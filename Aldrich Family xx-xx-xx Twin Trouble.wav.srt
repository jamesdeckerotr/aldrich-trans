 Come here, Evan.

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 The trouble of the semelordic consider is this doesn't think one fellow is still girls with sort of a club.

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 If you guys come down to my little house and you know what this is, how could you get another fellow to your little house?

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 Well, how about this?

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 Oh, you mentioned that guy, he's your best friend.

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 Oh, Homer.

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 That's it, what's he like?

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 Oh, uh, these are 12 kids.

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 You good, little kid?

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 I'm 12 kids.

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 They're all trouble with these people over to have a city with his family to visit his uncle Oscar.

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 Oh, that's extraordinary.

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 Well, what about your mother's born?

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 That's good, your mother's born.

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 Excuse me, a second, mother's. I think she's in the kitchen problem.

28
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 Thank you.

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 Father's, I'll tell you what. You were hanging out with the lucky phone around with some of the guys right now.

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 Oh, yes.

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 I thought these were down town.

32
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 I'm about to, but first, do you have enough clothes for me, again?

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 What?

34
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 You?

35
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 Oh, yes.

36
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 Now are you doing it? Gotcha. How's he? Oh, cool. What are you? Money. Have you got the mention of money and clothes? Tell me what's gotten in here. I don't think I'm going to come to town. I've been happy with the best client I've got. I just want to be honest. I'm going to have any. I should be screaming here for me. Why would I be there? I open myself up. That's why I don't have any. I don't want you to hold me down there.

37
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 I thought you were going to visit your uncle after.

38
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 That's why I was talking.

39
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 You like to save my life.

40
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 I better talk to my mother together.

41
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 No, I get to have to tell.

42
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 There you go.

43
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 Me bring an operator somebody in this town that's being offered.

44
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 Hey, where are you with?

45
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 Is that a moment?

46
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 That's a moment.

47
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 I thought you were going to visit your uncle after.

48
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 That's why I was talking.

49
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 You like to save my life.

50
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 So, can you tell her who's got something very urgent to do today?

51
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 You mean you don't want to go to your uncle or uncle?

52
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 Well, certainly my uncle. It's my cousin, Hipsabaw.

53
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 Every time I go over there, she makes a million wrestling.

54
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 I send half my time on the floor.

55
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 You're doing it, old pal.

56
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 Well, I'm hoping you're all wild. I'd be tickled to.

57
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 And as a matter of fact, we have got something very urgent to do.

58
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 We have a lot.

59
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 Well, how would you like to go on a well-daked protection now?

60
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 I guess I didn't have a chance to tell you about this. Well, girl, I met the other night. The name is Bubbles. Bubbles? What kind of a name is Rob? What's Roblin? Nothing. Your package is self-placed.

61
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 Well, it happens to bigger personality, exactly. Anyway, I've got to date with her for the second now. And I'm a little isolated.

62
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 Well, she has a sister thing.

63
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 Now wait a minute.

64
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 You hold on.

65
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 I'm going to just let her out with anybody's sister and that's all.

66
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 I'll tell her everybody is somebody's sister.

67
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 I'm not.

68
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 Wait a minute.

69
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 You like to see a picture of her?

70
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 Okay.

71
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 It was taken up a camp hocal as Johnny.

72
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 It's their whole camp.

73
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 Now look here.

74
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 Oh, you're so old.

75
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 Oh my, you're looking at the lifeguard.

77
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:18,200
 Look, look, look, look, will you hear

78
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,340
 right under the "oh" when Poco was shot?

79
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:22,680
 Uh huh.

80
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,520
 Good.

81
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,420
 Sometimes call it a sense of humor.

82
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,260
 What do you mean?

83
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:29,120
 Let's see right around and get him under the "ee" too.

84
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,360
 (laughing)

85
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,120
 No, no, that's your sister.

86
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,960
 No, it's the same girl.

87
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,200
 Oh, can I mention that?

88
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,520
 I'm answering her all.

89
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,840
 Well, hold you there, sister, or a twin.

90
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,160
 Oh.

91
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,240
 She's five lines.

92
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,080
 Yeah.

93
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:42,920
 What do you say?

94
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,680
 So let me ask you how to touch your gun.

95
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,840
 This is mine right here.

96
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,200
 It's cool.

97
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,880
 Have you got a night and a time ago?

98
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,720
 Oh boy.

99
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,640
 Come on, I called a chicken or coke.

100

 You'll love your little one, please.

104
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,640
 I'm home, but you just keep looking at that picture.

105
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,680
 Okay, but you'll say,

106
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,400
 "That's cool, make it a little bit of a film."

107
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,840
 Let's see him there.

108
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,160
 Yes, Bobbie.

109
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,880
 Better do you have your little arm.

110
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,680
 Sure, Bobbie, do you need some clag?

112
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:16,160
 I just want to be sure that you have no reason for trying to get in touch with me.

113
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,160
 What are your plans?

114
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:22,160
 Well, if I can get a moment, a listen to reason, we've got a date to go walking down town with a couple of girls.

115
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:28,160
 On a nice day like this, well, how are you? I'd have the girls, I'd be like, "Oh, they're not into the country."

116
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:33,160
 Well, definitely. And she holds a dollar for a couple of years, so that's expensive.

117
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:36,160
 Well, team, team, thanks, Father.

118
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,160
 This is a kind of reason in how my understand.

119
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,160
 Oh, and guess what I've got?

120
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:44,160
 Well, now I think you'll think things differently.

121
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,160
 You're trying to make me try and go?

122
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,160
 That would very nice of you.

123
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,160
 Uh-huh.

124
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,160
 Oh, well, I'd like to see the boy.

125
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,160
 You cannot be the owner.

126
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,160
 You know what I mean?

127
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,160
 Oh, of course.

128
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,160
 And if you buy the plug,

129
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,160
 then you can't bother me.

130
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,160

 Is this your bye time friend here?

133
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,560
 Well, I'll tell you a little bit.

134
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,640
 Why don't I go up by myself, Bertie?

135
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,280
 Sort of place the ground.

136
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,440
 What do you mean?

137
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,560
 Well, don't you think it's better if we

138
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,320
 stem the sister adjusted to the IBM?

139
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,880
 The IBM law of you?

 Oh, just wait a minute.

00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,080
 I think I should film my girls now, I think.

142
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:38,080
 You think you're high, well you're gonna put yourself together.

143
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,080
 Well, be with my dog!

144

 That one is trying to shoot.

147
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:48,080
 I mean, the first impression is that you don't mean a thing.

148
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,080
 You know what I'm asking for?

149
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,080
 We need about the most generous person I know.

150
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:55,080
 And, Angela, you said your sister was pretty desperate to make some noise.

151
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,080
 You're not so desperate.

152
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:01,080
 Well, you made out here while I was a little careful, Bubbles.

153
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:05,080
 You were not Bubbles? No, I'm too.

154
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:09,080
 But it's just me, the Bubbles, wait. I mean, I'm too. You got the help.

 Oh, my God, I'm going to do that.

176
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,080
 Oh, my God, I'm going to do that.

177
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,080
 Not yet.

178
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,080
 What do you think of them, Bobo?

179
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,080
 I'm always going to do this at that time.

180
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,080
 So you're going to do anything I want.

181
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,080
 Get straight to it.

182
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,080
 How about us getting your bites out now, Bobo?

183
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,080
 Okay, then you can add.

184
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,080
 So do what you want.

185
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,080
 What I'm going to do is you're going to go,

186
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,080
 I think I'll go and get over to you.

187
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,080
 You can do it too.

188
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,080
 You can do it too.

189
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,080
 Yes, in many ways.

190
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,080
 You look like my dumbest friend.

191
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,080
 In what way?

192
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,080
 What?

193
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,080
 You're going to have to do it at an imagination.

194
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,080
 Now just to say, if mommy is a little age,

195
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:26,080
 You know, you have no way to look at your ears.

196
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,080
 I thought you were going to throw the things out then

197
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:32,080
 so you have to make one little talk about your ears.

198
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,080
 I don't know if you have any rather amount of time.

199
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,080
 You will, and the next time you wear it,

200
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,080
 I'll be a little drama.

201
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,080
 You know what I'm saying?

202
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,080
 Well, alright.

203
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:46,080
 Oh, well, I'm good.

204
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:51,080
 Oh, sorry, you must say, "Hey, what happened?"

205
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,560
 I saw you in your lunchroom,

206
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,320
 and then in back of the garage,

207
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,820
 to hear me, "Well, we should get up,

208
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,320
 "and we're gonna call."

209
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,320
 Look at me driving!

210
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,440
 No, we just, it couldn't leave me, right?

211
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,760
 We found out.

212
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,960
 But if you have a job, we could lift the whole rear end up

213
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,720
 and get the wheelbar out from under the muffler.

214
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,440
 And a little more, we can lift it

215
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,080
 and get the garage door back there.

00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,740
 I'm doing a week ago

00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:56,740
 I'm not going home

 You know even when I'm not even lunch alone

355
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,240
 I don't play in school and that's not goodbye

 So if you've had any idea that you weren't friends,

 then we all get to try and tell them to tell them to double it.

463
00:18:54,240 --> 00:19:02,240
 Yeah. Oh, 105. And of course I don't need to say it. You didn't get a bit of milk or that lot.

 No, I mean, someone wants to go on.

00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:55,140
 You know, I'd like to begin by telling you a little story.

529
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:56,140
 Do you ever have to have that?

 I'd better just skip that part.

 Do you ever have to have that?

536
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:12,140
 I'm going to break my head to the boat.

537
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:16,140
 I'm going to need all the men to lay our hands on.

 you're going to go, come back with all the lights,

 oh he's gonna get home now, come on,

 here and head them all down below.

555
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,720
 Slow your car, of course now, walk across,

 while I'm looking at the slides,

557
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,520
 we can make it across the nose rocks,

00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,520
 Come on, easy, huh?

559
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,020
 It's good, well, it takes good time.

560
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:12,520
 I don't know if I can find some actual

561
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,520
 potential you can just follow me.

562
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,520
 Okay, see? It's easy.

 Good evening, Tom.

 You let me have a hug.

578
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,520
 Thank you, Alice.

579
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,520
 Thanks you very much.

580
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,520
 On the straight-on, maybe a little late is good now.

581
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,520
 Well, don't bother with dinner, Alice.

582
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,520
 You're going out for you.

583
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,520
 So far.

584
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,520
 I'm not your boyfriend.

585
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:05,520
 The power of the concert had time and I was thinking about willing to deliver the bond.

586
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,520
 Oh, that's wonderful.

587
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,520
 It was a delightful scene.

588
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,520
 As an average life, I never got the message.

589
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,520
 What?

590
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:13,520
 Well, it's time to have to go out on the dance call.

591
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,520
 It is a lesson.

592
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,520
 Hello.

593
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:19,520
 I never did buy the presents, but while I went out there, it came across a couple of boys.

594
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,520
 He was climbing around the village pond.

595
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:25,520
 And that's the best interest they could have had of what I think is what it is.

596
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,520
 No, I couldn't.

597
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,520
 The house gets ready to go out.

598
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:31,320
 Only thing is, I don't think Henry's in the mood to celebrate.

599
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,520
 I'll worry, he will be.

600
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,320
 He will?

601
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,320
 I think so.

602
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,120
 We're going out on the contrary.

603
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,240
 I think it happens to have two of the prettiest,

604
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,920
