00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 [Music]

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
 And now the Jell-O family presents...

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
 Henry Henry Oldridge!

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.000
 Coming, mother!

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 [Applause]

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
 Yes, it's the Oldridge family based on characters

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
 by Clifford Goldsmith and starring Ezra Stone as Henry

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 with Jackie Count as Homer.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 And yes, it's the Jell-O family,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 with its three famous desserts.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 Jell-O in those six delicious flavors,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 Jell-O puddings without old fashioned,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
 homemade flavor, and Jell-O tapioca puddings,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
 a miracle of goodness, a marvel of spirit.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.920
 (

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:03.720
 No! They are made by famous J-E-L-L-O!

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.720
 And now for the Aldrich family.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:22.120
 A typical teenage boy like Henry Aldrich is as unpredictable as the weather.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.320
 And like the weather, he can change in a moment from storm to calm.

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.780
 And usually a whole household changes with him.

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.320
 The scene opens in the Aldrich living room.

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.520
 It is early Saturday evening.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.720
 Sam, would you like me to put another log on the fire?

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.020
 No, thank you, Alice.

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.320
 I wouldn't mind a bit, dear.

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.220
 I know you like to be warm when you're reading.

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.920
 Alice is only one thing I really like when I'm reading.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.020
 What, dear?

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.420
 Not to be talked to.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.520
 Well, you won't have to worry about Henry bothering you tonight.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.020
 He'll be out of the house the whole evening.

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.020
 And frankly, I don't know why one of us didn't think of it years ago.

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.320
 Putting him out of the house?

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.820
 No, dear, arranging for the children to have a party at a different home each week.

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:04.520
 Mm.

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.420
 It'll be so much easier sitting in the kitchen one night every two months

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.620
 when we know that the rest of the time we can read in the living room in peace and quiet.

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:13.520
 We can?

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.620
 Of course, dear. Just as you are now.

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.020
 Yes.

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.320
 Elizabeth said she thought the idea was a stroke of genius.

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.780
 But I wouldn't go so far as to say that.

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.280
 Would you, Sam?

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.380
 Alice, I think your idea is wonderful.

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:29.580
 It's brilliant.

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.820
 It gives me an opportunity to read this book.

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.620
 Now, suppose I read it.

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.620
 You can't read it if you keep on talking all the time.

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.120
 Mother!

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.420
 Yes, Henry?

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.520
 And you've been making any rag-rubs recently?

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:44.620
 Any what?

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.620
 Rag-rubs! Rag-rubs!

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.820
 I can't find my maroon socks!

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.020
 Henry!

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.420
 Your socks are in your top drawer.

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.420
 I'm sorry mother they are and I've turned my drawers inside out.

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:57.620
 [LAUGHTER]

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.820
 Do you know that strange because I distinctly remember putting them away.

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.420
 Alice, why don't you go upstairs and help him look?

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.820
 Well while I'm doing that, will you please answer the phone?

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.020
 Now wait a minute, Henry's perfectly capable of finding his own socks.

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.620
 But dear...

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:11.620
 You answer the phone.

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:12.620
 Mother!

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.620
 Alice, Henry's calling you...

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:15.620
 What is it, Henry?

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.420
 The phone's raining!

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.220
 Yes, dear, I know.

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:20.980
 (phone ringing)

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:21.820
 - Hello?

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:23.980
 - Hello, is that you Mrs. Oldrich?

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.540
 - Yes, how are you, Homer?

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.520
 - Okay, I guess, except for my arms.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:29.520
 - Your arms?

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:30.860
 - They're just sort of aching,

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.620
 from carrying a couple of armchairs out to the kitchen

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.340
 from my parents.

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.140
 But don't worry, they'll be in shape

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.300
 by the time Agnes gets here.

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:40.140
 - Your parents?

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.600
 - No, my arms.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:42.740
 (audience laughing)

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:44.740
 Could I speak to Henry, please?

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:46.380
 - Dear Henry's in his bare feet,

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.860
 but he'll see you at your party in a little while.

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:50.140
 in his bare feet.

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.980
 - Father!

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.140
 - Good-bye, home-iron.

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.980
 - I know, but--

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.140
 - Father!

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:55.240
 - Oh, Sam!

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.140
 - Yes?

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:57.700
 - Henry's calling you.

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.140
 - Henry, your mother told you where your socks were.

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:01.980
 - I found my socks, Father.

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.340
 I had them on!

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:04.700
 (audience laughing)

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.980
 - How do you think we should have his eyes examined?

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:08.700
 - Dear, the only trouble with Henry

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.260
 is his body works faster than his mind.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.500
 - Father, what I can't find now is your tight clip.

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:15.620
 - Now, say here!

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:17.340
 - Sam, I'll go look for it.

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:18.740
 You just go back to your book.

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:22.100
 Perhaps I should wait until Henry's mind catches up with the rest of it.

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.600
 Oh my goodness.

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:25.340
 Hello?

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.540
 Mrs. Aldrich, we were cut off.

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.060
 Homer, what is it you want?

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:30.500
 I have to speak to Henry.

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:31.780
 It's very urgent.

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:32.780
 Just a minute.

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:33.660
 Henry?

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:34.620
 Yes, mother.

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.380
 Homer, watch you on the phone.

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:37.580
 I can't come now.

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.180
 I'm taking a bath.

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.780
 There, I thought you were all dressed except your feet.

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:45.420
 I was, but I just got shoe polish on me.

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:46.260
 Hello, Homer?

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.020
 - Is he coming Mrs. Aldrich? - No, he can't right now.

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:50.660
 Suppose you give me the message.

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:54.060
 Listen, Mrs. Aldrich, I've got some bad news.

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.460
 Our radio's just going on in the bum.

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.460
 - Really? - And we won't have anything to dance to.

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.660
 - Oh, well, couldn't you play the piano?

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.260
 - How could you dance to Home Sweet Home?

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:08.060
 - Here, haven't you been studying for years and years?

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.260
 - Only five, Mrs. Aldrich.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.660
 - And all you can play is Home Sweet Home?

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:16.060
 - Sure. She was on no child prodigy.

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:19.660
 Oh, I wish I could suggest something, but...

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:25.460
 Well, as a matter of fact, how is your radio working, Mrs. Aldrich?

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:29.460
 Our radio? Oh, I'm afraid Mr. Aldrich wouldn't let that out of the house.

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:35.060
 Well, Mrs. Aldrich, did you ever hear that saying about the mountain and no hamlet?

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:36.060
 What's that?

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:41.060
 If your radio can't come to us, I'm sure the game wouldn't mind going to your radio.

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:44.460
 Now, just a minute, Homer. I'm afraid that's out of the question.

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:45.260
 It is.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.940
 And besides, it's your parents' turn to look after the party tonight.

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:51.300
 But neither of them plays the piano.

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.180
 Well, dear would this help you?

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:57.420
 There's a neighbor of ours who has a portable phonograph and a complete collection of records.

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:59.300
 Oh, boy!

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:01.100
 I'll send Henry over to borrow the piece.

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:01.940
 You will, Mother.

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:03.660
 Okay, but will you tell him to hurry?

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:04.940
 Half the kids are here.

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:05.660
 Yes, Homer.

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:09.580
 And if we don't get something to dance to, I'll never get Willie out of the punch bowl.

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:11.340
 All right, Homer, goodbye.

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:14.940
 Come, Mother, you mean I have to start running errands at a time like this?

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:18.280
 Just over to Miss Spencer's to pick up her phonograph and records.

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:19.980
 Homer needs something to dance to.

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:22.860
 Boy, I always have to wait on him, hand and foot.

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:24.940
 Dear, you're not doing this for Homer.

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:27.540
 You're doing it for your father and me.

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:29.420
 And I thought you were taking a bath.

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:30.980
 I decided I didn't have time.

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:32.540
 I'd only keep Diane waiting.

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:34.020
 Now, here's your overcoat.

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:35.020
 Thanks, mother.

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:36.660
 And you don't forget to put your gloves on.

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:37.260
 OK.

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:38.620
 And have a good time.

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:39.340
 Thanks, mother.

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:41.300
 You and father have a good time, too.

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:42.060
 We will.

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:42.820
 Goodbye.

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:44.540
 Goodbye.

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:46.340
 Was that Henry leaving Alice?

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:47.740
 Yes, Sam.

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:49.780
 Well, thank goodness.

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:50.780
 [PHONE RINGING]

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:52.620
 Oh, dear.

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:53.380
 Hello?

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:55.060
 Hello, is that Mrs. Aldridge?

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:55.660
 Yes.

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:58.060
 Well, well, I'm very sorry to bother you,

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:00.420
 but this is Diane.

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:01.180
 Diane?

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:02.700
 Yes, Diane Conway.

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:05.420
 I'm going to a party tonight with your son Henry.

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:06.660
 Oh, of course.

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:08.860
 And he's certainly looking forward to it.

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:09.980
 Oh, so am I.

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:11.620
 And so are we.

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:12.660
 That is--

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:18.160
 But do you happen to know whether Henry is picking me up at home or at dehaven's drugstore?

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:21.160
 - Well, didn't he tell you? - Yes, he did, I think.

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:25.660
 But you'll know how when Henry tells you something one minute, it's perfectly clear.

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:28.160
 And the next minute, you know what I mean?

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:34.960
 Well, dear, I'm not sure, but he just left and I was under the impression he was going to pick you up at your house.

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:37.160
 Oh, my goodness, he can't do that!

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:40.760
 - Where are you now, Diane? - I'm waiting down here at the drugstore!

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:43.560
 Well then suppose you go back home and wait for me.

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:46.260
 By the time I go all the way home I'll miss him.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:46.760
 Well...

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:49.560
 I can't stay here, everybody's staring at me.

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:51.760
 Now dear, just calm down.

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:54.760
 I know what we can do, you wait right where you are.

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:55.760
 But Mrs. Old...

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:58.060
 It'll only be for five minutes, goodbye.

00:07:58.060 --> 00:07:59.060
 Sam!

00:07:59.060 --> 00:07:59.760
 Yes, I will.

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:01.260
 Will you please come here a minute?

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:02.660
 What's the trouble now?

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:03.760
 Here's your coat, Nia.

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:04.960
 My coat, I'm not going anyplace.

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:05.960
 Sam, don't argue.

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:09.560
 You'll have to go down to the Havens drugstore before that child goes to pieces.

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:10.260
 What child?

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:14.060
 for the sake of our whole evening, Samuel, have to pick her up.

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:15.660
 Pick her up and what?

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:18.060
 Dear, we'll cross that bridge when we come to it.

 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:30.260
 Hello.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:31.060
 Hello, Homer.

00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:31.860
 This is me.

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:33.460
 Henry, where have you been?

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:35.060
 I've been slightly delayed, Homer,

00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:36.660
 but I'll be right over to your place.

00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:38.660
 But Henry, I thought you weren't coming,

00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:40.960
 and I talked to everybody out of dancing.

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:43.520
 - But Homer, so what do you say we go someplace?

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:46.200
 - I'm going to all the trouble of getting your phonograph

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:47.040
 and records.

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:48.560
 - What records have you got?

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:50.440
 - Well, I'll tell you.

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:54.040
 Listen, Homer, how would the gang feel about Schubert's eighth?

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:56.080
 - Who's eight?

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:57.880
 - Schubert, Schubert.

00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:00.240
 - Yeah, his eighth why?

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:01.080
 (audience laughing)

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:04.360
 - Symphony, Homer, have you ever heard of the unfinished symphony?

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:07.320
 - Listen, Henry, why would we wanna listen to that?

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:10.620
 I know, but even Schubert wasn't interested enough to finish it.

00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:11.620
 [laughter]

00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:15.120
 But Homer, that's the only kind of record Ms. Spencer had.

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:17.820
 Well, it's a good thing we're not dancing.

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:20.520
 Look, why don't we all go over to your place?

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:21.320
 My place?

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:25.020
 I mentioned it to your mother before, but I don't think she took the hint.

00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:28.320
 Now listen, if you're planning to go over to my house, you're crazy.

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:30.720
 What do you mean by a statement like that?

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:35.820
 Homer, my folks are going to have one peaceful evening at home if it's the last thing I do.

 Hello Alice!

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:45.820
 Sam, where are you?

00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:47.820
 Down at the Havens drugstore and Alice.

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:49.820
 What does Diane look like?

00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:54.820
 I'm not sure, dear, but I believe Henry mentioned something about blue eyes.

00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:56.820
 What kind of a description is that?

00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:57.820
 What's she wearing?

00:09:57.820 --> 00:09:59.820
 Sam, I had an any idea.

00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:00.820
 Although...

00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:01.820
 Yes?

00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:02.820
 It's pretty cold.

00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:04.820
 She's probably wearing a fur coat.

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:05.660
 - You think so?

00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:09.140
 - If she has one, although frankly I doubt it.

00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:10.460
 - Alice, I'm coming home.

00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:11.700
 - There you can't do that.

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:12.900
 Diane's waiting for you.

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:14.180
 - She isn't waiting here.

00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:16.220
 - Then you better run over to Hilliard's drugstore

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:17.500
 and take a look around there.

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:19.140
 - That's all the way across town.

00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:21.980
 - Sam, we can't leave a single stone unturned.

00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:24.740
 (dramatic music)

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:32.860
 Alice, how nice of you to fall.

00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:36.220
 - Hey, Elizabeth, do you happen to know what Diane looks like?

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:37.060
 - Diane?

00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:38.620
 - Yes, Henry's girl.

00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:40.940
 Sam's down at Hilliard's drugstore looking for her,

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:43.780
 and we haven't the fadest idea what she looks like.

00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:45.180
 - Oh, Diane.

00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:46.340
 Well, as a matter of fact,

00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:48.340
 Homer was talking about her, it's separate and I've--

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:50.260
 - Really? What did he say about her?

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.020
 - He said she was a dish.

00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:52.860
 - A dish?

00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:55.260
 - Yes, dear. You know, a lulu.

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:56.980
 - Well, that's some help.

00:10:56.980 --> 00:11:00.340
 Homer didn't mention exactly where Henry was to meet her, did he?

00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:02.580
 - Well, Homer claims that all Henry talked about

00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:04.380
 was somebody named Schubert.

00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:05.180
 Schubert?

00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:07.020
 Yes, and the number was eight.

00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:07.900
 Oh, and Alice.

00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:08.620
 Yes?

00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:10.620
 Well, since Sam is down at the drug store

00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:12.700
 and he has to go by here on his way home,

00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:15.220
 do you think he'd mind picking up a quart of ice cream?

00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:16.140
 I guess not.

00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:18.180
 And the cube of toothpaste while he's at it?

00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:19.300
 All right, Elizabeth.

00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:21.660
 And Alice, I still think this idea of yours

00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:23.100
 is a stroke of genius.

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:24.260
 You mean about the party?

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:25.060
 Yes.

 Will and I can bear up tonight as long as we know that next week

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.140

 You see that fella standing over there by the soda fountain?

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:47.540
 The one with his hat pulled down over his eyes?

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:48.540
 Yeah.

00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:49.820
 Keep an eye on him.

00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:50.160
 Why?

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:51.100
 What's he doing?

00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:52.620
 Well, every girl that comes in here,

00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:55.060
 he steps up to her, seeing stairs at her.

00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:55.660
 Yeah?

00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:57.020
 What are you supposed he's up to?

00:11:57.020 --> 00:11:57.780
 Wait a minute.

00:11:57.780 --> 00:11:58.860
 I'll handle him.

 What, sir? May I help you?

 Why, uh, uh, uh, uh, as a matter of fact, yes, I might want to buy something.

00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:14.620
 Fine. Are you interested in reading?

00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:18.860
 I was earlier this evening. Well, then, how about a good book?

00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:23.060
 A book? Uh, alright. We have a complete collection of pocketbooks

00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:28.420
 right here. Uh, yes. You just look over the titles and let me know which one you'd like.

 Diana, are you sure this is where that friend of your mother's lives?

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:49.420
 Of course, Henry, and she has positively every kind of record.

00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:50.420
 She has, Diana.

00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:51.420
 All popular?

00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:52.920
 I'm sure of it, Henry.

00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:57.420
 Oh boy, Diana, it's a lucky thing I saw you waiting there in to Haven's drugstore.

00:12:57.420 --> 00:13:02.620
 The only thing is yes well either your friends out or she sleeps awfully hard

00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:09.620
 Let's try the doorbell again. I've got a better idea. What are you picking up Henry some gravel stand back Diane?

00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:13.060
 My goodness. Are you gonna throw it at the window just gently?

00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:18.300
 Do you hear anything

00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:23.160
 No, gee whiz Henry I think we better give up and get to the party give up

00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:26.820
 Well, if I don't get some dance records, do you know what Homer's going to do?

00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:27.320
 What?

00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:30.100
 Land right on top of my parents with all four feet.

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:30.840

 Alice, I'm calling to tell you this whole thing is utterly ridiculous.

00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:13.020
 Now Sam Diane's waiting for someone to meet her in a drugstore, and I promise you-

00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:17.020
 But Alice is getting embarrassing, looking in the girl's eyes to see what color they are.

00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:18.020
 But beer!

00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:20.020

 - And he'll just threaten to call the police.

00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:25.820
 And it marshals, they came right out and called me a masher.

00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:28.020
 - You mean you've been to every drug store in town?

00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:29.020
 - I have.

00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:32.420
 - But here is there a Schubert's drug store on 8th Street.

00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:33.420
 - What's that?

00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:37.020
 - According to Homer, Henry talked about Schubert's at 8th.

00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:38.420
 - Alice, there's no such place.

00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:39.620
 - There you'd better have a look.

00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:40.620
 - Now wait.

00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:43.420
 - And while you're there, Mrs. Brown would like a quarter of ice cream.

00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:44.420
 - Now wait.

00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:45.420
 - And a tube of toothpaste.

00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:48.620
 And you better get a dozen lemon salmon case they run out of punch.

00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:50.220

 Well, hardly ever.

 No sir.

 Mr. and Mrs. Aldrich are trying to get Henry off to a party.

00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:53.700
 But the more they try, the further they get from their goal.

00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:56.700
 The scene opens in Springer's hardware store.

00:16:56.700 --> 00:16:58.900
 It is a little later the same evening.

00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:01.600
 It is, operator. The line's still busy.

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:03.400
 Yes, sir. I'm sorry.

00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:05.900
 Well, look, could you cut in on the conversation?

00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:07.700
 No, sir. I'm sorry.

00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:10.780
 But look, operator, it's only my mother speaking, see?

00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:12.260
 And now her son.

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:13.660
 I beg your pardon.

00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:15.300
 Her only son, see?

00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:17.660
 And I know she'd want to talk to me.

00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:20.500
 And we pay our bill regularly every month.

00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:21.940
 I beg your pardon.

00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:24.140
 If you're so good, and you please cut in.

00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:26.660
 I'll try your number again and call you back.

00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:28.020
 I know, but--

00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:29.540
 Hello?

00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:30.660
 Oh, boy.

00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:32.980
 Henry, you want me to wrap these for you?

00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:34.580
 The only thing is Mr. Springer,

00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:36.420
 I should speak to my mother first.

00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:40.500
 Now look, when you got me out of bed to come down here and open my hardware store,

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:42.580
 you didn't say you were dragging your mother into it.

00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:47.820
 I'm not Mr. Springer, G. I wouldn't think of dragging her out of the house when she's spending a nice restful evening.

00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:49.820
 Oh boy, excuse me.

00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:51.820
 Hello, operator!

00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:53.220
 Henry, is that you?

00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:55.020
 She was, mother!

00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:56.300
 Yes, where are you?

00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:57.860
 Dana Springer's hardware.

00:17:57.860 --> 00:18:00.820
 And look, could I charge a small item or two to father?

00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:01.220
 A bit dear.

00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:03.220
 Just a window pane and some putty.

00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:05.220
 Henry, what for?

00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:09.500
 You mean you want to go into all the boring uninteresting details now?

00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:10.600
 Yes, dear.

00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:13.720
 But I'm right here in the store with Mr. Springer in a night shirt.

00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:15.180
 Henry, you're wearing what?

00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:18.060
 No, it's Mr. Springer's, and he's shivering.

00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:19.900
 So won't you please say yes?

00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:20.400
 Well...

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:22.520
 Gee, thanks, mother. You can wrap them up, Mr. Springer.

00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:23.820
 And another thing, mother.

00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:24.720
 Yes, dear.

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:28.460
 Well, I got sort of separated from Diane, see?

00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:29.660
 You mean you found her?

00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:31.740
 It's your mother. Only I lost her again.

00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:33.960
 When the window broke, we both had to run.

00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:37.720
 So, would you mind phoning your folks for me and see if she went home?

00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:38.460
 My cook.

00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:42.460
 And then would you please phone Homer and tell him I'm practically on my way to the party.

00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:42.960
 But him?

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:49.460
 All I have to do now is repair a little something and find I am and round up some records and then I'm all set.

00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:58.560
 Hello? Hello, Alice?

00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:00.060
 Sam, where are you now?

00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:02.560
 I'm phoning from Schubert's delicatessen.

00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:03.560
 Where?

00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:05.560
 It's a show but it's delicatessen.

00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:08.060
 It's on the south side of town.

00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:09.560
 What are you doing there?

00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:11.560
 What am I doing? I'm looking for Diane.

00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:12.560
 But Sam!

00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:14.060
 And this ice cream is beginning to melt.

00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:15.060
 Oh, Mr....

00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:16.060
 Oh, just a minute, Alice.

00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:18.560
 Mr. did I hear you say you were looking for Diane?

00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:20.060
 Well, yes. I'll tell you're here.

00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:21.060
 You mean she's...

00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:22.060
 You mean she's...

00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:23.060
 Hello, Alice.

00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:24.060
 Yes, Sam.

00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:25.060
 Alice, I found Diane.

00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:28.060
 Well, thank goodness Henry will be so happy.

00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:31.060
 Just take her and the ice cream and the lemons and the toothpaste

00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:32.060
 straight over to the party at home.

00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:33.060
 Very well.

00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:36.640
 And Sam, I just phoned Diane's parents and they're terribly upset.

00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:37.140
 What about?

00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:39.240
 But I thought she was lost.

00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:43.860
 So would you please stop by a drug store again and buy some spirits of ammonia for Diane's mother?

00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:45.240
 Diane's mother.

00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:47.280
 Yes, dear. She's been having his sterics.

00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:48.080
 Good heaven.

00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:50.000
 And hurry, Sam. Good bye.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.280
 Diane will be right with you, Mr. as soon as she's through waiting on that table.

00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:55.140
 But, Sam?

00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:57.080
 Now, hold on. There must be a mistake.

00:19:57.080 --> 00:19:59.120
 While you're waiting, what kind of meat do you like?

00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:02.360
 Meat? Sure, Diane's boyfriend's always by something.

00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:04.880
 I am not one of Diane's boyfriend.

00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:07.400
 Sure, Mr. Shore. Now what kind of meat do you like?

00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:19.600
 How many have you seen Henry?

00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:21.200
 Henry, Henry who?

00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:23.520
 Henry, old, rich, your friend.

00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:25.600
 He's no friend of mine, Diane.

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:28.280
 From tonight on, I haven't even heard of.

00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:30.160
 But where do you suppose he is?

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:34.360
 When I learnt you'd moved your party down here to the Haven's, I thought surely you'd be here.

00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:38.460
 Nevermind Henry Diane, let's dance before the jukebox wins out.

00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:39.760
 Oh, I'd love to!

00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:45.960
 She are a swelled answer.

00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:47.760
 I give anything so hungry.

00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:50.160
 You're supposed to make a dance a little faster.

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:50.760
 Faster!

00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:51.560
 Sure.

00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:56.160
 'Cause as soon as this number runs out, boy, that was my last nickel.

00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:58.360
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, my goodness!

00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:01.520
 Once I get started dancing, I just can't stop.

00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:03.520
 I want to go on and on.

00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:04.520
 You do?

00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:05.520
 Yes.

00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:08.520
 Isn't there some place that you go where there's a photograph and some records?

00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:13.560
 Look Diane, let's just put our heads together and we'll think of something.

00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:22.920
 Henry, what is it you're trying to say?

00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:23.920
 Isn't it clear, Mother?

00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:28.480
 I'm in a music shop on the edge of town, see, and I finally got some records.

00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:29.920
 You mean you bought them?

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:33.040
 No, I got them on the cuff, on account of my face.

00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:34.080
 Your face?

00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:34.720
 Sure.

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:37.840
 The man said one thing about it, it's honest.

00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:40.960
 Well, dear, that's fine, then you're all fixed up.

00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:41.840
 I am?

00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:44.560
 What didn't I tell you? Your father found I am.

00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:48.640
 Sure, but, well, frankly, mother, there's a slight new development.

00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:50.160
 Henry, it's nothing serious.

00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:52.000
 Serious? Oh, no.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:53.200
 What is it?

00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:55.460
 Well, brace yourself.

00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:57.460
 Henry, what's happened?

00:21:57.460 --> 00:22:02.200
 I just discovered I sort of lost Mespenser's phonograph.

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:03.300
 You lost it?

00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:04.900
 Well, not exactly.

00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:07.900
 That is, I have something else instead.

00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:09.000
 What?

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:10.300
 A typewriter?

00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:11.800
 Oh, my heavens.

00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:14.200
 The case looks exactly the same, mother,

00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:16.200
 so you can't blame the fellow tumor.

00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:17.000
 What fellow?

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.700
 On the streetcar, the fellow picked up my phonograph

00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:21.100
 and left me this typewriter.

00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:21.900
 Oh, my goodness.

00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:22.900
 Henry, hang up.

00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:23.900
 Hang up!

00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:26.900
 I think I can catch your father at Diane's house.

00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:36.900
 Oh, uh, excuse me, sir.

00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:39.900
 Okay, mister, don't do it again.

00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:40.900
 Don't do what?

00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:42.900
 Drifting milk in the dirt.

00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:44.900
 It isn't milk, it's ice cream.

00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:50.900
 I got enough to do sweeping out these street cars without people traipsing through and dripping milk.

00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:54.900
 Well, look, suppose I just sit down here where I'll be out of your way.

00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:56.900
 Can't sit there. Why not?

00:22:56.900 --> 00:22:57.900
 That's the Mortemann seat.

00:22:57.900 --> 00:22:59.900
 I don't intend starting your street car.

00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:02.900
 Just the same, you can't sit there. Company rules.

00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:05.900
 All right, all right. May I just ask you a simple question?

00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:09.900
 Last time a layman said on the Mortemann seat there was trouble.

00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:13.900
 Well, look, you have a lost and found apartment down here at the car barns, haven't you?

00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:14.900
 Wasn't the lost and found?

00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:15.900
 What wasn't?

00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:19.900
 Well, I'll run the thing right off the tracks and smack in the cafeteria.

00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:23.600
 Look, I'm not interested in your cafeteria.

00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:25.400
 It's closed anyway.

00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:30.400
 May I just ask one simple question.

00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:32.400
 I don't see why not.

00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:36.400
 Well now look, a little while ago my son was riding on a streetcar.

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:37.400
 This streetcar?

00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:40.900
 I don't know what streetcar. It doesn't matter what streetcar. The point is...

00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:42.400
 Mr. E- uh, yes.

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:44.400
 You're dripping in my dirty gimme.

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:47.400
 I'm very sorry.

00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:52.560
 The point is he had a phonograph on the street car course on the streetcar and

00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:55.640
 play music on the streetcar

00:23:55.640 --> 00:24:00.040
 he wasn't playing it he was carrying it that is he set it down and when he picked

00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:07.080
 it up he had a typewriter is that so yes sounds like a good trick

00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:11.720
 oh it was very simple someone else took his phonograph I know a few good tricks

00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:13.520
 Michelle, take a number.

00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:14.320
 What?

00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:15.160
 Any number.

00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:16.120
 Go on.

00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:16.640
 Now, wait.

00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:19.120
 All I want to know is this was a phonograph turned in here

00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:20.040
 this evening.

00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:20.720
 A phonograph?

00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:22.920
 Yes, belonging to my son.

00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:26.400
 Oh, you're trying to find your son's phonograph.

00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:26.960
 Yes.

00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:29.400
 Why didn't you say so?

00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:30.560
 There was one turned in?

00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:31.840
 Oh, say look at that time.

00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:32.440
 Was there?

00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:34.000
 Sorry, Mr. Time for me to go home.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:34.440
 What?

00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:36.120
 You tell your story to the nightmare.

00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:37.120
 Now, wait a minute.

00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:40.120
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:53.120

00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:56.120
 Can I move the footstool over for you, Sam?

00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:58.120
 I'll bring you your slippers.

00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:00.120
 This is only one thing you can bring me.

00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:02.120
 Yes, dear, what is it?

00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:03.120
 A large spoon.

00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:04.120
 A spoon?

00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:07.120
 Yes, I'm going to eat this ice cream.

00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:09.120
 Dear, you mean you didn't take it over to the brown?

00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:12.120
 Under the circumstances I did not go near the Browns.

00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:14.120
 But dear, what about Elizabeth's toothpaste?

00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:17.520
 All my life I've wanted to eat a whole quarter of ice cream,

00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:22.120
 and now I'm going to sit here quietly by the fire with my book and enjoy myself.

00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:26.120
 Of course, dear. Wouldn't you like me to bring you a straw?

00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:27.120
 Never mind.

00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:30.120
 I'll just drink it.

00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:33.120
 Oh, here, you can take this out to the kitchen.

00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:34.120
 What is it?

00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:35.120
 Salami.

00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:36.120
 Salami?

00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:39.720
 Friends, boyfriends always buy something.

00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:41.320
 My goodness.

00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:44.620
 Alice, what's the racket upstairs?

00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:46.120
 It's Henry, dear.

00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:47.520
 Henry, isn't he at the party?

00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:49.120
 He can't find the party.

00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:51.120
 They all left Homer's house for the havens

00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:53.620
 and where they went from there nobody knows.

00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:55.720
 So Henry's up in his room typing.

00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:56.520
 Typing?

00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:59.520
 He's decided to give up society and write a book.

00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:01.720
 He has my whole hearted cooperation.

00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:05.120
 But, dear, what are we going to do about the lost phonograph?

00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:07.320
 Henry can pay for it when he sells his book.

00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:08.320
 Now, Sam...

00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:10.920
 Alice will worry about that tomorrow.

00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:14.920
 Right now, all I want to do is to sit back and put my feet up and relax.

00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:16.920
 You go right ahead, dear.

00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:26.920
 Alice, don't move.

00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:28.520
 Sam, there's someone at the door.

00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:31.120
 I know there is, but don't move.

00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:33.120
 This is our quiet night at home.

00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:35.120
 Hello!

00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:37.120
 Anybody home?

00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:39.120
 Hello!

00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:41.120
 Alice, who's there?

00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:43.120
 I haven't the slightest idea.

00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:45.120
 Hello, Alice!

00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:47.120
 Hello, Alice!

00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:49.120
 This is Mr. and Mrs. Conway, Diane's parents.

00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:51.120
 So glad to meet you.

00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:53.120
 Nice to meet you, all.

00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:57.120
 Oh, Mrs. Aldridge, I can't begin to thank you for all you've done for Diane.

00:26:57.120 --> 00:27:00.120
 I don't mind telling you, we were pretty worried about her for a while.

00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:02.860
 Oh, have you such a lovely party over at our house?

00:27:02.860 --> 00:27:04.620
 We felt we should drop by and say thank you.

00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:05.700
 - Well, you're quite welcome.

00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:07.460
 And since we've never met you before,

00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:09.260
 Mrs. Aldrich Cora thought it'd be nice

00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:10.740
 if we really got a queen to do.

00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:12.380
 - Talked with that chair over a little closer.

00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:14.140
 - We thought the four of us could sort of

00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:16.260
 have our own little party.

00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:17.100
 - Well.

00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:19.340
 - Yes, well.

00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:22.940
 - Well, isn't that grand?

00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:25.520
 (upbeat music)

00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:39.520
 [applause]

00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:43.520
 Hey, it is your family and with their stockings on Christmas Eve.

00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:46.520
 She was Homer. Who'd want to do a childish thing like that?

00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:50.520
 Okay, Henry, okay. But I'd just like to point out one thing.

00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:51.520
 What, Homer?

00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:56.520
 It may be childish, but think of all the extra surprise presents you get.

00:27:56.520 --> 00:28:00.520
 Right, and say here's a surprise package for your holiday meals.

00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:04.520
 The new Jell-O Rice Pudding, newest member of the famous Jell-O family.

00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:06.520
 There was never anything quite like it before.

00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:09.520
 Jell-O Pudding, the 10-minute marble.

00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:12.520
 All you do is add milk and boil gently for 10 minutes.

00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:17.520
 No fussy mixing, no bothersome custard to make, no cooking for hours on end.

00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:21.980
 And you get rice pudding so delicious even expert cooks are amazed.

00:28:21.980 --> 00:28:26.620
 Super rich, gloriously creamy with real honest-to-goodness homemade flavor.

00:28:26.620 --> 00:28:30.120
 You can have it plain or fancy, thicker, thin however you like it best.

00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:34.820
 And once you've tried jello rice pudding, you will never make rice pudding any other way.

00:28:34.820 --> 00:28:36.620
 So buy it, try it.

00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:40.420
 The 10-minute marble, the new jello rice pudding.

00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:46.820

 Here's hoping you'll be in your living room in ours next week at the same time. Good night folks.

 The Oldridge family starring Ezra Stone is Henry with Jackie Kalka's Homer,

00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:03.140
 is written by Patricia Jaudrey and Del Dinsdale with music by Jack Miller.

00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:06.900
 Mr. and Mrs. Oldridge are House Jamison and Catherine Roth.

00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:10.340
 And this is Dan Seymour in New York saying,

00:29:10.340 --> 00:29:14.260
 "The Oldridge family is brought to you by the Jello family."

00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:19.560
 For desserts that are delicious,

00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:23.120
 I believe me, you should know

00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:28.840
 They are me, my famous, J-E-L-L-O
