WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
 It's the Irish family.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 The Irish family presented by the Jell-O family.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
 J.T. F.L.L.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
 Oh, mad at, oh mad at Will's back!

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
 Well, my dear little talking people.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
 Hey, hey, hey, why the big swoon there?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 We're the Henry Irish Band Club.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.000
 Oh, I see.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
 Can we send him a present there to Ken Ken Ken?

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
 Well, that'd be nice.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.240
 have in mind how about a big shaggy dog the kind of jumps all over you and goes

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:41.500
 go after black oh Henry wouldn't want any aluminum goes no Henry wouldn't work

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:50.520
 with the go Henry I don't know Henry I don't know if I just forget the dog why

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.360
 don't you send Henry a present that the whole family will enjoy of course why

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.360
 I didn't waste any of that!

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.360
 Jello, the world's most famous shimmering dessert with the six delicious flavors.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.360
 Or any of the three flavors of Jello Tapioca Pudding.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.360
 Whoa!

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.360
 That's the pudding with the personality.

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.360
 And, Dipples!

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.360
 And there's no treat in the world like those smoothest cream Jello Pudding.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.360
 Ahhh!

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.360
 Henry and everybody else will swoon when they taste Jello Pudding's three delicious flavors.

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:51.360
 Can't you just taste that luscious light? And the chocolatey good? And the buttery brown, bonny, bonny. Scotch. Edge yellow pudding. And they're smooth as cream. But you all like them? No, not much. Oh, he's in there. Hey, look at that clock. It's time for...

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:57.360
 I'm for the Aldrich family based on characters originated by Clifford Goldsmith

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.860
 and starring Ezra Stone as Henry with Jackie Kalk as Homer.

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.360
 Henry! Henry Aldrich!

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:06.360
 Coming, mother!

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:21.360
 [Applause]

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.360
 No one has ever yet succeeded in crowding into one definition

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.360
 all the amazing characteristics of a typical teenage American boy.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.360
 The best you can do is to say boys will be boys and let it go at that.

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.860
 This is a special issue of Henry Aldridge.

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.060
 The scene opens in an empty classroom at Central High.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.460
 Henry, let's go. I'm hungry.

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.060
 Wait a minute, Homer.

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.360
 Do you hear footsteps out there in the hall?

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:52.760
 Sure, all the kids are going downstairs to eat their lunch, like sensible human beings.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.560
 But do you hear any footsteps that sound like Mr. Nelson?

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.560
 Henry, what are you afraid of?

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.360
 Who's afraid? I'm not afraid.

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.760
 And why are you holding my hand?

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.060
 Look, Homer, just open the door, say.

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.780
 Sure, and we'll both go downstairs and eat our lunch.

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:14.280
 No Homer, just peek out into the hall and tell me when you see Mr. Nelson going into the teacher's room.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.300
 Okay, Hen, but don't stick your head out.

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.740
 How can I see him if I don't stick my head out?

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:22.000
 But he might see you. Is that bad?

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.900
 Quick Homer, close the door.

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.480
 But Hen, we are in home.

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.760
 Here, have my lunch. I've got glue on my mind.

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.220
 Oh boy.

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:35.120
 Look, all we have to do is wait till Mr. Nelson is safely inside the teacher's room.

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.120
 Yeah, why?

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.420
 Homer, isn't it clear?

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.220
 I've got to keep out of his way.

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.020
 Although, gee whiz, it wasn't even my fault.

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:43.320
 I don't think.

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.220
 Hello, Wolfen.

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.220
 Knocking over the glue pot in manual training.

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.820
 Besides, I was just doing, willy, a good turn by helping him knock his block off.

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:53.220
 Helping him, Mom?

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.220
 Knock his block off!

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:55.720
 Knock his block off!

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.820
 He went and put one block too many in his inlay breadboard.

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:03.080
 And you knocked over a whole pot of glue?

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.880
 No, gee, was it was only half full?

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.380
 Or Mr. Nelson threw a fit?

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.480
 You know what really made a man?

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.620
 He stepped in the glue, see?

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.560
 And walked right out of his shoe.

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.760
 [LAUGHTER]

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.140
 And right there in the toe of his sock

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:21.460
 was about the biggest hole I've ever seen.

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:22.980
 [LAUGHTER]

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:24.900
 Me, whiz.

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.340
 Gee, you don't ever think of teachers

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.340
 being real human beings with holes in their socks, do you?

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:35.340
 And I'm not sure, but I think he had one in the heel, too.

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.340
 Why, him?

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:39.340
 Sure. So tell me the truth.

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:43.340
 Do you think I deserve to get a detention for a little thing like that?

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.340
 She was to Mr. Nelson, give you a detention?

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:50.340
 Not yet. That's why I'm avoiding him. All he said was he'd look into the glue

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:51.340
 pod later.

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.340
 Oh, somebody's coming.

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.340
 Well, can we, my peanut butter sandwich?

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:56.340
 under the desk.

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.340
 Henry, you're sitting on.

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.340
 Stop squirming Homer, we'll show.

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.340
 How could we?

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:06.340
 Henry, my goodness, what are you and Homer doing under that desk?

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.340
 Kathleen, I thought you were.

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:09.340
 Homer, get up.

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.340
 I can't, I'm underneath.

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:12.340
 Hi Kathleen.

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:13.340
 Hi Kathleen.

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:16.340
 My goodness, I was just talking about you.

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:17.340
 Allow me Kathleen.

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.340
 Homer, what could I possibly say about you?

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:21.340
 That's true.

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:24.340
 It was about the basketball game this afternoon, Henry.

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:27.340
 Yeah, the basketball game.

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:30.340
 And my goodness, the silliest thing happened.

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:33.340
 Guess who asked me to go to the game with him, Charlie Clark?

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:34.340
 Charlie Clark?

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:36.340
 Well, you know how he pesters me.

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:38.340
 He even wanted to take me out for soda afterwards.

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:42.340
 My goodness, I suppose he thinks I'd be the envy of all the girls if I went with him.

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:44.340
 Wouldn't maybe envy a Shivu in with Henry.

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:46.340
 Homer, don't be ridiculous.

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:48.340
 Cross home, don't be ridiculous.

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:50.340
 Kathleen, what's so ridiculous about that?

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:57.340
 And Henry, Charlie said, "If at the last minute you couldn't take me to the game to let him know."

00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:58.340
 Oh, he did.

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:00.340
 Well, Gee, what did he mean by that?

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:02.340
 Well, that's what I wondered.

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:04.340
 You are going to take me out to Henry.

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:06.340
 Well, sure, Kathleen, absolutely.

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:10.340
 I might be, well, a couple of minutes late, but I'll be there.

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:11.340
 I'm pretty sure.

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:13.340
 There's nothing wrong with her, Henry.

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:14.340
 The wrong?

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:15.340
 She was, no.

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:16.340
 Everything...

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:19.340
 The things have never been better, I think.

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:20.340
 I think.

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:22.840
 Then why are you in Homer waiting here in this classroom?

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:27.340
 Why, uh, why, do we, we, we lie here?

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:28.340
 Where it's quiet.

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:31.340
 Oh, well then I'll meet you at Miss Travis' classroom at 3.45.

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:32.340
 Sure.

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:38.340
 Oh, Kathleen is, um, is, uh, anybody out in the hall?

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:39.340
 No, Henry.

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:41.340
 The coast is clear, Homer, come on.

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:43.340
 Nobody can miss Nelson, bye.

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:44.340
 Mr. Nelson?

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:45.340
 Sure, Henry.

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:46.340
 Here he comes down the hall.

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:47.340
 Oh boy, oh, oh, look.

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:48.340
 Look, look.

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:52.620
 I'll be taking a drink from the water fountain here. You stand in front of me. Okay, bend over.

00:06:52.620 --> 00:07:17.860
 Act nonchalant, Homer. Manchalant. Oh, Homer. Oh, gee. Hello, Mr. Nelson. How are you? Just fine. How are you? Oh, I'm fine. That's fine. Fine. Now, would you mind stepping aside, Homer? I'd like to get a drink. A drink? If you're pleased. Of water? Unless they've started putting soda pop in the fountains.

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:22.360
 That would be an awfully good idea, don't you think?

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:23.660
 A hallmark step aside.

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:24.660
 Yes, sir.

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:26.660
 Why, Henry?

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:28.660
 Why, Mr. Nelson?

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:32.960
 Gee, the one person in school, I...

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:33.960
 The one person I...

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:35.660
 You wanted to speak to me, Henry.

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:40.860
 Yes, sir, I just want to apologize for that little accident this morning in manual training.

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:41.860
 Which accident do you mean?

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:47.180
 When I accidentally and through no fold of my own helped knock over the glue pot, you

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:49.540
 You mean you were the one who knocked it over?

00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:50.740
 You mean you didn't know?

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:52.260
 (audience laughing)

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.780
 Well, Henry, as much as I admire your honesty.

00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:55.620
 - Yes, sir.

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:57.260
 - I'm afraid I'll have to give you a detention.

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:58.820
 Mr. Bradley's rules, you know.

00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:00.180
 - A detention?

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:01.020
 This afternoon?

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:02.900
 - Yes, Henry, in my room right after school.

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:03.820
 - But Mr. Nelson.

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:05.820
 - Now if you'll excuse me, I'm eating my lunch here

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:06.660
 on the teacher's room.

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:07.500
 - Oh boy.

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:10.060
 Hello then, Elsie.

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:11.140
 - How are you, Prescott?

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:12.020
 This seat taken?

00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:15.820
 - No, go ahead, I just came from band practice.

00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:16.980
 Have you got an aspirin?

00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:20.580

 Frankly, I'm hungry.

00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:50.420
 Why, I was just wondering, Mr. Nelson,

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:52.520
 was it this afternoon you said you wanted me

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:53.760
 to take my detention?

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:54.600
 It was.

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:55.700
 What was it tomorrow afternoon?

00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:56.760
 It was this afternoon.

00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:57.600
 Not tomorrow?

00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:59.800
 Henry, that's all right, Mr. Nelson.

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:02.340
 I'll be glad to stay after school.

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:08.340
 Only, what do you think our basketball team is going to do

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:09.140
 today?

00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:13.260
 What they usually do, lose.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.300
 Mr. Nelson, did I tell you how sorry I am,

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:21.320
 knocked over your sock. I mean you glue. I'm sorry too Henry. I know. Was that all you

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:25.020
 had just hope your shoes are all right. They will be once I get them loose from

00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:29.060
 the floor up there. Well see whiz what do you wear these Jim shoes are very

00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:34.020
 comfortable Jim shoe. I had to borrow them from Charlie Clark. Charlie. Oh boy

00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:37.900
 the Mr. Nelson about to say about this afternoon. This afternoon Henry I'll

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:44.820
 see you at 3.30. Yes sir just before the basketball game. That's right. Oh now if

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:45.820
 If you'll excuse me.

00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:50.420
 Who was that Nelson?

00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:51.420
 The Orbridge boy.

00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:52.020
 Yes.

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:53.420
 What do you want coming in here?

00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:54.220
 He didn't say.

00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:55.620
 Nice boy, that Henry.

00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:57.520
 Are you sure you haven't gotten your aspirin?

00:09:57.520 --> 00:09:58.220
 Positive.

00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:01.620
 I hated that to give him a detention, but you know how Mr. Bradley is.

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:02.820
 I sure do.

00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:05.820
 Have to keep your finger on everybody's pulse, you know.

00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:09.420
 Speaking of pose, look who just came in.

00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:11.620
 Well, well, Miss Trevor.

00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:12.620
 That's a nail.

00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:14.620
 Here, here, have my chair, Miss Trevor.

00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:15.620
 No, I have Mark.

00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:17.620
 Why don't I just take this empty one right here?

00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:19.620
 What's that in the basket, Miss Trevor?

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:21.120
 Apples. I just cleaned out my desk.

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:22.120
 Anyone like that?

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:23.120
 No, thank you.

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:23.620
 I'll have one.

00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:24.620
 Well, I'll have one, too.

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:26.620
 Will you have one of my letters, then, which is Miss Trevor?

00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:28.620
 No, thank you. I can only stay a minute.

00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:31.620
 Mr. Nelson, about the basketball game this afternoon...

00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:33.620
 I'm certainly sorry you can't go with me, Miss Trevor.

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:37.620
 Well, as a matter of fact, Mr. Nelson, I got those papers marked last night.

00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:39.620
 Oh? So I will be able to go with you after all.

00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:40.620
 Well, why, that's great.

00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:41.620
 Yes, but...

00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:45.620
 Well Nelson didn't you say you had a detention this afternoon?

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:46.620
 Say I'd forgotten all about that.

00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:47.620
 Oh that's too big.

00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:50.620
 I'll tell you what Miss Trevor, I don't mind being second choice.

00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:51.620
 What?

00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:53.620
 I suppose I pick you up at your room at 3.30.

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:55.620
 Well I just a minute, I can get out of this detention.

00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:57.620
 Oh no you can't Nelson.

00:10:57.620 --> 00:10:59.620
 Miss Trevor I'll pick you up at 3.30.

00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:01.620
 No no wait a minute press stop.

00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:11.620
 (music)

00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:13.620
 Thank you, operator. I'll wait.

00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:15.620
 But, Henry, why are you phoning your mother?

00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:18.620
 I'm just using my head, Homer. I can get out of this detention.

00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:19.620
 You can.

00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:25.620
 If I can just replace that glue I spilled, I'm pretty sure Mr. Nelson will be reasonable about the whole thing.

00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:26.620
 Hello?

00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:28.620
 Now, get out of the phone booth, Homer.

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:30.620
 Hello, mother.

00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:33.220
 Henry, why aren't you in school?

00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:34.220
 I am.

00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:36.220
 I'm right here in Ms. Shae's booth.

00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:38.820
 You're not in any kind of trouble, are you, dear?

00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:39.820
 Trouble?

00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:42.220
 Oh, see, why do you say anything like that?

00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:47.420
 I just happen to be passing the phone, see, and I have five minutes before my next class.

00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:48.420
 Yeah.

00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:49.420
 And, yeah.

00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:52.420
 And, uh, how are you?

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:54.020
 Come on, fine.

00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:56.420
 Is that all you phone for?

00:11:56.420 --> 00:11:59.420
 Sure, and could you please send Mary down here with a can of glue?

00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:01.060
 The kind of what?

00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:05.020
 Glue mother glue. What you used to stick shoes to. I mean furniture lay.

00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:07.260
 Yeah, what do you want glue for?

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:12.700
 For manual training. The can they had sort of ran out, see,

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:17.180
 and well I thought it might help matters if I supplied them with an extra one.

00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:21.020
 That's very nice of you Henry, but can't it wait until tomorrow?

00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:24.900
 No, Gee was if I don't get it today, I'll probably get a detention.

00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:25.740
 What's that?

00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:27.460
 Oh, her, oh boy.

00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:29.460
 Henry, did you say a detention?

00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:31.960
 Look, Mother, will you please tell Mary to run all the way?

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:32.960
 Goodbye.

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:35.960
 Henry, I'm glad I found you.

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:36.960
 Yes, Mr. Nelson.

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:38.960
 I've been thinking over what you said to me in the teacher's room.

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:40.960
 See, I didn't mean anything by that.

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:41.960
 I know.

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:43.960
 But when you said you thought your detention was tomorrow...

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:45.960
 Oh, I realize now that it's today.

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:46.960
 But, Henry...

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:51.960
 I wondered what you'd think, Mr. Nelson, if I were to replace the glue, I spilled.

00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:53.960
 That won't be necessary, Henry.

00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:55.960
 You mean it wouldn't help matters, any?

00:12:55.960 --> 00:13:02.480
 Henry and view of the fact that you did clean up all the glue all except what spattered into the band saw you spattered glue

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:04.480
 I'm a band saw you mean you didn't know

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:11.800
 Well, Henry even if you did and I realized mr. Nelson that you have to punish me for it

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:15.600
 He was if you teachers didn't keep discipline around here

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:21.120
 Who would well Henry what I had in mind was that was mr. Nelson?

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:24.760
 I hope you won't think I'm being forward, but mr. Nelson

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:30.320
 What would you think of this or what how would you like to have sort of a right hand all the rest of the year?

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:31.080
 What's that gee?

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:36.760
 I'll clean up a manual training room and sharpen the chisels and carry messages for you and help you mark papers

00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:40.900
 No, Henry. I don't I'll do anything if you'll just release me from that detention today

00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:47.620
 Anything you ever asked me to do mr. Nelson no matter what it is Henry. I certainly appreciate your offer

00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:49.620
 She was you do therefore Henry

00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:52.600
 Yes, mr. Bradley

00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:59.920
 Certainly, Mr. Bradley. Mr. Nelson about my property. I'll be back in a minute Henry. Wait right there. Sure. Mr. Nelson. I'd be glad to

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:06.720
 Sit down please. Thank you, Mr. Bradley

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:09.240
 Now then mr. Nelson

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:14.280
 Something quite serious has just happened. Oh, oh it has it has oh

00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:21.160
 I've just received the call from a mother who claims that we're forcing her boy to supply glue from annual training

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:22.160
 What's that?

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:23.800
 And Mr. Nelson.

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:28.640
 When this mother pointed out that she pays taxes, to buy just such items as glue, you

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:29.640
 can imagine my position.

00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:30.640
 Yes, yes sir.

00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:32.800
 I was without an answer, Mr. Nelson.

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:33.800
 Yes sir.

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:37.320
 But Mr. Nelson, if you ran out of glue in manual training this morning, may I ask why

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:39.040
 you didn't report it to me?

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:42.520
 But Mr. Bradley, we have plenty of glue in manual training for lacquer that we're out

00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:43.520
 of.

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:44.520
 Or is it varnish?

00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:46.440
 No, no, I'm sure it's lacquer.

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:47.440
 You're sure?

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:48.440
 Yes sir.

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:49.440
 You're quite sure.

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:50.520
 Why, I'm almost sure sir.

00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:53.880
 I see. So, Mr. Nelson, you claim you have plenty of glue.

00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:54.480
 Yes, sir.

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:57.120
 Now, would you please tell me how many pots?

00:14:57.120 --> 00:15:02.040
 Why, we have somewhere between--

00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:04.040
 Well, I know we have plenty, Mr. Bradley.

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:05.960
 But I see.

00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:09.120
 Mr. Nelson, when the school board asked me how many students

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:13.080
 we had registered in Central Hyde, do you think I replied plenty?

00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:13.640
 No, sir.

00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:14.440
 No, sir.

00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:16.360
 I replied.

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:17.880
 I replied.

00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:19.320
 I told them how many we had.

00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:20.320
 Yes sir.

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:26.880
 It appears to me, Mr. Nelson, that it must be quite difficult for you to teach manual

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:30.280
 training with only vague ideas to the amount of your supplies.

00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:31.280
 Yes sir.

00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:32.280
 You admit it's difficult.

00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:34.560
 Why, it isn't exactly that easy.

00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:37.720
 That would be easier if you knew what you had in the store room.

00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:39.200
 Oh yes, yes sir, Mr. Bradley.

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:40.200
 Much easier.

00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:42.880
 And then I'm sure you'll agree with me that you ought to take a complete inventory of

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:44.440
 your manual training room supplies.

00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:45.440
 Yes sir.

00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:46.440
 Very well.

00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:48.940
 Right after your last class this afternoon, Mr. Nelson,

00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:52.300
 and I got all the figures on my desk by five o'clock.

00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:54.000
 This afternoon, Mr. Bradley?

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.340
 I mean, you don't need tomorrow afternoon.

00:15:56.340 --> 00:15:58.420
 I mean, this afternoon?

00:15:58.420 --> 00:15:59.100
 Oh.

00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:00.860
 That will be all, Mr. Nelson.

00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:01.940
 Yes, Mr. Bradley.

00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:04.060
 And, well, thank you, sir.

00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:07.660
 We have to keep our finger on everybody's pulse, you know.

00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:08.460
 Yes, sir.

00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:09.860
 I know.

00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:11.020
 Here I am, Mr. Nelson.

00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:12.180
 I'm still waiting.

00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:13.060
 Waiting for what?

00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:15.220
 Waiting for your answer to my proposition.

00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:18.220
 You know about my helping you whenever you need help.

00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:20.220
 Oh yes, Henry, I remember.

00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:23.220
 Please report to the storeroom at 3.30 this afternoon.

00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:26.220
 - This afternoon? - Oh, we're going to take inventory.

00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:30.220
 And since it may take three or four hours, you better get some sandwiches from the cafeteria.

00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:32.220
 Sandwiches, you mean we'll be that? But Mr. Nelson?

00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:34.220
 That's all right, Henry, just charge them to me.

00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:35.220
 But Mr. Nelson!

00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:36.220
 Hey, Henry!

00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:38.220
 - What, Homer? - He caught her.

00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:39.220
 You caught who?

00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:44.220
 Kathleen, like you just told me to. And I told you we're taking her out for a soda after the basketball game.

00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:51.220
 Homer you didn't. And she was so excited she kissed me. Oh boy. So I flew in a movie. Oh boy.

00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:12.180
 Now I don't have to tell you folks how good jello puddings are.

00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:16.940
 Yes, jello, chocolate, butter, scotch, and vanilla puddings, a trio of treats,

00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:19.940
 chock full of old-fashioned homemade goodness.

00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:23.060
 And say, ever try chocolate peppermint pudding?

00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:27.980
 Just prepare one package of smooth, velvety jello chocolate pudding as usual.

00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:32.420
 While still warm, add crushed peppermint stick candy, let it chill,

00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:35.780
 then top with whipped cream and sprigs of mint.

00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:40.920
 Three jello puddings made with milk are nourishing, and they cook to perfection in just about

00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:42.260
 five minutes.

00:17:42.260 --> 00:18:02.180
 No wonder more people buy jello puddings than any other prepared puddings in the world.

00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:05.180
 Now getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldrich.

00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:10.180
 Henry's plans to take Kathleen to a basketball game this afternoon

00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:14.180
 have been shattered by an after-school detention for Mr. Nelson.

00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:16.580
 As a result of his efforts to avoid it,

00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:22.180
 Henry and Mr. Nelson are now tied up for the whole afternoon taking inventory.

00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:24.980
 The scene opens in Mr. Aldrich's office.

00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:26.980
 It is later the same afternoon.

00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:28.180
 Hello.

00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:30.380
 Hello. Is that Mr. Aldrich?

00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:31.780
 Yes. Is that you, Homer?

00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:34.980
 Sure. Gee, how are you?

00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:36.580
 Well, I'm fine.

00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:41.580
 Mr. Aldrich, Henry wants to know if you'd mind having your secretary, Miss Thompson,

00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:44.580
 run down here to school with your adding machine.

00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:46.580
 Adding machine? What for?

00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:51.780
 To speed things up. And while she's here, would you mind if Henry borrowed Miss Thompson?

00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:52.780
 What's that?

00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:58.380
 Then maybe he could polish this whole thing off in an hour and see the finish of the basketball game anyway.

00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:00.380
 Well, what on earth are you talking about?

00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:03.340
 an inventory, Mr. Allrich, in manual training.

00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:04.740
 Henry's taking inventory?

00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:05.740
 Yes, sir.

00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:07.820
 But isn't that a teacher's job?

00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:10.140
 Sure. Mr. Nelson's helping him.

00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:12.740
 Yes, the word is Henry coming up.

00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:14.900
 Why aren't some of the other teachers helping Mr. Nelson?

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:18.060
 Right. There don't seem to be any available.

00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:20.740
 I think they're all going to the basketball game.

00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:21.660
 Yeah?

00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:23.540
 And not being that work off on the students?

00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:24.180
 Oh, no.

00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:27.540
 It's just that Mr. Nelson and Henry sort of felt Henry

00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:29.580
 should help Mr. Nelson.

00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:31.580
 Now just a minute, let's get to the bottom of this.

00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:35.180
 The bottom? I think Henry would just assume you didn't.

00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:35.680
 What's that?

00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:38.580
 He just assumed you forgot the whole thing. Goodbye.

00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:41.180
 Homer, wait! Homer, come back here!

00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:53.580
 Can't you write all this down faster, Henry?

00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:54.580
 Yes, Mr. Nelson.

00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:55.580
 Fifty-three hacksaw blades.

00:19:55.580 --> 00:19:57.580
 Fifty-three hacksaw blades.

00:19:57.580 --> 00:20:01.980
 two kegs three inch nails two kegs three inch nail twenty six parts of glue

00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:05.660

 g_ mister nelson do you mind if i ask you a personal question or what is it

00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:30.420
 Frankly, do you think Charlie Clark is so handsome?

00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:32.860
 Yeah, I suppose he is, to a girl.

00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:34.780
 See, I hope not.

00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:38.220
 You know who I'd really call handsome?

00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:40.060
 That Mr. Prescott, for instance.

00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:41.140
 That's got it.

00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:44.100
 Let's get back to our inventory.

00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:47.820
 She was at home, Mr. Nelson, would you mind if I stepped out of the store?

00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:49.820
 I'm just a second and had a word with my friend.

00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:51.140
 All right, but don't take more in a minute.

00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:52.140
 I won't.

00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:54.260
 Give me, I just found your father and it's no use.

00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:54.940
 Why not?

00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:56.940
 I started asking too many questions.

00:20:56.940 --> 00:20:59.640
 Oh boy, then there's only one thing to do.

00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:02.640
 Homer, you've got to take Kathleen to the basketball game for me.

00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:03.140
 I do.

00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:05.440
 Here are the tickets and here's the money for the sodas.

00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:08.140
 And don't let her even talk to Charlie Clark.

00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:09.840
 Okay, sure.

00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:11.040
 It'll be a pleasure.

00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:14.040
 And be sure she has a real good time, Homer.

00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:16.040
 Oh boy.

00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:17.040
 [laughter]

00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:19.040
 I'll say I will.

00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:20.040
 Hey, wait a minute.

00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:21.540
 What do you mean by that?

00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:23.540
 Oh boy.

00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:24.540
 [laughter]

00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:27.040
 And then I'll wait Homer, let's talk this over.

00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:27.540
 Oh, Homer.

00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:29.040
 Yes, Mr. Nelson.

00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:31.140
 Will you drop this case as a motto soup off

00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:32.540
 in domestic science on your way down?

00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:34.540
 I'd be glad to, Mr. Nelson.

00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:36.540
 Is it creamed or clear?

00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:38.540
 Never mind, just get it down there right away.

00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:39.540
 The Homer.

00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:41.540
 Well, on hand, it's thanks for everything.

00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:42.540
 The Homer, come back here.

00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:44.540
 Something wrong, Henry?

00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:48.540
 Mr. Nelson, did you see that look on Homer's face?

00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:49.540
 What about it?

00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:53.540
 She was, I'd be better off if she went to the game with Charlie.

00:21:53.540 --> 00:22:03.080
 [Music]

00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:05.380
 But home are the game stars in 10 minutes!

00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:08.640
 No, do you mind if I set this case of soup down?

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:11.080
 Where's Henry? I've been waiting and waiting!

00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:13.780
 That's what I want to talk to you about, Kathleen.

00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:15.580
 Guess who you're going to the game with?

00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:16.480
 Not Henry?

00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:19.100
 No, he has to take inventory up in the store.

00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:20.120
 Inventory?

00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:22.020
 So guess who's taking you to the game?

00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:23.260
 Not Charlie Clark.

00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:24.260
 Guess again.

00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:25.760
 Oh my god, who?

00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:26.760
 Me.

00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:27.760
 You?

00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:28.760
 Sure.

00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:30.760
 I'm going to the game with you.

00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:31.760
 Sure.

00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:32.760
 Right out in public?

00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:37.760
 And I'm taking you off for a soda afterward.

00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:38.760
 What do you say about that?

00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:39.760
 Oh, I'm speechless.

00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:40.760
 I thought you would be.

00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:43.760
 And I must say you certainly have your nerd.

00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:44.760
 Why?

00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:47.960
 Sneaking around behind your best friend's back and trying to steal his girlfriend right

00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:48.960
 from under his nose.

00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:51.260
 But Kathleen, he gave you to me.

00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:54.260
 Henry Aldrich would never do a thing like that to me.

00:22:54.260 --> 00:22:56.460
 Kathleen, are you insulting me?

00:22:56.460 --> 00:22:57.660
 Goodbye, Homer.

00:22:57.660 --> 00:22:58.860
 Where are you going?

00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:01.760
 I'm going up to the storeroom and help Henry take inventory.

00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:04.760
 But Kathleen's students aren't allowed up there without permission.

00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:06.460
 I'll get in somehow.

00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:07.960
 Okay, Kathleen.

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:08.960
 That's your attitude.

00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:10.460
 Where's my tomato soup?

00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:10.960
 Right there.

00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:14.160
 Okay, and see if I ever speak to you the one of you again.

00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:15.160
 Homer, watch where you're going.

00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:16.460
 Just where you ever want me to...

00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:18.760
 Come and look up the day!

00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:35.760
 What was that again, Mr. Aldridge?

00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:40.760
 I just said, Mr. Bradley, that I don't want you to think of me as a complaining parent.

00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:42.760
 Oh, no, no, of course not, Mr. Aldridge.

00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:46.760
 Why, one of my greatest pleasures, his principal, is hearing from our parents.

00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:48.760
 Well, that's fine, Mr. Bradley.

00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:53.760
 Now, I realize it's a small thing, but my boy has his heart set on going to that basketball game this afternoon.

00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:54.760
 Of course he has.

00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:59.760
 And it seems to be just a bit unfair to force him to take an inventory just because all the teachers want to go to the game.

00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:02.760
 Oh, is that what's happened, Mr. Aldridge?

00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:04.760
 Didn't you know, Mr. Bradley?

00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:05.760
 Oh, why?

00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:07.760
 I assume you know what's going on in your own school.

00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:09.760
 Well, I do, Mr. Aldridge. I do.

00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:13.760
 I do. As a matter of fact, I was just about to clamp down on that very thing.

00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:14.760
 I'm glad to hear it, Mr. Bradley.

00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:15.760
 Mr. Bradley.

00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:17.760
 Although I'm sure Mr. Aldrich, you'll agree with me.

00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:20.760
 Our teachers ought to attend the school basketball game.

00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:21.760
 Certainly, Mr. Bradley.

00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:25.760
 Just as long as they don't neglect their own work and keep students from attending.

00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:27.760
 They are entirely right, Mr. Aldrich.

00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:29.760
 I'll look into Henry immediately. Thank you for calling.

00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:31.760
 Thank you, Mr. Bradley. Goodbye.

00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:34.760
 Goodbye, Mr. Aldrich. Let's hear from you again.

00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:38.760
 Miss Say! Miss Say!

00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:40.760
 Yes, Mr. Bradley!

00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:42.760
 Miss Say! Have all the teachers go to the game this afternoon?

00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:44.560
 Well, I'm not sure, Mr. Badman.

00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:45.720
 No, not sure.

00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:47.600
 Miss Shea, as my secretary, it seems to me

00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:49.200
 you ought to know what's going on in this school.

00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:50.000
 Yes, Mr. Badman.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:51.920
 Didn't any of the teachers have papers to mark

00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:53.400
 or lessons to prepare?

00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:54.680
 Didn't any of them have detention?

00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:55.340
 Well--

00:24:55.340 --> 00:24:56.280
 Yes, Miss Shea.

00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:58.120
 Well, Mr. Nelson is taking inventory.

00:24:58.120 --> 00:24:59.240
 Inventory.

00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:01.040
 Go up there and tell Henry Aldrich I

00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:02.360
 want to see him immediately.

00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:05.840
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:16.840
 This is Stillmas Trevor's classroom isn't it Mr. Nelson?

00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:17.840
 Henry, I'm beginning to wonder.

00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:19.840
 This is where Kathleen said to me,

00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:21.840
 "She was, I wonder where they are."

00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:23.840
 We're only a few minutes late.

00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:26.840
 Henry, are you sure Mr. Bradley said to drop the inventory?

00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:27.840
 Positive, Mr. Nelson.

00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:29.840
 He was as nice as pie.

00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:30.840
 That's strange.

00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:36.840
 strange. He said to go to the game and to remember all the good plays so I could tell my father.

00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:42.840
 Oh, there's Mr. Trevor now. And Kathleen too. Hi Kathleen, I'm glad to see you.

00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:45.840
 Hello Henry. Listen, I'll speak to you alone for a minute.

00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:47.840
 Well, of course. What if I'm afraid to do that?

00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:51.840
 Boy Kathleen, let's get going to the game. I'm finally all straightened out.

00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:56.840
 You are? Well look. For a while I was pretty worried Kathleen. I thought I'd never get to take you.

00:25:56.840 --> 00:25:59.240
 Well everything's alright now, come on.

00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:01.940
 But that's just it Henry. I can't go.

00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:03.940
 You can't go. Why not?

00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:06.540
 Henry, I was only on my way to help you with your inventory.

00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:07.340
 Oh, Kathy.

00:26:07.340 --> 00:26:08.640
 Who am I going to do, Mr. Bradley?

00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:10.340
 You have to excuse Kathy.

00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:12.840
 Henry, she has a two-hour detention this afternoon.

00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:13.840
 A detention?

00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:15.840
 Yes, here in Miss Trevor's room.

00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:19.840
 Henry, what would you think of a young lady who climbs around on fire escapes?

00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:21.840
 Fire escapes, Kathleen.

00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:22.840
 Oh, Miss Trevor.

00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:24.140
 Yes, Mr. Bradley.

00:26:24.140 --> 00:26:25.740
 Miss sooner you'll begin your detention.

00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:28.380
 The sooner you will be free to talk to Mr. Nelson.

00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:30.080
 She was Kathleen.

00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:34.480
 Gee, you mean I have to go to the basketball game with somebody like Homer?

00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:35.880
 Homer, Cacko-Ezer.

00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:36.720
 He can?

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:39.720
 He's down in the nurse's office there reviving him with tomato soup.

00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:41.360
 [laughter]

00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:43.760
 Sorry, I can't go to the game with you, Mr. Nelson.

00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:45.760
 I'm sorry too, Mr. Trevor.

00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:47.760
 Come along, Kathleen.

00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:49.760
 Goodbye, Henry.

00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:51.760
 Goodbye, Kathleen.

00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:53.760
 [sighs]

00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:58.760
 She was... I know exactly how you feel, Henry.

00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:00.760
 Mr. Nelson.

00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:02.760
 Yes, Henry?

00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:06.760
 Mr. Nelson, how would you like to go to the basketball game with me?

00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:09.760
 I'd be delighted, Henry. Let's go.

00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:25.360
 [Music]

00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:26.960
 Henry, are you still mad?

00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:30.560
 Because Kathleen just happened to accidentally kiss me.

00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:32.360
 Henry.

00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:33.160
 Huh?

00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:35.760
 Won't you even speak to me?

00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:37.560
 Henry.

00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:38.760
 Huh?

00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:40.760
 Mr. Seymour.

00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:41.760
 Ah, yes, Homer.

00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:45.760
 Will you ask Henry why he won't shake hands with me and end this whole thing?

00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:50.760
 A sure thing, but first let me tell the folks about the happiest ending a meal ever came to.

00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:55.760
 Yep, it's jello. The luscious shimmering dessert everybody goes for,

00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:59.760
 because you just can't beat jello for tempting fruit-like goodness.

00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:05.760
 In any one of those six delicious flavors, strawberry, raspberry, cherry, orange, lemon, or lime.

00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:11.160
 lime. Every jello flavor is a special treat in itself, rich with that famous

00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:16.520
 locked-in goodness. Flavors sealed right in by a special process so it can't get

00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:22.680
 out till your first delectable spoonful. And that's why jello is America's

00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:26.320
 favorite gelatin dessert.

00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:38.500
 Here's hoping you'll be in your living room and ours next week at the same time.

00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:39.880
 Good night folks.

00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:48.880
 The Aldrich family starring Ezra Stone is Henry with Jackie Kalka's Homer.

00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:52.880
 It's written by Patricia Joudry and Del Dinsdale with music by Jack Miller.

00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:57.880
 Mr. and Mrs. Aldrich are House Jamison and Catherine Rod.

00:28:57.880 --> 00:29:00.880
 And this is Dan Seymour in New York saying,

00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:05.120
 The Aldrich family is brought to you by the Jell-O family.

00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:10.000
 For dessert that are delicious,

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.440
 I believe me, you should know!

00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:19.280
 They are made by famous J-E-L-L-O!

00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:35.120
 Listen again next Thursday, same time, same station, to another sparkling half hour with the Aldrich family.

00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:41.120
 This is NBC, the national broadcasting company.

00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:43.620
 (piano music)

00:29:43.620 --> 00:29:46.120
 (piano music)

00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:48.700
 (bell ringing)

00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:50.700
 [buzzing]
