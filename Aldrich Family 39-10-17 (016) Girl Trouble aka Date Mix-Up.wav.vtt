 Brought to you by Jello Pudding, those delicious new desserts all America's talking about.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.400
 The Aldrich family arrived on Broadway this week in the hilarious successful Paramount

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.200
 picture of What A Life.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.440
 It's truly a four-bell movie and we urge you all to see it.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.640
 Tonight we are pleased to present one of the stars of the motion picture, Miss Betty Field.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.600
 It will play Barbara Pearson, Henry Sweetheart.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.880
 As usual, the part of Henry Aldrich is played by Ezra Stone.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.200
 They've seen Opens in Barbara's home.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.200
 It is early evening.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.200
 Grandma!

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.200
 Grandmother!

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.400
 Grandmother!

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.200
 Well, yeah, Barbara.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.700
 Henry, you all just become young, has he?

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.300
 No, come in and not ask you, Barbara.

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.700
 Uh, no, he hasn't, Barbara.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.200
 First time this week, he hasn't been here.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.000
 Father, could you come here a minute?

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.500
 Where are you?

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.600
 I'm here in the front hall.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.700
 Well, well, what is it this time, Barbara?

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.200
 Now, listen, Father.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.100
 I don't want grandmother to hear me.

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.300
 Why don't you want me to?

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.300
 Oh, no reason.

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:55.660
 Father yes when Henry comes would you do something for me well what is it I know

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:00.520
 it's awful but I've got it all planned I found out today Henry is saying an

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:06.180
 awful lot of Constance Marshall who told you Constance yourself did I say but

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.060
 not even seen them together I'll I'll back the candy we had around here last

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.100
 night I haven't any idea father when Henry does come would you learn stepping

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.260
 into the room just once or twice and saying George Bigel I want to speak to

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.220
 me on the telephone. Well, I will. Father, won't you? I'm just a bit surprised,

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:29.140
 Barbara. Father, it wouldn't be so terrible, wouldn't? Don't you think I'm human? Barbara,

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.060
 I still think it'd be much better if you got your grandmother mixed up in this. But daddy,

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.820
 grandmother wouldn't approve it. You know she wouldn't. And exactly what makes you think

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:43.140
 I do. It's for Henry's own good father. Constance Marshall is so silly. Barbara, young ladies,

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.580
 don't go about deliberately making young men jealous. What would they do? I beg to differ

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.380
 with you. Well, I get my I. T. for peace that candy. So had my

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.060
 teeth. Charles, somebody's at the front door. Please say yes,

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.260
 father. Well, I'll think it over. That's practically yes. Tell

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.820
 him the other right now. Well, how do you do, young man? How do

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.420
 you do, Mr. Pearson? How are you this evening? Splendid. And

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.740
 that how is Mrs. Sanderson? She's splendid. No, she's not either.

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:15.300
 My digestion is terrible.

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.220
 Is that you in there, Mrs. Sanderson?

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.340
 Jaws.

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.060
 Tell Barbara Henry's here.

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.860
 Mask and all evening, where Henry is?

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:22.700
 Hashi.

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.460
 No, I haven't eaten it, grandmother.

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:26.500
 I had to stop for a second and see

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.900
 somebody on the way over, Barbara.

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:29.740
 Oh.

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:31.940
 Wanna want to put your hats in that package, Don?

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.460
 I'll put my hat down, but I think I'll keep the package.

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:36.620
 Don't you trust us, Henry?

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.140
 Oh, I don't mind holding it.

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:39.500
 It only weighs two pounds.

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:40.340
 What's in it?

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.260
 Oh, just a little something.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.540
 Well, Mr. Pearson, how do you find business?

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:47.540
 - Very good, Henry.

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.140
 - You know, my father was saying--

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.060
 - Will you excuse me just a moment, Henry?

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:53.220
 - That's all right.

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.020
 - Henry, I went over to my doctor's today.

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.900
 - Is that right?

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.140
 - And I can't eat one blessed thing.

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.980
 - Is that right?

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.260
 - And I can't remember when I went sleep last.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:03.220
 - Hello, Henry.

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:04.300
 - Oh, hello.

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.660
 Well--

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.180
 - Oh, here, here's a package for you.

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.700
 Be careful when you take it, it weighs two pounds.

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.420
 Oh, you shouldn't have done this, Henry.

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:16.340
 Well, aren't you going to open it?

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:17.340
 All right.

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:22.300
 Who did you drop in to see on your way over, Henry?

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.460
 Nobody in particular.

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.540
 It wasn't Constance Marshall, was it?

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:29.900
 Oh, all she wanted me to do was drop in and say hello.

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.740
 Oh, she's a nice girl.

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:33.700
 Bobra?

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:34.740
 Yes, Bobra?

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.500
 You're wanted on the telephone.

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:37.540
 Who is it?

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.980
 It sounded like George Bigelow.

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:41.500
 George Bigelow?

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:42.700
 again

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:43.700
 all

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.660
 will you excuse me

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.540
 you mean you're going without opening it

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:49.780
 i'll be right

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:51.900
 it's a strange i didn't hear that for a ring

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.340
 mrs sanderson did

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.660
 did mr pearsons say george big along he did

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:58.700

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:59.660

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:02.740
 what do you want to sleep think of george tell you true so don't think of

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.420
 them at all

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:05.460
 are you think of

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.100
 all you can't get me to say anything against them

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:09.580
 very honorable of you

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:11.540
 You know, I said to Barbara only the other day.

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:13.780
 And lady, I said, "I hope you appreciate

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.460
 what kind of young man Henry Orgrit really is."

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.100
 - Is that right? - Oh, mine is.

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:19.980
 - And what did she say?

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:21.140
 - I forget, Ma'am. - Oh.

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:24.860
 - Well, I certainly hope George doesn't call again.

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:26.020
 - George Fine?

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:27.540
 - It's very fun.

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:28.700
 - Glad to hear that.

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:31.620
 - Certainly wish I could say as much about herself.

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:32.780
 - Don't you think it'd feel better

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:34.300
 if you went up to bed grandmother?

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.260
 - When you're gonna open that candy.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:37.260
 I'm opening it.

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:45.120
 Candy grandmother hmm well just to candy Henry. Oh, I didn't even know you were there

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.720
 Thank you. Mmm very good

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:52.660
 Even if they do have no shall we step out onto the front porch barber?

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:58.860
 No, I'm going out there and catch pneumonia right the prime your lives or a cudin barber put on a coat maybe

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:05.680
 Yes, Bob. I think it's George big a load. Yeah, my goodness

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:08.760
 I guess he just thinks I don't have anything else to do.

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:10.440
 Excuse me, isn't he?

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:11.440
 Uh-huh.

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.240
 I must be getting deaf.

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:16.040
 Henry, do you hear any following rings?

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:17.040
 No, ma'am.

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:18.040
 How are you?

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:19.040
 With I?

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:20.040
 Hmm.

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:21.040
 I don't.

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:22.040
 Whatever it is.

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:23.040
 You know, would you do something about it?

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:24.040
 What is there I can do?

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:25.040
 Oh, it's worth having it.

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:26.040
 Worth having, ain't it?

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:29.240
 You mean, you mean I ought to pound the daylights out of George?

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.200
 Oh, he's out of him or out of Barbara.

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:32.200
 How?

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:34.000
 Let me lay your hands on.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.000
 Reminds me.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.000
 I don't mean that, can't he?

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.300
 But if Barbara likes George, I don't see how socking him is going to help any.

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:42.360
 He'll certainly make you feel better, won't he?

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:43.840
 Even if he's older than I am?

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:45.160
 Isn't he, young man?

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:50.080
 I used to be as pretty as any of them in my day, and I know all the tricks of the trade.

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:51.760
 Did you used to fight?

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:53.920
 When the occasion demanded it, yes.

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:56.480
 Hey, are these all caramelles?

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:57.480
 No, ma'am.

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:59.480
 Now, let me tell you something.

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:03.520
 If you want to make her set up and take notice, only way to do is to make her joke.

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:06.720
 I mean, when she comes into the room, I don't pay any attention to her.

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:08.220
 I just sit and talk to you.

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:11.020
 Well, is that the way they do it in the movie?

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:13.220
 You mean I should make her think I like somebody else?

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:14.520
 No, I'm telling you.

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:16.320
 Not as a grandmother.

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:18.620
 But as one soldier to another.

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:20.020
 Get busy and get busy quick.

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:20.920
 Yes, ma'am.

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:21.820
 Yeah.

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:23.720
 One eater, half of this one.

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:25.120
 Good nut, son.

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:26.920
 My goodness.

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:30.120
 George Bigelow, he wants to give me his class pin.

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:31.620
 Can you imagine such a thing?

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:35.020
 Well, I'm late as it is.

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:36.060
 Where are you going?

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:36.660
 No place.

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:40.020
 I just told Connie when I dropped in, I'd be right back.

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:43.100
 Oh, I'm sorry.

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:44.820
 I didn't tell George he could come over.

00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:46.260
 No, I just called him back.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.100
 Well, of course.

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:49.740
 Maybe I will.

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:51.500
 If he's phone ain't wore out.

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:54.180
 What's that you're putting in the lapelia code?

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:56.180
 Oh, nothing.

00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:57.540
 Just a pen of Connie.

00:07:57.540 --> 00:07:58.500
 She asked me to wear.

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:00.060
 Where'd she get it?

00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:03.780
 Her mother had it first. It's an old family hair loom.

00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:06.060
 Let me see what it says.

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:08.460
 Vote the Democratic ticket.

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:12.500
 Yeah, the whole family comes from a long line of Democrats.

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:13.980
 Oh.

00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:16.460
 I'm sorry you have to go, Henry.

00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:17.580
 Maybe I can stay.

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:22.060
 I'm telling you, Henry, all right, you're making the mistake here alive.

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:27.260
 But, well, Grandmother, I don't think we should force him to go.

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:30.940
 Henry well, I guess I have to go barber. Goodbye

00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:37.660
 Bye, I am and I suppose we see very much of you from now on will we why not? Oh?

00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:42.460
 Oh, oh, yeah, I guess this time goes on you won't well

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:47.440
 Who is it you better go to George?

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:52.700
 She's over at somebody's house and wants you to come over is that right? Oh

00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:55.260
 I'll answer in just a minute.

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.060
 Who is this constant marshal?

00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:59.300
 Constance Marshall is nothing but an NTS.

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:00.660
 What's an NTS?

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:02.900
 NTS is necktie straightener.

00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:05.500
 Every boy she meets she has to straighten right away.

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:08.140
 Charles, who is constant marshal?

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:11.900
 Constance Marshall's father is one of the most active Republicans in this state.

00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:12.980
 Is that right?

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:13.980
 I think I'll be going.

00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:16.580
 I know what you're going to do, Henri Otter.

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:18.820
 You're not going to Connie's house at all.

00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:19.580
 But I am.

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:21.020
 Oh no, you weren't.

00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:23.580
 You're really going to some other girl's house.

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:27.580
 I hope whoever she is you have an awful time in.

00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:28.580
 But listen.

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:29.580
 No, I won't.

00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:31.580
 I hate you, Henry Aldrin.

00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:33.580
 Young man, get out of this house.

00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:34.580
 Good Mr. Sam.

00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:36.580
 And don't you ever die from this doorway again.

00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:39.580
 With chocolate spilled with nuts and raisins?

00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:40.580
 Get out of here.

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:41.580
 Yes, ma'am.

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:53.580
 [Music]

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:55.080
 Hello Henry.

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:56.380
 Hi, your Constance.

00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:57.380
 Where are you going?

00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:59.580
 No place just at the grocery store.

00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:02.280
 Henry, all of a sudden, look at your neck time.

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:03.580
 I know it's crooked.

00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:05.880
 I wear my tie like that purposely.

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:07.780
 Please let Constance help you.

00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:08.680
 Not so tight.

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:09.980
 Do you want to strangle me?

00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:11.660
 How do you do, Henry Aldrich?

00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:13.780
 Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Sanderson?

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:15.300
 How do you do, Mrs. Sanderson?

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:16.420
 How do you do, young lady?

00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:17.340
 Where are you going?

00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:18.620
 I'm going to the doctor.

00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:21.180
 Would you like to have me walk along partway with you?

00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:23.140
 Oh, do you have to go now, Henry?

00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:24.740
 Gee, I'm late as it is.

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:26.740
 Tell you what I wish you do, Henry.

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:28.660
 Say right where you are.

00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:29.500
 Here?

00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:30.340
 Yes, sir.

00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:32.220
 Barbara, be along just a minute or so.

00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:33.620
 Wish you tell her where I've gone.

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:35.500
 But my mother's waiting for the groceries.

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:38.020
 Do you want, Barbara, to walk the streets of this town

00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:39.100
 looking for me?

00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:41.300
 I used to stay right here because I'll tell you to.

00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:44.100
 And you young lady, you stay here to see those.

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:45.500
 Oh yes, Mrs. Sander.

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:47.100
 And you tell her if I'm up for doctors,

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:48.300
 I'll be right across the street,

00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:50.300
 and there's getting a bag of candy.

00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:52.300
 Henry, all good, you look at your hair.

00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:53.500
 Listen, Constance.

00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:57.700
 You know, you could be one of the cutest boys I've ever known.

00:10:57.700 --> 00:10:59.000
 Cute?

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.100
 I'm cute.

00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:01.900
 Who?

00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:04.400
 How do you think I'm cute?

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:07.400
 Oh, Henry, you've got the cutest lot of hair right up there.

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:08.600
 What's the matter with it?

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:12.280
 Every time I push it down it goes right up.

00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:13.600
 Oh, look at it.

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:16.920
 Down, up, down, up.

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:18.080
 How do you do?

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:19.920
 Where did you come from, Barbara?

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:20.920
 No, please.

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:23.680
 Your grandmother wanted me to tell you she's gone to the doctors.

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:25.320
 I know where she is.

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:27.880
 Oh, what did she want us to wait here and tell you for?

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:30.200
 I should like to add Henry Aldrich.

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:33.800
 But you are certainly making us spectacles yourself out here in the street.

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:34.680
 I am?

00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:38.160
 No self-respecting person would have his hair combed by a girl

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:42.960
 out in public. Listen Barbara, I'll have you know I'll have my hair comb wherever I want.

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:45.920
 And what George Bigelow said about you is absolutely true.

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:55.680
 What do you say about me? Never mind. He said you. He said I hope from time it tells you what he said.

00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:59.360
 What do you know about that? Gee was anybody think I'd struck her?

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:02.080
 Henry, if I were you, I'd never speak to her again.

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:04.640
 I hope you don't think I'm going to speak to her again.

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:08.640
 Henry, would you like to come over to my house tonight?

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:11.640
 She would. I'd be glad to.

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:14.640
 I'd be glad to. I think it would do me good.

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:30.640
 Before Henry Aldrich comes back, I want to say that if you happen to have an active growing boy in your family,

00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:36.080
 family, I know one thing, I know that you're kept plenty busy feeding that boy, because

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:40.680
 youngsters that age are always hungry, always on the lookout for something good to eat.

00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:46.240
 Well, now here's a dessert that every boy and girl too will say is a real smoothie.

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:48.640
 The new Jello Butterscotch pudding.

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:52.000
 It has a swell tempting color like gold-colored taffy.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.680
 It's smooth and luscious, and it just can't be beat for real flavor.

00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:59.120
 That's rich and delicious as old-fashioned butterscotch candy.

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:03.520
 No butter scotch puddings bring you real downright homemade goodness, and best of all

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:05.320
 it's quick and easy to make.

00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:10.640
 It takes you only a few minutes, there's no fuss or trouble, you just can't go wrong.

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:15.040
 Then try jello chocolate pudding with that wonderful real chocolate goodness smooth and

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:16.520
 satisfying.

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:20.480
 And jello vanilla pudding cream-colored and tempting with nuts or fruits folded in to

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:22.600
 make it even more delicious.

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:27.640
 All three new jello puddings have that homemade richness you love, so try them all.

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:32.640
 Here goes to tomorrow for Jello, butterscotch, chocolate, and vanilla pudding.

00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:39.640
 [Music]

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:43.640
 Back at the Aldrich home we find the whole family seated at the breakfast table.

00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:47.640
 Everyone that is except Henry.

00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:53.640
 Henry! Henry! Henry!

00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:56.040
 Mary, do you know whether Henry's up yet?

00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:58.480
 He said he was getting up the first time he calls.

00:13:58.480 --> 00:13:59.880
 Father!

00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:00.880
 What is it?

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:04.180
 Father, will you please tell Mary that a G.C.

00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:06.800
 Connie Mardle go by to flag her?

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:08.760
 Aren't you all dressed yet, Henry?

00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:10.120
 Practically, Mother.

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:13.600
 My goodness, all Henry can think about is Constance Marshall.

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:16.240
 How is it he never sees Barbara Pearson anymore?

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:18.320
 Her grandmother won't let him near the house.

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:19.880
 What's the trouble?

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:21.600
 I don't know, except she said something

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:24.280
 about his going too far over something.

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:25.840
 And did I tell you about the picture

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:27.560
 I found under Henry's pillow?

00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:29.560
 - Of whom, Barbara's grandmother?

00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:30.900
 - Of Connie Marshall.

00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:32.840
 And down in the corner it said,

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:36.600
 Constance to others, but constantly to Henry,

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:39.120
 does not make you positively ill, mother?

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:40.400
 - Please pass the salt.

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:42.000
 - This whole business is something

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.480
 I shall never understand.

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:44.920
 - Oh, forget it.

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:46.960
 My next week you'll be over the whole thing.

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:48.120
 - Mother!

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:49.400
 - Yes, Henry?

00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:52.840
 Have you any idea where my trousers might be?

00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:54.640
 I thought you were all dressed.

00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:55.880
 I am, Father.

00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:57.760
 All of my trousers.

00:14:57.760 --> 00:14:59.240
 They seem to be missing.

00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:00.920
 Where did you wear them last?

00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:02.960
 I think it was when I went to the movies.

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:05.960
 Don't tell me you like your trousers at the movies.

00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:08.200
 Where your brown trousers, dear?

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:11.320
 My brown trousers are mother-coddies of the light, though.

00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:13.280
 She tells them what clothes to wear.

00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:15.840
 The next thing you know, they'll be announcing their engagement.

00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:17.640
 It may be of interest for you to know

00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:19.720
 that this is not one bit funny.

00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:22.360
 But Mother, I think it would be all right with Constance.

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:23.800
 How do you know?

00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:25.880
 I heard her tell Henry only the other day

00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:27.960
 that she believes in long engagement.

00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:30.240
 Well, this would have to be a good long one

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:33.120
 because Henry still has a year and a half of high school

00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:36.320
 and six years of college before he even begins

00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:37.440
 to practice law.

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:39.680
 She may even talk him out of becoming a lawyer.

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:42.160
 Mary, you certainly are cheerful this morning.

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:44.440
 (phone ringing)

00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:46.600
 Mother, look out through the window.

00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:48.920
 - Look at what I see! - Constance Marshall.

00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:52.040
 - Constance Marshall. - She didn't come here for breakfast now.

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:55.680
 - Well, I selected a very excellent name for that child.

00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:58.320
 - Hello, Mary. - Hello.

00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:00.880
 I wanted whether you'd like to have me walk to school with you.

00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:03.800
 - Come on in, Constance. - I guess you know my father, don't you?

00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:06.760
 - Ha ha ha ha. How do you do? - How do you do?

00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:10.520
 - My goodness, Mr. Old, would you look like Henry? - I.

00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:13.640
 - Only, of course, an awful lot older. - Yes.

00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:16.480
 - Shall we start now, Constance? Has Henry left yet?

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:18.480
 Not yet. Where is he?

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:20.480
 We have no idea where he is.

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:22.480
 You mean Mr. Algaj, Henry is left home?

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:23.480
 Apparently he has.

00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:25.480
 Constance Henry's upstairs.

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:27.480
 We only think he's upstairs.

00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:29.480
 No one in the family has seen him.

00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:32.480
 We have simply heard sounds that might have come from Henry.

00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:35.480
 Henry! Henry!

00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:37.480
 You see? What did I tell you?

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:39.480
 There's somebody calling me!

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:41.480
 There's somebody down here to see you!

00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:42.480
 Who is the mother?

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:43.480
 Somebody!

00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:45.480
 You mean the ring ring?

00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:46.480
 Yes!

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:48.780
 I know, but it is a stinky camera.

00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:49.780
 I stinky!

00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:50.780
 Henry!

00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:53.380
 I'll be down just to sort of like buy my pants!

00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:57.780
 Henry, it's not stinky, and even if it were, I don't think you should call him that!

00:16:57.780 --> 00:16:58.780
 I need that to line!

00:16:58.780 --> 00:16:59.780
 No, you're stinky!

00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:00.780
 Henry!

00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:03.980
 Father, come on up and help me buy my pants!

00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:06.380
 Henry, you're just scraping the entire family!

00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:09.980
 In fact, it might interest you to know that Constance is down here!

00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:10.980
 Yeah?

00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:12.980
 That was General Grant!

00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:13.980
 Hello, Henry!

00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:16.980
 Well do you wait where did you come from Connie?

00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:17.980
 Home?

00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:19.980
 Well why didn't anybody tell me I'll be right down.

00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:21.980
 Henry have you got your trousers on?

00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:24.980
 Oh no I'm glad you spoke about that excuse me.

00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:26.980
 You better be starting Constance.

00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:28.980
 Oh we got loads of time Mary.

00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:30.980
 Not unless you want to be as late as Henry is.

00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:32.980
 Goodbye mother.

00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:33.980
 Goodbye father.

00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:34.980
 Goodbye Mary.

00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:36.980
 Goodbye Mr. Ogman.

00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:37.980
 Goodbye.

00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:40.980
 Charming young woman.

00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:44.220
 Oh my goodness, Sam, I hope you'll get over it.

00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:47.580
 You must remember, however, that someday somebody

00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:49.620
 is going to marry that young woman.

00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:52.700
 But it certainly isn't going to be Henry.

00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:54.700
 It would be just our luck to have it be Henry.

00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:55.940
 Wait for me, Mary.

00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:56.780
 Wait for me.

00:17:56.780 --> 00:17:57.700
 They've left Henry.

00:17:57.700 --> 00:17:58.540
 Say what?

00:17:58.540 --> 00:17:59.380
 Without me?

00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:00.380
 Well, of course.

00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:01.460
 Well, goodbye, everybody.

00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:03.260
 Come back here and eat your breakfast.

00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:06.100
 What, Mother, do you want me to run right on top of a hearty meal?

00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:07.980
 I want you to come back to this table.

00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:09.180
 Where did you find your trousers?

00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:11.060
 That's the strangest part of it.

00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:12.900
 I found them on a chair in my room.

00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:14.380
 - On a chair? - Yeah.

00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:16.940
 - Henry, where did you meet this constant?

00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:18.540
 - I was a fine young store.

00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:20.460
 - Henry, don't you think you should swallow your food

00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:21.700
 before you talk?

00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:22.700
 - That's not it.

00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:25.940
 I learned to end up in the minute, Father.

00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:28.100
 - There, I was assigned next to her.

00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:29.180
 - In what way?

00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:30.180
 - My seat.

00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:31.620
 - My seat in assembly.

00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:32.460
 - Oh, I see.

00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:33.380
 - Why were you asking?

00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:36.660
 - I was just wondering, what does her father do?

00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:37.500
 - In the--

00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:38.660
 - He's a what?

00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:41.740
 Dr. Merritt, he's an exterminator.

00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:42.860
 And exterminator?

00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:44.620
 No matter what you have, even if it's rats,

00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:45.980
 you call him and he'll get rid of him.

00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:47.700
 Henry, that's right, mother.

00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:50.420
 He'll get rid of any kind of pest there is.

00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:53.580
 He has never shown any disfavor toward his daughter.

00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:54.700
 Aren't you like Constance?

00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:57.700
 Henry, in the past, your father and I have always

00:18:57.700 --> 00:19:00.380
 permitted you to know anyone you wanted to.

00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:02.900
 But somehow we don't care for this, Kanye.

00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:03.740
 Why not, mother?

00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:07.300
 Well, putting it bluntly, you're much too nice, father.

00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:12.480
 mother dump the absurd. Until she came along I didn't care how I look. Now look at

00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:16.900
 it. Remember that bunch of hair that that always used to stand up? Now I keep it

00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:20.900
 calm down. And to tell you the truth I miss that lock of hair I miss it very

00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:25.100
 much. You don't think I look improved? Henry dear when are you coming to your

00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:29.500
 sense? And what way mother? Well for one week now you haven't touched your homework

00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:34.900
 you can't eat your meals. I don't need food. Whatever became a barber of pissing.

00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:36.900
 Barbara Pearson.

00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:37.900
 Oh, good.

00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:38.900
 She wouldn't.

00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:41.700
 Well, she was all right when I was young, mother.

00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:44.100
 You grew old seven days ago?

00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:46.500
 I certainly changed since then.

00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:49.100
 In what way, aside from putting Vaseline on your hair?

00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:50.500
 In a lot of ways, father.

00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:54.900
 Well, just remember, son, we wouldn't have you lose your head for anything.

00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:55.900
 Is that clear?

00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:56.900
 Yes, father.

00:19:56.900 --> 00:19:57.900
 Now I run on the school.

00:19:57.900 --> 00:19:58.900
 Yes, sir.

00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:01.900
 Only you've got the wrong idea about Constance.

00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:03.900
 I'm quite sure one of us has.

00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:06.500
 "Goodbye, so long."

00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:10.340
 Sam Aldridge, I'm worried sick.

00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:12.980
 "Alice, you're worrying about something that's absurd."

00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:15.780
 "Sam, I didn't want to say anything about it before.

00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:20.840
 I usually don't read anything that belongs to Henry, but I picked up a note, Constance

00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:23.140
 wrote him, and Sam, she isn't his kind."

00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:25.260
 "Why didn't you tell me there was more to it?"

00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:27.380
 "Well, what I want to know is what we should do."

00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:29.580
 "Give him some cash to Royal and send him to bed."

00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:31.500
 "Well, that's what I thought you'd say.

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:33.420
 I know what I am going to do."

00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:37.140
 I'm going to handle this the way the psychologist say a parent should.

00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:41.420
 Well, if I were you, I wouldn't start fooling around with psychology at a time like this.

00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:46.420
 But it's common sense, Sam. If we forbid it's seeing the girl, it's simply a challenge.

00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:51.020
 So the thing for us to do is to tell him that he may see her just as much as he wants to.

00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:52.820
 Which is what he's doing, anyhow.

00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:54.920
 But we should invite her to dinner, Sam.

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:56.120
 And might I hear to dinner?

00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:59.720
 Well, of course. If he sees enough of her, he'll grow tired of her.

00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:00.920
 You hope he will.

00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:06.920
 I'm sure he will. And on next Saturday night we're having her and some of these other friends here for dinner.

00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:16.920
 [Music]

00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:18.920
 Hi, Connie.

00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:20.920
 Henry. Henry, do you like my dress?

00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:23.920
 Yeah, it's very pretty. I've got to see who's at the door.

00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:26.920
 Oh, I'll let them in. It was George Bigelow and some other girls.

00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:27.920
 Oh.

00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:29.920
 Henry, let Connie straighten your toy.

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:34.920
 You always yank it so tight. The other night I had to go to sleep with it on.

00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:36.920
 Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Aldrin?

00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:37.920
 How do you do, Constance?

00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:39.920
 We're very glad you could come.

00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:40.920
 How do you do?

00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:44.920
 You'll find my family in the living room. Papa has to leave early once.

00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:45.920
 Sorry to hear that.

00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:47.920
 He's got to go on a big job for somebody.

00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:48.920
 You don't sense so.

00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:53.920
 This is the third time he's been there. He just nicely gets the map and they always come back.

00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:55.920
 Then come along.

00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:57.920
 Henry, wait and talk to Connie.

00:21:57.920 --> 00:21:59.560
 You gotta go and see my guests.

00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:01.920
 Are they more important than pulled it alive?

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:03.720
 No, but I ought to go in and say a lot of them.

00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:06.920
 Henry, Henry, look at me.

00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:10.720
 Oh, you've got the bluest eyes Connie has ever seen in her life.

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:11.720
 Yeah?

00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:13.120
 Excuse me, friend Repton.

00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:13.720
 Oh.

00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:14.920
 That's something in your eye, Henry?

00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:15.420
 Huh.

00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:16.920
 She was, Mrs. Sanderson.

00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:17.920
 Hello, Henry.

00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:20.520
 Henry, you didn't tell me Barbara was coming.

00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:21.320
 No.

00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:23.720
 Well, I understood this party was for me.

00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:26.520
 I'm going in the other room and tell your mother what I think of it, Henry.

00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:28.020
 You know that?

00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:30.920
 Henry, I know I shouldn't have come.

00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:32.620
 Even if your mother did say I should.

00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:33.860
 But I'm glad to have you.

00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:35.260
 I'm glad to have both of you.

00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:36.320
 No, I'm not staying.

00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:38.220
 I just can't make sure she got here.

00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:39.060
 Where's your mother?

00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:39.900
 In the next room.

00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:41.660
 I just slipped in, say hello.

00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:44.300
 Whether maybe there's a little candy around.

00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:50.140
 Well, I see Constance has been fixing your tie again.

00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:51.640
 How can you tell?

00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:53.340
 It looks so nice.

00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:54.500
 Doesn't look like you.

00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:55.980
 No.

00:22:55.980 --> 00:22:59.580
 When I came in she was just going to straighten your eyes for you I guess.

00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:00.380
 Wasn't she?

00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:01.780
 Listen Barbara, please.

00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:04.580
 Henry, would you mind very much if I went home?

00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:06.780
 Henry, aren't you going to come in and join your guests?

00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:08.380
 Yes Father, we're coming.

00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:10.780
 George Bigelow says he hasn't even seen you.

00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:11.980
 George Bigelow?

00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:13.780
 Henry, I can't go in there.

00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:14.580
 Why not?

00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:15.980
 Because I can't.

00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:17.380
 Please let me go in.

00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:18.780
 But I want you to stay up.

00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:21.180
 Henry, I've got to tell you.

00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:24.180
 Those telephone calls I had from George.

00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:26.380
 They weren't from Georgia, do you?

00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:28.060
 Well, who were they from?

00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:29.900
 Nobody.

00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:31.900
 I just did it to make him jealous.

00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:33.940
 Was that your grandmother's idea?

00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:35.180
 No.

00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:37.180
 It was mine.

00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:38.180
 Wasn't it ridiculous?

00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:39.460
 Robert, come in here.

00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:41.980
 They got cake with every kind of icing you can think of.

00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:42.740
 No.

00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:44.100
 Henry, your mother wants you.

00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:44.900
 I'll be there.

00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:46.860
 She wants you now, right away.

00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:48.300
 Of a clenchy way to suck.

00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:49.860
 No.

00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:53.340
 Now then, young lady, if you want Henry old Ridge,

00:23:53.340 --> 00:23:55.440
 You will stay here where you can keep an eye on him.

00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:56.520
 I'm not gonna stay.

00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:58.640
 You want to upset me more than I already am?

00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:00.480
 I can't help but I'm going home.

00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:01.960
 Well, wait, no.

00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:03.240
 Well, you've got to come in, dear.

00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:05.380
 It wouldn't be a party without you.

00:24:05.380 --> 00:24:06.280
 Why not?

00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:09.920
 Or any number of reason?

00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:11.360
 Well, look at my eyes.

00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:12.440
 They're a sight.

00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:14.480
 Here is my dear only make you prettier.

00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:16.520
 I know from experience.

00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:18.360
 Do you really think so?

00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:20.940
 (somber music)

00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:49.940
 I've been thinking about that party. I knew that I didn't understand psychology. I didn't say that. I said that you were taking a gamble. Just think we won't have to worry about that awful constant marshal or the idea of Henry's ever giving up law.

00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:53.020
 giving up law or getting engaged before he leaves high school.

00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:56.180
 - Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, usually work out for this.

00:24:56.180 --> 00:25:00.340
 - Mm, provided you give him a little assistance.

00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:02.180
 By the way, have you heard Henry come in yet?

00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:03.620
 - No, believe I have.

00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:05.740
 - Oh, my goodness, what time is it?

00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:10.740
 - It's by the clock on the bureau at 10 minutes to two.

00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:12.980
 - Sam Oldridge Henry has never stayed out

00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:14.380
 this late before in his life.

00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:17.020
 - I thought you weren't going to worry anymore.

00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:19.820
 - Oh, Henry, is that you?

00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:21.220
 Where have you been, Henry?

00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:22.020
 No place.

00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:26.120
 I just walked home with Barbara, and then I had to wait until her grandmother went to bed.

00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:28.220
 Come in here and say good night to us.

00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:30.720
 I want to thank you for the swell party.

00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:32.720
 Barbara said she had a very nice time.

00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:35.520
 He'd sit down here on the edge of the bed.

00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:37.720
 Henry, you're sitting right on my ankle.

00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:38.820
 I'm sorry, Father.

00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:40.320
 I didn't know it was there.

00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:41.920
 Where did you think it would be?

00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:44.820
 Henry, move your head over toward the light from the door.

00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:45.620
 What for?

00:25:45.620 --> 00:25:48.020
 Well, Henry, I could almost cry.

00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:48.720
 Why?

00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:52.820
 That old lock of hair, it's standing straight up again.

00:25:52.820 --> 00:25:54.000
 Yeah.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:57.960
 She lets me wear my necktie so I can breathe too.

00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:02.440
 Mother, would you mind my asking right from the shoulder?

00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:03.480
 What, dear?

00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:08.520
 Well, would you and Father be disappointed if I didn't

00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:10.720
 study six years to become a lawyer?

00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:12.320
 Why not?

00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:14.400
 No particular reason, Father.

00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:15.200
 Just asking.

00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:18.120
 Henry, old Richard, aren't thinking of getting married, are you?

00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:23.120
 No mother, no. We think you should wait until you're at least through high school, don't you?

00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:27.120
 Well, Alice, you certainly understand psychology.

00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:34.120
 [music]

00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:39.120
 Well, ladies and gentlemen, once there was a husband who was very fussy about his desserts.

00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:43.120
 He liked puddings, but only the kind of puddings that his wife made for him.

00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:47.080
 Well, of course, it's a lot of work to make good puddings, so this man's wife decided

00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:48.760
 to play a little trick on him.

00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:49.760
 What happened?

00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:53.200
 Well, the wife who wrote us about this is right here in person.

00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:58.080
 Mrs. Florence C., who lives at 25 Hillside Avenue, Washington Heights, New York City.

00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:01.440
 Here's your letter, Mrs. C. Would you read us the rest of what you wrote, please?

00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:03.240
 Certainly, Mr. Varnzel.

00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:05.760
 I've decided to try a jello chocolate pudding.

00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:11.200
 It only took me a few minutes to risk it up, and when supper time came, there it was.

00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:14.600
 a big bowl full of rich creamy smooth chocolate pudding.

00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:17.600
 Well, my husband came right back for the second helping.

00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:20.640
 Said it was the most delicious pudding I had ever made.

00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:23.080
 So then I told him about it,

00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:26.760
 told him that I had used the new jello chocolate pudding.

00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:29.440
 He had to admit it surely was a success.

00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:32.240
 Every bit as delicious as the old-fashioned kind.

00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:34.000
 - Well, thank you very much, Mr. C.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:35.600
 And ladies, that is the way to make a hit

00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:37.040
 with your husband too.

00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:39.520
 For the new jello puddings have that real old-fashioned

00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:40.360
 goodness.

00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:42.960
 creamy, smooth, full-flavored and tempting,

00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:45.480
 but they're far quicker and easier to make.

00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:48.200
 There are three delicious yellow puddings to choose from.

00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:50.760
 Rich chocolate, mellow butter scotch,

00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:52.880
 and creamy, delicate vanilla.

00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:55.480
 Yes, you like all three new jello puddings.

00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:58.920
 Real old-fashioned puddings made a new-fashioned way.

00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:00.280
 So try them tomorrow.

00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:02.860
 (upbeat music)

00:28:02.860 --> 00:28:08.760
 Barbara.

00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:09.680
 - Yes, Henry.

00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:12.280
 Are you sure your grandmother's going to bed?

00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:13.480
 Thanks, Heaven.

00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:14.480
 She has.

00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:17.480
 Well, uh, do you mind my asking you something?

00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:18.480
 What is it, Henry?

00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:21.680
 What would, uh, would you like to go to a football game with me Saturday?

00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:24.280
 Of course I would, Henry.

00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:29.080
 If you go, Henry, I give you the money to get a seat for me.

00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:33.680
 Well, Grandma's in again, but be sure to tune in again next week for further adventures

00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:35.080
 of Henry Aldrich.

00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:38.680
 The Aldrich family, starring as with Stone, is written by Clifford Goldsmith.

00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:42.320
 night's special guest was Betty Fields, star of the stage in screenplay, What A Life,

00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:45.280
 and she'll be back with us again next week.

00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:47.880
 Original music is composed and conducted by Jack Miller.

00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:51.640
 Eriff Anzel speaking and wishing you good night for those delicious new desserts all

00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:53.360
 America's talking about.

00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:54.880
 Jello or pudding.

00:28:54.880 --> 00:29:01.880
 This is the National Broadcasting Company.
