 Ladies and gentlemen, what is the best way to find out how really good Jello Butterscotch pudding is?

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 Well, now it's not to have somebody tell you about it, because words just can't give you the full idea.

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 Know the way to find out is to try a golden dish of jello butterscotch pudding for yourself.

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 And then I think you'll agree that a spoon in the hand is worth a hundred adjectives.

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 Jello butterscotch pudding friends is a ready prepared pudding that takes only about five brief minutes to make.

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 Yet it tastes every bit as delicious, every bit as homemade as if you had gone to all the trouble of making it yourself.

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 Of all the butterscotch puddings you ever tasted, we believe that you'll find Jello butterscotch pudding the most satisfied.

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 a grand pudding with a grand flavor, the rich buttery brown sugar flavor of mellow butter scotch.

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 So try jello butter scotch pudding for yourself.

16
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 One taste is all you need to tell you why jello butter scotch pudding is the dessert that thousands call the best of all.

 The Aldrich family who live in the comfortable house at 117 Elm Street in Centerville, USA

19
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 are friends and neighbors of yours.

20
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,600
 All rich and his wife Alice are real parents and there never was a more typical American boy than their teenage son Henry

21
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:18,120
 Well now it is evening and as we join the Aldrich's in their living room

22
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,120
 Just see if you don't recognize Henry Aldrich as a boy from your bluff

23
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,640
 Then yes, Alice

24
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:28,280
 How steam chilly to you and ran

25
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,120
 and ran

26
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,880
 Yes, father. Have you put any coal on the furnace and

27
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,840
 In just a minute, Father.

28
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,840
 You were pleased to put it on now.

29
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,540
 Perhaps he isn't through looking at the funny paper, Sam.

30
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:45,540
 Henry never does anything until he's told three times.

31
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,540
 But, dear, he's in school all day.

32
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:50,440
 When I was a boy, I had a few responsibilities.

33
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,340
 In fact, I had a great many responsibilities.

34
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:56,340
 Yes, dear. But remember, you grew up in another generation.

35
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:57,140
 Henry!

36
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:59,640
 Yes, Father, I'm coming right now.

37
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,840
 Do you realize your mother is cold?

38
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,640
 Mother, which would you rather I do?

39
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,640
 put some coal on or bring you your sweater.

40
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,640
 Henry, why can't you do what your father asked you to?

41
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:13,640
 I'm perfectly willing to. I just like to save all the coal I can.

42
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:16,640
 Henry, I'm starting right now, Father.

43
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,640
 Just one moment, please.

44
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,640
 You want to speak to I, Father?

45
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,640
 No, sir. I want to speak to you.

46
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,640
 Yes, sir. That's what I'm referring to.

47
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,640
 Sit down a minute.

48
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,640
 Yes, Father.

49
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,640
 Do you know what I used to do when I was your age?

50
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,640
 No, sir.

51
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,440
 Believe it or not, I used to get up at six o'clock every morning.

52
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,320
 And after helping my father milk the cows,

53
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:39,760
 I walked three miles to school, sometimes

54
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,640
 through four feet of snow.

55
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,480
 - How's that for?

56
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,960
 - Now Sam.

57
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,880
 - Well, we had four feet one morning, Alice.

58
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,400
 And when I came home from school, Henry,

59
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,200
 I went down to the village and did odd jobs.

60
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,680
 - Yes, father, but didn't your folks give you any money?

61
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,720
 - Not a cent.

62
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,760
 And at the end of my four years in high school,

63
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,880
 do you know how much I had in the bank?

64
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,520
 Thirty-five dollars.

65
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,160
 Is that all?

66
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,680
 What do you mean is that all?

67
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,200
 It was drawing six percent interest.

68
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,880
 Yes, Father, but nowadays a bank doesn't pay six percent.

69
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,360
 The great reward for saving my boys.

70
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,400
 Alice, where are you going?

71
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,160
 Out in the hall to get a sweater.

72
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:14,840
 Yes.

73
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,640
 And Henry, right there is a very good example of what I'm driving at.

74
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,920
 Yes, Father, I'll go right down and fix the furnace.

75
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,080
 And in the future will you try to do things without having to be told?

76
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,360
 Oh, yes, Father.

77
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:28,120
 This talk has done me a great deal of good already.

78
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,380
 Well, I'm pleased to hear that.

79
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:33,780
 As a matter of fact, I think I have an idea that'll please you very much.

80
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:34,980
 What is the idea?

81
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,980
 Oh, you'll see.

82
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:40,940
 From now on, you're gonna find a big change in me.

83
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:41,980
 What's that noise?

84
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:44,460
 See, I guess that must be Mother's shoveling coal.

85
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,860
 Wait, Mother! I'm coming right down!

86
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:50,860

00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:56,860

89
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:05,860
 Toby, do you know what time it is?

90
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:08,860
 We've got lots of time, Henry. We're only two blocks from school.

91
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:10,860
 Did I tell you about my idea, Toby?

92
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:11,860
 What idea?

93
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:13,860
 I'm taking care of furnaces.

94
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:14,860
 Who's, Henry?

95
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:15,860
 Everybody's.

96
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:20,860
 I think that when a person reaches our age, they ought to begin to assume a few responsibilities.

97
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,860
 Don't you, Toby?

98
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,860
 How much money is there in it?

99
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:26,860
 Oh boy, I hate to think of it.

100
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,860
 I've been calling up customers all morning.

101
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:29,860
 How many do you have?

102
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:32,860
 Well, so far I don't actually have any.

103
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,860
 But that's just a coincidence.

104
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:40,860
 It just happened that most of the people I've called so far don't need to have anyone assume their responsibilities.

105
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:41,860
 Yeah?

106
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:45,820
 Well, I understand Willie Marshall makes a lot of money taking care of furnaces.

107
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:46,500
 He does.

108
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,340
 Sure.

109
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:49,140
 Could I go into business with you, Henry?

110
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,540
 Oh, no, Toby.

111
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:53,860
 You assume your responsibilities, and I'll assume mine.

112
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:56,540
 But, Henry, we could make twice as much.

113
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:57,460
 You think so?

114
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:00,940
 If we could get a few families like the Vance Givers and the Peckin Paws.

115
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:01,620
 Sure.

116
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,020
 They've got money.

117
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:06,140
 The only thing is, I think Willie Marshall already takes care of them.

118
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:06,900
 He does.

119
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:07,620
 Sure.

120
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:11,180
 And I heard that every time there's a holiday, he gets a little extra from them.

121
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:14,440
 Is that right? You know, I'd like to take care of the peck and pause.

122
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,740
 Gee, my father takes care of all of Mr. Peck and pause legal matters.

123
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:19,740
 It'd be nice if I could take care of his heating.

124
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,740
 [audience laughter]

125
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:25,340
 Sure. Sure, then it would be a complete all-round service.

126
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:29,540
 Henry, don't look now. But isn't that willy across the street?

127
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:33,020
 Where? Hey, you've powered, wait a second. Come on over, Willy.

128
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:35,640
 Am I tired? What's the matter with you?

129
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:38,660
 I got up at half past five this morning to ten my furnaces.

130
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:40,220
 What are you eating, Willie?

131
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:42,000
 Fudge and peanuts.

132
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,700
 Fudge and peanuts?

133
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:46,060
 It's my breakfast.

134
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,440
 That's all you're gonna eat?

135
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,340
 Candy and peanuts are all by ever eat.

136
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:50,180
 For any meal?

137
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:54,620
 Sure. Fudge for breakfast, peanut for lunch, chocolate for dinner.

138
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:56,820
 Gee, Toby, do you hear that?

139
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:59,660
 He makes so much money, all he ever eats is candy.

140
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:01,360
 Hold this bag a minute, Henry.

141
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,060
 What for?

142
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:04,060
 I won't open a piece of bubble gum.

143
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:06,060
 [LAUGHTER]

144
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:11,260
 Willie, you wouldn't like to get rid of one or two of your customers, would you?

145
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:12,220
 Why should I?

146
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:13,900
 Didn't you just say you were tired?

147
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,340
 Not that tired.

148
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:17,180
 Willie, take some of your customers.

149
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:20,700
 Sooner or later they'll be putting in oil burners and then where will you be?

150
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:21,980
 How about it, Willie?

151
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:24,460
 Well, where will our vector scum started?

152
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:27,820
 Willie, while you're starting your gum, let me suggest something.

153
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:32,620
 How would you like to have me give you two dollars for a couple of your customers?

154
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:35,820
 I'll buy the peck and paws and the van skivers from you.

155
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:36,900
 Three dollars, Henry.

156
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:37,580
 Two, Willie.

157
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:38,080
 Three.

158
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,820
 But Willie, all I've got is two dollars.

159
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:42,140
 My mother gave me to buy lunches with for next month.

160
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:43,100
 I don't want it.

161
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,060
 But Willie, with two dollars, you still

162
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,540
 wouldn't have to go back on to regular food right away.

163
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:48,940
 Oh, I tell you no.

164
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:51,100
 Willie, I don't like to say this,

165
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,980
 but if you don't want to sell, I

166
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:56,380
 happen to be in a very unfortunate position for you.

167
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:57,340
 Oh, Henry.

168
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:01,540
 Well, my father happens by chance to be Mr. Peckinpaw's lawyer.

169
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:03,020
 And you know what that means.

170
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,380
 Yeah, sure.

171
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:08,380
 And Henry, isn't your father Mr. Vance Skyver's lawyer too?

172
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:10,880
 Yeah, come to think of it, I think he is.

173
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,880
 Willie, what chance have you got?

174
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,680
 Let's see the two dollars.

175
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,680
 Here you are.

176
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,680
 Okay, you want to buy my shovel for 50 cents extra?

177
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,380
 Well, we need it, you think?

178
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:22,180
 Sure. You can pay me any time.

179
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:23,180
 That's fair enough.

180
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:25,180
 How about my overall for 25 cents?

181
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,380
 You're overall?

182
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:29,180
 Henry, you can't buy overalls for any less than that.

183
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:29,880
 Okay.

184
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,580
 And is there anything else you fellas need?

185
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:32,080
 No.

186
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,580
 I got a necktie at home, I tell you.

187
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:36,940
 No, Willie. Willie, what's the necktie like?

188
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:38,380
 It's red, so...

189
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:40,620
 Hey fellas, wait for me!

190
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,740
 Hello, Agnes.

191
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:42,780
 Wait, where you are?

192
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:45,180
 Toby and I've got a hurry on so long, Willie.

193
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:48,300
 Henry, let's go over to the candy store and open a chart.

194
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,300
 Hey, what's been going on, Willie?

195
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:54,220
 I just sold them the peck and paws of the van Skyver's furnaces to take care of.

196
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:54,860
 Yeah?

197
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:57,500
 Yeah. I wonder if they'll be mad.

198
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,140
 Why?

199
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:00,860
 Well, the van Skyver just had an oil burner put in.

200
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:01,900
 Oh.

201
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,260
 Would that make a difference?

202
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:04,620
 In a way, it would.

203
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:07,260
 Yesterday, the peckenpaw left for Florida.

204
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:10,260
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

205
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:27,100
 Toby, are you sure this is where the peckenpaws live?

206
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,140
 Sure, Henry.

207
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:31,340
 Do you suppose we're going to have to get up this early every morning?

208
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:32,940
 Gee, but it's dark.

209
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:37,780
 Wouldn't you think somebody would be willing to get up and let us in?

210
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:40,640
 I wonder whether we really ought to wake up the peckin' paws.

211
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,740
 You mean we've gotta wait until they get up?

212
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:45,340
 Well, they certainly expect us to be quiet, don't they?

213
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:47,640
 Let's go around and try the cellar door.

214
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,340
 Okay, come on, Toby.

215
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:50,140
 Can you see?

216
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:50,940
 Sure.

217
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:53,940
 Have a piece of candy, Toby?

218
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,340
 I don't mind if I do.

219
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:58,040
 Which bag do you want some out of?

220
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,840
 Well, let's try the one that's in your left pocket.

221
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,840
 Toby, isn't this the cellar door?

222
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,300
 Can you open it?

223
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,400
 No.

224
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,800
 Push you little Henry.

225
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,800
 What are you doing?

226
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,800
 Think I'm doing.

227
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,040
 Well, Gee, Henry, we've got to get into that furnace.

228
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:16,980
 Since what I say we can't shirk our responsibility the first day we begin here, I'll push with you.

229
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:17,480
 Come on.

230
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:23,620
 Oh, Gee, what is it?

231
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:25,520
 Imagine, Henry.

232
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,520
 The whole lot came right off.

233
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,920
 I guess the door was rotten.

234
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:34,920
 Boy is it dark down here.

235
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:35,920
 Wait a minute.

236
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,920
 What's the matter?

237
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,920
 I walked into a cobweb.

238
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,920
 You've got to get used to going into cellars like this, Toby.

239
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:43,920
 Oh sure.

240
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,920
 What's the matter?

241
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:50,920
 I found the boiler.

242
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:51,920
 Yeah?

243
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:52,920
 Where?

244
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:53,920
 Right over my head.

245
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,920
 Well at least we know where it is.

246
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:57,920
 Ouch!

247
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:58,920
 What's that?

248
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,920
 Well, gee whiz Toby, I just...

249
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,920
 (screams)

250
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,920
 Listen, Henry, do you want to wake everyone up?

251
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,920
 Here's the furnace.

252
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,920
 Toby, there isn't any fire in it.

253
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,920
 You mean they let it go out?

254
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,920
 Imagine, boy, it's a good thing we got in here before they woke up.

255
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,920
 Do you suppose there's any kindling?

256
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,920
 If you find a light, turn it on.

257
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,920
 Same to you.

258
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,920
 Here's a box, Henry. Good, can you break it up?

259
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,920
 I guess so. There are a lot of papers in it.

260
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,920
 We've got everything.

261
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:32,680
 You know, Toby, it won't be any time until we have it so hot upstairs, Mr. and Mrs. Peck

262
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,920
 and Paul be hanging out the window.

263
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:35,920
 Sure.

264
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,320
 When they hear about all this extra trouble we've been to, they'll make us take something

265
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,320
 extra.

266
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,320
 Here we go, Toby.

267
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,920
 I'm going to touch the match to it.

268
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:50,920
 Oh boy, look at that.

269
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:55,120
 Imagine, we may get as much as a dollar just for striking that one match.

270
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,120
 Ever have an easier job Henry?

271
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,320
 I'll say I have a...

272
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,120
 Oh gee, there goes the candy all to the floor.

273
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,120
 Why worry about 10 or 15 cents worth of candy?

274
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,620
 That's what I say.

275
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:07,620
 Here I'll throw it in the fire.

276
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:10,620
 Boy, look at it.

277
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:16,120
 I never thought I'd be in a position where I could just stand back and watch Candy burn.

278
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,120
 Hi there!

279
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,620
 See who's that in the doorway?

280
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:19,620
 Me.

281
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:20,620
 Is it Mr. Packenpaw?

282
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:22,620
 No, it's the milkman.

283
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:25,740
 I was just going by and I seen smoke starting out of the chimney.

284
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,260
 Are the pecking paws back?

285
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:29,740
 Back? They're upstairs in bed.

286
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:32,380
 They are? I thought they went to Florida.

287
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:35,620
 Oh, Gee, now we've been engaged to take care of their furnace.

288
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:38,620
 Well, look, how much milk do you suppose I ought to leave?

289
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,260
 Toby, how much would you think?

290
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:44,420
 I don't know. Why not they a regular amount? That's what I would say.

291
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:47,620
 Okay, I'll leave six ports of milk and one a cream.

292
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:48,420
 Yes, sir.

293
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:51,220
 I better tell the Fred man in the newsboy if I see him.

294
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,220
 Yes, sir.

295
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:55,220
 Henry, let's start shoveling.

296
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:57,220
 You know, Toby, my father was right.

297
00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:02,220
 If you have a job to do when you do it, it makes you feel swell.

298
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:06,220
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

299
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:26,220
 And now folks, let's leave Henry and Toby for a moment and turn our attention to one

300
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:29,220
 of the big topics of the day, football.

301
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:33,300
 Each year you know football experts select the country's outstanding players and honor

302
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,340
 them as the All-American football team.

303
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:40,260
 Well, with this All-American idea in mind, we recently decided to do the same thing in

304
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:42,020
 the field of desserts.

305
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:46,540
 So we ask a number of football fans what they would give as their choice for the All-American

306
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:48,020
 dessert.

307
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:50,220
 And here is the way these football fans reply.

308
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:52,220
 Pomerac, Pomerac, Pomerac, Pomerac, row!

309
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:54,220
 Wiggle wiggle wiggle wiggle wag, a zigga zagga zow!

310
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:56,220
 Pomerac, a wiggle wagga zigga zagga zow!

311
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:57,220
 Jell-a-dell, put it!

312
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:58,220
 R-rah, r-rah, r-rah!

313
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:03,220
 Uh, the English translation, "We like Jell-o the milliputting."

314
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:09,220
 And that, ladies and gentlemen, is a sentiment that's being echoed around more and more family dinner tables every day.

315
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:15,220
 Yes, sir, Jell-o the milliputting is winning new friends by the thousands for its tempting appearance,

316
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:19,220
 for its tender, creamy goodness, and for its rich, satisfying taste.

317
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:25,780
 taste. So why not let your family enjoy it too? Serve this easy, ready prepared pudding tomorrow night

318
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:30,420
 with sliced bananas or whatever fruits or nuts you may have handy. Take it from me folks,

319
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:33,860
 Delo Vanilla Pudding is a treat you'll soon repeat.

320
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:53,060
 Now getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldrich, Henry and Toby bought a furnace route from Willie Marshall.

321
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:57,060
 Without realizing that the first customer he sold them at John de Florida,

322
00:14:57,060 --> 00:15:01,060
 the boys managed to get him to the basement and build a fire in the furnace.

323
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:05,060
 The scene opens the same morning in the Aldrich dining room.

324
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:07,060
 Sam!

325
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:08,060
 Yes, Alice?

326
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:09,060
 Come in here and eat your breakfast.

327
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,060
 Henry, how'd he is?

328
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:12,060
 He's upstairs washing.

329
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:15,060
 You know Alice, it seems to me there's already been a great change in Henry.

330
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:19,900
 in Henry. There has do you. He came in so covered with ashes that I didn't even know him.

331
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:25,900
 Mother. Yes, Henry. I'll sweep out the bathroom just as soon as I finish breakfast.

332
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:30,100
 What's happened to the bathroom? Nothing, Father. I just changed my clothes in it.

333
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:35,540
 Here's the morning mail for you. Oh, thank you. Henry, what in the world

334
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:39,420
 happened to you this morning? Mother, I bought out a furnace tending business from

335
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:44,540
 a guy yesterday. See, are you listening, Father? Alice, who do you suppose sent this

336
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:46,460
 - A letter from Florida. - From Florida?

337
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:48,100
 - Father, now may I proceed.

338
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:51,940
 - Well, the pecan paws seem to be having a wonderful time.

339
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:53,460
 - Well, that's nice, dear.

340
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:55,260
 I envy them, poise.

341
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:57,780
 - The pecan paws, I have a letter from them.

342
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:59,220
 - A letter from the pecan paws?

343
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:00,900
 (audience laughing)

344
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,900
 Saying they're having a wonderful time?

345
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,780
 - What's so strange about that?

346
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:06,540
 - Why didn't they just follow and tell you?

347
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,700
 - They're neither in Florida.

348
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:09,780
 - They're in Florida?

349
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:10,620
 - Yeah.

350
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:11,900
 (audience laughing)

351
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:14,020
 - Well, what'd they go down there for?

352
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:16,220
 I suppose because it's nice and warm.

353
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:20,020
 Yes, they always did find their house in Centerville hard to heat.

354
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:24,220
 Well, if you'll excuse me, I don't think I'll eat anymore.

355
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:24,820
 Henry?

356
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:25,620
 Where are you going?

357
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:29,820
 Oh, just over an attempt to something I think would be a good idea to attend to.

358
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:34,420
 Sam, I hope Henry isn't going to work as hard as this every day.

359
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:37,220
 Best thing in the world for him to work on Saturday.

360
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:40,020
 If that can pause, let her goes on to say,

361
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:44,820
 Due to our haste in getting away, we overlooked a rather important item.

362
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:48,940
 At the foot of our cellar stairs, we left a box of manuscripts which we would like to

363
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:51,740
 have covered and shipped by express at once.

364
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:53,180
 What else does he say?

365
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:57,580
 Please ask whoever does the job not to litter the basement, as Mrs. Peckinford just had it

366
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,860
 thoroughly clean.

367
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:04,860
 I'll drive around and get the box on my way to the office.

368
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:17,860
 [Music]

369
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:19,860
 Now let me try to shake it Toby.

370
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:21,860
 Henry don't you think I can shake a furnace?

371
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:24,860
 [Coughing]

372
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:26,860
 No.

373
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:29,860
 The whole trouble is there's a clinker stuck.

374
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:32,860
 Of course Toby, but you're just filling the basement up with smoke.

375
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:33,860
 Here.

376
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:39,580
 Well, what do you know about that?

377
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:41,980
 Henry, I still don't understand it.

378
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:44,140
 Are you sure the pecking paws aren't here?

379
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:47,380
 Didn't I tell you I saw Mr. pecking paws' letter?

380
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:50,220
 Stand back while I show up with this long poker ring.

381
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,700
 Imagine that.

382
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:53,700
 What's the matter?

383
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:57,860
 Toby, can you hold up this piece of furnace pipe right over your head?

384
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:58,860
 Why, Henry?

385
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:01,060
 It seemed to come apart when I just hit it.

386
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:02,660
 Well, that pipe's hot, Henry.

387
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:04,660
 I'll hold it up with this stick here.

388
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:07,660
 Hey, look at the smoke leak out.

389
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:10,660
 I'll take care of the smoke. You get to work on the clinker.

390
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:13,660
 I am, Toby. I am.

391
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:19,660
 Wouldn't you have thought that the pecking paws would at least put up a sign saying go on to Florida? No fires, please?

392
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:22,660
 Imagine Willie selling them to you.

393
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:24,660
 You wait until we get Willie.

394
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:29,660
 Henry, do you realize I'm holding this pipe while you just stand there and call?

395
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:32,260
 Now the poker's stuck in the grate.

396
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:35,460
 Well look Henry, I don't think we're getting anyplace.

397
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,660
 So we take that pipe down for a minute.

398
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:38,660
 All the way?

399
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:43,260
 Sure, let's fix one thing at a time here.

400
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:46,160
 Now look at the smoke come out.

401
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,660
 That's only until we get it fixed.

402
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:50,160
 I'll pull on the poker while you shake.

403
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,660
 When I say three, yank Henry.

404
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:55,660
 One, two, three, yank.

405
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:57,660
 [coughing]

406
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:02,660
 Did we get it out, Toby?

407
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:04,660
 I think we got the whole grade out.

408
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:09,660
 Oh, is that what dropped down?

409
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:14,660
 We've got to do something about these hot coals that have rolled out on the floor, Henry.

410
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:17,660
 Well, at least the smoke has stopped coming out of the pipe.

411
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:20,660
 And nobody can say we aren't responsible.

412
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:23,660
 Listen, Toby, what's that?

413
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:24,660
 What, Henry?

414
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:27,260
 She was at somebody walking upstairs.

415
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:29,260
 Do you suppose the peck and paws are home?

416
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:30,260
 They couldn't be.

417
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:31,660
 Do you know what I think, Henry?

418
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:32,660
 What?

419
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:35,160
 Only Mr. Peck and paws away in the rest are here.

420
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,660
 She was. This is a nice time to find that out.

421
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:39,660
 Henry, we've got to get the fire back in.

422
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,660
 How?

423
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:45,660
 How at where part of the great is still hanging?

424
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:46,660
 Okay.

425
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:49,660
 We'll shovel real quietly.

426
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:53,660
 Quiet, Henry.

427
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:54,660
 Henry.

428
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:59,500
 You think he can match too loud?

429
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:02,540
 Well I can hear it, but then I'm right here.

430
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:08,700
 Sure, and you know what I'm doing.

431
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,260
 What do you suppose that can be?

432
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:12,740
 There must be a fire someplace.

433
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:14,420
 I wonder where they're going.

434
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:17,220
 Come on Toby, let's go out in front and see which way they're headed.

435
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,220
 That's what I say.

436
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:20,220
 Here hold the door open.

437
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:23,020
 There's one thing I like, it's a good fire.

438
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:24,020
 Toby!

439
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:26,520
 Toby, look, the engines are stopping right out in front!

440
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,220
 And they are unloading their hulls!

441
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:30,020
 Toby, I think we better be leaving!

442
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:33,020
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

443
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:49,220
 Toby, about what time do you think it is?

444
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:51,860
 Must be darn near time for dinner.

445
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:54,100
 Will your folks give you the juice when you get home?

446
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:57,140
 I'm gonna perfectly good excuse, Toby.

447
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:59,020
 If they ask where I was today,

448
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:01,740
 I can say I was way out in the country.

449
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:04,100
 Sure, that's because that's where we are.

450
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,860
 Sure, that's what I mean.

451
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:09,900
 Here, have a piece of candy.

452
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,420
 No, thanks.

453
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:13,420
 I'm not hungry either.

454
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:15,740
 I told you when you made Willie give back your money,

455
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:18,060
 you shouldn't spend the whole business on candy.

456
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:21,060
 She was, you bought enough to nearly fill this barn.

457
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:23,900
 Well, first few pounds tasted good, didn't they?

458
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:27,020
 What's that, Henry?

459
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:29,380
 That's just Willy's trying to get out again.

460
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:32,900
 Hey, shut up, Willy!

461
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,060
 Let me off here!

462
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,540
 Go chase yourself, Willy.

463
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:37,860
 We aren't gonna let you out until you promise.

464
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:38,780
 Promise what?

465
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:40,060
 Are you gonna tell our folks

466
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:42,740
 that we were the cause of those fire engines coming out?

467
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:44,420
 Are you gonna give me back my $2?

468
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:46,260
 Back along to Henry, Willy.

469
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:48,660
 And besides, we've eaten your $2.

470
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:49,580
 (laughing)

471
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:52,040
 Well, you're not gonna make me promise not to squeal.

472
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,200
 All right, then you can stay in there.

473
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,640
 That's what I say.

474
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,020
 Come on, Toby.

475
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:59,480
 I guess we'll go back to Centerville.

476
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,680
 Do you mean that, Henry?

477
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,380
 No, we'll just let him think it.

478
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:05,080
 But Henry's supposing we have to keep him here all night.

479
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:08,120
 Toby, don't you realize what'll happen if he tells?

480
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,120
 They carried every piece of furniture

481
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,400
 out of Peck and Paws House

482
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,560
 and then had to carry it all back in again.

483
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,840
 (audience laughing)

484
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:17,520
 Do you want your father to know you were mixed up in it?

485
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,920
 Well, let's go back and force Willie to promise.

486
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,520
 Okay, but let me do the talking.

487
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,800
 Oh, Willie.

488
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:28,880
 Willie, we've got a little proposition to put up to you.

489
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:33,080
 All right, Willie, if you don't want any of this candy.

490
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,280
 Listen, Willie.

491
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:37,280
 Willie, stop sulking.

492
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,440
 Henry, look through the crock here.

493
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,280
 What do you say?

494
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:42,520
 Gee whiz, open the door.

495
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,320
 Toby, Toby, he's gone.

496
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,360
 You mean he's escaped?

497
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,560
 He's probably on his way to my house right now.

498
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,520
 Oh boy.

499
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,040
 Yeah?

500
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,400
 Maybe he's on his way to mine.

501
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,960
 Come on, we've got to beat him back home.

502
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,440
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

503
00:22:54,440 --> 00:23:08,680
 Well, Sam, do you still think you were right?

504
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,520
 About what?

505
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,800
 You said that from now on, we'd see a big change in Henry.

506
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,000
 Well, he didn't come home for lunch,

507
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,280
 and here it is, time for dinner.

508
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,080
 All in all, Alice, this has been a very pleasant day.

509
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,920
 I still can't get over it.

510
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,920
 And when do you suppose I will?

511
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:24,600
 To make the thing doubly embarrassing, Alice.

512
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,520
 When I saw smoke pouring out of the house,

513
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:29,000
 I had to be the one who turned in the alarm.

514
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,440
 But there wasn't any fire at all?

515
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,160
 Only in the furnace.

516
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,760
 But it took nearly all the rest of the day

517
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,920
 getting the place straightened up again.

518
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:38,400
 And those two tramps the firemen saw running away

519
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,320
 from the house had been living in the basement.

520
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,000
 Not really, Sam.

521
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,480
 That's what they'd been doing.

522
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,080
 That's why they built a fire in the furnace

523
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:49,420
 to keep warm. Why, Alice, they were even having their milk and bread delivered there.

524
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:51,420
 Oh, my goodness!

525
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:56,260
 We even found today's paper there. And what was left of a bag of marshmallows?

526
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:59,060
 What on earth have they been doing with marshmallows?

527
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:05,860
 Probably toasting them. And the box, Alice. The box of manuscripts that Peck and Paul wanted me to express to.

528
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:06,660
 Were they gone?

529
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:11,140
 Probably they had been burned. Burn, mind you. And nobody knows how valuable they were.

530
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:12,180
 Well, what are you going to do?

531
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:16,180
 I don't know. I wired Peckinpaw. Who's that?

532
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:18,180
 Is everybody all right?

533
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:20,180
 Is that you, Henry?

534
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:23,180
 Yes, Mother. I hope I haven't kept your dinner waiting.

535
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:25,180
 And will you please come in here?

536
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:27,180
 Has anything happened while I was away?

537
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:28,180
 Happened?

538
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:32,180
 I mean, there hasn't been anybody here at the house to see you, has there?

539
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:35,180
 Oh, for instance. Well, anybody.

540
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:38,180
 You know, I just wondered whether any one of the fellas I know had dropped in.

541
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:39,180
 No, Henry.

542
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:42,180
 - Oh, well, I'm glad I didn't miss anyone then.

543
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:44,180
 - Henry, where have you been all day?

544
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:48,180
 - Oh, well, tell me and I just took a walk outside town

545
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:50,180
 to look at the countryside.

546
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:51,180
 - Did you?

547
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:53,180
 - Yeah, we explored an old barn.

548
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:56,180
 Would you like to take a walk out that way sometime, Father?

549
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:58,180
 - I've had all the exercise I need.

550
00:24:58,180 --> 00:24:59,180
 Thank you.

551
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:00,180
 - Oh.

552
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:03,180
 - Your father has been carrying furniture all day, Henry.

553
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:04,180
 (audience laughing)

554
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:05,180
 - He has?

555
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:07,180

564

 Oh, no, she isn't, Henry.

565
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,140
 What is it you walk, Willie?

566
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:42,540
 Mother, don't I smell something burning out in the kitchen?

567
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:43,300
 Bernie?

568
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:45,140
 Oh, dear, it's probably the same thing.

569
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:46,380
 Listen, Willie, you beat it.

570
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:47,100
 Do you hear me?

571
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:47,780
 You make me.

572
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:49,060
 Get your foot out of the door.

573
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:50,420
 I don't want to tell your fault.

574
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:51,100
 He was, Willie.

575
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,140
 Looking back of you.

576
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:52,580
 Where?

577
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:53,340
 Right there.

578
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:53,980
 Hey, you!

579
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:56,340
 Goodbye, Willie.

580
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:57,220
 Mother.

581
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:57,740
 Mother.

582
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:58,460
 What is it there?

583
00:25:58,460 --> 00:25:59,540
 Are you out here in the kitchen?

584
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:00,020
 Yes.

585
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:00,980
 That's all I wanted to know.

586
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:02,700
 Do you feel a draft here?

587
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,700
 I think I'll lock this back door.

588
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:10,300
 Well, Alice, I just had an answer to my wire.

589
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,300
 What does it say?

590
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:13,460
 Box of manuscripts were only Mrs. Peck

591
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:15,300
 and Paul's minutes of the woman's club.

592
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:16,300
 Don't worry.

593
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:17,400
 What's that, Father?

594
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,600
 Oh, nothing to concern, you son.

595
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,800
 He also says returning Monday.

596
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,000
 He's coming back?

597
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,500
 Why shouldn't he?

598
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,100
 He also says, please engage Willie Marshall

599
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:30,000
 to clean up basement and start furnace.

600
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,100
 Could you read that again, Father?

601
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:35,780
 I understand exactly what he means. Do you know where Willie Marshall is?

602
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:36,660
 Yes sir, but...

603
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:37,260
 He was just here.

604
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:40,860
 Henry, I want you to run over and tell him to straighten that basement out and get a fire started.

605
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:43,900
 But, but Father, why should Willie do it when I'm right here?

606
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,460
 He asks to have Willie do it.

607
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:47,420
 But, Mother, I won't charge.

608
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:48,420
 Why not?

609
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:52,380
 Well, I'd like to give Mr. Peck and Paul an introductory offer.

610
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:55,380
 Henry, I'm sorry, but you're not going to do any more work tonight.

611
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:57,900
 But, Mother, I feel sorry for Mr. Peck and Paul.

612
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:58,420
 Why?

613
00:26:58,420 --> 00:26:59,820
 Well, he's a friend of fathers.

614
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:06,820
 Well, all I can say, son, is that I'm certainly glad to see you shoulder some responsibility.

615
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:08,820
 Now, what's that?

616
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:12,820
 Oh, I guess that's just something banging against the cellar door.

617
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:14,820
 Well, I better go fix it.

618
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:16,820
 Father, you stay where you are. I'll fix it.

619
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:17,820
 Well, thank you, son.

620
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:20,820
 I'll just get my baseball bat and attend to it right away.
