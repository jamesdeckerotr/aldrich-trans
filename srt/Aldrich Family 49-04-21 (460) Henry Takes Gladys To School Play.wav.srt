00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,480
 [Music]

2
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:18,000
 And now the Jell-O family presents Henry, Henry Oldridge. Come here, mother.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,720
 [Applause]

4
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:27,760
 Yes, it's the Oldridge family based on characters originated by Flippigold Smith,

5
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:35,920
 and starring Ezra Stone as Henry with Jackie Kelt as Homer. And yes, it's the Jell-O family.

6
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,760
 [Music]

7
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:45,360
 Oh, the Big Red Ladder stand for the Jell-O family. Oh, the Big Red Ladder stand for the Jell-O family.

8
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:52,560
 Back Jell-O Union, yeah. Jell-O Pudding, yum, yum, yum. Jell-O Taffy, Oka Pudding, yes, sir.

9
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,560
 And now for the Aldrich family.

10
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:12,560
 Right in the middle of everyone's memories, there is always a teenage boy.

11
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:17,560
 And if he's like Henry Aldrich, he is right in the middle of plenty of other things too.

12
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:21,560
 The scene is the Aldrich living room. The time is evening.

13
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,560
 Alice! In his sand!

14
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,960
 There's the ex-relief for the dining room table.

15
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:26,960
 Why, dear?

16
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,360
 I thought I'd have the committee work in there.

17
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,960
 And we're going to need lots of room.

18
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:30,960
 Let me see.

19
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,560
 The last time I saw that Lee Henry was using it on his bed for a desk.

20
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,560
 A desk?

21
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,860
 Yes, he was doing his homework.

22
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:38,860
 In bed?

23
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:41,460
 Yeah, that's the place he seems to concentrate this.

24
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,160
 I'll ask him what he did with it.

25
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,160
 You mean he's still here?

26
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,160
 Yes.

27
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,860
 I've been trying to get the financial committee together for weeks.

28
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:50,360
 And we'll need all the peace and quiet we can get.

29
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,860
 Sam, I give you my word.

30
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:55,220
 Henry will be at the school play where he can't possibly bother you.

31
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:57,260
 Meanwhile, why not sit down?

32
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:57,860
 Of course.

33
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:58,860
 You were all flush.

34
00:01:58,860 --> 00:01:59,460
 I'm all right.

35
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:03,060
 I've been married to you long enough to know when you're flush.

36
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,860
 Now I remember it's in the whole closet.

37
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:06,460
 What is?

38
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,460
 You see how over here did you are?

39
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:10,460
 The leaf for the dining room table.

40
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:11,360
 Mother!

41
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,560
 They're waiting!

42
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,860
 In here, dear!

43
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:14,360
 Good night, Mother.

44
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,260
 Good night, Father.

45
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,060
 Good night, Henry.

46
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:16,660
 Turn around.

47
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:17,860
 Let me see how you look.

48
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:19,260
 Mother!

49
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,960
 Dear, why are you wearing that old blue tie?

50
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,460
 Why didn't you wear that nice one?

51
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:25,100
 Aunt Harriet gave you for Christmas.

52
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,100
 The red one.

53
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,460
 The red one, mother?

54
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:28,860
 To the theater?

55
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,760
 She was, do you want Gladys to think I have no breeding?

56
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,260
 No, I suppose it's all right.

57
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,780
 Now, do you have your ticket?

58
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,740
 She was sure right here.

59
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:38,580
 A hanky?

60
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:39,580
 I've got two of them.

61
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:41,580
 One up here, one down here.

62
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:42,420
 (audience laughing)

63
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,460
 Did you tie your money up in it?

64
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:47,460
 Gee, mother, how juvenile do you think I am?

65
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:51,620
 Henry, you've got to learn not to ask leading questions.

66
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:53,620
 What about the pins in your new shirt?

67
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:54,620
 Did you get them all out?

68
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:55,620
 Of course!

69
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,620
 Well, check the tails again.

70
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:00,620
 I wouldn't want you to sit on a pin and do it your time.

71
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:04,620
 I give you my word, Mother. There isn't a pin on me.

72
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:07,620
 And boy, I better get going. This is my first date with Gladys.

73
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,620
 And I don't want to keep her waiting. Good night, you all.

74
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:10,620
 Drive carefully, dear.

75
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:12,620
 Be sure you've got enough gas.

76
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:16,620
 There's plenty, Father. I checked the car from head to toe this afternoon.

77
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:18,620
 I even washed it.

78
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:22,620
 Alice, was that our son?

79
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:27,620
 My goodness, he certainly seemed to have everything in hand, didn't he?

80
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:29,620
 Doesn't that please you?

81
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:31,620
 I'm not sure.

82
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:32,620
 What?

83
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:36,620
 I mean, Sam, he doesn't seem to need us anymore.

84
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,620
 You'll always need his allowance.

85
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:42,620
 Yes, I'm serious. He's growing up.

86
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:45,620
 It was inevitable, Alice. It's nothing to cry about.

87
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:48,620
 I'm not crying. It's just...

88
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:52,620
 Am I? Feel like I've suddenly lost my little boy.

89
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,620
 Mother!

90
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:55,620
 Look at this.

91
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:56,620
 Henry, what's wrong?

92
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,620
 I choose one of where are my shoes?

93
00:03:58,620 --> 00:03:59,620
 No, what?

94
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:02,620
 I choose! I ran out of the house in my bedroom.

95
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,620
 They must be up in your room.

96
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,620
 Oh, boy.

97
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,620
 Don't run, dear. You're losing your trousers.

98
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:11,620
 She was, did I forget my belt, too?

99
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,620
 You better check everything again.

100
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:18,200
 Yes, mother and while I'm doing that would you please look up Gladys's address in the phone book?

101
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,200
 I never asked for work. You were

102
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:26,400
 Alice it looks like your little boy had come back

103
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:42,240
 Is this the well-being and sure Gladys and I certainly want to apologize boy

104
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,120
 I never realized roe X was way back here

105
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:52,360
 You don't know as a matter of fact. I understand this is a play you want to see from the spa back is possible

106
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:55,000
 So we go to what's sure?

107
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,520
 Seventh and eight seats in

108
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,640
 Would you excuse us, please?

109
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:08,460
 Excuse us. Oh, oh, hi Cynthia. Excuse us. Oh my goodness. Can we look what's right in front of me?

110
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:11,660
 Oh boy, where did that pole come from?

111
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:14,660
 I'm glad you take my seat.

112
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:17,660
 I can really see fine if I just tell you a little.

113
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:19,660
 Gee, what is glad I said?

114
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:21,660
 I couldn't have you tilted on our first day.

115
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,660
 We wouldn't be polite.

116
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:24,660
 Let's change.

117
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,660
 Alright.

118
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:29,660
 May I have my program now, please?

119
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:30,660
 Your program?

120
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,660
 Oh boy, how did I forget that?

121
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,660
 Excuse me, I'll be right back.

122
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:36,660
 Excuse me.

123
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,660
 Excuse me.

124
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:41,660
 Oh, oh hi Cynthia.

125
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:44,660
 Excuse me, excuse me.

126
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:47,660
 Safe, Charlie, did I have two programs please?

127
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:49,660
 Sure, I'm here, thanks.

128
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:52,660
 Excuse me, excuse me.

129
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:55,660
 Oh, excuse me, Emily.

130
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:58,660
 Oh, she was Cynthia, did I get you again?

131
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:01,660
 Excuse me, excuse me.

132
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,660
 Hair gliders.

133
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:05,660
 Thank you Emily.

134
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,420
 - Hey, hey, hey.

135
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:09,820
 (laughing)

136
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:10,920
 - Well, anyway.

137
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,620
 - Who's that?

138
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,060
 - Homer Brown.

139
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:16,460
 Boy, some people never grow up.

140
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,300
 - What do you mean?

141
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:21,060
 - Imagine yelling all over a public place like that.

142
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:23,420
 Boy, I certainly want to apologize for her.

143
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:26,100
 - I don't mind that, I think it's cute.

144
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,580
 - Cute?

145
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:29,220
 Homer Brown, cute?

146
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,740
 - Isn't that a nice nice guy you're wearing?

147
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:32,980
 - That red one, yes.

148
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:35,380
 Did you know that red's my favorite color?

149
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:36,880
 Well, do you, where?

150
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,080
 I mean, I didn't see all this for getting ready to stop the overture.

151
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,180
 Could I have my purse, please?

152
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,180
 Your purse?

153
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:44,980
 You mean I have?

154
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:47,080
 Didn't I give it to you just before we left my house?

155
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,180
 Well, do you, where's no?

156
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,080
 Oh, my goodness.

157
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:49,880
 Oh, my goodness.

158
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,380
 I must have left it on the whole table.

159
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:52,980
 What am I going to do?

160
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:55,580
 I don't think anyone will steal it, Gladys.

161
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:59,180
 Oh, would you be a beer and hop into your car and run home for us?

162
00:06:59,180 --> 00:06:59,980
 Now?

163
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:01,180
 And my purse.

164
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:03,180
 I don't have my hat, did you?

165
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:05,280
 And I understand this is a very sad place.

166
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,880
 Well, I wouldn't mind letting you want to mind.

167
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,680
 Yeah.

168
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,680
 I've got one up here and one down here.

169
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,680
 [LAUGHTER]

170
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,680
 Yeah, I'll get you to help.

171
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,880
 Oh, you missed it.

172
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,480
 What's that?

173
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,180
 That's my first time.

174
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:17,780
 But glad as you won't need more lipstick

175
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:19,280
 until I take you home.

176
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,280
 [LAUGHTER]

177
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,280
 That's why, if you must know my glasses are in the purse.

178
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,280
 Glasses?

179
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,080
 [LAUGHTER]

180
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,280
 Thank you, Dr. Shout.

181
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,280
 Well, as you, Gladys, I didn't know you needed glasses.

182
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:29,980
 I don't.

183
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:32,280
 I just wear them to keep my mother happy.

184
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,280
 suppose we don't tell your mother

185
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,780
 you don't have to be miserable all evening

186
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:39,280
 look glad it's very well

187
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:43,480
 but i'm thinking about how you feel about me early in our friendship

188
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,840
 but glad it's not even

189
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,540
 well that is naturally

190
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:48,640
 well if it's that important i'd be

191
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,400
 glad to get to your purse

192
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,800
 tell me i knew you were a gentleman

193
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,080
 and you'll have a back phone

194
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,360
 sure because i'll be awfully lonely without you

195
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,360
 oh boy

196
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,560
 i'll be back before you know it

197
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,560
 Excuse me.

198
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,960
 The present on the whole table.

199
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:04,960
 You sure?

200
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,960
 Excuse me?

201
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:06,960
 Excuse me.

202
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,960
 Excuse me.

203
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:08,960
 Ouch!

204
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,960
 Hi, Henry.

205
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:16,960
 Boy, Willie, boy, a fine parking attendant you are.

206
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:25,960
 What the hell are you stop blaming it on me?

207
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,680
 Who else can I blame it on?

208
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,360
 She was looking at all the cars parked in front of mine.

209
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,440
 I parked everybody's car as they came in.

210
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,720
 What'd you come to early for?

211
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,400
 To avoid trouble.

212
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,560
 Get me out, will we?

213
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:37,560
 Get me out.

214
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,400
 I will.

215
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,200
 Just as soon as I study the situation.

216
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,080
 Listen, I have to go all the way back for Gladys' glasses

217
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,000
 and the play's going to start any minute.

218
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,440
 And we must have known Elton hired me

219
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,960
 to take charge of a parking lot,

220
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,560
 and I'm not going off half-cost.

221
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,080
 Now, the way I figure it, all I have to do

222
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:56,520
 is move this mask back and that's cheap out,

223
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,040
 and then you can slip your car through the space.

224
00:08:59,040 --> 00:08:59,880
 I can?

225
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,880
 I'll move it. Keep an eye on my rear.

226
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:02,880
 Willy, if you ask me.

227
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,880
 I know what I'm doing.

228
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,880
 Out of my back bumper.

229
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,880
 Fine.

230
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:06,880
 I'm clearing back.

231
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,880
 Sure.

232
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,880
 Here I come.

233
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,880
 He was coming.

234
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,880
 Keep on coming.

235
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,880
 Oh boy.

236
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,880
 Everybody had a puppy that was clearing back.

237
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,880
 You are?

238
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,880
 Was your front bumper that had...

239
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,880
 Pull up.

240
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:23,880
 Holy moly, all this!

241
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:27,880
 What's wrong now?

242
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:28,880
 The bumper's a lot.

243
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,880
 They are?

244
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,880
 Well, what do you know?

245
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,880
 We'll just don't stand there, will we do some?

246
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,880
 Let's not move our heads, Ken.

247
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:39,880
 All I have to do is move that today and up front and we'll have a whole thing with it.

248
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:40,880
 And, Willie, that's crazy.

249
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,880
 If you're going to move anything, it should be this red convertible.

250
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,880
 Henry, you're the one who's crazy.

251
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,880
 It's a sedan.

252
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,880
 The convertible!

253
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,880
 Listen, Henry, are you insinuating I don't know the parking business?

254
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:59,880
 [Music]

255
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,680
 Now, where were we, gentlemen?

256
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,180
 Right in the middle of fiscal expenses, Mr. Audrey.

257
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:04,880
 Oh, yes.

258
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,180
 Shouldn't we wait until Ferguson gets back?

259
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:10,380
 Mr. Harris, this statement has to be ready for the meeting tomorrow.

260
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,780
 Why did Ferguson have to go to the school anyway?

261
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:15,880
 It seems, Mr. Kilmer, he left his car to his son,

262
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,380
 and now his bumpers are locked with another car.

263
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:20,080
 Well, that couldn't take very long.

264
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:24,320
 Yes, but before they can straighten that out, they have to get the rest of the parking lot untangled.

265
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,780
 I think we better go on without it.

266
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:28,020
 Yes, I suppose so.

267
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:32,460
 Now, I think the best way to start is to figure out our asset.

268
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:33,160
 Asset?

269
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,220
 Mr. R.W.E.S. we don't have any assets.

270
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:38,680
 The club is 250 in the red and everyone knows it.

271
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,640
 I know, Mr. Head.

272
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,820
 I make a motion.

273
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,540
 We just make up a report chain.

274
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:46,540
 We owe $250 and not worry the club about how it happened.

275
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:47,200
 Oh, Mr. Head.

276
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,140
 I second the motion.

277
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:48,940
 How about some bridge?

278
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,940
 Now Mr. Kilburn!

279
00:10:50,940 --> 00:11:03,440
 Listen, Henry, what's the idea of calling me out of the auditorium in a time like this?

280
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,940
 I had to, Homer.

281
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:08,940
 But screaming, kitten, just playing the old aunt, and I think she's just about to get murdered.

282
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:09,940
 But Homer...

283
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:12,940
 I've been looking forward to that since the curtain went up.

284
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:16,940
 But Homer, I can't get my car out of the parking lot. I'll have to take a street car.

285
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:19,540
 This is the first date I've had with her.

286
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:20,040
 What?

287
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,240
 Homer, don't you understand?

288
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,240
 The only part I got was you have a date with a streetcar.

289
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:25,940
 [Laughter]

290
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:28,040
 Now, Homer, with Gladys Prentice,

291
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,640
 so won't you please do me a favor and sit with her?

292
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,140
 Me?

293
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,440
 So she won't be lonesome.

294
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,640
 Nothing doing him.

295
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,540
 What a home, brother.

296
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:36,940
 I saw that pole right in front of your seat.

297
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:38,040
 Pole?

298
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,640
 There's a pole there?

299
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,440
 You know, dying well.

300
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,940
 Come on, hardly even noticed it.

301
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,640
 That's how infotecimal it is.

302
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,340
 - It's been tassel, it's been tassel, huh?

303
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,340
 - Oh!

304
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:51,540
 - And she was, if you lean a little,

305
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,040
 you hardly know it's there.

306
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,440
 - Oh no, when I get off balance, I get a headache.

307
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,540
 - Look, is it worth a quarter to your mouth?

308
00:11:58,540 --> 00:11:59,620
 - 50 cents.

309
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:00,460
 - 50?

310
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:01,840
 - Well, she was, you should be willing to have

311
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,140
 a little headache for that kind of money.

312
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,220
 - Okay, I'll do it.

313
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,700
 - Gee, thanks Homer.

314
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:07,900
 - 75.

315
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,020
 - Now listen!

316
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:12,660
 - Can we eat a headache in the polar worth at least 75 cents?

317
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,740
 - But that hardly leaves me enough for sodas.

318
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,340
 Okay, Henry, step aside.

319
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:17,180
 Where are you going?

320
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:18,840
 Back to my seat and watch thing be.

321
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,680
 Get there, Lynn.

322
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,320
 Okay, okay, okay.

323
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,040
 Here's your 75 cent.

324
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:23,860
 Hey.

325
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,680
 So glad us I'll be back before she knows.

326
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,160
 Okay.

327
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:30,320
 Yes, Mr. and Dr. Isaki.

328
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,920
 Yes, Ms. Hotchkiss.

329
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,320
 She's been learning.

330
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,960
 Well, she was already.

331
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,960
 I better inspect the body.

332
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,160
 Excuse me, can I get in this row?

333
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,200
 Thanks.

334
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,520
 Excuse me.

335
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,360
 Excuse me.

336
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,360
 Excuse me.

337
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,360
 Oh, so high Cynthia.

338
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:58,360
 Sam, I feel terribly guilty about having to leave.

339
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,360
 Yes, yes, of course.

340
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,360
 But I'm sure you and Mr. Kilmer can appreciate my position.

341
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,360
 After all, you have children of your own.

342
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:09,360
 Yes, but couldn't Mrs. Harris take the saddle shoes down to your daughter, Cynthia?

343
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,360
 I have the car, Mr. Ahrich.

344
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,360
 Oh, oh yes.

345
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:17,360
 Yes, but I'm certainly going to speak very sharply to Cynthia about interrupting our meeting like this.

346
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,360
 I was against her wearing open toe shoes from the start.

347
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,360
 Well, if you must go, you must.

348
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,360
 Well, and if I don't come my bet, I may not.

349
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,360
 No, no, we won't.

350
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,360
 Good night.

351
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,360
 Good night.

352
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:31,360
 Mr. Aldrich, I've just finished heading up those figures.

353
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,360
 Yes.

354
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:35,360
 And according to my addition, we have $194 in the bank.

355
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,360
 What?

356
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,360
 That's impossible. We have a deficit.

357
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,360
 I know. I must have gone all somewhere.

358
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,360
 Let me see those figures.

359
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:47,600
 a year. Mr. Kilmer you've added our membership to our assets. I have my mind.

360
00:13:47,600 --> 00:14:00,500
 Oh boy. Excuse me. Hey fellow what do you think you're going into the auditorium?

361
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:04,320
 Have I missed much? Only the first act. Let me see you take it. Take it you already

362
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,480
 took it. Me? Well maybe not you but somebody took it. Look fella try and know

363
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,920
 When you're the third guy who's tried that excuse tonight.

364
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:14,120
 Well, but it isn't any excuse my girls inside waiting for me.

365
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,360
 Yeah, and Rolex.

366
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,840
 Now I know you're a gay crush.

367
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,640
 You've arisen an empty seat in that row.

368
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:21,000
 Well, she were naturally homers in it.

369
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,960
 Look, I have strict orders not to let anyone in without a ticket

370
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,240
 and that's that, so stand back.

371
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,440
 But she was, I sold more tickets for this drunk lady

372
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,320
 than anyone in school, ask Mercedes.

373
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,840
 She knows I had a ticket.

374
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,960
 Mercedes isn't here.

375
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,120
 What? At a time--

376
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,680
 Look, fellow, why not stop trying to be a welter

377
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,400
 and give me a dollar and I'll sell you a ticket?

378
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,680
 But she was only half left as 50 cents.

379
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,120
 Well, can't you borrow the rest?

380
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:41,780
 Barmer?

381
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:42,920
 Sure.

382
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,680
 Well, that's an idea.

383
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,840
 Could you loan me 50 cents?

384
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,600
 No, wait a minute.

385
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,240
 Well, I just purchased that.

386
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,720
 Oh, that's just it, my girl.

387
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,000
 Since she can't see a thing without her.

388
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,200
 Well, why not see if she's got as much as a dollar in there?

389
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,080
 Open Gladys's purse?

390
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,520
 Sure, girls always carry get mad money.

391
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,280
 Oh, I couldn't.

392
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:02,960
 Why not?

393
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,400
 She might get mad.

394
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,560
 Besides, what would she think of my character?

395
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,440
 Listen, it'll just be a loan, will it?

396
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,960
 It is as though you won't pay a back loan.

397
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,220
 - No. - Well, okay.

398
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:15,280
 Stand back while I open it.

399
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,720
 You see any money?

400
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,560
 - Not yet.

401
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:20,280
 - Could you hold a few of these things?

402
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,640
 - No. - Okay.

403
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,840
 Here's your comb, notebook, glasses,

404
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,960
 library card, key chain, compact.

405
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,560
 A map!

406
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:31,120
 Left glove, hanky, another glove, left the right.

407
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,680
 A laugh!

408
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,840
 How about money?

409
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,440
 I think I hear something rattling near the bottom.

410
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,940
 Here's her mirror mending tape needle and

411
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,940
 thrift lifesavers.

412
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:42,940
 What flavor?

413
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:43,540
 He's gone.

414
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,540
 That's glottishes all over everything.

415
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:46,040
 Flipping.

416
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,740
 Oh boy.

417
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:49,540
 Wait a minute.

418
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:50,240
 Where are you going?

419
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:50,840
 So let's think.

420
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,740
 Just roll under the auditorium door.

421
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:53,440
 I told you,

422
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:53,740
 fella.

423
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:55,240
 You don't go in there without a ticket.

424
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,540
 Now listen, fella.

425
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:58,040
 Listen yourself, fella.

426
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:06,240
 [Music]

427
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:10,120
 Oh! The Big Red Letter stands for Evigello Family.

428
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:13,840
 Oh! The Big Red Letter stands for Evigello Family.

429
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,760
 That's Jello. Yum, yum, yum.

430
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,680
 Jello Pudding's, yum, yum, yum.

431
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:22,320
 Jello Tack, Bianca Pudding's Yes or Weeee!

432
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:27,840
 Yes, and there are dozens and dozens of swell treats you can make with the Jello family of yum-yum desserts.

433
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:31,420
 And here's a grand new combination to surprise the folks with tomorrow.

434
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:37,320
 Maple Nut Tapioca, made with Luscious Light and Mellow Jello Vanilla Tapioca pudding.

435
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:41,060
 Just prepare a package of Jello Vanilla Tapioca as usual.

436
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:47,400
 Then chill and serve with log cabin syrup, topped with chopped nut meat, sauteed in a little butter.

437
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:54,540
 It's a wonderful dessert. Delicious Jello Vanilla Tapioca, with tangy maple syrup and crunchy nut meats.

438
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:57,380
 Try all three jello tapioca puddings.

439
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:01,100
 Jello chocolate, vanilla, and orange coconut tapioca.

440
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,420
 They're ready prepared.

441
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:06,100
 All you do is add milk and they take about five minutes to cook.

442
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:09,020
 Look for 'em on your grocery's dessert shelf.

443
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:10,820
 Jello tapioca pudding.

444
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:13,580
 (dramatic music)

445
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:20,380
 And now getting back to the troubles of Henry Oldridge.

446
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:22,660
 Henry left the performance of the school play

447
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:27,020
 in order to get Gladys's purse. But when he returned he couldn't get back in without

448
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:32,500
 his ticket. Meanwhile he is hired Homer to sit with Gladys and keep her company. The

449
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:36,660
 scene opens in the auditorium just as the second act is ending.

450
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:38,660
 Hello? What's this?

451
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:40,660
 Inspector, is it a clue?

452
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:46,020
 Yes, Miss Hotchkiss. A very... a very vital clue.

453
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:50,980
 vital crew and if this doesn't lead us to the killer my name isn't Inspector

454
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:53,340
 Hornblow of Scotland Yard.

455
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,860
 [applause]

456
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:58,060
 Oh my goodness, that would be the most knowing that in the first time.

457
00:17:58,060 --> 00:17:59,620
 Did you really enjoy it, Gla?

458
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:03,500
 No, I did. I guess I grabbed your arm a couple of times, didn't I, Homer?

459
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,340
 Gee, I didn't mind.

460
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:09,340
 Would you like to go out to the hall for another glass of water?

461
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:10,780
 No, I don't think so.

462
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:11,780
 That's good.

463
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:15,780
 Boy, did that Cynthia Harris step on my toe the last turn?

464
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:17,180
 I wonder where Henry is.

465
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,180
 Henry?

466
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,980
 Henry Aldrich.

467
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:21,380
 Aren't you worried about him?

468
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:23,980
 Well, it wouldn't be very polite to be worried, you think?

469
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:24,780
 It wouldn't.

470
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:27,380
 No, it wouldn't mean I wasn't having a good time with you.

471
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:28,580
 Oh.

472
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:29,980
 You know who I are?

473
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,980
 What's that I seem to be?

474
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,580
 Gee.

475
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:35,580
 Gee, it's suddenly gotten warm in here.

476
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:38,780
 Oh, I was thinking it was getting a little chewy.

477
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:39,380
 Yeah?

478
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:40,580
 Would you like my jacket?

479
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:41,980
 Oh, I couldn't deprive you.

480
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:43,180
 Gee, I don't mind.

481
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:45,580
 Well, suppose I just follow a part of it.

482
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:47,580
 A par?

483
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:49,580
 They just agreed.

484
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:53,580
 Oh, I'll tell you. I don't think my folks will be too happy if I tore it off.

485
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:56,580
 Oh, goodness, you're cute.

486
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:58,580
 I am.

487
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:02,580
 Hey, you just let us put you on around my shoulders. I wouldn't be so dressed.

488
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:05,580
 Oh. Oh.

489
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,580
 How's that?

490
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:08,580
 Much better.

491
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,580
 Oh, my goodness, whoa!

492
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:11,580
 Where?

493
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:14,580
 I got window and back there. See those two hands on the ledge?

494
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:17,740
 She was a must be some guy trying to sneak in that way.

495
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,040
 What's that in her hand?

496
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,740
 Well, I'll be doing it.

497
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:23,140
 Grattice it isn't a fellow, it's a girl.

498
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:23,640
 It is.

499
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,640
 Sure, that's a personal left hand.

500
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,840
 Well, my goodness, isn't that disgraceful?

501
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,380
 There goes a janitor after her.

502
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:31,280
 What's he doing with that window, Paul?

503
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,680
 Oh boy, he's gonna let her have it right on the knuckle.

504
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,280
 I swear to the ouch!

505
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,780
 [laughter]

506
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,320
 Oh, I give it to him.

507
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,520
 She's doing hands disappear so fast.

508
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,720
 Oh, right.

509
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,920
 Yes, Grattice.

510
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,920
 Did you know you took your arm away?

511
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:45,920
 I did.

512
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,920
 Yes, and it's getting very chilling again.

513
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:53,920
 Graddish, don't you think it would be a good idea if I went back to my own seat?

514
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:54,920
 Why Homer?

515
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:58,920
 I mean, she was Henry's my best friend and he did pay for your ticket.

516
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,920
 Well, you're doing him a favor.

517
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:01,920
 I am.

518
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,920
 Certainly. He wants me to have a good time, doesn't he?

519
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:04,920
 Yes, but...

520
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:05,920
 Well, I've been miserable sitting alone.

521
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,920
 Sure, but...

522
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:09,920
 Homer, please put your arm back where it was. I'm freezing.

523
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:10,920
 But...

524
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:11,920
 Homer...

525
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,920
 How's that?

526
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,920
 Mmm, that's better.

527
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:20,920
 Oh boy, am I a heel?

528
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:32,920
 Willie, where are you? Right in front of you, Henry.

529
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,920
 Boy, this basement is dark.

530
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:37,920
 Are you sure we can get into the orchestra pit this way?

531
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:38,920
 Sure.

532
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:43,180
 When I played the tube in the school orchestra, I used to sneak out this way all the time.

533
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:47,800
 Boy, my suit must be a wreck. I fell right off that window sill into a thorn hedge.

534
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,800
 Hold it.

535
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,320
 But we turn here.

536
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,320
 Willie, are you sure?

537
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,720
 Positive. I memorize the space-ment like a book.

538
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,220
 You do?

539
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:56,720
 You throw when you're carrying a tube, but you can't be too careful.

540
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,720
 [laughter]

541
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,520
 Come on.

542
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:01,720
 Gee, Willie, I certainly want to thank you for helping me out like this.

543
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:05,420
 Well, that's okay, Henry. After all, I was responsible for tying up your car.

544
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:08,120
 What did Mr. Nelson say when he fired you?

545
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:12,120
 I wasn't exactly fired. I retired by mutual agreement.

546
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,760
 Did he at least get paid?

547
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:17,720
 Well, I'll tell you the truth, Henry. I didn't think I ought to press that point.

548
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:22,040
 Especially since the fire department had to come over and help untangle those cars.

549
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:26,560
 A hold it, Henry. What's the matter? We should be almost to the door of the orchestra pit.

550
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:30,120
 Where? Well, feel along the wall on your side for a pipe.

551
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,400
 What for? It was right to the door. Oh.

552
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,560
 Feel around. Okay. Did you find it?

553
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:38,560
 Well, he was at a steam pipe. Yeah, I found it.

554
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:41,560
 Well, keep following it and go forward. Sure.

555
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:45,560
 When you get to the orchestra pit, sneak in behind Agnes' lost in space.

556
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:48,560
 Okay. Well, let's be quiet, huh?

557
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:58,560
 Henry, you're not something over?

558
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:01,560
 No shovels.

559
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:04,060
 - Kelly, half a dozen of them. - That's funny.

560
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:06,360
 I don't remember those being there last winter.

561
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,860
 - Willie, you mean we're lost? - Well, not exactly.

562
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:10,860
 I just don't know where we are. - No.

563
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:12,060
 - What is it my fault, Henry?

564
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:14,860
 This is the first time I've come through here without my tuba.

565
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:16,860
 - [music playing]

566
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:28,260
 - You said you. Can't you tell me who murdered my ass?

567
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:31,460
 - Miss Hotchkiss, I think you'll be walking through that door.

568
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:34,860
 That door in a moment. All right, men, scatter.

569
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:37,760
 Oh, my goodness, I'm dying. I'm just dying.

570
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,960
 Have you ever seen the mark?

571
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:39,760
 I'm dying.

572
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,760
 She also am so excited, my tozer curl.

573
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:45,460
 Yes, doctor. I hear someone.

574
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:48,960
 Quickly turn out the lights and careful men,

575
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,160
 he may be armed.

576
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,260
 Oh, man, you terrified of my hair.

577
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:53,960
 Hold this. How's that?

578
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:56,960
 My goodness, coat hands warm up.

579
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,960
 She was a pretty cold yourself.

580
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,760
 - Well, but you better keep out the door.

581
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,100
 (sighing)

582
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:04,600
 - I'm your toes man.

583
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,380
 - Oh my God, look, the door's out there.

584
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:07,220
 - It's your murder.

585
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:08,060
 - What are you doing?

586
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:08,900
 Who is this?

587
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:09,900
 - I don't know.

588
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:12,300
 - Will you are you sure this is the door to the orchestra?

589
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,860
 (crowd laughing)

590
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,980
 - Well, instead of murder it sounds familiar.

591
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:17,480
 - All right, men, glad it.

592
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,480
 (crowd laughing)

593
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,320
 - Hey!

594
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,160
 - No way!

595
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,420
 - You've come to the end of your road.

596
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:26,460
 - Now listen, you guys, I pay for my ticket,

597
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:27,820
 and I'm coming in.

598
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:30,820
 (audience laughing)

599
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:37,820
 - Now, Sam, calm down.

600
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:38,820
 - I am calm, Alice.

601
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,520
 It's just that after all these years it hurts

602
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,820
 to find out I've missed Judge Ralph Kilmer, so complete.

603
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:44,820
 - Now, dear baby, you had a good reason for leaving.

604
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:45,820
 - Good reason?

605
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:47,820
 His excuse was he had to go to the school auditorium

606
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:48,820
 and take his daughter home.

607
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:50,320
 - Yeah, that doesn't sound unreal.

608
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,320
 - Because you've got another attack of our hiccups

609
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,820
 from laughing at the school play?

610
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:56,320
 - Laughing, I thought it was a serious drama.

611
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:59,320
 Exactly, certainly could have thought of a better excuse.

612
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:03,320
 Fine meeting, Ferguson runs out, then Harry, now a cure-mer.

613
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:06,320
 Well, there's one thing to be said, you certainly can't blame Henry.

614
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,320
 Well, that's something.

615
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,320
 Why, good is that, couldn't be Henry, it's only 10.30.

616
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,320
 Henry, is that you?

617
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,320
 Yes, Mother, it's sigh.

618
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,320
 Here, come in here, please.

619
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,320
 Mother, if you don't mind, I'd like to go right up to bed.

620
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,320
 Yeah, are you home a little early?

621
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,320
 Are we?

622
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,320
 Is the playover already?

623
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:29,820
 ready? Well, you might say it ended a little unexpectedly. Oh, I see. Incidentally,

624
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:34,260
 be in this Eddie phone this evening. She did. And she was so pleased about your

625
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:38,660
 selling all those tickets. She has a little surprise for you. Surprise. Yes,

626
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:43,620
 she's going to see that you get a part in the next place. Me? Yes, there isn't that

627
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:47,920
 night. Well, I'll tell your mother. And naturally, I appreciate it, but I've

628
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:54,560
 suddenly lost all interest in appearing on the stage. You have. Yeah, all you do is get up there and

629
00:24:54,560 --> 00:25:00,240
 make a fool of yourself. Oh my goodness, I'm going in and make you a glass of hot milk with

630
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:05,840
 butter. On top of everything else I'd go on through. Henry, please answer the phone. Who I?

631
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:11,040
 Father, suppose it's a member of the cast. Answer it, Henry. I have to finish this report. But they

632
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,440
 They bring her for three months.

633
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,440
 Oh boy.

634
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,440
 Hello.

635
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,940
 Hi, Hannah, old timer.

636
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:18,940
 Homer, is that you?

637
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:19,940
 Sure.

638
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:22,240
 What they do to you after they roll down the curtain.

639
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,240
 I'd rather not say.

640
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,940
 Henry, it isn't as bad as that.

641
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:29,640
 They promised to print who the murderer was in the school paper next week.

642
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,140
 Homer, what about Gladys?

643
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:33,840
 Wait, that's where I'm calling from.

644
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,240
 I just took her home.

645
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,240
 You did?

646
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,240
 Well, you tell her I'll bring her her purse over there the first thing in the morning.

647
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,240
 Okay, Dan.

648
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:44,400
 When the optometrist promised to have her glasses fixed by three o'clock tomorrow.

649
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,240
 Something happened to them?

650
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,400
 In a way, Homer.

651
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:50,640
 They somehow came into contact with a window pole.

652
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,120
 So am I.

653
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,120
 And Homer.

654
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,960
 Homer is Gladys very mad.

655
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:55,960
 Mad.

656
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,840
 Because I wasn't with her all evening.

657
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,280
 Well, she doesn't seem very mad.

658
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,280
 She doesn't?

659
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,280
 No.

660
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,720
 As a matter of fact, she said she had a wonderful time.

661
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,320
 We'll cut it out, Gladys.

662
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,320
 That too.

663
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,320
 What's that?

664
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,320
 Oh boy.

665
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:21,320
 Oh, boy. Homer, what's going on? Nothing, and nothing. Only Henry. Yes? I just want you to know you've got a 75 cent refund coming to you.

666
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:33,320
 [music]

667
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:37,320
 Oh, I went up to make a new grassy certain party I know turned out to be.

668
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:40,320
 Snake and the grass, Agnes, are you referring to good old home?

669
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,320
 I'll say I am.

670
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:44,320
 What Agnes, you're talking about my best pal?

671
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,320
 Your best pal, your best pal.

672
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,320
 Oh, sure.

673
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,320
 Oh, okay.

674
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,320
 Then what was your best pal doing with his arm?

675
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,320
 I'm glad it's all he knew.

676
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:54,320
 She was so, that's what happened.

677
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,320
 Boy, what a snake and the grass.

678
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:00,320
 Well, sometimes that's the way it goes with the best of friends.

679
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,320
 But ladies, when it comes to desserts,

680
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,480
 Here's one that never lets you down.

681
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,440
 Jello tapioca puddings, a miracle of goodness,

682
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,080
 a marvel of speed.

683
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:11,520
 Jello tapioca puddings are ready prepared,

684
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,000
 nothing to go wrong.

685
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,600
 All you do is add milk,

686
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:17,280
 and they take just about five minutes to cook.

687
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:20,960
 There's Jello vanilla tapioca, luscious light and mellow.

688
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,240
 Jello chocolate tapioca, rich and candy good.

689
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,680
 Jello orange coconut tapioca,

690
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:29,760
 tangy orange with rich tropical coconut.

00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,840
 Jello tapioca puddings,

 Absolutely no more cooking needed.
