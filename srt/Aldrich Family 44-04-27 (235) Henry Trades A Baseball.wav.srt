 Coming, Mother!

 The Oldrich family.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 A typical teenage boy like Henry Aldrich, lives in a world on his own.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 A world of impulses, hectic activity and honest enthusiasm.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 And grown-ups always welcome the opportunity of re-entering that wonderful world.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 The scene opens in the older living room.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 The time is Saturday afternoon.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 But Henry, don't you see my point of view?

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 You have no life to do a thing like that.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 But Mary, Charlie, talk to my son.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 He's really a slow guy. He's really very good.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 Look, he's helping you tell. His hair's always falling down over the front of his face.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 Not when he goes out.

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 No, it isn't. Yes, it's a stuffy point of our habit.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 Boy, it makes a step of the board.

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 Well, let me warn you, Henry, if Charlie Clark comes over here tonight, I won't even see him.

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 Why not?

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 Because Henry, you had no right making any such thing for me.

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 Mary, isn't this a very, but you and Henry, the car price allowed?

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 I'm not talking about it.

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 But you know what Henry did to me.

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 You know what he did to me.

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 What did he do?

28
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 He told me to Charlie Clark is a baseball.

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 [laughter]

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 Come, lover.

31
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 I assure you, the baseball had nothing to do with it.

32
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 And besides, Mary, do you realize how hard a thing like that is to get these days?

33
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 Mary, I always thought Charlie Clark was a very nice ball.

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 Oh, Charlie Clark?

35
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 How did he search the draw?

36
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 I was a little playmate for Henry, but to send an evening with him.

37
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 Mary, may I ask whatever gave you the conception of Charlie Clark is my little playmate?

38
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 I am in the ring.

39
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 Hi, how are you?

40
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 Oh, my God.

41
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 I need help to wait for her.

42
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 Let's see.

43
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 Oh, my God.

44
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 I have to wait until I get married right now.

45
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 See, I don't want to hear any more about this.

46
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 Now, please go outside with Homer and play ball.

47
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 Yes, Mother.

48
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 I'll go.

49
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 Only Charlie Clark thinks you have a play for tonight.

50
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 You're made of heaven, Heather.

51
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 You're the one who'll have to keep it with us.

52
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 I am.

53
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 Let's see that boy here, Charlie.

54
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 It's right here.

55
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 No more flossing Homer.

56
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 Boy, are you lucky you haven't got a sister.

57
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 You're crazy, Henry.

58
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 Don't you realize I'm the only person that I have?

59
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 My family can pick on.

60
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 Where's the ball?

61
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,520
 It's up on the shelf, I think.

62
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,520
 Can we run to have some light in this car?

63
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,800
 We don't need any light.

64
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,840
 She was ever long ago,

65
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,000
 and knows exactly where everything is.

66
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,360
 How would you win?

67
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,600
 Hey, Henry, what was that?

68
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,800
 You just knocked off the chow.

69
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,200
 Oh boy, you're a boy.

70
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,200
 You're a good man.

71
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,400
 I'd like to try to find out.

72
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,800
 Here, I can't make it out.

73
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,000
 Sort of a box.

74
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,600
 And there are a lot of little things that came out of it.

75
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,000
 Oh, she was like a step on, well, whatever it is.

76
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,400
 Her sort of soft and squashing.

77
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,800
 Henry, I imagine I should have a white smell chocolate.

78
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,800
 Chocolate?

79
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,300
 Oh, it couldn't be chocolate.

80
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,300
 No, it couldn't be, huh?

81
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,600
 It's chocolate, all right?

82
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,600
 And boy.

83
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,800
 Oh, boy.

84
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,600
 Don't you imagine that.

85
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,000
 And no good, two-one-says.

86
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,800
 Look out, Henry.

87
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,300
 Let me get down here on the floor with you.

88
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,300
 Now, wait a minute, Homer.

89
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,600
 Rush night, the whole works.

90
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,600
 Don't you realize this box must belong to someone?

91
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,100
 I'm not necessarily.

92
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,300
 Maybe somebody put it up there and put that in.

93
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:05,500
 Ten years ago.

94
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,800
 You think so?

95
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,000
 Well, but don't taste as though they were.

96
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 Ten years old?

97
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 Maybe they ain't any other.

98
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,500
 Homer, come on, help me.

99
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,500
 They're all over the floor.

100
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,500
 Well, where's the box?

101
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,000
 You'll find it. You'll find it.

102
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,500
 I've got the lid right here in my hand.

103
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,500
 And it's looking for me.

104
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,500
 Save all the little papers.

105
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,500
 Some little papers?

106
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,000
 Sure. Don't you feel this?

107
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 There's a little paper cup for her for each piece.

108
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 Oh, yes.

109
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,500
 That's what I just swallowed.

110
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,500
 Oh, boy.

111
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,500
 Rob, Mary.

112
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,500
 Don't let me tell you something.

113
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:33,000
 Oh, well, don't bother looking for me, Mary.

114
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,500
 I'm on my way into you.

115
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,000
 Oh, I can't admit you.

116
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,500
 I mean, may I ask what it is you're eating?

117
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,500
 Why?

118
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,500
 Eating?

119
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,500
 Well, I'm just running my tongue over my teeth, Mary.

120
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:46,500
 What I started to say was, one reason I don't watch Charlie Clock around tonight is because Joe Graham is coming over.

121
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,500
 Joe Graham?

122
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,500
 You'd rather see Joe Graham than a kind, generous guy like Charlie.

123
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,500
 You realize Joe Graham is just as generous as he can be?

124
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:57,500
 He even sent me a beautiful box of candy yesterday, a beautiful two pound box.

125
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,500
 He did, Joe Graham gave you...

126
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,500
 Oh, listen, that's mine.

127
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,500
 Where is it?

128
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,500
 That happens to be not a few business, can we all?

129
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,500
 I put it away very carefully in a place where you can't possibly go across it.

130
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,500
 Oh, well, I'm certainly sorry.

131
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,500
 Goodbye.

132
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,500
 Why?

133
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,500
 Why are you going?

134
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,500
 I have no place in the ticket.

135
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,500
 I just have a little cleaning up.

136
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,500
 I mean a few things.

137
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,500
 I'm sorry I said what I said about you.

138
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:37,500
 We're here in the

139
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,500
 Oh boy.

140
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,500
 Now listen, why'd you close the door, kid?

141
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,500
 Why do you think so? You thought I wouldn't see it.

142
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,500
 With Homer, there's no knob on this side.

143
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,500
 You know, we can't get out.

144
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,500
 She was. We may be in here.

145
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:50,500
 Oh boy, nobody knows how long we may be in here.

146
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,500
 Oh, at least, Harry, we will start.

147
00:04:52,500 --> 00:05:02,500
 Hello? Hello?

148
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,500
 Hello?

149
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,500
 Hello?

150
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,500
 Hello, is Mary Alberts there?

151
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,500
 Oh, Joe, is that you?

152
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,000
 No, this is Charlie.

153
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,300
 Oh, Charlie Clark.

154
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,700
 Mary, did you hear me?

155
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,300
 This is your friend, Charlie Clark.

156
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,100
 Yes, well, just gonna go ahead and make it.

157
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,600
 But I don't want to speak to Henry, Mary.

158
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,500
 I want to speak to you.

159
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,700
 This is Charlie Clark.

160
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:20,000
 Hello?

161
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 Hello?

162
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,700
 Hello?

163
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,300
 Oh, gee, Mary, I thought you pitched me.

164
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,700
 This isn't an always Charlie.

165
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,400
 We don't seem to be able to find Henry.

166
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,400
 But Mrs. Olvers, I gave Henry a baseball.

167
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,300
 I mean, it's your daughter, Mary, I want.

168
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:30,900
 Mary?

169
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:31,700
 Oh, why Mary?

170
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,000
 Is looking for Henry, Charlie?

171
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 She is?

172
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,300
 Well, look, maybe you could tell me

173
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,980
 What time I'm supposed to come over tonight.

174
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:40,940
 Oh, so I'm not sure that I just married Milly tonight.

175
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:41,900
 Sure with me.

176
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:42,660
 Really?

177
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:43,980
 Well, sure, didn't Henry tell her?

178
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:45,620
 Well, Charlie, I think they say the same thing

179
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,020
 for us to do with the Henry phone.

180
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:48,020
 You later in the day.

181
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:48,780
 Henry?

182
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:49,460
 Not Mary?

183
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:50,980
 I'll tell Henry you call me.

184
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,780
 Oh, well, thanks very much.

185
00:05:52,780 --> 00:06:03,020
 Homer?

186
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,580
 Homer, you aren't even going to sleep now.

187
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:06,780
 No, of course I have a friend that's weak.

188
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:09,280
 I just feel sort of funny.

189
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,580
 Have you found all the chocolate's over on your part of the floor and some of them?

190
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,780
 I'm stepping right in the box over here.

191
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,880
 But, Homer, I've got the box over here.

192
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,880
 You have?

193
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,880
 But what's this I've been putting in?

194
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,780
 Now listen, what's the matter?

195
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:22,680
 It's somebody's shoe.

196
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,680
 Now listen, Homer.

197
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,180
 How's it going, Mom?

198
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:27,280
 You know what we ought to have a flashlight?

199
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:27,980
 Sure.

200
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:30,480
 I even found a couple of chocolate's inside this umbrella.

201
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,980
 Homer, keep going.

202
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:32,780
 Keep going.

203
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:33,980
 I have put somebody coming.

204
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:34,980
 What's the matter?

205
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,480
 We can work this, my father.

206
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,980
 Let's put the box up on the shelf.

207
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:38,980
 Okay.

208
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:39,980
 You put it up.

209
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,980
 I think I better move quick.

210
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:42,980
 There.

211
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,980
 And wait back in the closet.

212
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:45,980
 It's my father.

213
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:46,980
 He may not notice us.

214
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:47,980
 She was.

215
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:48,980
 Just don't move.

216
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,980
 Oh, get your foot off me.

217
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:51,980
 So McPey's your bed enough.

218
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:52,980
 Why?

219
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:53,980
 Yes.

220
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:54,980
 Yeah, Todd.

221
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,980
 I heard you were putting on just something.

222
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:59,980
 Henry, what are you at home doing here in this closet?

223
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:00,980
 Oh, my father.

224
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,980
 I want to show all of it.

225
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:05,920
 Why are you sitting there doing absolutely nothing?

226
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,920
 White.

227
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,860
 Oh, we were just trying to see how long we could hold our breath.

228
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:10,860
 Mr. Allrich.

229
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:11,860
 Well, get up.

230
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:14,060
 You both entirely ought to be wasting your time doing that.

231
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,060
 Yes, Father.

232
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,060
 And please get out of the way.

233
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,560
 I want to find an old pair of shoes, if I am.

234
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,560
 Yes, Mr. Allrich.

235
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,560
 Come on, Henley.

236
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,560
 Oh, boy.

237
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,560
 I'm coming.

238
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,100
 Oh, is there anything to matter with you?

239
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,100
 No, Mr. Allrich.

240
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:27,100
 I'll be all right, I think.

241
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:30,340
 Hey, look, as soon as you get by, don't we got to go back and pick up a rest?

242
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:31,180
 - Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

243
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:33,020
 - I asked where you've been to the last half hour.

244
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:36,300
 - Oh, wait, we're just, we're out there on Mrs. Old.

245
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,060
 - We're looking for a flashlight.

246
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:40,060
 - Yes, we need a flashlight, mother.

247
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,620
 - I'm Mary, have you seen one?

248
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,540
 - I mean, I'm not even speaking to you.

249
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:44,380
 - Do I, Mary?

250
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,180
 - And I just wanna tell you, if you hadn't done what you did,

251
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:47,900
 I would have let you and Homer have some of the candy,

252
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:48,940
 your grand business.

253
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,820
 But as it is, you're not even gonna say it.

254
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:53,460
 - Oh, we're not? - Oh, gee, with Henry.

255
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:55,660
 You wanna see what I just found in the cup of my pan.

256
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:57,500
 - What is it, Homer? - Nothing.

257
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,700
 Nothing. - It's--

258
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:01,300
 Oh, Mo, is it in pretty good condition?

259
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:04,700
 Well, to be frank, Henry, we better just leave it where it is.

260
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:07,700
 Henry, have you cleaned up that mess yet?

261
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:08,700
 Is that mess?

262
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:09,700
 Oh, boy.

263
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,700
 You know very well that I'm talking about.

264
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,700
 That model airplane you left all over the floor of your room.

265
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:15,700
 Oh, is that all?

266
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:16,700
 Is that all?

267
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:17,700
 Henry, what's gotten into you?

268
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:18,700
 Oh, nothing, Mother.

269
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:19,700
 Nothing.

270
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,700
 This is all the challenge you're wearing ideas to where we plan to flashlight.

271
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,700
 Oh, my Henry does not need any flashlight.

272
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:25,700
 It's straight and things up.

273
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:26,700
 He does, and...

274
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:29,700
 - Hey, which mess you want me to work? - You step up me, all right.

275
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:32,700
 - Mother, would you like to have me go get two pieces of that candy joke about me?

276
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:35,700
 - I certainly hope you haven't opened it. - Oh, no, Mother.

277
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:38,700
 - How did you be careful to hide it out in the whole closet? - In the whole closet!

278
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:43,700
 Your father is always poking around in that closet, and you know how he is when he gets over the box of candy.

279
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:47,700
 - Well, my goodness, I'll get it out right away. - You can find a place in the dining room to hide it.

280
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:52,700
 - All right. - Mary, look. There it is. Right out on the top shelf where everyone can see it.

281
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,700
 - This is a strange. - I thought I'd put it right back in there.

282
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,700
 I'm not going to let go of me.

283
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:58,700
 Take one seat.

284
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,700
 Now, dear, don't even take the cover off that box.

285
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:03,700
 Why not hide it in the dining room and open it until William comes to see.

286
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,700
 All right, let me out of here.

287
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,700
 Then you can see how much it looks.

288
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:17,700
 Oh, there, Mr. Aldrich.

289
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,700
 Well, that's all right, darling. How are you?

290
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,700
 That's fine. Can I see him, Mary, please?

291
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:22,700
 You want, Mary?

292
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,700
 Mary!

293
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:24,700
 - Hey, Miss. - Yes, Father.

294
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,700
 Charlie Clark, here to see you.

295
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,700
 Mary. Mary.

296
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,700
 Is she getting you, Mr. Aldrich?

297
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,700
 I thought she asked her when I first called.

298
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,700
 Step inside, we're trying to locate her.

299
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,700
 Okay. Mary.

300
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,700
 Can I hear her then, Mr. Aldrich?

301
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,700
 I don't believe you did.

302
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,700
 I would like to see Henry.

303
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:42,700
 Hey, Mrs. Aldrich.

304
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,700
 I don't want to see him, Mr. Aldrich.

305
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:45,700
 What, Father?

306
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,700
 Charlie Clark, it's asking to see you.

307
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,700
 No, I guess you didn't understand me, Mr. Aldrich.

308
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,700
 I don't give a dine about seeing him.

309
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,700
 Oh, sorry, are you here?

310
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,700
 Yeah.

311
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:57,700
 Who did it in the... Oh, Jean, hello, Charlie.

312
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:58,700
 Oh.

313
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,700
 Hey, how did you see Mary? He went to the other side.

314
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,700
 Now, Father, before I hear me, I want to ask her what time I'm to come over tonight.

315
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:06,700
 And every time I call, I give me your mother and start looking for you.

316
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,700
 Well, listen, Charlie.

317
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:11,700
 Like this man, home and I are very busy trying to find a flashlight.

318
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,700
 Oh, you want a flashlight? Well, why didn't you tell me?

319
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,700
 You mean, you've got one, sure. I hear on my key ring.

320
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,700
 Sort of small, though.

321
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,700
 What is this happening? A flashlight? A flashlight?

322
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,260
 Let me have a beer.

323
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:23,500
 Come on, let's see what we can dig up on the closet.

324
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,060
 We're gonna dig something up, fellas.

325
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:26,580
 Can I watch him? Wait a second.

326
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:28,100
 Charlie, how do you work this?

327
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,900
 He can't. The battery's dead.

328
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:32,740
 Listen, Charlie. Are you trying to be funny?

329
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,260
 I'll locate a battery someday.

330
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,100
 The water isn't gonna last forever.

331
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,900
 What are you gonna do with that table, Anne Henry?

332
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:40,060
 I'll just go take it for a front-hole closet for something.

333
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:41,460
 But how about Mary?

334
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:43,900
 Ken, you hear me, Henry? How about Mary?

335
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,580
 Here, Henry. Here's a floor, Claude.

336
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:47,540
 Right near the closet door.

337
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:49,300
 Look, it lights up the whole clock.

338
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:52,340
 Henry, would I be bothering you now if I asked a simple statement?

339
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:54,140
 Gee, I'm gonna look at them.

340
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:56,540
 - No, I'm gonna pull them off, please. - Oh, no.

341
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:58,300
 We didn't get even half of them.

342
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,940
 What are those little black things you're picking up, fellas?

343
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:03,020
 Listen, Henry. I'll hold you in my hand,

344
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:04,300
 and you do the picking up.

345
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,740
 Well, hold your hand, big fellas.

346
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:09,300
 - Father, I saw you, Lord, come on, yes! - Oh, boy.

347
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,020
 No, Mary, I'm still here. Wait a minute.

348
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:13,140
 - Well, I am! - Oh, please, wait a minute.

349
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:15,540
 Now, listen, Troy, you want to take that lamp for?

350
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,540
 I'm all right. Now wait a minute.

351
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:18,540
 Now you put on.

352
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:21,540
 Listen, Henry, what am I gonna do with these two handfuls of charters?

353
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:24,540
 Let me see that in the box. I'm gonna pick up this lamp first.

354
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,540
 Alice, is that your gun wrong?

355
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:27,540
 Oh boy.

356
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,540
 Was that my aunt, Harry, at the just team in the front door?

357
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:31,540
 Where are you, Alice? In the business room?

358
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:34,540
 Come on. What's the end of the dining room before she gets me at the school?

359
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:36,540
 Henry, what am I gonna do with these charters?

360
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,540
 Oh, put them in your box. They're crazy.

361
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:40,540
 Isn't that additional, darling?

362
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:42,540
 Oh, dear. Put them in the next.

363
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,540
 Oh, my glad to get rid of those.

364
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:46,540
 Now Homer, don't wipe your hands on the table floor.

365
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:47,540
 I'm not.

366
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,540
 I was just feeling it.

367
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,540
 See what kind of material it is.

368
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:53,540
 Look out while I shut the dishes of chocolate behind the fruit bowl.

369
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:55,540
 You feel any more freedom?

370
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:56,540
 No, how can you?

371
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:57,540
 Can I try?

372
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:58,540
 Can I try?

373
00:11:58,540 --> 00:11:59,540
 No, Mary.

374
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:00,540
 Are you looking for?

375
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:01,540
 I know.

376
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:02,540
 I'm trying to get away from you.

377
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:03,540
 Keep on me after the kitchen.

378
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:04,540
 I went out for that too.

379
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:05,540
 And now I just came in the classroom.

380
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:07,540
 Mary, is that you in the dining room?

381
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:08,540
 Yes, but I'm not so low.

382
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:09,540
 Sorry, quiet.

383
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:10,540
 Was looking for you.

384
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:11,540
 Did he find you?

385
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,380
 for you.

386
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:13,220
 Did he find you?

387
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:14,220
 I don't think so.

388
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:15,780
 Homer, what do you have on your hand?

389
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:18,740
 White, a man, boy.

390
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:19,780
 Say, look, look, look, look.

391
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,620
 I've got him in my puddle now, son.

392
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:22,740
 You better go up and watch him.

393
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,540
 Yes, Mr. Hall, make you mind, Henry.

394
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:25,220
 OK.

395
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:27,380
 And if you see your mother off back out of your Aunt Harry,

396
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:28,940
 that's waiting to see her in the living room.

397
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:30,420
 Father, what are you looking for?

398
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:32,420
 Lamping, oh, let's think to be something wrong with one

399
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:33,180
 of my shoes.

400
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:34,900
 Give me my hat, huh?

401
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:37,300
 I have a pair of shoes in the hall closet, and maybe

402
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:38,580
 my imagination, but I think there's

403
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:40,180
 something down in the door of one.

404
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:43,700
 - Nellie, how long did you take it out? - It's probably just a lining or something.

405
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,980
 It's soft and it's give, it's not warm.

406
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:48,420
 - Hey! - Are you following me?

407
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:50,780
 - Yes, out of it. How did it wait until you were in the living room?

408
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:53,300
 - Yes. How are you? I'll be right in there.

409
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,340
 - Great. - Where did this come from?

410
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:58,220
 - How does it matter? - There's two people standing behind the pool.

411
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:00,940
 Now, dear, you didn't go and open that box your way, I'm glad you did.

412
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:03,700
 - No, no, because remember, I can't pass you on to the pool.

413
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,020
 - Mary, I didn't put this here. - Mm-hmm.

414
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:08,340
 - See, you don't want your Aunt Harriet brought it, do you?

415
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:10,140
 - Who thinks she liked it? - Why, of course, he did.

416
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:12,740
 He's always carrying little paper bags of candy around there.

417
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:14,540
 - What do you have a thing? - A mary.

418
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:16,540
 - I've been to my return on clothing in our home.

419
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:18,140
 - Mary, you can't keep coming away from her.

420
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:20,340
 - I'm not going to say here. - No, Mary.

421
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:23,540
 - Come over to you, Queen Mary. - Have I been married, darling?

422
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:25,340
 - I'll have a different ring you want to see.

423
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:28,140
 - Isn't it funny I can't make that clear to anyone?

424
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,940
 - It's Mary I want. - Here, dear.

425
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:32,340
 - Will you have a topic? - Thanks. I don't mind if I do.

426
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:34,740
 - Mary, do I have to go home and I'll find a flashlight?

427
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:36,940
 - It's nice, Leiden. - What did you want it for?

428
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:39,140
 - My little particular ring, can we just...

429
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:41,740
 This is all it's one in fact you've got in my seat.

430
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:43,740
 Handy, homo, would you have a seat?

431
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:44,740
 Handy.

432
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:45,940
 Handy, yes, dear.

433
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:47,240
 Go ahead and take one.

434
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,540
 Well, homo, I don't think you ought to touch it.

435
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:50,840
 And that's true.

436
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:53,240
 Then, Mrs. Hall, it's failed for an eighth, Nancy.

437
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,740
 Don't you think you ought to get the reason?

438
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:55,240
 Sure.

439

 And the night when, maybe, it's better for Mr.

440
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,140
 Hall, which is long as they aren't having any way.

441
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:00,740
 I have very blessed, Charlie.

442
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,840
 After we've been down on our hands and knees,

443
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,140
 I knew he had Charlie.

444
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,940
 And perhaps I'd better take these and to Henry's

445
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:08,940
 - Hey, Dad, holly, a brother's house is left.

446
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:11,520
 - Henry, what do you think?

447
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,680
 - What about over there?

448
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,940
 - Who's gonna leave an awful big hole, Henry?

449
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,320
 - Don't you think we ought to try to get them away

450
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,160
 from your mother?

451
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,820
 - Homer, let's call what she just took into the living room.

452
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:22,120
 - So much water under the dam, and go on from there.

453
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,920
 - Listen, fellas, where did Mary go?

454
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,080
 - Henry, what are you looking at a sideboard for?

455
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,960
 - Somewhere in this household, there's a flashlight.

456
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,360
 - Oh, boy. - Let's see, Henry.

457
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,520
 - What have you found, fellas?

458
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,720
 - Can you imagine that?

459
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,200
 - Listen, fellas, what have you found?

460
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,200
 Charlie, I want you to do something, Bonnie.

461
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,200
 You go up to my room.

462
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,200
 Yeah?

463
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,200
 And you sit there until we come up.

464
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,200
 And then you're going to fix me up with Mary?

465
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,200
 Yeah, sure.

466
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,200
 Okay, but don't forget me.

467
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,200
 We won't forget you, Charlie.

 Homer.

469
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,200
 Oh, look at why I dug up in the sideboard.

470
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,200
 What?

471
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,200
 Another box of candy.

472
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,200
 And look, it's exactly like the one we still.

473
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,200
 Henry, we're all sick.

474
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,200
 We just take this into the hall part.

475
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,200
 This is for some of these in the Mary's box.

476
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,200
 Come on.

00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,200
 Do you think that'll be all right?

478
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,200
 Well, you don't want to rob your own sister to me.

479
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,600
 And the phone is you don't know who needs belong to?

480
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,300
 Okay.

481
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,000
 Wait a second while I open the closet door.

 Fine.

486
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,700
 Let us out on the top cell.

487

 Wait a minute and I'll boost you up.

 I'll hurry up Homer.

 Oh boy.

00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:31,820
 Now getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldrich.

573
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:35,820
 Henry accidentally spilled a box of Mary's chocolates in the hall closet.

574
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:38,820
 Later, without realizing it was the same box,

575
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:41,120
 he found one in the dining room buffet

576
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:44,920
 and was about to place it in the hall closet when Homer fell on it.

577
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:48,020
 The scene opens an hour later in to Haven's drugstore.

578
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:50,420
 Oh, Mr. Haven. Mr. Haven.

579
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:52,220
 Yes, there is something I can do for you.

580
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:54,120
 How much is old box of chocolates there?

581
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,220
 The two-pound box that sits down in half.

582
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:59,320
 A dollar and a half, Mr. D. Haven. As much as that.

583
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,420
 Well, here's a one-pound box for 80 cents.

584
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,920
 He always probably has to be the kind home of fell on.

585
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:07,920
 I mean, Mr. Behaven, you couldn't trust me for a dollar and a half, could you?

586
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:13,320
 Well, isn't it? I don't trust you, Henry, but if you'd like me too, I could call your mother and ask her for all right to charge it to her.

587
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,720
 Oh, no, don't bother my mother about a thing like this.

588
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:19,720
 Mr. Behaven, you don't have any chocolate at all like those in that box.

589
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,520
 For less than a dollar and a half.

00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,520
 No, over.

00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,720
 Hmm.

592
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:30,920
 Well, Mr. Behaven, do you have anything that would be good for removing chocolate creams like those in that box on trousers?

593
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:33,420
 - Oh, tell me you want a spot remover? - Yes, only first.

594
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:36,420
 How much is it? - We have pretty good cleaner here for 25 cents.

595
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,920
 - Nothing less than that. - Oh, I'm sorry.

596
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:42,920
 Well, do you have anything that would be good for an unsettled stomach?

 Resolving from chocolate foods like those in that box.

598
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:48,420
 - Or you'd like some by-car? - One hundred more chisels.

599
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:51,920
 - One dime. - Yeah, I'm getting anything that would settle me for a nickel.

600
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:55,420
 I could give you a little fizzy water free.

601
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:58,920
 Okay, let's try that first before I throw my money away.

 Hey, fellas, where have you been?

603
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,880
 She was at Charlie's car.

604
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,880
 I'll wait up in your room for you for an hour, Henry.

605

606
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,600
 Don't forget, I gave you that baseball.

607
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,240
 Charlie, we had to come out here to see about some candy.

608
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:13,040
 Oh, Mr. Behaven, do you have any hair oil that smells nice?

609
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,040
 And say fellas, does Mary like candy?

00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,240

611
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,120

612
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:18,960

00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,080
 Oh, no.

616
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:24,880
 We can't do that.

617

618
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,080
 Is it done here?

619
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,840
 Charlie, that is in the kind she likes.

00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,680
 You know, listen, hold on. I'm not going to have any part of this.

00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,360
 - She just left. - What?

633
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,280
 Do you think she might have taken my box of chocolate?

634
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:56,960
 No.

635
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,260
 Your Aunt Harry is not in the habit of taking candies.

636
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:00,460
 It doesn't belong to us.

637
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:02,760
 Well, I guess these just three people that might have taken it.

638
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:03,760
 And who are they?

639
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,460
 Your Harry or her or Charlie Clark are possibly all three.

640
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:08,660
 Now, Mary, that isn't exactly fair.

641
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:11,260
 You probably intended to put the box of candy in the sideboard

642
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:13,160
 and add some mind and let's put it some other place.

 And his soap pan?

645
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,860
 Yes, Alex, I'd like to wash my hands.

 Well, nothing there.

 Chocolate?

650
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,260
 I think it's chocolate.

 I have to look at my hand a little while ago and it was all chocolate.

 After all, is that important? Where will I find a piece of soap?

654

 - Feel, I don't think I've ever been so mad at you in my life.

 - Mad at me? - What about us?

 - Oh, just start and read. - And Harriet, you want me to hold your pocket before you put it out?

 - No, thank you. I can put it out. - Oh, it's my good enough for falling on me.

00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,460
 Listen, Troy. I'm advising you.

706
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:29,560
 I'm begging you.

707
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,260
 Don't give Mary that Box of Canden.

708
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:33,060
 I'm not taking any advice from you, Henry.

709
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:36,360
 I gave you a baseball and you don't even want to fix me up with your sister.

710
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,060
 Hey, Mary. Mary!

711
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:39,660
 Yes, he's not going to call me.

712
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:40,660
 I'm here.

713
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:41,660
 Here, here.

714
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:42,660
 I see.

715
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:43,660
 It's a box of candy.

716
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:44,660
 Show me, cross.

717
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:46,660
 I should have known all the time you've looked at the fly.

718
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:47,660
 Now, you didn't take it.

719
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:48,660
 What do you mean you didn't take it?

720
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:49,660
 You're already fly from here.

721
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:50,660
 Thank you, Charlie.

722
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:51,660
 Thank you very much.

723
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:52,660
 Now, please go.

724
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:53,660
 Can you hear me?

725
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:54,660
 Not at you.

726
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:55,660
 I could kill you.

727
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:56,660
 Please leave this house.

728
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:57,660
 Where do you live?

729
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:58,660
 Sorry, you hear me go.

730
00:25:58,660 --> 00:25:59,660
 I'm going.

731
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:00,660
 I'm going.

732
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:01,660
 I'm only at a minute, Charlie.

733
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:02,660
 There you're faithful.

734
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:03,660
 I feel it's the least I can do for you.
