 [Music]

2
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,200
 And now the Jell-O family presents...

3
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:15,760
 Henry Henry Oldrich!

4
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:16,860
 Coming, mother!

5
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:22,200
 [Applause]

6
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:27,200
 Yes, it's the Oldrich family based on characters originated by Clifford Goldsmith

7
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:32,200
 and starring Ezra Stone and Henry, the Jackie Celka's home.

8
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:36,200
 And yes, it's the Jell-O family with its three famous desserts.

9
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,200
 Jell-O in those six delicious flavors,

10
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,200
 regular Jell-O puddings, with that old fashioned homemade flavor,

11
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:49,200
 and Jell-O tapioca puddings, a miracle of goodness, a marvel of speed.

12
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:55,200
 Oh, the big red letters stand for the Jell-O family.

13
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:59,200
 ♪ All the big red letters stand for the Jallow Family ♪

14
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:04,200

15
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,200

17
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,200
 And now for the Aldridge Family.

18
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:23,200
 ♪♪

19
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,200
 Every typical teenage boy is a little like a bird.

20
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:35,200
 No man can follow Henry Aldrich very long, for instance, without seeing a reflection of the boy he used to be.

21
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:41,200
 The scene opens in the cafeteria at Central High School. It is right after school.

22
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:46,200
 G-Homer, do I feel great? I haven't had a soda in two whole weeks.

23
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,200
 You sure am making up for it now?

24
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:55,200
 Boy, when I think of giving up ice cream just so I wouldn't catch cold in my vocal cords.

25
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,200
 Boy, what a waste of time.

26
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,200
 Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me.

27
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,200
 I beg your pardon?

28
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,200
 Nothing.

29
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,200
 Only speaking of vocal cords, I'm just keeping mine limbered up.

30
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,200
 Homer, are you sure you don't want to sew them?

31
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,200
 No thanks.

32
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,200
 I'm not taking any chances with my voice.

33
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,200
 Me, me, me, me, me.

34
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:21,560
 Boy am I glad I'm not in the cast. Once the rehearsals for that opera ready start

35
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:28,000
 you'll be tied down every darn afternoon you poor kid. I don't learn. While I'll be as free as a bird

36
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:35,740
 I can go skating. I can go on hikes. Gee I can do all kinds of things. All by yourself, him. There's Willy, isn't there?

37
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:42,040
 Willy. He's in the chorus with me. He is? Along with Toby and Charlie? Sure.

38
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:46,040
 Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me.

39
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:49,040
 Homer. Yeah?

40
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,040
 All of a sudden I'm kind of bored sitting here.

41
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:58,040
 Look, what do you say we go upstairs and just have a look at the bulletin board?

42
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:01,040
 I thought you said you were positive, your name wouldn't be there.

43
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,040
 Sure I'm positive, it just couldn't be there.

44
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,040
 Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me.

45
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:09,040
 Homer, are you sure you didn't see my name anywhere on the list?

46
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,040
 And I told you all I saw was my own name.

47
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,040
 Gee, that's a relief.

48
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:18,040
 I don't know why I ever tried out for the darn thing in the first place.

49
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,040
 Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me.

50
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,040
 And besides Homer,

51
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:26,040
 besides do you really think Gilbert and Sullivan is any good anymore?

52
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,040
 Sure, don't you?

53
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,040
 Especially the Maccato.

54
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,040
 See, the way they'll have to make you up, nobody will ever recognize you.

55
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,040
 Not even your own family.

56
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,040
 Me, me, me, me, me, me.

57
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:51,040
 Homer, I don't like to be rude, but if all you're going to say from now on is me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me.

58
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,040
 Frankly, the conversation's bound to get a little dull.

59
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:57,040
 Henry, Henry, it's Geraldine Love. I wonder if she's in the camp.

60
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,040
 Forget it, Homer. There are other people interested in other things other than operatic.

61
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:03,600
 Why? Because I drank four chocolate sundies in a row.

62
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,560
 Henry, I saw your name, you modest thing, you.

63
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,400
 Who me? You saw his name, where?

64
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,520
 I'm the bottom part, my goodness.

65
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,640
 What? But I didn't make the operator. It's impossible.

66
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:16,280
 You certainly did. Your name's up there. As large as large.

67
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,400
 Why? Sure.

68
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:21,640
 There must be some mistake, Gerald. You must have seen Hank Oderdice's name.

69
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,400
 Henry, where are you going?

70
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:29,000
 No place exactly. I just thought I'd casually go up and see who is...

71
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 Well whose name is like mine?

72
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:41,220
 But Mr. Cooper...

73
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:44,000
 Mildred, how on earth did his name ever get on that list?

74
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,300
 I'm almost positive you dictated it to...

75
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,860
 Why would I do a thing like that?

76
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:50,440
 Henry Aldridge and the leading role of the Macabre?

77
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,100
 I know!

78
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:55,100
 Mildred, you'll just have to hunt him up immediately and tell him a whole thing was a mistake.

79
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,100
 You mean I have to tell him?

80
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,600
 Mr. Cooper?

81
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,600
 May I have a word with you please?

82
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,600
 Oh certainly Mr. Bradley, on your way, Milvie.

83
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,600
 Milvie?

84
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:09,600
 No Mr. Cooper, my calendar tells me we're nearing a Poretta time again.

85
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,600
 Yes sir, yes indeed.

86
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,600
 Yes.

87
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,600
 Now there's nothing that takes me happy, Mr. Cooper, then to see you put on your little show once a year.

88
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,600
 Thank you sir.

89
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:24,600
 And when the time comes I'll buy my ticket and I'll attend the performance as a total stranger. I hope...

90
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,600
 That's fine Mr. Bradley.

91
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:33,200
 I mean by that, Mr. Cooper, I'd appreciate it if I could be completely excluded from all plans and preparations.

92
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,200
 Oh, certainly, sir.

93
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:38,000
 And I trust you'll keep the auditorium doors tightly closed during rehearsal.

94
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,920
 Oh, yes, sir. Yes, sir.

95
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,520
 Tightly.

96
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,520
 Yes.

97
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:45,800
 And you'll also do everything in your power to see that the entire school isn't disrupted by your little show.

98
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,160
 I give you my word, Mr. Bradley. Nothing will go wrong this year.

99
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:52,400
 And let's not borrow quite so much furniture this time.

100
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,300
 Sir?

101
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:56,000
 We were still returning last year's in June.

102
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,600
 Excuse me, Mr. Cooper.

103
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,000
 - Henry, how are you? - How are you?

104
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,560
 - And how are you feeling, Mr. Brad? - Just fine, Henry.

105
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,200
 How are you? - Me, boy.

106
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,800
 I'm on top of the world.

107
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,320
 - Henry, if you'll step back into the hall,

108
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,600
 Mildred has something to say to you.

109
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,880
 - She wants to give me my part? - She'll tell you about it.

110
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,960
 - Okay. And thank you for everything, sir.

111
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:19,000
 - Mr. Cooper, don't you think it'll be more official

112
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,440
 like you told him? - Mildred, it was your mistake.

113
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,920
 - Upper-resid trouble, Mr. Cooper. So, so...

114
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:27,160
 It's nothing for you to worry about, Mr. Bradley. I assure you.

115
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,720
 Goodbye, Mildred.

116
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,160
 Oh, dear.

117
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,920
 Mildred, did you hear the good news about me?

118
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,120
 Listen, Henry.

119
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:38,920
 Boy, this is the first decent break I've had since the Princess and the Woodcutter.

120
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,920
 Henry, there's something I have to carry me.

121
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,520
 It was in kindergarten, see?

122
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:45,520
 And I could swing in the axis as well as the next fella.

123
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,520
 But the whole trouble was my hair.

124
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,520
 Henry!

125
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,920
 A little kid with curly hair got the part.

126
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,920
 But I didn't mind.

127
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,600
 see my life was just starting.

128
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,120
 Henry, please listen to me.

129
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:57,960
 What's the matter, Milgrid?

130
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,960
 Didn't you get apart in the opera, Ren?

131
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,160
 Because if you didn't, I'd be glad to ask Mr. Cooper

132
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,880
 to give you another chance.

133
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,800
 Henry, you're only making things worse.

134
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,400
 What's going on here?

135
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,400
 Well, nothing, Mr. Bradley.

136
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,400
 I was just telling you--

137
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,160
 I can't do it, that's all.

138
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,880
 Only one of you said to Milgrid to upset her like that.

139
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:16,880
 What?

140
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,880
 Nothing.

141
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,640
 Nothing.

142
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,160
 What did you say to her?

143
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,640
 Well, do you all we were talking about

144
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,640
 That was the opera-retta, Mr. Bradley.

145
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:27,240
 Opera-retta? So it's starting to accept the entire school already.

146
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:31,640
 Mr. Bradley, I hope you don't feel that getting the leading part is going to my head.

147
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:34,640
 What's that? The leading part? You?

148
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,640
 You mean you're bold over, too?

149
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:48,640
 I'm very glad you followed Mr. Cooper.

150
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:54,020
 considering writing him a letter Mrs. Aldrich, but then it occurred to me that his mother might be the best one to tell him.

151
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:56,980
 No, I'm sure I won't have any difficulty, Mr. Cooper.

152
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:59,520
 I can't tell you how sorry I am the whole thing happened.

153
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:04,140
 Oh, well, I'm sure Henry doesn't really believe he's playing the lead in your operata.

154
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:04,940
 He doesn't?

155
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:08,300
 There's one thing about us Aldrich is we know our failing.

156
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,140
 Yes, but...

157
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:12,980
 And just between you and me, Mr. Cooper, Henry can't sing a note.

158
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:17,300
 Oh, I wouldn't say that, Mrs. Aldrich. It's just that he can't sing them in the right order.

159
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:20,300
 I think I hear him coming in now.

160
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:23,300
 Oh, I'm sure I won't have any trouble.

161
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,300
 Goodbye.

162
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:28,300
 Then screw eye a thing of reds and hatches.

163
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,300
 About its songs and hello mother.

164
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,300
 Hello, Henry.

165
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,300
 Three guesses what I'm seeing.

166
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,300
 I'm outta here.

167
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,300
 Yes, dear.

168
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:36,300
 And guess what else?

169
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,900
 I'm the play the lead in the operator.

170
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:39,900
 Yes, dear.

171
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:40,900
 Sit down.

172
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:41,900
 Sit down?

173
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,540
 Gee, I can't take time to sit down for the next month.

174
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:45,500
 I've got to get started on my homework.

175
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,500
 Your homework?

176
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,500
 Sure.

177
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,500
 I'm going to get some decent marks so I don't get thrown out of the cast.

178
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,140
 Henry, you can sit down for a minute.

179
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:54,100
 You and I have to have a little talk.

180
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,100
 We do?

181
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,100
 Okay.

182
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,100
 And now then.

183
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,100
 Mmm, me, me, me, me, me, me.

184
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,700
 Hey, do you think that's nice?

185
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,500
 You go ahead and talk, mother.

186
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:09,500
 I'll just be rehearsing in between me me me me me me me me me.

187
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:19,340
 Henry. Yes Father.

188
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:21,300
 Uh. What Father.

189
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:26,820
 Yeah that is uh your mother wanted me to explain something to you so uh

190
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:31,660
 did you enjoy your dinner son. I'll say boy who wouldn't enjoy a dinner like

191
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:32,660
 Yes.

192
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:36,460
 Why do you suppose mother had all my favorite things tonight?

193
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:38,620
 Even strawberry shortcake, allum mode.

194
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:43,100
 Oh, that's because, well, we're all extremely fond of you, son.

195
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,100
 You are?

196
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,100
 Extremely.

197
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,100
 Gee, thanks.

198
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,100
 Sit down, Henry.

199
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,100
 Sure.

200
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,100
 And anyway, I think I know.

201
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,100
 Know what?

202
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:55,140
 Why everybody in the family suddenly being so nice to me?

203
00:09:55,140 --> 00:10:00,140
 Because for the first time in my natural life, you can be proud of me.

204
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:04,720
 Henry, some people might be proud to cause their children can play a leading role in an operator, but

205
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,920
 Personally, you know how I judge my children. How?

206
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:14,400
 By the way, they can take a disappointment. Oh boy. I've certainly taken plenty of them in my time

207
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:24,600
 Well now and you know father when I used to come home from school year after year and you'd say did you make the football team or

208
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,080
 Are you in the orchestra?

209
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,580
 And I'd say no.

210
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:29,520
 - The Henry... - And you used to say to me,

211
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:32,220
 "Gee whiz, Henry, why let them get you down?"

212
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:34,020
 So you didn't make it this year.

213
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:36,580
 Okay, keep trying. You'll make it next year.

214
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:39,920
 - The Henry... - Well, now I'll let you in on a secret, father.

215
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,520
 Frankly, I always thought you were kind of talking through your hat.

216
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:46,420
 - Oh, you did? - But now...

217
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:49,860
 Boy, now I realize that's all a person has to do.

218
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,160
 Just keep trying.

219
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,700
 And sooner or later, you're bound to get a break.

220
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:54,740
 - That's true.

221
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:56,160
 But on the other hand...

222
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:01,160
 And G-Father, as long as I live, I'll never forget that lesson you taught me.

223
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,660
 Yeah.

224
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:05,120
 Uh, would you excuse me a minute?

225
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,120
 Alice!

226
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,120
 Father, what is it you wanted to tell us?

227
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,120
 Alice, where are you?

228
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,120
 Out here in the hall.

229
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,120
 What did you tell him, Sam?

230
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,120
 Well, we...

231
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,120
 We've been discussing it.

232
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,120
 You mean you haven't told us?

233
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,720
 Alice, it isn't just the fact that he thinks he's playing the lead, it's...

234
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,720
 It's what, Sam.

235
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,720
 Look, why can't we phone the school and have someone there tell him?

236
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,720
 There are thoughts you were impatient with me because I was afraid to tell him.

237
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,720
 Alice, I don't think you realize how important this is to the boy.

238
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,720
 Hey, Henry!

239
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,720
 Hello, everybody, isn't it wonderful?

240
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,720
 Well, what's wonderful, Homa?

241
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:41,720
 She either way Henry's overcome all his handicaps and landed on top of the pile.

242
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,720
 What's that?

243
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,720
 Hey, Hannah, you in the living room?

244
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:46,720
 Sam, what does he mean by Henry's handicap?

245
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,720
 Hi, Homer, you're just in time.

246
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,720
 I am for why?

247
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:53,720
 I'm just going to do a little rehearsing. You can tell me if I hit a bum note here and there.

248
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,720
 You? A bum note?

249
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,720
 I hit them Homer, I hit them.

250
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:04,720
 Oh, don't worry. You're just being modest. Didn't Mr. Cooper pick you for the lead out of the whole school?

251
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,720
 Yeah, and the more I think about it, the more I'm more surprised than anybody.

252
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,720
 Come on, you want me to play the piano for you?

253
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,720
 Sure, here's the music.

254
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,720
 Okay. Let her rip.

255
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,720
 Mmm.

256
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,720
 Mmm.

257
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,720
 [guitar]

258
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,720
 Now Henry.

259
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:32,720
 Now Henry, the flowers that bloom in the spring, tah-ah-ah. What happened to the tah-ah? You must have hit a wrong note. I guess so. Well, let's start again.

260
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:45,720
 The flowers that bloom in the spring. Yes, Father? You come into the dining room for the moment. Sure. Homer, you'll be practicing that part meanwhile. What is it, Father?

261
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:52,720
 And I've just been having a discussion with about something with your mother, and I wanted your opinion.

262
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,720
 Sure. Is it regarding music?

263
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:59,720
 Well, not exactly. In a few weeks, Henry, I'm making a trip to Washington, non-business,

264
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,720
 and your mother and I wondered if you wouldn't like to go along.

265
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,720
 To Washington? No!

266
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,720
 Yes.

267
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:09,720
 See, there's nothing in this world I'd rather do. Boy!

268
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:14,720
 Of course it would mean resigning from the operator, but after all, a trip to Washington.

269
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,520
 Father, when would you be going?

270
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,520
 What is the operator?

271
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,920
 The week of the 27th.

272
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,220
 That's when we're going.

273
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:23,720
 [LAUGHTER]

274
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,520
 You mean I'd have to give up my part?

275
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,720
 I'm afraid so.

276
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,520
 But father, what would Mr. Cooper say?

277
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,520
 Everybody think I was walking out on them.

278
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,320
 Henry, I'm sure you could explain it to them.

279
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,120
 I couldn't explain it to Geraldine Berry

280
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,520
 while she's playing opposite me.

281
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,120
 Oh, yes.

282
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,920
 She might even take it personally.

283
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,520
 What, Henry, you've never been to Washington, DC.

284
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,520
 It's the capital of your country.

285
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,520
 Sure, Father.

286
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,840
 And I appreciate your offering me the trip.

287
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,680
 But the headway.

288
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,440
 But duty comes first.

289
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,720
 Come on Homer, let's get back to work.

290
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,080
 Okay, and I think I know where I was making my mistake.

291
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,080
 Let's go.

292
00:13:55,080 --> 00:14:00,320
 The flowers that bloom in the spring.

293
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:05,320
 Trola, breathe promise of Mary, sunshine.

294
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:08,880
 As we merrily dance and we sing.

295
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,680
 Trola, hey Homer.

296
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,360
 Yeah?

297
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:16,360
 You got a little closer that time, but you're still kind of flat.

298
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,360
 [audience laughter]

299
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,860
 I'm very sorry, him.

300
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:19,860
 Oh, that's okay.

301
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:22,360
 Some people just don't have any ears for music.

302
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,660
 It isn't there for.

303
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:26,360
 She, I could have sworn I was sticking to the music.

304
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,360
 The Henry?

305
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,360
 Yes, mother.

306
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:31,360
 Dear, have you looked at it this way?

307
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,360
 Look at what?

308
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,360
 There really isn't any money in singing.

309
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,360
 There isn't?

310
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,360
 I'm afraid not, dear.

311
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,860
 You see, organizations that hire singers usually can't afford to pay very much.

312
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:44,860
 Well, I know. For instance, you take our church group.

313
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:48,860
 While we'd love to be able to afford a singer, our budget just won't permit it.

314
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:53,860
 Gee, whiz, mother, if that's all you're worried about, I'd be glad to sing at your church.

315
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:56,860
 And I wouldn't think of charging.

316
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:58,860
 Oh, dear.

317
00:14:58,860 --> 00:14:59,860
 Sam!

318
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:11,860
 [Music]

319
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:18,860
 [Music]

320
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:21,860
 Henry isn't the only one who's anxious to say it.

321
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:27,860
 Here are a few notes from Meredith Wilson and his talking people.

322
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,380
 Intermission!

323
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:31,020
 Intermission!

324
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:33,660
 Jello is the grandest dessert in the world.

325
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,300
 And now back to the office.

326
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,020
 Hey, wait just a minute here.

327
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:40,900
 How can you interrupt the office family in such a crucial situation?

328
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:45,220
 Well, you can always interrupt with anything as tempting as Jello's six delicious flavors.

329
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:47,220
 Starting with strawberry, we we we we

330
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:49,220
 Raspberry, we we we

331
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:51,220
 Orange, lemon, you

332
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:58,220
 And every one of those rich fruit-like flavors reminds you of the real right fruit itself.

333
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:03,220
 Flavor that's locked right into Jell-O locked in so that it can't possibly get out until your first

334
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,220
 Electible spoonful.

335
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:05,220
 That's fine.

336
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,220
 You can listen over.

337
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:09,220
 Curtain, curtain, curtain going on.

338
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:10,220
 Hey, hold it there.

339
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,220
 Intermission is not over.

340
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:15,220
 I haven't even begun to tell the people half of the wonderful things about Jell-O.

00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:49,580
 Yes, getting back to the troubles of Henry Olives. You know, mistake, Henry has got me

349
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:54,180
 impression that he has to play the lead in the school's production of the Maccada.

350
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:59,580
 The task of informing Henry of the error has been passed from one to the other with

351
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:05,260
 the result that no one has told him. The scene opens in Geraldine Love's house. It is the

 You see, up until recently, I didn't have any voice to speak of.

382

 Yes, sir.

387
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:43,700
 And since my folks have poured so much money into you in the past, I thought I'd try to swing this myself.

00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:47,700
 Well, suppose you sing something for me.

 It certainly is.

513
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:20,680
 And to think I dreaded telling Henry that instead of playing the lead he was to the head stage manager

514
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:27,760
 The best stage manager central high ever hey, yeah nobody but a boy could take it on the chin like that and bounce right back again

515
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:31,180
 Henry, what are you doing with that suitcase?

516
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:35,800
 She was a whole pack what time does our train leave my train for Washington for watching

517
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:39,600
 What sure father isn't it the night you said you were taking me

518
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:45,500
 - Alle, Sam. - Henry, your mother has something to tell you.

519
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,500
 - Sam, how did you come back here?

520
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,500
 - Oh, you mean?

521
00:25:49,500 --> 00:26:05,500
 - Boy, Geraldine, you were swelling tonight's operation.

522
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:08,500
 - Oh, thanks, Henry. You were a wonderful business manager, too.

523
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:13,260
 You know, you could make singing your whole future career.

524
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:15,460
 Oh no, I've got another career.

525
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:16,460
 I'll kick down.

526
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:17,460
 You have?

527
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:18,460
 My goodness, yes.

528
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:20,460
 I want to marry a famous businessman.

529
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:23,460
 Don't you mean a business manager?

530
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:30,140
 Well, speaking of careers, one of famous one Jello is made for itself as America's favorite

532

 Yes, Jello.

533
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:36,580
 The luscious shimmering dessert that comes in six delicious flavors.

534
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:40,180
 Strawberry, raspberry, cherry, orange, lemon, and lime.

535
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:43,540
 All things rich with that famous, locked-in goodness.

00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:47,020
 Tomorrow, try Jell-O Peach and Banana Mole.

537
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:50,300
 Just prepare one package of lime, Jell-O as usual.

538
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:53,900
 Then pour your Jell-O over one half cup of drained can,

00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:56,980
 sliced cling peaches, arranged in a mole.

540
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:59,900
 Add one sliced banana and chill until firm.

00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,860

542
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:04,860
 and it's so gay to look at, so tempting to eat.

 Last year, one person died every minute from heart disease.

00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:38,180
 Let's do something about it.

549

 Money can help the fight against heart disease.

 So open your heart and give.
