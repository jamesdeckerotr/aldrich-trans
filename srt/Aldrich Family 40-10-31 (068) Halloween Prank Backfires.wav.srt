 The Albright family, written by Clifford Goldsmith and starring Ezra Stone.

00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,760
 Henry! Henry Albright!

4
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:17,960
 Coming, mother!

00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,960

8
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:45,960
 You know ladies and gentlemen scarcely a day passes that doesn't bring us a letter from some housewife praising Jell-O better scotch pudding.

9
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,960
 Many of these letters read somewhat as follows.

10
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,960
 I've tried just about every ready prepared pudding on the market.

11
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,960
 And jello butterscotch pudding is the one for me.

12
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,960
 Other letters, of course, speak of how easy jello butterscotch pudding is to make,

13
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,960
 because you simply add milk, cook for a few minutes, and cool.

14
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,960
 And still other letters tell us how grateful housewives are

15
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,960
 for the many ways you can serve jello butterscotch pudding.

16
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,960
 But the big point is its flavor, the warm buttery brown sugar flavor

17
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,840
 sugar flavor of creamy, golden butterscotch.

18
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,840
 Just the way you like it, full of rich homemade goodness.

19
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,960
 Yes, friends, you like yellow butterscotch pudding a lot, so just try it.

20
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,220
 And let your own taste tell you why yellow butterscotch pudding is the pudding that thousands

21
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:28,880
 call the best of all.

 [Music]

23
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:50,880
 If your doorbell rings tonight, when you answer it and find no one there,

24
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,880
 you remember that this is Halloween and that you too were a chance for yourself.

25
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:01,880
 And you might suspect Henry Aldrich of having something to do with the prank, because he's a real boy from your own neighborhood.

26
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:05,880
 Tonight we find Henry in the Aldrich living room with his friend Toby.

27
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,880
 Gee whiz am I bored?

28
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:10,880
 Same here, Henry.

29
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:15,880
 How could a thing like this happen, Toby? A Halloween in the two of us are dead broke.

30
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:18,880
 Gee, I thought I'd never lived to see a thing like this happen.

31
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:23,880
 Wouldn't you think, Toby, that there'd be at least one thing a person could do on Halloween without its costing money?

32
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:28,200
 money. That's what you'd think. How about going over and getting even with Mr.

33
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:32,880
 Tarbell for what he did a year ago? How? Well we could think of something. I'll tell

34
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:36,320
 you what. If we could get his front steps loose from the porch we could hide them.

35
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:40,640
 No, tell me. But Henry, then when he comes out and starts to go down the steps you

36
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:45,480
 wonder where they are. Who will wonder where what is? Oh is that you father?

37
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:50,560
 You're not going to touch anyone's front steps. How do you know about that? I'm

38
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,960
 I'm psychic.

39
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:55,360
 Halloween or no Halloween, you boys are not to touch any private property.

40
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,760
 Henry, are you in the living room?

41
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,960
 Yes, mother.

42
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,960
 She was father.

43
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:02,360
 Toby and I don't want to just sit around and look at each other all evening.

44
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,060
 How would you like to have me make some candy?

45
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,960
 Mother candy.

46
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:10,060
 Everybody else is out doing things and we sit home and make candy.

47
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:12,860
 Well, if you'd planned ahead, you'd have enough money to go to a den.

48
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,060
 I did plan ahead.

49
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:17,060
 I told you several weeks ago that my allowance is an adequate.

50
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:18,060
 Yes.

51
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:23,060
 Henry, what do you say we'd get our hats and go out for a little stroll?

52
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:25,060
 All right.

53
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:27,560
 You aren't going to play any practical jokes on anyone, are you?

54
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,060
 Oh, oh no, Mr. Olvich.

55
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:33,060
 We're just going out for the fresh air and maybe ring one or two doorbells.

56
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:36,060
 Henry, you're not going to ring any doorbells.

57
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:39,060
 But, Mother, what harm can come from innocently ringing just one doorbell?

58
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:42,060
 That's wrong 50 million times in the year anyway.

59
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:44,060
 Because most people don't like it.

60
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:47,060
 Henry, the minute you begin to trespass, you're liable to run into trouble.

61
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:50,460
 They're named one thing that could happen from sticking a pin into a doorbell

62
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:55,120
 Aside from the fact that it's going to ring for a while. I'm not going to argue

63
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:02,600
 Probably I don't think I'll go out. No wall here ever since way back. I've been looking forward to tonight

64
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:06,160
 And now it's here and I can't even stick a pin in a doorbell

65
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:10,740
 Sam if Henry didn't actually stick a pin in it couldn't he ring just one bell?

66
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:16,480
 It's entirely up to you, Alice. All we do is ring it and run father. Don't look at me, son

67
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:21,400
 I'm only your father. I don't see what fun that could be in at least my whole year wouldn't be ruined

68
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,820
 Well, could you ring a bell when no one is home?

69
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:26,520
 mother

70
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:33,700
 Right if it'll make you any happier go out and ring one bell we can father we can't just told me come on

71
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:37,140
 Okay, I don't see what fun you'll get brother at least we can say we've done it

72
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:44,000
 Henry I've got an idea what my folks didn't say I couldn't ring more than one. I'll tell you

73
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,300
 I'll do the ringing and you do the running.

74
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,800
 Okay, let's ring Mr. Edwards's bell first.

75
00:04:48,800 --> 00:05:02,800
 [MUSIC]

76
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,140
 John.

77
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:06,800
 John Edwards, are you out there on the porch without any hat on?

78
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,200
 I am.

79
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,100
 I was just out to look at the car.

80
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,900
 Someone has taken the battery out of it.

81
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,900
 You suppose you could have done a thing like that?

82
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,900
 Oh, some Halloween hootlem.

83
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:18,900
 I tell you, Phoebe, this town has reached a nice state of affairs.

84
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,900
 Well, come in and close the door before you catch pneumonia.

85
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,900
 You know what I think I'll do.

86
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,900
 I'll just wait inside the door and see whether anyone comes back.

87
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,900
 I'll get my cane too.

88
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,900
 The next boy that comes up on this porch is going to get the tanning of his life.

89
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:32,900
 Yes, dear.

90
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:35,900
 Toby.

91
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:36,900
 Toby.

92
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:37,900
 What?

93
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,900
 He's going in.

94
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:40,900
 Come on up on the porch.

95
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:46,800
 What were they talking about Henry search me? Let's write a note and pin it to the door. Okay. Got a pencil?

96
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,800
 No, here's my fountain pen

97
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:54,240
 Listen Toby. Let's just ring the bell and run. Let me ring it. No Toby. This is the only one I can ring

98
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:59,560
 You can ring the next one. No besides mr. Edwards was my idea. Here we go Toby. I'm gonna ring it

99
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:04,380
 Do you hear anyone coming?

100
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:06,840
 No, I'd better ring it again

101
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,600
 Run Toby run I am

102
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:17,100
 Quick Toby talk around the stock the house. I'm with you. I'm with you. Hey stop

103
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:21,100
 Oh boy, oh boy, what's that?

104
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:27,220
 I'm all right. Just knocked over an ash can come on. I care for this great lover

105
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:30,440
 There goes mr. Edwards over

106
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,940
 Toby

107
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,940
 Help

108
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:39,180
 I'm went out through these trees Toby if he catches you Henry don't give you a right name whose name should I give

109
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:43,740
 Take one off. What was that? That was Mrs. Edwards.

110
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:47,420
 Look, Toby, here's a hole or something we can hide in.

111
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:49,180
 Yeah, where? Right here in the ground.

112
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:51,180
 Oh, she was way too big. What's the matter?

113
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,540
 It's an old wall. It's an old well.

114
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:55,180
 Well, this is a nice time to tell me.

115
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:55,980
 What's the matter?

116
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,580
 I dropped my fountain pen in it.

117
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:00,460
 Toby, he's coming.

118
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:01,020
 Poured us.

119
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:04,620
 He went right on.

120
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,060
 Boy, that was close.

121
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,660
 Let's be determined and get out of here.

122
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,660
 What, Henry, I dropped my fountain pen.

123
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:10,660
 That's so important.

124
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,360
 My mother just bought it for me.

125
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,160
 She whizzed, I can't go home without my fountain pen, Henry.

126
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,460
 How are we gonna get it?

127
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:18,660
 It's way down at the bottom of the wheel.

128
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,160
 Well, there's an old chain here.

129
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,660
 It's hanging right straight down.

130
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:24,160
 Is it fastened here at the top?

131
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,160
 Sure. Right to this piece of iron.

132
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,160
 Wait a second, I'll roll up my trousers.

133
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,660
 You better take the morph toby, then you won't get them wet.

134
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,660
 Sure, and hold my coat, too.

135
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:33,660
 John!

136
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:34,660
 John!

137
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:35,660
 Hey, what is it?

138
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:36,660
 Did you find it?

139
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:37,660
 Go on, kid.

140
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:39,160
 Toby.

141
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,160
 Did you look in the kid out beyond the well?

142
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,160
 I'm just coming from there.

143
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,160
 Well, come back in the house, man.

144
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,160
 Oh, I can say, here's they must have disappeared right into the ground.

145
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,160
 It's okay, Toby. You can go down now.

146
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:52,160
 Look out while I go over the edge.

147
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,660
 Are you sure you can get up again?

148
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:57,660
 Why not? All I have to do is hang on to this chain and climb right up the side.

149
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,660
 So long, Henry.

150
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:01,160
 Hang on.

151
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,660
 Hang on, tight old boy.

152
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,160
 Gee, where's...

153
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,160
 What's the matter?

154
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,760
 So what's the matter?

155
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,560
 There's something tied part way down on the chain.

156
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,360
 What is it?

157
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,260
 It's an automobile battery.

158
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,560
 A battery?

159
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,260
 What's it doing down there?

160
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:17,360
 How should I know?

161
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,160
 And the chain ends right here.

162
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,260
 We're done?

163
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:22,060
 Can you jump the rest of the way?

164
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:23,460
 What do you mean jump?

165
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:27,560
 It's so dark down here I wouldn't know when I got to the bottom.

166
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,660
 Oh, here's the trouble.

167
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:29,860
 It's up here.

168
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:32,460
 Some of the slack is hooked onto a bolt.

169
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:34,060
 I'll see whether I can lose to it.

170
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:35,860
 Let it out easy, Henry.

171
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:39,360
 Don't worry, Toby. You don't think I'd let you fall, do you?

172
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:44,860
 Toby.

173
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,360
 Oh, Toby.

174
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,360
 Toby, where are you?

175
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,860
 I thought you were my friend.

176
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:53,460
 I couldn't help it.

177
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:55,160
 Toby, can you float?

178
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,060
 How can you float in four inches of water?

179
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:00,960
 Well, did you get your pen and come on up?

180
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,860
 You're crazy. There's nothing to take a hold of.

181
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:05,740
 - Fan on the battery and reach.

182
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:07,060
 - I can.

183
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:09,340
 - Well, G-Tobe, I'll have to get you out somehow.

184
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,300
 Wonder whether I can find a ladder anyplace.

185
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,940
 - Ask Mr. Edwards whether he has one.

186
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:16,100
 - Sure, do you think I'm crazy, Toby?

187
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,740
 - Well hurry up and get a ladder someplace.

188
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:20,860
 - Look, there's the lid to the well up here.

189
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:21,860
 - Well, what about it?

190
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:24,660
 - You want me to put it over the top so you won't get cold?

191
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,940
 - No, just get me a ladder.

192
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,980
 - Do you want your pants and coats?

193
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,660
 - Just throw down my coat.

194
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:31,980
 - Okay, here it comes.

195
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:34,380
 I'll get the latter that's in our garage, Toby.

196
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:37,540
 And if anybody speaks to you, don't answer.

197
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:40,120
 (upbeat music)

198
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:51,820
 - Santa, has Henry come in yet?

199
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:52,660
 - Not yet.

200
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:53,820
 - It seems as though it's taking him

201
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,820
 an awfully long time during one doorbell.

202
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,940
 - Do you realize, Alice, this is the first Halloween

203
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,460
 no one has bothered us?

204
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:00,980
 - Certainly do.

205
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:02,380
 You put all the H cans in.

206
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:03,380
 I put them in the basement.

207
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:05,580
 What was that?

208
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,080
 Something out in the back.

209
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:10,980
 Sam, Sam, it sounds like one of the garage doors.

210
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,480
 You suppose anyone's getting in there?

211
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,980
 Listen, dear.

212
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:14,980
 Come with me.

213
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:15,680
 Where?

214
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,780
 Let's go out to the kitchen and look through the window.

215
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:19,380
 Is the kitchen light on?

216
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,480
 No.

217
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,780
 I want you to see it.

218
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:23,280
 Sam, someone is in the garage.

219
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,480
 Stand back from the window.

220
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,480
 Can you see them?

221
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,880
 That is.

222
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,780
 Someone is coming out of the garage with our big ladder.

223
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:30,480
 Sam, who did you?

224
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,520
 I think that's the limit.

225
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:34,160
 I'm going down the cello stairs here and slip out to the basement door.

226
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,440
 Who might not go out the back door?

227
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,960
 This way I can hit him off in the driveway.

228
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,880
 Shall I turn the light on?

229
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,120
 No, no, don't turn the light on.

230
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,200
 I can see quite all right.

231
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,200
 Hey!

232
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,200
 Hey!

233
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,840
 Sam, what have you done?

234
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,880
 I forgot I put the ash hands down here.

235
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,600
 Well, my goodness, dear, the ash is all over my cello floor.

236
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,040
 Yes, so am I.

237
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:51,880
 Turn on the light.

238
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,000
 Sam, you better come back up here and get your hat and coat.

239
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,720
 You want whoever it is to get away?

240
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,600
 Is that later more important than your health?

241
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,000
 Now, come back up here.

242
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,280
 All right, if you've already gone out toward the street in a town this size and you can certainly track down someone with a ladder

243
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:21,400
 You say the battery was taken right out of your car mr. Edward yes officer, but you didn't see any

244
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:26,240
 Not until a few minutes later two boys come up on the porch and rang the bell and I chased them right around here through the

245
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,240
 a great barber.

246
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,540
 And were they carrying the battery?

247
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:29,840
 Well, I couldn't say.

248
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:33,640
 Well, whoever stole it is going to be apprehended and punished.

249
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,080
 The young fellows here have got to respect private property.

250
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,880
 Oh, they don't stop at anything.

251
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,760
 I even found a pair of somebody's trousers back here.

252
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,360
 You better take them down to headquarters.

253
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,760
 Why?

254
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,520
 One minute.

255
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,280
 What's up?

256
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,920
 Stand back there under the street.

257
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,720
 You see out there toward the street.

258
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,520
 Somebody coming?

259
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,840
 Somebody with a ladder is coming right this way.

260
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:57,120
 I know, keep quiet, keep quiet, and when he passes I nap.

261
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:02,920
 - Just a minute, dear young man. - Oh, jeez, who said that?

262
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,280
 - One minute, I said. - Yes, sir.

263
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:08,200
 - Is there something you wanted? - Where did you get that ladder?

264
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,800
 - At home. - I asked you, where did you get it?

265
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,480
 - I brought it from home, sure I did. I give you my word, I did.

266
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:16,760
 - Oh, so we're gonna have trouble with you. Where's the battery?

267
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:20,120
 - The battery? What battery? - The battery that disappeared from my car.

268
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,800
 - I haven't even seen any battery. - What's your name?

269
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,940
 Why, uh, what is it? It's a...

270
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:28,400
 - A hurry. - Harry, what?

271
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,100
 Harry Ambrose.

272
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,040
 Where are you taking that ladder?

273
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:32,800
 Well...

274
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,520
 Not any place in particular.

275
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,240
 I just...

276
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,920
 Just happen to be carrying it with me.

277
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,960
 Just giving this a nailing.

278
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,560
 Aye, taking it out for a walk.

279
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,300
 Yes, sir.

280
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:46,420
 Well, Mr. Edward, what do you think we ought to do with him?

281
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:47,860
 It's, uh...

282
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:50,060
 90 days for a large knee in an office.

283
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:52,940
 90 days in jail for taking my own father's ladder?

284
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,100
 That's what it is.

285
00:12:54,100 --> 00:13:12,940
 Well, but I've got a friend, S

286
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,740
 Well, suppose you leave that ladder here.

287
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,540
 But I'll get the duchess, if I don't take it back home.

288
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:19,440
 You'll get 90 days, Harry Ambrose, if you don't put it down.

289
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,240
 Yes, sir.

290
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,340
 Now get home with you.

291
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,640
 It should have been an embedd an hour ago.

292
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:25,440
 Yes, only I don't know what my friend will do without me.

293
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:47,160
 And ladies and gentlemen, this being Halloween, I'd like to tell you a ghost story.

294
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:52,000
 The story of Edgar the gloomy ghost.

295
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,360
 Edgar, it seems, was very fond of nice desserts at dinner.

296
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:02,160
 But his wife, Phyllis the Phantom, kept serving him just ordinary desserts.

297
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:07,760
 As a result, Edgar went around moaning and groaning like this.

298
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:23,500
 Then one day Edgar's wife bought some jello vanilla pudding at the ghost to restore.

299
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,640
 And now Edgar is just as cheerful as can be.

300
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:29,520
 No longer does he go around moaning.

301
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:34,520
 Now he has a warm, likable laugh like this.

302
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:38,520
 [Laughter]

303
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:41,520
 So, you see, just in case that germite drop in, ladies and gentlemen,

304
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:44,520
 always keep jello vanilla pudding on hand.

305
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:47,520
 It's rimful of pimping flavor as smooth as rich cream

306
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:51,520
 and extra good when garnished with nuts, marshmallows, or fruit.

307
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:54,520
 My own favorite is jello vanilla pudding with sliced bananas,

308
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,520
 but served anyway at all, it's bram.

309
00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:03,520
 Order this delightful ready prepared dessert and start right away to enjoy the luscious flavor of jello vanilla pudding.

310
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:18,520
 Now getting back to the troubles of Henry Albridge, if being Halloween Henry and his friend Toby set out to ring just one doorbell and come home.

311
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:24,520
 However, one thing leads to another until Toby was left stranded at the bottom of a well.

312
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,520
 And Henry is attempting to rescue it.

313
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:31,520
 Good evening. Oh, is that you out there Henry Alders?

314
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:35,520
 Good evening, Mrs. Lockbridge. Could I borrow a real strong rope from you?

315
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:39,520
 A real strong what, dear? A rope. I need about 15 feet of very strong rope.

316
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:42,520
 Oh, would the be the clothesline help him?

317
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,520
 No ma'am, I have a friend that's in a well.

318
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,520
 Oh, look at that, quite a Halloween joke, isn't it?

319
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,520
 No ma'am, I'm trying to get my friend out.

320
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:51,460
 friend out. Well, how did he get in it? He was looking for his

321
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:54,420
 fountain pen. Well, why don't you try one of the other houses in

322
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:57,180
 the neighborhood? I have, I have, but every doorbell I've rung so

323
00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:00,140
 far the people chased me. Don't say so. Yes, ma'am, that's how I

324
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:02,620
 got a little wet like this. Goodness gracious, how did you get

325
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:05,100
 that when? They poured a bucket of water on me from the second floor

326
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:08,660
 window. Well, it's common to think of it, Henry. We have a good

327
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:11,780
 long toed-up out in the car. You have? Yes, sir. You'll find the

328
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:14,340
 car right out there in front. Right down the curb away. That's

329
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:17,100
 right. Okay. If I remember, the roast a little bit

330
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:20,100
 That's all right. It can certainly hold Hobi.

331
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:23,100
 Well, I find it in the front or the rear of the car.

332
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,100
 You have to look there.

333
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,100
 Yes, this is the car.

334
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,100
 Oh, my gosh.

335
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:32,100
 That's funny.

336
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:35,100
 All right, young fella. What are you trying to get away with?

337
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,100
 What's that?

338
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,100
 Did you think I didn't see you?

339
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,100
 It was like, oh, my car.

340
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,100
 What were you doing in my car?

341
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:41,100
 I've got a friend that's in a well.

342
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,100
 Yeah?

343
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,100
 But you see, Mrs. Lockbridge gave me permission to open this car.

344
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,100
 This is Lockbridge did.

345
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,340
 This is Lockbridge did.

346
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,000
 It's her husband.

347
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,800
 Well, it just happened to be my car and I live right here in this house.

348
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,400
 You do?

349
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,500
 You mean this other car here is Lockbridge?

350
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,980
 And I suppose you're going to tell me,

351
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:57,400
 Mrs. Lockbridge gave you permission to let all the air out of my tires.

352
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,200
 Are they flat?

353
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,300
 What do you think I was watching out the window for?

354
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,200
 Well, you certainly have my sympathy.

355
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,200
 [SOUND]

356
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,000
 Here you are.

357
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:05,600
 What's that?

358
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,700
 It's a pump.

359
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:07,400
 Get to work.

360
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:11,800
 But she was, I'd give you my word while I was looking for it with a piece of rope so I could pull my friend out.

361
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,800
 Maybe you'd like to have me turn you over to the police, my boy.

362
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,800
 Oh, no.

363
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,600
 Are you going to hook that pump onto the valve?

364
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,400
 Yes, sir.

365
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,300
 What's your name?

366
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:23,300
 Well, it's, um, it's, uh, which tire do you want me to pump up first?

367
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,800
 I asked her your name.

368
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,500
 It's Harry Ambrose.

369
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,600
 Harry Ambrose, eh?

370
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,400
 Yes, sir.

371
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,000
 Well, your family ought to be ashamed of you.

372
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:30,400
 Yes, sir.

373
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,600
 They certainly ought to be.

374
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,800
 I'm going in and keep an eye on you from the house.

375
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:37,800
 And don't forget, there's a street lamp right here and I can see every move you make.

376
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:38,600
 Yes, sir.

377
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,300
 If I hadn't been a boy once myself, I'd come to open the law.

378
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,300
 Yes, sir.

379
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:44,300
 I'll be with you.

380
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:49,300
 I'll be with you.

381
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:51,300

382
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:54,300
 Henry, is that you popping up those tires?

 I'm looking for our ladder.

385
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:01,300
 And may I first ask you to come back to the house?

386
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:04,300
 I'm not going to be here.

387
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,300

388
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,300
 Henry, is that you popping up those tires?

404
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:17,960
 - You're waiting till I get even with you, Homer.

405
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,520
 - You got away from him, didn't you, Henry?

406
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,560
 - I got away from him, but look at what he did to my co-helm.

407
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,720
 I gonna get this sleeve back on.

408
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,720
 - Aren't I gonna help you get Toby out of the well?

409
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,560

00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,640

411
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,480

412
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,720
 - Isn't it a beauty, Henry?

413
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,580
 I found it over here on Walnut Street.

414
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:33,520
 - What I mean, Homer is who's was it?

415
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,440
 - Nobody.

416
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:37,700
 We're just roping off a new sidewalk that had been laid this afternoon.

417
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,780
 Listen Homer, I'm not going to use it.

418
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:42,380
 We aren't going to keep it, Henry. It's just to get Toby out.

419
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:43,860
 But Homer, I don't think we should use it.

420
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:45,420
 All right then. All right.

421
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:46,780
 Not so loud, Homer.

422
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:47,780
 Do you see somebody?

423
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:49,620
 We're right here by Mr. Edwards' house.

424
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:52,580
 Oh, come on now, Homer. I'm following back to the well.

425
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:54,780
 Why don't you want to disturb Mr. Edwards, Henry?

426
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:58,580
 Well, if he's going to sleep, there's no sense in waking him up as then.

427
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:00,220
 Come on back through this great barber.

428
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:02,620
 I'm coming. Where is the well?

429
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:03,620
 It's right ahead here.

430
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,520
 Someplace.

431
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,120
 Can't you find it?

432
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,020
 It's strange.

433
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:11,520
 She was done falling window.

434
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,920
 Oh, here it is.

435
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,720
 And Toby.

436
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,820
 Toby, are you all right?

437
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:17,920
 Help me.

438
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,420
 Who is that?

439
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:21,420
 It's Henry and Homer.

440
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:24,420
 Well, you're the only one that haven't been here before.

441
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:25,620
 Who else has been here?

442
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:26,620
 Everybody.

443
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:28,920
 And they all threw something down.

444
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:33,220
 The last time it was a bushel of apple.

445
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:35,620
 Are you all right, Toby?

446
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:36,780
 How could I be?

447
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:38,120
 Get me out of here.

448
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:40,520
 We're letting a rope down now, Toby.

449
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,820
 Here, Henry, I'll help you.

450
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:43,420
 Is it down yet, Toby?

451
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:44,120
 No.

452
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:44,920
 It's coming.

453
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,420
 Homer, have you got the end?

454
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:47,420
 What end, Henry?

455
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:48,120
 Of the rope.

456
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,120
 The end down here.

457
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:53,020
 Witch end.

458
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:53,820
 Both ends.

459
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:57,120
 Well, she whiz, Homer, if you are in a hell.

460
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,820
 Toby, throw one end up here.

461
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:00,320
 Oh, my God, I do that.

462
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,320
 Just throw it right straight up.

463
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,320
 Here it comes.

464
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,320
 Where is it?

465
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,320
 Around my neck.

466
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,320
 Henry, I've got an idea. Look out.

467
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,320
 What are you going to do?

468
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:14,320
 How about dropping this rock down and letting him tie the rope to it?

469
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,320
 And then throw it up?

470
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:19,320
 Now listen. Don't throw anything more down here.

471
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,320
 There isn't any more room.

472
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:24,320
 Henry, do you think you could hold my hand while I go down part way?

473
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,320
 How would you get the rope?

474
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,320
 Well Toby could tie it to my foot.

475
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,320
 Sure, and then I'll pull you back up.

476
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,800

485
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,720
 - Oh, she was.

486
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,560
 - What's that?

487
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,400
 - Keep quiet.

488
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,220

 Oh boy.

490
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:07,640
 (upbeat music)

491
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:17,960
 - Gee, if they had come two feet closer,

492
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,520
 they would have fallen right in with us.

493
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,080
 - That would have been good.

494
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,480
 Well, we got you out, Toby,

495
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,000

496
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,360
 Toby we got you away from Mr. Edward's house, but I still haven't got any pants Henry

500
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:47,940
 Well, we've got to take that right back to Mr. Edward all the way sure

501
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:52,760
 What do you think we hold it out for we get caught with it? We'll get six months in jail here Homer

502
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,040
 How would you like to carry it?

503
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:54,680
 I don't want it.

504
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,640
 Let Henry carry it.

505
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,880
 Toby, don't try to shirk responsibility.

506
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,640
 Well, you fellas are going to go back with me.

507
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,720
 I'm not going alone.

508
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,720
 Come on.

509
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,040

 Where?

511
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,880
 Down here on the corner.

512
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,560
 He's coming right toward us.

513
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,520
 Isn't that a policeman?

514
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,680
 I think it is, Henry.

515
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,320
 Let's turn around and go the other way.

516
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,280
 That's what I say.

517
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:11,640
 No.

518
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,680
 We'll walk right along as though we were heading for a--

519
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,240
 Rod.

520
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:14,760
 Sure.

521
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,520
 Oh, sure.

522
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,160
 Our battery ran down and we're going to get it recharged.

523
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,600
 But I still haven't got any pants.

524
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,480
 Let's see, fellas.

525
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,240
 Look ahead there.

526
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,360
 Where? There's another policeman and he's walking right toward us.

527
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,240
 So long, Toby.

528
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,040
 Now wait, Henry, you can't leave me flat like this.

529
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,560
 I've got to get rid of this battery.

530
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,920
 So put it down someplace.

531
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,600
 Sure, I'm supposing he saves me.

532
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,080
 I've got an idea. You see that car parked there by the curb?

533
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:36,480
 Yeah.

534
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,880
 We'll put it inside. Just dump it through the window.

535
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,480
 Henry, you've got a head on you.

536
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,640
 Come on, how will I be? I've been between these two houses.

537
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,560
 Boy, if they see it.

538
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,040
 Okay.

539
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:45,920
 Wait for me.

540
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,120
 Well, hurry up.

541
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:47,600
 Quiet.

542
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,480
 Police are going by.

543
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,480
 Do you think they saw us?

544
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,480
 No.

545
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,480
 They're not even looking this way.

546
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,480
 Say fellas.

547
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,480
 You know what I just happened to think?

548
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,480
 What?

549
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,480
 I left my fountain pen down in the well.

550
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:04,480
 - Say, Gee whiz. - What's the matter?

551
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,480
 That car we put the battery in.

552
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,480
 What about it?

553
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,480
 Somebody just drove off in this.

554
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:19,480

555
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:22,480
 [Music]

556
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,480
 Is that you Henry?

557
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,480
 Yes mother.

558
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,480
 Will you please tell me where you've been all evening?

559
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,480
 Just that with Toby.

560
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,480
 Fooling around.

561
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,480
 Well come into the living room.

562
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,480
 I've got to make a phone call first mother.

563
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,480
 Hello operator.

564
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,480
 Then I'll be right there.

565
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,480
 Operator could you get me?

566
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,480
 It's right here in the book.

567
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,560
 It's um, it's Elm 36.

568
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,360
 Henry!

569
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,960
 Mother father isn't in yet anything.

570
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:43,840
 No, he isn't.

571
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,200
 Oh, hello.

572
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,880
 Hello, is this Mr. Edwards?

573
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:51,360
 Well, Mr. Edwards, this is to inform you that if you will notify the police

574
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:59,760
 to look for a car number T765, I think, or maybe it was T5 something,

575
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,880
 anyhow, in it you'll find your battery.

576
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,320
 What's that?

577
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:08,320
 This is just a friend, Mr. Edwards, who happened to be passing by your house a

578
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,580
 little while ago.

579
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:10,580
 Henry!

580
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:11,580
 Goodbye.

581
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:12,580
 Henry!

582
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:13,580
 I'm coming, mother.

583
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:14,580
 Where's your coat there?

584
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:15,580
 I just hung it up in the closet.

585
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:17,980
 Well, did you ring your doorbell?

586
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:18,980
 Yes, mother.

587
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:19,980
 I rang it.

588
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:22,580
 Did you find it worthwhile?

589
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:30,140
 Well, to be honest, I think I'm getting a little too old to be doing things like that.

590
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:31,140
 Where's my Latin?

591
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:33,140
 Well, it's Henry in...

592
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:34,140
 Yes, Sam.

593
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:35,140
 He's sitting here studying.

594
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:36,300
 Where have you been?

595
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:38,500
 I found the ladder, but not the boy.

596
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,940
 Then what on earth do you have all of your shoes?

597
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:42,540
 That is cement.

598
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:43,980
 They laid a new sidewalk over town

599
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:45,340
 and didn't even bother to rope it off.

600
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:47,500
 Well, don't get it all over the carpet.

601
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,340
 What do you think I found a few minutes ago?

602
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:50,180
 What?

603
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:51,820
 A battery in the backseat of my car.

604
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:53,300
 (audience laughing)

605
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,140
 A battery phone?

606
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:55,900
 Tomorrow morning, Henry, you call up the police

607
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,140
 and find out who lost it.

608
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:57,980
 I, Father.

609
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:58,900
 And then after you've done that,

610
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:01,060
 you can go over to Mr. Edwards and get our ladder.

611
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,620
 Yes, Father.

612
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:06,260
 I wonder why people think Halloween is a time for fun.

613
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:23,260
 [Music]

614
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:26,260
 Henry Aldrich will be back in just a moment.

615
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:28,260
 And when you make out the grocery list for tomorrow,

616
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:32,260
 be sure to include several packages of jello pudding.

617
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:35,260
 They're easy to make, inexpensive, and really delicious.

618
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:40,420
 Ask a grocer for all three flavors, yellow chocolate pudding, yellow vanilla pudding, and

619
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:42,420
 yellow butterscotch pudding.

620
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:46,260
 Yellow puddings are made by the makers of jello, so you know they're good.

 [Music]

622
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:57,260
 The night helps me singing the next week to help.

 [Applause]

624
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:04,100
 Listen in again next Thursday evening to the Aldrich family and to the Maxwell House Coffee

625
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:07,800
 time program which immediately preceded on most of these stations

626
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:11,480
 a solid hour of sparkling radio entertainment every Thursday night

627
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:14,960
 the old rich family starring as the stone is written by Clifford Goldsmith

628
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:18,120
 original music is composed and conducted by Jack Miller

629
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:23,120
 and this is Harry Vansell bidding you all good night

630
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:35,120
 [Music]

631
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:40,120
 It's your grocer folks, calling out to let you know about our special this week on Birds

632
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:47,120
 Eye Quick Frozen Haddock Phillip. Say what really good Haddock it is too, chalk full of that

633
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:52,920
 fresh taste in deep sea flavor, and don't bother to look for any bones, because birds

634
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:58,360
 The harak is all clean and bone for you ready for the pain.

635
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:01,960
 By birds I harak fillets tomorrow.

636
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:05,240
 They're specially low priced all this week.
