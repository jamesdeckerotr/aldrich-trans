 [Music]

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 And now the Jell-O family presents...

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 Henry Henry Oldridge!

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 Coming, mother!

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 [Applause]

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 Yes, it's the Oldridge family based on characters

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 by Clifford Goldsmith and starring Ezra Stone as Henry

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 with Jackie Count as Homer.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 And yes, it's the Jell-O family,

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 with its three famous desserts.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 Jell-O in those six delicious flavors,

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 Jell-O puddings without old fashioned,

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 homemade flavor, and Jell-O tapioca puddings,

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 a miracle of goodness, a marvel of spirit.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,920
 (

16
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:03,720
 No! They are made by famous J-E-L-L-O!

17
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:06,720
 And now for the Aldrich family.

18
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:22,120
 A typical teenage boy like Henry Aldrich is as unpredictable as the weather.

19
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:26,320
 And like the weather, he can change in a moment from storm to calm.

20
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,780
 And usually a whole household changes with him.

21
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:32,320
 The scene opens in the Aldrich living room.

22
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,520
 It is early Saturday evening.

23
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:37,720
 Sam, would you like me to put another log on the fire?

24
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,020
 No, thank you, Alice.

25
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:40,320
 I wouldn't mind a bit, dear.

26
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,220
 I know you like to be warm when you're reading.

27
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:45,920
 Alice is only one thing I really like when I'm reading.

28
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,020
 What, dear?

29
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:48,420
 Not to be talked to.

30
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:51,520
 Well, you won't have to worry about Henry bothering you tonight.

31
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,020
 He'll be out of the house the whole evening.

32
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:58,020
 And frankly, I don't know why one of us didn't think of it years ago.

33
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,320
 Putting him out of the house?

34
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:03,820
 No, dear, arranging for the children to have a party at a different home each week.

35
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:04,520
 Mm.

36
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:08,420
 It'll be so much easier sitting in the kitchen one night every two months

37
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:12,620
 when we know that the rest of the time we can read in the living room in peace and quiet.

38
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:13,520
 We can?

39
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,620
 Of course, dear. Just as you are now.

40
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,020
 Yes.

41
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:22,320
 Elizabeth said she thought the idea was a stroke of genius.

42
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,780
 But I wouldn't go so far as to say that.

43
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,280
 Would you, Sam?

44
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,380
 Alice, I think your idea is wonderful.

45
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:29,580
 It's brilliant.

46
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,820
 It gives me an opportunity to read this book.

47
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:33,620
 Now, suppose I read it.

48
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:36,620
 You can't read it if you keep on talking all the time.

49
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:39,120
 Mother!

50
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,420
 Yes, Henry?

51
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:43,520
 And you've been making any rag-rubs recently?

52
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,620
 Any what?

53
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:46,620
 Rag-rubs! Rag-rubs!

54
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,820
 I can't find my maroon socks!

55
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,020
 Henry!

56
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:52,420
 Your socks are in your top drawer.

57
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:56,420
 I'm sorry mother they are and I've turned my drawers inside out.

58
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:57,620
 [LAUGHTER]

59
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:01,820
 Do you know that strange because I distinctly remember putting them away.

60
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:04,420
 Alice, why don't you go upstairs and help him look?

61
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:06,820
 Well while I'm doing that, will you please answer the phone?

62
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:10,020
 Now wait a minute, Henry's perfectly capable of finding his own socks.

63
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:10,620
 But dear...

64
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:11,620
 You answer the phone.

65
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,620
 Mother!

66
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:14,620
 Alice, Henry's calling you...

67
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:15,620
 What is it, Henry?

68
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:17,420
 The phone's raining!

69
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:19,220
 Yes, dear, I know.

70
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,980
 (phone ringing)

71
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:21,820
 - Hello?

72
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,980
 - Hello, is that you Mrs. Oldrich?

73
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:25,540
 - Yes, how are you, Homer?

74
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:28,520
 - Okay, I guess, except for my arms.

75
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,520
 - Your arms?

76
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,860
 - They're just sort of aching,

77
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:33,620
 from carrying a couple of armchairs out to the kitchen

78
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:35,340
 from my parents.

79
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,140
 But don't worry, they'll be in shape

80
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,300
 by the time Agnes gets here.

81
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,140
 - Your parents?

82
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:41,600
 - No, my arms.

83
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,740
 (audience laughing)

84
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:44,740
 Could I speak to Henry, please?

85
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,380
 - Dear Henry's in his bare feet,

86
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:48,860
 but he'll see you at your party in a little while.

87
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:50,140
 in his bare feet.

88
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:50,980
 - Father!

89
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,140
 - Good-bye, home-iron.

90
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:52,980
 - I know, but--

91
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,140
 - Father!

92
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:55,240
 - Oh, Sam!

93
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,140
 - Yes?

94
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,700
 - Henry's calling you.

95
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:00,140
 - Henry, your mother told you where your socks were.

96
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,980
 - I found my socks, Father.

97
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,340
 I had them on!

98
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,700
 (audience laughing)

99
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,980
 - How do you think we should have his eyes examined?

100
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,700
 - Dear, the only trouble with Henry

101
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,260
 is his body works faster than his mind.

102
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:14,500
 - Father, what I can't find now is your tight clip.

103
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,620
 - Now, say here!

104
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,340
 - Sam, I'll go look for it.

105
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,740
 You just go back to your book.

106
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:22,100
 Perhaps I should wait until Henry's mind catches up with the rest of it.

107
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,600
 Oh my goodness.

108
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,340
 Hello?

109
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,540
 Mrs. Aldrich, we were cut off.

110
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,060
 Homer, what is it you want?

111
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,500
 I have to speak to Henry.

112
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,780
 It's very urgent.

113
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:32,780
 Just a minute.

114
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:33,660
 Henry?

115
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:34,620
 Yes, mother.

116
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,380
 Homer, watch you on the phone.

117
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:37,580
 I can't come now.

118
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:39,180
 I'm taking a bath.

119
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,780
 There, I thought you were all dressed except your feet.

120
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:45,420
 I was, but I just got shoe polish on me.

121
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:46,260
 Hello, Homer?

122
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:49,020
 - Is he coming Mrs. Aldrich? - No, he can't right now.

123
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,660
 Suppose you give me the message.

124
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:54,060
 Listen, Mrs. Aldrich, I've got some bad news.

125
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,460
 Our radio's just going on in the bum.

126
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:59,460
 - Really? - And we won't have anything to dance to.

127
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:01,660
 - Oh, well, couldn't you play the piano?

128
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:04,260
 - How could you dance to Home Sweet Home?

129
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:08,060
 - Here, haven't you been studying for years and years?

130
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:10,260
 - Only five, Mrs. Aldrich.

131
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:12,660
 - And all you can play is Home Sweet Home?

132
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:16,060
 - Sure. She was on no child prodigy.

133
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:19,660
 Oh, I wish I could suggest something, but...

134
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:25,460
 Well, as a matter of fact, how is your radio working, Mrs. Aldrich?

135
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:29,460
 Our radio? Oh, I'm afraid Mr. Aldrich wouldn't let that out of the house.

136
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:35,060
 Well, Mrs. Aldrich, did you ever hear that saying about the mountain and no hamlet?

137
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:36,060
 What's that?

138
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:41,060
 If your radio can't come to us, I'm sure the game wouldn't mind going to your radio.

139
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:44,460
 Now, just a minute, Homer. I'm afraid that's out of the question.

140
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:45,260
 It is.

141
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:48,940
 And besides, it's your parents' turn to look after the party tonight.

142
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:51,300
 But neither of them plays the piano.

143
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,180
 Well, dear would this help you?

144
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:57,420
 There's a neighbor of ours who has a portable phonograph and a complete collection of records.

145
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:59,300
 Oh, boy!

146
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,100
 I'll send Henry over to borrow the piece.

147
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:01,940
 You will, Mother.

148
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:03,660
 Okay, but will you tell him to hurry?

149
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:04,940
 Half the kids are here.

150
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:05,660
 Yes, Homer.

151
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:09,580
 And if we don't get something to dance to, I'll never get Willie out of the punch bowl.

152
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:11,340
 All right, Homer, goodbye.

153
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:14,940
 Come, Mother, you mean I have to start running errands at a time like this?

154
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:18,280
 Just over to Miss Spencer's to pick up her phonograph and records.

155
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,980
 Homer needs something to dance to.

156
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:22,860
 Boy, I always have to wait on him, hand and foot.

157
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:24,940
 Dear, you're not doing this for Homer.

158
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:27,540
 You're doing it for your father and me.

159
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:29,420
 And I thought you were taking a bath.

160
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:30,980
 I decided I didn't have time.

161
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:32,540
 I'd only keep Diane waiting.

162
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:34,020
 Now, here's your overcoat.

163
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,020
 Thanks, mother.

164
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,660
 And you don't forget to put your gloves on.

165
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:37,260
 OK.

166
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:38,620
 And have a good time.

167
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:39,340
 Thanks, mother.

168
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:41,300
 You and father have a good time, too.

169
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,060
 We will.

170
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:42,820
 Goodbye.

171
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,540
 Goodbye.

172
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:46,340
 Was that Henry leaving Alice?

173
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:47,740
 Yes, Sam.

174
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,780
 Well, thank goodness.

176
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,620
 Oh, dear.

177
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:53,380
 Hello?

178
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,060
 Hello, is that Mrs. Aldridge?

 Yes.

 Well, well, I'm very sorry to bother you,

 but this is Diane.

182
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,180
 Diane?

183
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:02,700
 Yes, Diane Conway.

184
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:05,420
 I'm going to a party tonight with your son Henry.

185
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:06,660
 Oh, of course.

186
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,860
 And he's certainly looking forward to it.

187
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:09,980
 Oh, so am I.

188
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:11,620
 And so are we.

189
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:12,660
 That is--

190
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:18,160
 But do you happen to know whether Henry is picking me up at home or at dehaven's drugstore?

191
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,160
 - Well, didn't he tell you? - Yes, he did, I think.

192
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:25,660
 But you'll know how when Henry tells you something one minute, it's perfectly clear.

193
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:28,160
 And the next minute, you know what I mean?

194
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:34,960
 Well, dear, I'm not sure, but he just left and I was under the impression he was going to pick you up at your house.

195
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,160
 Oh, my goodness, he can't do that!

196
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:40,760
 - Where are you now, Diane? - I'm waiting down here at the drugstore!

197
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,560
 Well then suppose you go back home and wait for me.

198
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,260
 By the time I go all the way home I'll miss him.

199
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:46,760
 Well...

200
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,560
 I can't stay here, everybody's staring at me.

201
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,760
 Now dear, just calm down.

202
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,760
 I know what we can do, you wait right where you are.

203
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,760
 But Mrs. Old...

204
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,060
 It'll only be for five minutes, goodbye.

205
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,060
 Sam!

206
00:07:59,060 --> 00:07:59,760
 Yes, I will.

207
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,260
 Will you please come here a minute?

208
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:02,660
 What's the trouble now?

209
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:03,760
 Here's your coat, Nia.

210
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,960
 My coat, I'm not going anyplace.

211
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,960
 Sam, don't argue.

212
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:09,560
 You'll have to go down to the Havens drugstore before that child goes to pieces.

213
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,260
 What child?

214
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:14,060
 for the sake of our whole evening, Samuel, have to pick her up.

215
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,660
 Pick her up and what?

216
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:18,060
 Dear, we'll cross that bridge when we come to it.

218
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:30,260
 Hello.

219
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,060
 Hello, Homer.

220
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:31,860
 This is me.

221
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,460
 Henry, where have you been?

222
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:35,060
 I've been slightly delayed, Homer,

223
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:36,660
 but I'll be right over to your place.

224
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:38,660
 But Henry, I thought you weren't coming,

225
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:40,960
 and I talked to everybody out of dancing.

226
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,520
 - But Homer, so what do you say we go someplace?

227
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,200
 - I'm going to all the trouble of getting your phonograph

228
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,040
 and records.

229
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,560
 - What records have you got?

230
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,440
 - Well, I'll tell you.

231
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:54,040
 Listen, Homer, how would the gang feel about Schubert's eighth?

232
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,080
 - Who's eight?

233
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,880
 - Schubert, Schubert.

234
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:00,240
 - Yeah, his eighth why?

235
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,080
 (audience laughing)

236
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,360
 - Symphony, Homer, have you ever heard of the unfinished symphony?

237
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,320
 - Listen, Henry, why would we wanna listen to that?

238
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,620
 I know, but even Schubert wasn't interested enough to finish it.

239
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:11,620
 [laughter]

240
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:15,120
 But Homer, that's the only kind of record Ms. Spencer had.

241
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,820
 Well, it's a good thing we're not dancing.

242
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:20,520
 Look, why don't we all go over to your place?

243
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,320
 My place?

244
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:25,020
 I mentioned it to your mother before, but I don't think she took the hint.

245
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:28,320
 Now listen, if you're planning to go over to my house, you're crazy.

246
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,720
 What do you mean by a statement like that?

247
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,820
 Homer, my folks are going to have one peaceful evening at home if it's the last thing I do.

 Hello?

250
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:44,820
 Hello Alice!

251
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:45,820
 Sam, where are you?

252
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:47,820
 Down at the Havens drugstore and Alice.

253
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,820
 What does Diane look like?

254
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:54,820
 I'm not sure, dear, but I believe Henry mentioned something about blue eyes.

255
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,820
 What kind of a description is that?

256
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:57,820
 What's she wearing?

257
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:59,820
 Sam, I had an any idea.

258
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:00,820
 Although...

259
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:01,820
 Yes?

260
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:02,820
 It's pretty cold.

261
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,820
 She's probably wearing a fur coat.

262
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:05,660
 - You think so?

263
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:09,140
 - If she has one, although frankly I doubt it.

264
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:10,460
 - Alice, I'm coming home.

265
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:11,700
 - There you can't do that.

266
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:12,900
 Diane's waiting for you.

267
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,180
 - She isn't waiting here.

268
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,220
 - Then you better run over to Hilliard's drugstore

269
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,500
 and take a look around there.

270
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,140
 - That's all the way across town.

271
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:21,980
 - Sam, we can't leave a single stone unturned.

273
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:32,860
 Alice, how nice of you to fall.

274
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:36,220
 - Hey, Elizabeth, do you happen to know what Diane looks like?

275
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:37,060
 - Diane?

276
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:38,620
 - Yes, Henry's girl.

277
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:40,940
 Sam's down at Hilliard's drugstore looking for her,

278
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:43,780
 and we haven't the fadest idea what she looks like.

279
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:45,180
 - Oh, Diane.

280
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:46,340
 Well, as a matter of fact,

281
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:48,340
 Homer was talking about her, it's separate and I've--

282
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:50,260
 - Really? What did he say about her?

283
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:52,020
 - He said she was a dish.

284
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:52,860
 - A dish?

285
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:55,260
 - Yes, dear. You know, a lulu.

286
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,980
 - Well, that's some help.

287
00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:00,340
 Homer didn't mention exactly where Henry was to meet her, did he?

288
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:02,580
 - Well, Homer claims that all Henry talked about

289
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,380
 was somebody named Schubert.

290
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:05,180
 Schubert?

291
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:07,020
 Yes, and the number was eight.

292
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:07,900
 Oh, and Alice.

293
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:08,620
 Yes?

294
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:10,620
 Well, since Sam is down at the drug store

295
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,700
 and he has to go by here on his way home,

296
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:15,220
 do you think he'd mind picking up a quart of ice cream?

297
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:16,140
 I guess not.

298
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:18,180
 And the cube of toothpaste while he's at it?

299
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:19,300
 All right, Elizabeth.

00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:21,660

301
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,100
 is a stroke of genius.

00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,260

00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,020
 There.

358
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:56,020
 Oh boy.

359
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:59,020
 Henry, how did that rock get in with the gravel?

 [Music]

361
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:09,020
 Alice, I'm calling to tell you this whole thing is utterly ridiculous.

362
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:13,020
 Now Sam Diane's waiting for someone to meet her in a drugstore, and I promise you-

363
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:17,020
 But Alice is getting embarrassing, looking in the girl's eyes to see what color they are.

364
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:18,020
 But beer!

365
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:20,020
 I've never felt more like a criminal in my life.

366
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:21,020
 What do you mean?

367
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:23,220
 - And he'll just threaten to call the police.

368
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:25,820
 And it marshals, they came right out and called me a masher.

369
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:28,020
 - You mean you've been to every drug store in town?

370
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:29,020
 - I have.

371
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:32,420
 - But here is there a Schubert's drug store on 8th Street.

372
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:33,420
 - What's that?

373
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:37,020
 - According to Homer, Henry talked about Schubert's at 8th.

374
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:38,420
 - Alice, there's no such place.

375
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:39,620
 - There you'd better have a look.

376
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:40,620
 - Now wait.

377
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:43,420
 - And while you're there, Mrs. Brown would like a quarter of ice cream.

378
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:44,420
 - Now wait.

379
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:45,420
 - And a tube of toothpaste.

380
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:48,620
 And you better get a dozen lemon salmon case they run out of punch.

381
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:50,220
 - Now wait a minute.

383
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:10,220
 And now for some shopping instructions from Meredith Wilson and his talking people.

384
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:15,220
 For talking people, you've been talking about the Jell-O family since last October,

385
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:17,220
 and you're getting pretty darn good.

386
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:26,220
 Oh sure, we can laugh together, ho ho, and we can cry together, and we can shiver together.

387
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:34,220
 Starting with strawberry, yoo-hoo, yoo-hoo, yoo-hoo, yoo-hoo, yoo-hoo, yoo-hoo, yoo-hoo, yoo-hoo, yoo-hoo.

388
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:36,220
 Jake, eat, out, out, out, ooh.

389
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:37,220
 Never make a mistake.

390
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:38,220
 How's that?

391
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:40,220
 Well, hardly ever.

392
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:44,220
 And nobody makes a mistake when they ask for the famous Gellow family of desserts.

393
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,220
 No sir.

394
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:51,320
 There's regular jello pudding smooth and luscious and jello capioca pudding full of personality

395
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:58,860
 Dibbles and there's jello the world's most famous shimmering dessert so colorful for your holiday table

396
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:04,300
 It better have plenty on hand because jello is easy to prepare and it's so dog-gone good

397
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:10,900
 Get jello with the big red letters on the box in all six of those shimmering delicious flavors starting with strawberry

402
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:41,200
 And now getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldrich.

403
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:45,800
 In order to ensure the quiet evening they had planned on spending at home,

404
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:49,400
 Mr. and Mrs. Aldrich are trying to get Henry off to a party.

405
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:53,700
 But the more they try, the further they get from their goal.

406
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:56,700
 The scene opens in Springer's hardware store.

407
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,900
 It is a little later the same evening.

408
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:01,600
 It is, operator. The line's still busy.

409
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,400
 Yes, sir. I'm sorry.

410
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,900
 Well, look, could you cut in on the conversation?

411
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,700
 No, sir. I'm sorry.

412
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:10,780
 But look, operator, it's only my mother speaking, see?

413
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,260
 And now her son.

414
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:13,660
 I beg your pardon.

415
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:15,300
 Her only son, see?

416
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,660
 And I know she'd want to talk to me.

417
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:20,500
 And we pay our bill regularly every month.

418
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,940
 I beg your pardon.

419
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:24,140
 If you're so good, and you please cut in.

420
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:26,660
 I'll try your number again and call you back.

421
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:28,020
 I know, but--

422
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,540
 Hello?

423
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,660
 Oh, boy.

424
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,980
 Henry, you want me to wrap these for you?

425
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:34,580
 The only thing is Mr. Springer,

426
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:36,420
 I should speak to my mother first.

427
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:40,500
 Now look, when you got me out of bed to come down here and open my hardware store,

428
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,580
 you didn't say you were dragging your mother into it.

429
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:47,820
 I'm not Mr. Springer, G. I wouldn't think of dragging her out of the house when she's spending a nice restful evening.

430
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:49,820
 Oh boy, excuse me.

431
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,820
 Hello, operator!

432
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,220
 Henry, is that you?

433
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:55,020
 She was, mother!

434
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:56,300
 Yes, where are you?

435
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:57,860
 Dana Springer's hardware.

436
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:00,820
 And look, could I charge a small item or two to father?

437
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:01,220
 A bit dear.

438
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:03,220
 Just a window pane and some putty.

439
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:05,220
 Henry, what for?

440
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:09,500
 You mean you want to go into all the boring uninteresting details now?

441
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,600
 Yes, dear.

442
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,720
 But I'm right here in the store with Mr. Springer in a night shirt.

443
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,180
 Henry, you're wearing what?

444
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:18,060
 No, it's Mr. Springer's, and he's shivering.

445
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:19,900
 So won't you please say yes?

446
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:20,400
 Well...

447
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,520
 Gee, thanks, mother. You can wrap them up, Mr. Springer.

448
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,820
 And another thing, mother.

449
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:24,720
 Yes, dear.

450
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,460
 Well, I got sort of separated from Diane, see?

451
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:29,660
 You mean you found her?

452
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:31,740
 It's your mother. Only I lost her again.

453
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,960
 When the window broke, we both had to run.

454
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:37,720
 So, would you mind phoning your folks for me and see if she went home?

455
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,460
 My cook.

456
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:42,460
 And then would you please phone Homer and tell him I'm practically on my way to the party.

457
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:42,960
 But him?

458
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:49,460
 All I have to do now is repair a little something and find I am and round up some records and then I'm all set.

00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:58,560
 Hello? Hello, Alice?

460
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,060
 Sam, where are you now?

461
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:02,560
 I'm phoning from Schubert's delicatessen.

462
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,560
 Where?

463
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,560
 It's a show but it's delicatessen.

464
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:08,060
 It's on the south side of town.

465
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,560
 What are you doing there?

466
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,560
 What am I doing? I'm looking for Diane.

467
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,560
 But Sam!

468
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,060
 And this ice cream is beginning to melt.

469
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:15,060
 Oh, Mr....

470
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:16,060
 Oh, just a minute, Alice.

471
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:18,560
 Mr. did I hear you say you were looking for Diane?

472
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,060
 Well, yes. I'll tell you're here.

473
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,060
 You mean she's...

474
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,060
 You mean she's...

475
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,060
 Hello, Alice.

476
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:24,060
 Yes, Sam.

477
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:25,060
 Alice, I found Diane.

478
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:28,060
 Well, thank goodness Henry will be so happy.

479
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:31,060
 Just take her and the ice cream and the lemons and the toothpaste

480
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:32,060
 straight over to the party at home.

481
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:33,060
 Very well.

482
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:36,640
 And Sam, I just phoned Diane's parents and they're terribly upset.

483
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,140
 What about?

484
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:39,240
 But I thought she was lost.

485
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:43,860
 So would you please stop by a drug store again and buy some spirits of ammonia for Diane's mother?

486
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:45,240
 Diane's mother.

487
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,280
 Yes, dear. She's been having his sterics.

488
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,080
 Good heaven.

489
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,000
 And hurry, Sam. Good bye.

490
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,280
 Diane will be right with you, Mr. as soon as she's through waiting on that table.

00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,140
 But, Sam?

492
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:57,080
 Now, hold on. There must be a mistake.

 While you're waiting, what kind of meat do you like?

494
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,360
 Meat? Sure, Diane's boyfriend's always by something.

495
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,880
 I am not one of Diane's boyfriend.

496
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,400
 Sure, Mr. Shore. Now what kind of meat do you like?

497
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:19,600
 How many have you seen Henry?

498
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,200
 Henry, Henry who?

499
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,520
 Henry, old, rich, your friend.

500
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,600
 He's no friend of mine, Diane.

501
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,280
 From tonight on, I haven't even heard of.

502
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,160
 But where do you suppose he is?

503
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:34,360
 When I learnt you'd moved your party down here to the Haven's, I thought surely you'd be here.

504
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:38,460
 Nevermind Henry Diane, let's dance before the jukebox wins out.

505
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:39,760
 Oh, I'd love to!

506
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:45,960
 She are a swelled answer.

507
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,760
 I give anything so hungry.

508
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,160
 You're supposed to make a dance a little faster.

509
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:50,760
 Faster!

510
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,560
 Sure.

00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:56,160
 'Cause as soon as this number runs out, boy, that was my last nickel.

 Oh, oh, oh, oh, my goodness!

513
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:01,520
 Once I get started dancing, I just can't stop.

514
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,520
 I want to go on and on.

515
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,520
 You do?

516
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,520
 Yes.

517
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,520
 Isn't there some place that you go where there's a photograph and some records?

518
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:13,560
 Look Diane, let's just put our heads together and we'll think of something.

519
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:22,920
 Henry, what is it you're trying to say?

520
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:23,920
 Isn't it clear, Mother?

521
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:28,480
 I'm in a music shop on the edge of town, see, and I finally got some records.

522
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,920
 You mean you bought them?

523
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:33,040
 No, I got them on the cuff, on account of my face.

524
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,080
 Your face?

525
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:34,720
 Sure.

526
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,840
 The man said one thing about it, it's honest.

527
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,960
 Well, dear, that's fine, then you're all fixed up.

528
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:41,840
 I am?

529
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,560
 What didn't I tell you? Your father found I am.

530
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:48,640
 Sure, but, well, frankly, mother, there's a slight new development.

531
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,160
 Henry, it's nothing serious.

532
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,000
 Serious? Oh, no.

533
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,200
 What is it?

534
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,460
 Well, brace yourself.

535
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:57,460
 Henry, what's happened?

536
00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:02,200
 I just discovered I sort of lost Mespenser's phonograph.

537
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,300
 You lost it?

538
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:04,900
 Well, not exactly.

539
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:07,900
 That is, I have something else instead.

540
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:09,000
 What?

541
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,300
 A typewriter?

542
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:11,800
 Oh, my heavens.

543
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,200
 The case looks exactly the same, mother,

544
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,200
 so you can't blame the fellow tumor.

545
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,000
 What fellow?

546
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,700
 On the streetcar, the fellow picked up my phonograph

547
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:21,100
 and left me this typewriter.

548
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:21,900
 Oh, my goodness.

549
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:22,900
 Henry, hang up.

550
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:23,900
 Hang up!

551
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:26,900
 I think I can catch your father at Diane's house.

552
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:36,900
 Oh, uh, excuse me, sir.

553
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:39,900
 Okay, mister, don't do it again.

554
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:40,900
 Don't do what?

555
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,900
 Drifting milk in the dirt.

556
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,900
 It isn't milk, it's ice cream.

557
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:50,900
 I got enough to do sweeping out these street cars without people traipsing through and dripping milk.

558
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:54,900
 Well, look, suppose I just sit down here where I'll be out of your way.

559
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,900
 Can't sit there. Why not?

560
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:57,900
 That's the Mortemann seat.

561
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,900
 I don't intend starting your street car.

562
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:02,900
 Just the same, you can't sit there. Company rules.

563
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:05,900
 All right, all right. May I just ask you a simple question?

564
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:09,900
 Last time a layman said on the Mortemann seat there was trouble.

565
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:13,900
 Well, look, you have a lost and found apartment down here at the car barns, haven't you?

566
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:14,900
 Wasn't the lost and found?

567
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:15,900
 What wasn't?

568
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:19,900
 Well, I'll run the thing right off the tracks and smack in the cafeteria.

569
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:23,600
 Look, I'm not interested in your cafeteria.

570
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,400
 It's closed anyway.

571
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:30,400
 May I just ask one simple question.

572
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,400
 I don't see why not.

573
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,400
 Well now look, a little while ago my son was riding on a streetcar.

574
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,400
 This streetcar?

575
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:40,900
 I don't know what streetcar. It doesn't matter what streetcar. The point is...

576
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:42,400
 Mr. E- uh, yes.

577
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,400
 You're dripping in my dirty gimme.

578
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,400
 I'm very sorry.

579
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:52,560
 The point is he had a phonograph on the street car course on the streetcar and

580
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:55,640
 play music on the streetcar

581
00:23:55,640 --> 00:24:00,040
 he wasn't playing it he was carrying it that is he set it down and when he picked

582
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:07,080
 it up he had a typewriter is that so yes sounds like a good trick

583
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:11,720
 oh it was very simple someone else took his phonograph I know a few good tricks

584
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,520
 Michelle, take a number.

585
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,320
 What?

586
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,160
 Any number.

587
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,120
 Go on.

588
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:16,640
 Now, wait.

589
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,120
 All I want to know is this was a phonograph turned in here

590
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,040
 this evening.

591
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:20,720
 A phonograph?

592
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,920
 Yes, belonging to my son.

593
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:26,400
 Oh, you're trying to find your son's phonograph.

594
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:26,960
 Yes.

595
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,400
 Why didn't you say so?

596
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,560
 There was one turned in?

597
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,840
 Oh, say look at that time.

598
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:32,440
 Was there?

599
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,000
 Sorry, Mr. Time for me to go home.

600
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:34,440
 What?

601
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,120
 You tell your story to the nightmare.

602
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,120
 Now, wait a minute.

 [Music]

605
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,120
 Can I move the footstool over for you, Sam?

606
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,120
 I'll bring you your slippers.

607
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:00,120
 This is only one thing you can bring me.

608
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,120
 Yes, dear, what is it?

609
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,120
 A large spoon.

610
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,120
 A spoon?

611
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:07,120
 Yes, I'm going to eat this ice cream.

612
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,120
 Dear, you mean you didn't take it over to the brown?

613
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:12,120
 Under the circumstances I did not go near the Browns.

614
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,120
 But dear, what about Elizabeth's toothpaste?

615
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:17,520
 All my life I've wanted to eat a whole quarter of ice cream,

616
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:22,120
 and now I'm going to sit here quietly by the fire with my book and enjoy myself.

617
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:26,120
 Of course, dear. Wouldn't you like me to bring you a straw?

618
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,120
 Never mind.

619
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,120
 I'll just drink it.

620
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:33,120
 Oh, here, you can take this out to the kitchen.

621
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,120
 What is it?

622
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,120
 Salami.

623
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,120
 Salami?

624
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,720
 Friends, boyfriends always buy something.

625
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,320
 My goodness.

626
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:44,620
 Alice, what's the racket upstairs?

627
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:46,120
 It's Henry, dear.

628
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,520
 Henry, isn't he at the party?

629
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,120
 He can't find the party.

630
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,120
 They all left Homer's house for the havens

631
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,620
 and where they went from there nobody knows.

632
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:55,720
 So Henry's up in his room typing.

633
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,520
 Typing?

634
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:59,520
 He's decided to give up society and write a book.

635
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,720
 He has my whole hearted cooperation.

636
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:05,120
 But, dear, what are we going to do about the lost phonograph?

637
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,320
 Henry can pay for it when he sells his book.

638
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,320
 Now, Sam...

639
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,920
 Alice will worry about that tomorrow.

640
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:14,920
 Right now, all I want to do is to sit back and put my feet up and relax.

641
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,920
 You go right ahead, dear.

642
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:26,920
 Alice, don't move.

643
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,520
 Sam, there's someone at the door.

644
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:31,120
 I know there is, but don't move.

645
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,120
 This is our quiet night at home.

00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,120

 Hello!

649
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,120
 Alice, who's there?

650
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,120
 I haven't the slightest idea.

651
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,120
 Hello, Alice!

652
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,120
 Hello, Alice!

653
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,120
 This is Mr. and Mrs. Conway, Diane's parents.

654
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,120
 So glad to meet you.

655
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,120
 Nice to meet you, all.

656
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:57,120
 Oh, Mrs. Aldridge, I can't begin to thank you for all you've done for Diane.

657
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,120
 I don't mind telling you, we were pretty worried about her for a while.

658
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,860
 Oh, have you such a lovely party over at our house?

659
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:04,620
 We felt we should drop by and say thank you.

660
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:05,700
 - Well, you're quite welcome.

661
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,460
 And since we've never met you before,

662
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:09,260
 Mrs. Aldrich Cora thought it'd be nice

663
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:10,740
 if we really got a queen to do.

664
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:12,380
 - Talked with that chair over a little closer.

665
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:14,140
 - We thought the four of us could sort of

666
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:16,260
 have our own little party.

667
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,100
 - Well.

668
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:19,340
 - Yes, well.

669
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:22,940
 - Well, isn't that grand?

 Hey, it is your family and with their stockings on Christmas Eve.

673
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:46,520
 She was Homer. Who'd want to do a childish thing like that?

674
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:50,520
 Okay, Henry, okay. But I'd just like to point out one thing.

675
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,520
 What, Homer?

676
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:56,520
 It may be childish, but think of all the extra surprise presents you get.

677
00:27:56,520 --> 00:28:00,520
 Right, and say here's a surprise package for your holiday meals.

678
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:04,520
 The new Jell-O Rice Pudding, newest member of the famous Jell-O family.

679
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,520
 There was never anything quite like it before.

680

 Jell-O Pudding, the 10-minute marble.

681
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,520
 All you do is add milk and boil gently for 10 minutes.

682
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:17,520
 No fussy mixing, no bothersome custard to make, no cooking for hours on end.

683
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:21,980
 And you get rice pudding so delicious even expert cooks are amazed.

684
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:26,620
 Super rich, gloriously creamy with real honest-to-goodness homemade flavor.

685
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:30,120
 You can have it plain or fancy, thicker, thin however you like it best.

686
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:34,820
 And once you've tried jello rice pudding, you will never make rice pudding any other way.

687
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:36,620
 So buy it, try it.
