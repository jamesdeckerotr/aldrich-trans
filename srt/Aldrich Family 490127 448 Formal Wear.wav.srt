00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,160
 And now the Jell-O family presents...

3
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,840
 Henry! Henry O'Rourke!

4
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:18,960
 Coming, mother!

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,400
 [Applause]

6
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:29,520
 Yes, it's the Oldridge family based on characters originated by Clifford Goldsmith

7
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:34,080
 and starring Ezra Stone as Henry with Jackie Count as Homer.

8
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:38,680
 And yes, it's the Jell-O family with its three famous desserts.

9
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:41,240
 Jell-O in those six delicious flavors,

10
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:44,560
 Jell-O puddings with that old-fashioned homemade flavor,

11
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,640
 and Jell-O tapioca puddings,

12
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,160
 a miracle of goodness, a marvel of speed.

00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:55,880
 ♪ Everyone's a Jell-O good fellow ♪

14
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:58,400
 ♪ A very good Jell-O good fellow ♪

15
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:02,400
 So rich, so tempting and mellow,

16
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,800
 J-E-L-L-O!

17
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,600
 And now for the Aldrich family.

18
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:20,300
 Whatever and whenever the Golden Age was,

19
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:23,800
 it is less important to most people than the Teenage.

20
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:27,300
 A time of life made notable by typical American boys

21
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:33,300
 like Henry Aldrich and all their mishaps. The scene opens in Mr. Aldrich's bedroom.

22
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,300
 It is just before breakfast.

23
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,300
 But Father, do you think that's fair?

24
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:38,300
 Fair.

25
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:40,300
 I don't mean to be rude, but do you?

26
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:44,300
 Henry, every time you've asked to wear my tuxedo in the past, I've let you have an eye.

27
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:46,300
 You sure, Father, and that's just the point.

28
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,300
 What is?

29
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,300
 Isn't there such a thing as squatters' rights?

30
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:52,300
 Squatter's rights would hardly apply to my tuxedo.

31
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:55,300
 Are you sure we can't rent one for your dance tonight?

32
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:59,300
 Father, there isn't a tuxedo my size left in town.

33
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:00,300
 Sam Henry!

34
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,300
 Then I'm sorry Henry.

35
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,300
 But Kathleen's bought a new formal and everything.

36
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,300
 Aren't you coming down to breakfast?

37
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,300
 Yes Alice! Come along Henry.

38
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:16,300
 Father I know you have the kind of mind that once it's made up dynamite couldn't change it, but could we do this?

39
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,300
 Do what?

40
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:22,300
 Fix it so that you can wear your tuxedo to that concert tonight with a clear conscience.

41
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,300
 My conscience is clear.

42
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:28,300
 Sure, but if I had my own tux, you wouldn't have me hanging over you.

43
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:30,300
 Are you proposing that I'd buy you one?

44
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,300
 You mean you'd consider it?

45
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,300
 Certainly not.

46
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:35,300
 Henry, what's wrong with your blue surge suit?

47
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,300
 My blue surge.

48
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,300
 Father, I give you my word.

49
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:42,300
 There's only one guy in the whole class who dareshow up in civilian clothes, and that's

50
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,300
 Willy Marshall.

51
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,300
 And Father, he has no pride whatsoever.

52
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:48,300
 There's nothing more that I can suggest, Henry.

53
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,300
 And let's consider the subject closed.

54
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:54,140
 My goodness, your eggs are getting cold. Please sit down, both of you.

55
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:57,820
 Mother, I couldn't eat a bite. There you can at least drink your juice.

56
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,100
 Well, I'm all choked up.

57
00:02:59,100 --> 00:02:59,980
 Henry?

58
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,580
 I'm drinking it, Father.

59
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:02,620
 Sam!

60
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:03,740
 Yes, Alice?

61
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:06,300
 Do you know what I was thinking about your tuxedo?

62
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:09,020
 Alice, Henry and I have agreed to close the subject.

63
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:09,740
 We have?

64
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:11,180
 And please answer the phone, Henry.

65
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:12,060
 Yes, Father.

66
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,660
 Drink your juice, Sam.

67
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,740
 Alice, I'm afraid I'm not very hungry either.

68
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:17,180
 Hello?

69
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:18,620
 Hi, Henry. This is Lily.

70
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:19,120
 Who?

71
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:19,880
 Willie Marshall.

72
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,380
 And listen, Henry, how are you fixed for formal shoes?

73
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:22,940
 What?

74
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:24,920
 Formal shoes, formal shoes.

75
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:28,380
 The closest thing I've got is a pair of black and white saddle shoes.

76
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:29,120
 But Willie--

77
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,380
 I've always have trouble dancing in rubber soles.

78
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:33,200
 Have you got an extra pair of patent letters?

79
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,340
 No, I haven't.

80
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,860
 Boy, except for those shoes, I'm practically set.

81
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:40,080
 I've got a stiff shirt, suspenders, and a real genuine cloth

82
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,260
 coronation.

83
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:42,380
 Willie, you mean--

84
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:45,660
 Boy, I need now shoes, black socks, cufflinks, studs,

85
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:46,820
 a muffler, and a girl.

86
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,580
 [LAUGHTER]

87
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:51,740
 Willie, you're actually wearing a tuxedo tonight?

88
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:54,180
 Sure, it's the most important dance of the year.

89
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,580
 Do you think I want to stick out like a sore thumb?

90
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,580
 Well, she was where'd you get it?

91
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:01,080
 From a waiter I know who's off duty tonight.

92
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,580
 Oh boy.

93
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:07,580
 You mean I'm going to be the only one there in just a blue surge suit?

94
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:11,080
 You're? Henry, don't you have any pride whatsoever?

95
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,580
 Listen, Willie, goodbye. I've got to go back to work.

96
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:16,080
 On what? Never mind. Goodbye.

97
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,580
 Father!

98
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:21,080
 Father, could I have your permission to reopen the subject,

99
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:24,080
 providing I use a completely new angle?

100
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:35,080
 Agnes, calm down. You're on the phone.

101
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:39,080
 Calm down, Homer. How can I calm down when I'm miserable?

102
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,080
 You mean your parents won't buy you a new form of...

103
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:45,080
 No, they said the minute I stopped growing in all directions, they'll get me one.

104
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:48,080
 - We're in a lapi. - Well, it won't be before the dance.

105
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,080
 I know that.

106
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,080
 She was. I've got my tuxedo all pressed and everything.

107
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,080
 - You have? - Sure. It's been under my mattress for a week.

108
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,080
 Look, Agnes, what's wrong with your own form?

109
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,080
 Oh, it's prehistoric.

110
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,080
 What?

111
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,080
 Sure, it's got a neckline that practically comes up to my chin,

112
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:08,080
 and I don't want to stick out like a sore thumb.

113
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,080
 Agnes, what are we going to do?

114
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,080
 I'll just have to keep working on my folks till I wear them down.

115
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:18,080
 I know, but the only thing is Homer, if I do talk to him in a buying a new dress,

116
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,080
 I can't get them to give me money for the tickets, too.

117
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:24,080
 What? But Agnes, that's our arrangement.

118
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,080
 I take you out and you flip the bills.

119
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:31,080
 Homer, can't you make us sacrifice justice once?

120
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,080
 How can I, I'm broke.

121
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,080
 Why not ask your father for some money?

122
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,080
 Agnes, I have a bargain with my father.

123
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,080
 What, father?

124
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,080
 I don't mention money, and he doesn't mention my report card.

125
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,840
 (laughing)

126
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,680
 - Hey, old man.

127
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,680
 - Look, Homer, if I hang up now,

128
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,480
 I think I can corner my father in the living room.

129
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,320
 Goodbye.

130
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,320
 - Bye.

131
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:52,480
 - Homer, would you be willing to sign this protest?

132
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,400
 - Can't you let me worry and pee?

133
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,600
 - But listen, it says, we're as in here too,

134
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,680
 all in sundry, know the country club

135
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,000
 gets pretty darn stuffy, to heck with tuxedos,

136
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,840
 and let's make this a simple dance where nobody dresses.

137
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,280
 - You don't want it formal?

138
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,680
 - Boy, have you ever tried putting on a tuxedo?

139
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,200
 You finally get the stiff shirt on, seat,

140
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,520
 and then you have to lie on your back to put on your shoes.

141
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,360
 But, Henry--

142
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,240
 And by the time you're through,

143
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,480
 you're no good for anything signed here.

144
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,640
 Well, before I do, I'd like to make just one minor change.

145
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,140
 What?

146
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:26,760
 Instead of all that junk about tuxedos,

147
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,320
 just say, whereas, in here too, we

148
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:32,080
 think it's a disgrace to charge money for tickets.

149
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:32,560
 Why?

150
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,680
 Gee, was the dances for members of our own classes,

151
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,800
 and it's like charging to get into your own house.

152
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,160
 But Homer, I've got to.

153
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,920
 And I've got a tuxedo.

154
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,420
 Oh.

155
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:45,160
 Look, Henry, how'd you like to do me a big fave?

156
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:45,760
 What fave?

157
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:48,440
 All you have to do is point out to my father

158
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,640
 that if your father gave you money for tickets,

159
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:53,200
 the least my father can do is get in the spirit.

160
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:53,760
 Well--

161
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,840
 Will you do that, Henry?

162
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,240
 Sure, Homer, old-timer.

163
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:56,960
 You will.

164
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,120
 And while I'm doing that to your father,

165
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,120
 would you point out just one thing to my father?

166
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:05,120
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

167
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:17,620
 Look at me, Father! Look at me! Isn't it heavenly?

168
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:19,120
 What is that you're wearing, Kathleen?

169
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,900
 Mine your evening gown for the dad's tonight, do you like it?

170
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:23,900
 Where's the rest of it?

171
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:24,900
 That's all there is.

172
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:25,900
 What?

173
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:26,900
 Isn't it heavenly?

174
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,000
 Heavenly is hardly the word.

175
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,100
 So, Father, would you be willing to point out to Mother that her pearls are just what

176
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,660
 I need to round me out?

177
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:37,820
 Kathleen, you don't need rounding out, you need covering up.

178
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,260
 (audience laughs)

179
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,540
 I want you to wear that lace shoe

180
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:41,980
 all your grandmother gave you for Christmas.

181
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:42,820
 - A lace shoe.

182
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:43,820
 - Around your shoulders.

183
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:45,540
 - That's Father, it'll ruin the whole effect.

184
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:47,140
 - That's just what I had in mind.

185
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:47,980
 - Father.

186
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:50,460
 - Kathleen, I will not have you catching pneumonia in public.

187
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:51,780
 - But I've been taking vitamins,

188
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,340
 don't you think that's enough protection?

189
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:54,260
 - I do not.

190
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:56,020
 - But Father, if I go to the dance hall,

191
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:59,180
 cover it up with a show of a stick out like a sore thumb.

192
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:01,760
 (upbeat music)

193
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:13,480
 Mr. Brown, is that you under the hood of your car?

194
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,480
 Was that...

195
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,480
 Oh, it's you, Henry.

196
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,480
 Yes, sir.

197
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,720
 Hand me that small wrench within.

198
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,720
 Sure, here.

199
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,720
 Thanks.

200
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,320
 Well, what can I do for you, Henry?

201
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,320
 For me?

202
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,320
 Why, you...

203
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:28,400
 Why just happened to be casually passing by?

204
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:35,800
 I said to myself why not talk the whole thing over with good old mr. Brown talk what over Homer? Oh

205
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:39,760
 You're standing on my pliers. Oh

206
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,840
 gee poor kid I

207
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,840
 Keep thinking of them in that dance tonight

208
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:52,840
 Everybody who's everybody is there see and where's poor old Homer? Where that's just it?

209
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:59,580
 The biggest affair of the whole term and he hasn't enough money to pay for his tickets. Oh

210
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,600
 The poor kid

211
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:07,160
 Doesn't it touch you? It does not and she's own for it

212
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:10,900
 He spent every last time he had in the world on a pair of waterproof raw hide boots

213
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,120
 Well, gee whiz mr. Brown

214
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:15,560
 Even if he did go overboard for a practical thing like waterproof boots

215
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:21,840
 You think you want to make him suffer for it? I mean boy, we all make mistakes. You don't say sure

216
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,820
 Even I make them.

217
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:26,280
 - He was, do you know when I did once? - What?

218
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:29,680
 I put a dime in a peanut machine seat, and you know what came out?

219
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,580
 - What? - Three cents stands.

220
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:34,780
 So you see, those things happen to the best of us.

221
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:39,680
 Henry, it isn't easy for a father to teach his son that money doesn't grow on trees,

222
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,080
 but it has to be done.

223
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,380
 Now, if he's going to that dance, you'll have to dig up the ticket money himself.

224
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:46,680
 - But Mr. Brown... - I have to think of his character.

225
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,280
 But she was, Mr. Brown, think of me.

226
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,780
 - You? - Sure.

227
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:56,620
 When the band strikes up the first wall, and I look out the window, and there's Homer.

228
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:58,140
 Poor kid.

229
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:01,340
 All dressed up in his tuxedo and no tickets.

230
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:06,620
 Staring in at us, with his nose pressed up against the window.

231
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:09,660
 Boy, I won't be able to dance a step.

232
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:10,940
 You don't say.

233
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:14,540
 It was now that I think I'm poor kid.

234
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:17,260
 I've got half of mine to give Homer my tickets.

235
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:18,620
 And not go yourself?

236
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:21,620
 Yes, sir. I've got half a mine.

237
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,720
 (audience laughing)

238
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,900
 - Henry, did Homer ask you to speak to me?

239
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:27,820
 - Homer?

240
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:31,380
 Well, gee whiz, Mr. Brown, I give you my word.

241
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,220
 Look, here are my two tickets.

242
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:34,660
 You give them to Homer.

243
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:35,900
 - You really mean that, Henry?

244
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:36,740
 - Sure.

245
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:37,820
 - You're positive?

246
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:38,940
 - Positive.

247
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:41,140
 - Well, thank you very much.

248
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,340
 - Mr. Brown, you mean you're really gonna take them?

249
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:45,920
 (upbeat music)

250
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,500
 (upbeat music)

251
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:53,120
 - What's the name, Mr.?

252
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:53,920
 - All rich.

253
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,720
 - And could you have it pressed by three o'clock?

254
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,480
 - Three.

255
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,980
 - Look, Mr. I've got every tuxedo and centerville

256
00:10:58,980 --> 00:10:59,820
 in my shop.

257
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:00,960
 - Yes, I know.

258
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,680
 Well, as long as I have it in time for the concert tonight.

259
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,120
 Oh, and here I'll pay for it now.

260
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,000
 - Send it to 117 Elm Street.

261
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,520
 - Okay, Mr. I'll try, but I've only got two hands, you know.

262
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,560
 - Yes, I know.

263
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,600
 Thanks very much.

264
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,660
 Well, Gee was... Hi Mr. Aldridge.

265
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:18,760
 Hello Homer.

266
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,360
 Aww, isn't that fantastic?

267
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,260
 I beg your pardon.

268
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:26,460
 Here I've been looking all over San Diego for you and Gee was here you are.

269
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:27,660
 You've been looking for me?

270
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:28,460
 Yes sir.

271
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:30,660
 I thought we might have a little chat.

272
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:31,460
 Chat?

273
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:32,460
 Yes sir.

274
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:33,460
 You and I?

275
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,460
 Yes sir.

276
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:37,460
 Homer, I'm afraid I'm in a hurry. I'm driving out to see a client.

277
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:39,460
 That's swell. I'll go with you.

278
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:39,960
 What?

279
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,960
 Then we can chat as we drive.

280
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,960
 All said Mr. Aldridge.

281
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,180
 Mush.

282
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:46,060
 What did you say?

283
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:47,180
 Mush.

284
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:50,140
 Let's ask him, Oph, let's start.

285
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:51,140
 I see.

286
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:53,540
 [LAUGHTER]

287
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:55,860
 Homa.

288
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:58,180
 Homa, what's on your mind?

289
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:59,540
 On my mind.

290
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:02,660
 I look like I have something on it.

291
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:04,940
 Frankly, it's hard to tell.

292
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:07,980
 I just thought we'd have a chat.

293
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:10,180
 How are you, Mr. Aldrich?

294
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:11,460
 Fine.

295
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:13,620
 That's fine.

296
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:16,820
 Well, now that we've had our chat, shall I let you off at the next corner?

297
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,920
 Before I drop a hint about the sale.

298
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:19,520
 What sale?

299
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:23,020
 Why the one the Emporium is having, unpractically everything.

300
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:23,720
 You don't say.

301
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,320
 Yes, sir.

302
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,720
 Especially Tuxedo.

303
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,420
 Tuxedo?

304
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:27,620
 Yes, sir.

305
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:29,020
 Boy, if...

306
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:31,820
 If a person wanted to buy one, now's the time.

307
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:32,520
 I see.

308
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:35,320
 Well, thank you very much, Homer, but I really don't need one.

309
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:38,320
 Mr. Aldridge, I didn't mean you. I'm in Henry.

310
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,520
 I know you did.

311
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:42,720
 Mr. Aldridge, why not look at it this way?

312
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,720
 Don't you warn Henry to get married and get out of the house someday?

313
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,720
 I certainly do.

314
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,720
 Well, he'll need a tuxedo for the ceremony.

315
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:55,720
 When that time comes, I'll scrape up the money somewhere.

316
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,720
 Homer, do you realize I'm driving all the way to Middletown?

317
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,720
 You are, as far as that?

318
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:04,720
 Yes, and it'll probably be several hours before I come back, so maybe it'll be best if I drop you at the next corner.

319
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,720
 Oh, no, Mr. Old, which I'll go along.

320
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,720
 But Homer...

321
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:11,720
 looks of things and may take me at least a couple of hours to have this little chat.

322
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:25,800
 Hello there Henry, what do you have?

323
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:29,640
 Gee Mr. Dehaven, I don't know if I'm in the mood for anything.

324
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:34,280
 Mr. Dehaven, do you happen to have a set of cufflinks and studs for as little as a dollar?

325
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,400
 Cufflinks and studs?

326
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,400
 That's one thing I haven't been able to dig up.

327
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,400
 I'm afraid I don't carry them, Willie.

328
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,400
 Oh.

329
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,400
 Say Henry, would you mind if I have a few dances with your girl tonight?

330
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,400
 My girl.

331
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,400
 That's another thing I haven't been able to dig up.

332
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:50,400
 Willie, I may not even be going to the dance tonight.

333
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:53,400
 You won't? Gee, when we're having a slow orchestra and everything?

334
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,400
 I know.

335
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,400
 I hear they're even working their way through college. That's how good they are.

336
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:00,400
 Well, I'd better try someplace else for those stunts.

337
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,400
 Hi, Homer.

338
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,400
 Listen, Homer, where have you been?

339
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:06,400
 Chatting with your father. Chatting with your father.

340
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:11,400
 And that's the last time I'll ever talk to a lawyer in my life, even socially.

341
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,400
 Listen Homer, speaking of fathers...

342
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:17,400
 Boy is he tricky. I had him to the point where any minute I thought he was gonna say,

343
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,400
 "Okay, I'll buy Henry a tuxedo."

344
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,400
 Yeah.

345
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,400
 And the next thing I knew there I was lending you mine.

346
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,400
 What?

347
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,400
 I never know how he did it.

348
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:30,400
 Homer, your father did the same thing. I'm giving you my tickets.

349
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,400
 What?

350
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:34,400
 Gee, we're right back where we started from.

351
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,440

00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,120
 Listen, Homer, come in here.

531
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,120
 - Did you get the cookies?

532
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,360
 - Never mind the cookies.

533
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,240
 Word ya hide it, word ya hide it.

534
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,400
 - Hide what?

535
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,280
 - Listen, Henry, who took my tuxedo off the banister here?

536
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,640
 - Homer, you weren't fooling me.

537
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,000
 You wait until I left the house

538
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,040
 and then you sneaked it outside, didn't you?

539
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,000
 - Boy, are you an actor.

540
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,460
 I know darn well you've hidden it somewhere.

541
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:18,760
 Come on, where is it?

542
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:19,920
 Where is it yourself?

543
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,200
 Can we stop shoving?

544
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,800
 Stop shoving yourself.

545
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,640
 Henry.

546
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,640
 Homer?

547
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,220
 (upbeat music)

548
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:35,120
 Yes, young man?

549
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,120
 You have a tuxedo that was brought in here

550
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,040
 to be pressed under the name of Aldrich.

551
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,200
 Aldrich, I think so.

552
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,760
 Oh boy, I knew it, I knew it.

553
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,600
 Knew what?

554
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:48,760
 I've come to pick it up right here on the right they are all paid for it is boy

555
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,280
 That's well

556
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:56,640
 Hey, what's wrong? Are you sure this is my tuxedo? It looks for sizes too large young man

557
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,040
 Would you mind standing back from this pressing machine?

558
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:08,600
 Look at the way it swims on me don't you want to be nice and casual sure, but I don't want to overdo it

559
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:13,200
 Suppose I'm dancing with Agnes and she turns me around fast

560
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,200
 Where's the tuxedo?

561
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,200
 What?

562
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,200
 And even more important, where am I?

563
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:23,200
 Look young man, there are 75 dress suits on those racks that belong to the symphony orchestra

564
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,200
 and they all have to be pressed by 7.30.

565
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,200
 Now would you please stay in back?

566
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,200
 But could I prove you made a mistake?

567
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,200
 Prove it.

568
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,200
 Sure, you see this button?

569
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,200
 Looks fine.

570
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,200
 That's just it, my jacket didn't have one.

571
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,200
 You don't say.

572
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,200
 Sure, it was off.

573
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,200
 You don't say.

574
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,200
 Come here.

575
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,200
 What are you gonna do?

576
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,200
 There.

577
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,200
 Hey!

578
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:47,480

579
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:53,240
 orchestra well okay yes let the trousers on in the back room okay but wouldn't it be easy to

580
00:22:53,240 --> 00:23:01,160

581
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:07,400
 yes sir excuse me but you have a tuxedo you're pressing under the name of brown brown yeah was

582
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,900
 - The sure Homer took us tuxedo and brought it down here

583
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:10,740
 to be pressed.

584
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:13,100
 - Oh, I just look at these pans.

585
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,460
 If I pull them up, they'll cover my stiff shirt.

586
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:17,260
 - Homer, so I was right.

587
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:20,540
 - Listen, Henry, this'll teach you not to try it out Fox me.

588
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:22,820
 - Homer, I won this tuxedo fear and square.

589
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:24,140
 Now hand over that Jack.

590
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,980
 - Oh, Henry, let go of that sling.

591
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:26,980
 - Let go of yourself.

592
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:28,980
 - Boy, boy, let go.

593
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,300
 - Oh boy.

594
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:32,940
 - You just look out for that right, Homer.

595
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:34,820
 (dice clattering)

596
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:39,060
 Oh no! Oh the orchestra, the orchestra!

597
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:41,820
 Look what you've done to the orchestra!

598
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:55,060
 [music]

599
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:56,540
 How do I look, mother?

600
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:57,900
 Very nice, dear.

601
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,700
 I do. I really do.

602
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,380
 Even sitting down?

603
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:06,100
 Boy, imagine finally getting a tuxedo on my own.

604
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,620
 Yeah, imagine.

605
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:14,180
 The only thing is, why do you suppose Uncle John wired that money for a birthday present today?

606
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:14,980
 Why?

607
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:17,220
 My birthday isn't until next month.

608
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:19,780
 He probably wanted to be sure he didn't forget.

609
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:25,220
 I know, but Gee was he never gave me anything like $50 before.

610
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:26,260
 Well...

611
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:31,940
 Well, uh, you see, uh, Uncle John suddenly sold that copper mine stock of his.

612
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:34,420
 Gee whiz, who did he unload that on?

613
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:34,980
 Why?

614
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:38,500
 Uh, his town hall just dropped us at the front entrance, Henry.

615
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:39,780
 Yes, mother.

616
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:43,300
 Gee, you're sure it won't inconvenience you to loan me the car, father?

617
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:45,540
 No, we'll get a ride home with someone.

618
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:46,740
 Thanks a lot.

619
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:49,300
 Gee, a tuxedo and a car.

620
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:52,340
 Boy, this is gonna be the biggest night of my life.

621
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:53,300
 Good night.

622
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,660
 Have a good time, Henry.

623
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:55,940
 Good night, son.

624
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:59,940
 Sam, I'm very proud of you.

625
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:00,940
 What for?

626
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:02,940
 Dear, you know very well.

627
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:04,940
 Alice, it really wasn't anything.

628
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:08,940
 If they ever do find copper in that mine, I'll make a fortune out of that stock.

629
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:11,940
 Let's go in the concert to do a start.

630
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:16,940
 You know, Sam, I still think you should have gotten yourself a tuxedo when you went down with Henry.

631
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:21,940
 Alice, for the last time, this tuxedo is all right. It's just comfortably snug.

632
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:25,620
 If you say so dear, just be careful when you sit down.

633
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:27,780
 Let's go to our seats.

634
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:29,300
 Oh, that's strange.

635
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,420
 What's wrong?

636
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:33,220
 I'm positive I put the tickets in my jacket this morning.

637
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:34,580
 Sam, you mean you don't have them?

638
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:38,100
 Let's not get excited, Alice. Maybe someone found them and turned them in at the ticket window.

639
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,460
 Oh, excuse me, mister?

640
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:40,020
 Yes, sir.

641
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:42,260
 Or did someone turn in two lost tickets?

642
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:43,380
 Third row, center?

643
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:44,580
 No, they haven't, I'm sorry.

644
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:45,460
 Sam!

645
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,820
 Alice, I can buy other tickets.

646
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:49,540
 As a matter of fact, I do have two left in the last row.

647
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:51,620
 Sam, take them or we'll miss the first number.

648
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:55,120
 There's no rush madam. We're starting a half hour late. Half hour late? Why?

649
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,120
 Well, the orchestra had some difficulty with their dress suits tonight.

650
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:01,120
 They're still getting them sorted. Here you are sir. Four dollars please.

651
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,120
 Hey, Agnes, look who's here.

652
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,120
 Hi Mrs. Oliver, time Mr. Oliver, how do we look?

653
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:09,120
 Lovely dear. Is that a new formal?

654
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,120
 I'll say I got a five minutes before the star close.

655
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,120
 You don't say.

656
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,620
 Yeah, my father finally agreed my request was perfectly reasonable,

657
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:20,620
 and told my mother to buy me the formal before I went out of his mind.

658
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,820
 But why aren't you two at the dance?

659
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:26,060
 We're making a real evening of it, the concert and then the dance.

660
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:27,140
 You don't say.

661
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:28,460
 Have some popcorn.

662
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:29,300
 Popcorn.

663
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:31,980
 That's the only way I can enjoy concerts.

664
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:35,700
 Homer, you mean your father finally gave in and bought you the tickets for the dance?

665
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,660
 No, the tailor did.

666
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:38,260
 What's that?

667
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:38,980
 Sure.

668
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:43,340
 All I had to do was promise to use the tailor shop on the other side of town from now on.

669
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:45,300
 [LAUGHTER]

670
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:47,900
 And he threw in tickets for the concert too.

671
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:51,060
 No, gee, it's the strangest thing how I got those.

672
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:54,060
 I just happened to reach into the inside pocket of my jacket,

673
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:55,600
 and there they were.

674
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,240
 What?

675
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,500
 Third row center.

676
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:58,840
 Sam.

677
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:02,840
 Homer, isn't that tuxedo a little loose on you?

678
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:07,220
 Gee, you should have seen it before the tailor sold me together.

679
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:10,480
 And was there a button missing on your tuxedo jacket?

680
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,180
 She was.

681
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:12,740
 How did you know?

682
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:13,540
 Never mind.

683
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:15,900
 Will you step into the washroom with me for a minute?

684
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:18,900
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

685
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:32,500
 Gee, Henry, who's that new girl on the snazzy dress dancing

686
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,100
 with Homer?

687
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:34,500
 Boy, is she snazzy.

688
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,780
 How do I know?

689
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:40,460
 Well, Gee whiz, if it isn't Agnes Lawson, boy.

690
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:43,180
 Agnes Lawson, boy, here's where I cut in.

691
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:44,100
 Hi, Agnes.

692
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,220
 Now listen, Willie.

693
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:48,680
 How am I way willy? Here's where I cut in. Hi, Agnes.

694
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,080
 Now listen, Henry.

695
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:54,040
 Thank you. Where have I been all my life? Bye!

696
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:57,040
 Sure, it's great to be popular.

697
00:27:57,040 --> 00:28:01,560
 And that's what happens to a hostess when she serves Jello Tapioca Puddings for dessert.

698
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:06,320
 Yup, Jello Tapioca Puddings, a miracle of goodness, a marvel of speed.

699
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,080
 And Jello Tapioca Puddings are ready prepared.

700
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:12,240
 All you do is add milk and cook for about five minutes.

701
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:16,060
 Nothing to go wrong, and three glorious flavors.

702
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:19,420
 Jello Vanilla Tapioca Luscious Light and Mellow
