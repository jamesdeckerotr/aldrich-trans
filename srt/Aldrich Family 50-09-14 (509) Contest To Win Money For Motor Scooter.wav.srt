 Somebody once said, "When trouble comes, it never rains but that it pours."

 But with Henry Orridge, it's just one long deluge.

 Boy, Homer, wait a year, see ya.

00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 Henry, I don't want to be late for school.

 Don't worry, it's right on the way.

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 Listen, Henry, if it's such a bargain, how come nobody's grabbed it all?

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 Well, Gee whiz, Homer, not everybody can use a motor scooter.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 And you sure are giving it away?

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,600
 Well, not exactly giving it, but it's almost the same thing.

13
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,000
 There it is, Homer.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000

00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,400

 - Let's go.

 She's never tried to bite me,

 Good morning, Mr. Goulston.

 A noble effort, but I think you would just send it to the lake.

 I don't like to disagree with you, Mr. Goulston, but we won't.

 No, I'll be here when the bell rings,

 Oh, uh, by the way, class, the Emporium Department Store is running a quiz contest for students.

 Oh, I'm sure I will, Mr. Dagobson.

00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:45,380
 Thank you. Although it first lands, it would be in the mighty way of remembering.

60
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:50,380
 When somebody finds the scooter before we go get back, boy, that would be a dirty trade.

 No, you don't want to go on. I'm going down to the ring one round.

 to ancient history?

71
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,380
 I know it's a very dull subject

72
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:20,300
 and it's not very important.

00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:24,540
 and you shouldn't even have to learn it here in school.

 Oh, yes ma'am.

 Yes, in a tagleston.

00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:57,980
 Oh, this will do.

183
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:00,280
 Now, remember boys, you're gonna have it for one day.

184
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:03,480
 Oh boy, we're going to go home and style.

185
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:07,480
 Well, a guy's be surprised when they see us whizzing down the street.

186
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,980
 Boy, we ever pass them up on their old bike.

187
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:10,580
 Yeah.

188
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,480
 Okay, we're getting our outfit here in the back.

189
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,580
 You can drive.

190
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:14,580
 Me?

191
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:17,280
 And then I'm going to drive a scooter.

192
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,480
 Can't you know where you're going?

193
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,180
 No.

194
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,480
 You need a new line.

195
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:24,980
 Well, camping much, too, it probably starts the same way as a motorcycle.

196
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:25,980
 Oh, sure.

197
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:28,580
 You know how to start a motorcycle? No

198
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:32,220
 Don't you step on this thing

199
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:36,220
 You almost had it here. We try it again. Okay

200
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:41,540
 Maybe this brother starts something I guess no

201
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:47,300
 Anyway, the motor sure sounds good now in the windman home. I think I've got it first you give her plenty of gas

202
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,060
 And I choke it a little then you step on this thing

203
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:57,060
 [Music]

204
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:01,060
 Boy, here it took us twice as loyal to get home with the schoolers.

205
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:04,060
 No, Homer, we won't always have to push it.

206
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:06,060
 Come on, I want my father to see it.

207
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:08,060
 Father!

208
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,060
 Mother!

209
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:11,060
 Mother!

210
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:14,060
 Mother!

211
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:17,060
 Goodness, Henry, what's the matter? Is anything wrong?

212
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,060
 What is it, Henry?

213
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:20,060
 How are you on the front lawn?

214
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:22,060
 Look, do you see anything?

215
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:23,060
 I certainly do.

216
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:26,060
 Wouldn't the wall left that pile of junk on our lawn?

217
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:29,060
 Law? Father, it's a scooter and it's wrong.

218
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:32,060
 Yeah, great. You did it. I bought it on approval.

219
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:33,060
 Approval? Who?

220
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:34,060
 Yours, Folling.

221
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:38,060
 I was hoping you could see your way clear to advance me something on my allowance.

222
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:42,060
 Well, I don't know, Henry. I'd like you to learn the value of money.

223
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:47,060
 When I was a boy, I always made a point to save something every week out of my allowance.

224
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:50,060
 What did you do with the money you saved father?

225
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:53,060
 Why I got married.

226
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:57,060
 Frankly father, I'd rather have the scooter.

227
00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:00,060
 Never mind how this all got it.

228
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:03,060
 Don't worry Henry, I'll talk to your father.

229
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:06,060
 Boy, did you hear that? I can have the scooter.

230
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:09,060
 But Henry earlier mother said, "Well she talked to your father."

231
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,060
 I can't explain at home.

232
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:14,060
 But all my mother has to do is just keep on talking and talking.

233
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:17,860
 And somehow she always gets my father to see her point of view.

234
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:18,860
 She died?

235
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:19,860
 Sure.

236
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,300
 What happens when your mother talks to your father?

237
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:25,260
 He goes out to the garage and starts pounding nails.

238
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:28,060
 Come on, let's go for a ride.

239
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:30,060
 You don't even know how to start it.

240
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:34,060
 Let's see if we've tried everything, gas, choke, or release of mercy.

241
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:36,060
 Boy, here we go.

242
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,060
 Why him?

243
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:39,060
 We've got to be ignition turned on.

244
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:40,060
 Oh, here it is.

245
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:41,060
 I got it going.

246
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:43,060
 All right, in, home, all right.

247
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:45,060
 Keep going Henry

248
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,060
 Why is this well?

249
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:52,060
 They didn't bother me with heart-making, or I better die invested.

250
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:54,060
 Okay, Homer, you can go back.

251
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:57,060
 Henry, can we look out for that tree?

252
00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:00,060
 Okay, Homer, I can't stop!

253
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,060
 But I'm the brave.

254
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,060
 Where is this?

255
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:06,060
 The area, the area, come far!

256
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:08,060
 [GUNSHOT]

257
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:10,060
 [LAUGHTER]

258
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:12,060
 He's a [INAUDIBLE]

259
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,060
 I'm a whore.

260
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:15,060
 You're a whore, you know.

261
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,060
 Never.

262
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:18,060
 Never mind about me.

263
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:21,060
 What happened to the scooter?

264
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,060
 Look at it.

265
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:25,060
 Gosh, Homer.

266
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:26,060
 What a wreck.

267
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:28,060
 Here's the part that still works.

268
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:30,060
 [Laughter]

269
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:33,060
 I took my private pieces in the garage before my father's season.

270
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:36,060
 You grab the insurance, I'll take an order.

271
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,060
 Okay, come on.

272
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:39,060
 Let's plug it over into the garage.

273
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,060
 Hey, what's your pharmacy in?

274
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:41,660
 I see it if we put in there.

275
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:43,860
 No, he always parts the car in the driveway.

276
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:46,660
 There.

277
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:49,060
 Boy, what am I going to tell him?

278
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:49,760
 I'm coming.

279
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,760
 I'll wait here.

280
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,060
 Yes, Father?

281
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:54,260
 Hey, that was the segostin on the pole.

282
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:55,760
 It was, Father.

283
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,860
 You can forget all about me buying that scooter

284
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:59,660
 until your ancient history improves.

285
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:00,660
 Yes, Father.

286
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:04,260
 But Father, would it be all right if I bought it out of my allowance, though?

287
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:07,860
 I'm also cutting off your allowance until you catch up in your studies.

288
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:10,500
 Even though I have debts to pay, legal obligations.

289
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,000
 That's all I have to say, Henry.

290
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,820
 You can convince me of your sincerity

291
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,900
 by doing better in your schoolwork.

292
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:16,820
 She wins.

293
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:17,820
 Hey, Henry.

294
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:18,820
 Come here, Homer.

295
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,100
 Heard what your father told you.

296
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,260
 What are you going to do?

297
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:24,060
 All I know is, Homer, are we in trouble?

298
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,060
 We.

299
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:27,060
 I like it in this.

300
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:29,180
 But then you say you want to be a partner?

301
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:29,900
 Sure, Henry.

302
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,580
 Believe me, Homer, it's legal.

303
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:33,420
 You ask, and I accept it.

304
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:34,500
 It's a contract.

305
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,620
 Ask any lawyer.

306
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:36,620
 Oh, boy.

307
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:39,120
 Henry, you get me in the dine this trouble.

308
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,820
 Look, Homer, old pal, all we need is $11.60.

309
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:44,620
 Now, what did you ask your father?

310
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:47,620
 I will not. Absolutely no, Henry.

311
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:50,620
 You know my father. I wouldn't dare ask him.

312
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:57,620
 Father, can I speak to you a minute?

313
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:59,620
 What is it, Homer?

314
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:02,120
 I'd like to ask you an embarrassing question.

315
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,620
 Well?

316
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:06,460
 I have $11.60.

317
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:09,900
 I'll give you an answer, which causes me no embarrassment.

318
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:10,900
 No.

319
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:11,900
 [LAUGHTER]

320
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:12,740
 She was father.

321
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:14,580
 Don't you mean you want to score?

322
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:16,620
 Frankly, no.

323
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:17,780
 What is it for?

324
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:20,660
 Well, you see, Henry and I want to buy this motor scooter.

325
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:21,860
 A motor scooter?

326
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,180
 I used one?

327
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:23,940
 Yes, sir.

328
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,060
 Quite a bit.

329
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:26,900
 I'm afraid not.

330
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:29,140
 Accidents happen with scooters.

331
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:30,100
 They do, father.

332
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:33,020
 I can't imagine why you want a scooter, Homer.

333
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:35,620
 Now I could understand it if it was a new bicycle.

334
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:37,020
 I can't have a new bicycle?

335
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:37,820
 No.

336
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,220
 For a father.

337
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:56,020
 Lace, have you ever wondered why we recommend that you keep several jello flavors on hand

338
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:58,020
 instead of buying just one at a time?

339

 [

340
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:03,020

341

 Three way to get the package with the big red letters, J-E-L-L-O.

 Your drosser has Canada's red letter dessert.

344
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:16,020
 And now we're getting back to the troubles of Henry Alders.

345
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:21,020

346
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:22,020

 The scene opens and the Alders living room.

348
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:32,180
 paper down Sam. Sam. Dear. What is the dollar? I want to talk to you about Henry.

349
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:39,460
 Before I fortified myself with breakfast. Sam. All right. Why isn't Henry more like

350
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:45,140
 some of the other boys at school? What boys? Well, as Christmas and the news, he's an

351
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:50,180
 outstanding student. Alice, the boy that plays the pickle on. There's nothing wrong

352
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:52,060
 with Henry, you straighten himself off.

353
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:55,820
 - Maybe he'd only take a real interest in your studies.

354
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:58,180
 If I could only get him to make a game of it,

355
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:00,300
 that's how Roslyn Burke got hurt to girls

356
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:03,220
 to enter the quiz contest at the Emporium.

357
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:05,340
 Then why couldn't I do that with Henry?

358
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:07,700
 - If they didn't get Henry to enter the quiz contest

359
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,300
 by pretending it's a game.

360
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:11,700
 - Then at least I can call it to his attention.

361
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,780
 - Good morning, mother, good morning, father.

362
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:15,980
 - Good morning, how do you feel there?

363
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,420
 - Fine, mother.

364
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:19,780
 Father, could I ask you a legal question?

365
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:24,580
 If you'll make it short, Henry, I always dislike giving free legal advice.

366
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:31,020
 Suppose A is driving something belonging to B.

367
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:33,700
 - This car? - Yes, it is.

368
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:40,500
 Could be. And A has an accident and ruins the scooter, the car.

369
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:45,140
 What could happen to A if we can't pay for the damages?

370
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,980
 Does A have a driver's license?

371
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,380
 No, three doesn't even have a car.

372
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:50,780
 I mean, no sir.

373
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:53,180
 The day is in serious trouble.

374
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:56,180
 Not only can we have a jail for the non-settlement

375
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:59,280
 of a legal death with a judgment obtained in court,

376
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:02,480
 but the police can press criminal charges against they.

377
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,480
 I wouldn't even recommend the lawyer for it.

378
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,980
 Nothing can help him.

379
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,480
 I think.

380
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,380
 You don't think the law may have been changed

381
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:10,980
 since you went to school, huh?

382
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:12,980
 [LAUGHTER]

383
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:13,980
 Yes, sir.

384
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,180
 It's not like the Henry.

385
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:19,580
 Look, Henry, the Emporium Department store is running a quiz contest.

386
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:23,780
 They've got a big ad in the paper, which should be a lot of fun.

387
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:24,780
 Yes, Mom.

388
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:27,980
 It's like a game. They ask you all sorts of questions.

389
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:28,980
 Yes, Mom.

390
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:32,380
 Do you put it in your pocket? You can look at it later if you're interested.

391
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:35,180
 Hi.

392
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:38,380
 Boy, Homer, did I just get some bad news?

393
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,980
 Listen, Henry, we're able to...

394
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,980
 Don't you feel well?

395
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:43,580
 Here you pale.

396
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:46,580
 Yeah, must be prison power setting.

397
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:49,580
 - Did you get some money from Mr. Randall?

398
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:51,580
 - Not yet, and I just found out, but unless we pay,

399
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:54,580
 we can go to prison for years.

400
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:57,580
 - I'd be telling you, Henry, I had nothing to do with it.

401
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:01,580
 - Apparently you don't realize that you're in a accessory after the fact.

402
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:03,580
 - Henry, that doesn't make sense.

403
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:06,580
 - Not supposed to make sense. It's legal talk.

404
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:11,580
 - Henry, will you get that out in the kitchen?

405
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:12,580
 All right, mother.

406
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:13,580
 Just a minute, almost.

407
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:14,580
 Hello?

408
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:15,580
 Hello.

409
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:16,580
 Can I stick to Henry Aldrich?

410
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:17,580
 This is he talking.

411
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:19,580
 This is Mr. Randall, Henry.

412
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:21,580
 What about the scooter?

413
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,580
 Do you want to buy it?

414
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:26,580
 Yes, Mr. Randall, but I don't have the money right this minute.

415
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:29,580
 I'll be happy to give you my personal I/O you though.

416
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:32,580
 Well, that won't be necessary as long as you're going to buy it.

417
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:33,580
 Your father is good for it.

418
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:34,580
 Oh, sure.

419
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:35,580
 Tell me, how's it run?

420
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:37,580
 Is the motor missing?

421
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:38,580
 Oh, no.

422
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,580
 I know just where it is.

423
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:42,180
 (audience laughing)

424
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:44,580
 - Now, you are every single piece.

425
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:45,820
 - I think you are.

426
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:48,660
 - I mean, I'm keeping it in the garage where it's safe.

427
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,500
 - Oh, that's fine, and I'll hear from you soon.

428
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,340
 - Yes, sir, you will.

429
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:53,700
 I can almost promise.

430
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:54,540
 - Okay.

431
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:57,220
 - Hey, where are we gonna get some money from, sir, in?

432
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:59,860
 - Homer, I'm afraid we're gonna have to do something desperate.

433
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:00,700
 - What?

434
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:03,540
 - Tell Mr. Randall and my father the truth.

435
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:06,100
 - You don't have to go overboard.

436
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,660
 Maybe something will happen.

437
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,020
 - Homer, what could happen?

438
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:15,020
 We might get a job or inherit some money or win a prize on a quiz show.

439
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:21,020
 A quiz show? Where's that newspaper ad my mother gave? Here, home, or look at this.

440
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:24,020
 And we access an ad for that silly quiz show at the employee.

441
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:33,020
 Look at what they're giving away for prizes. Any contestant who correctly answers two out of three questions will receive a prize of $15.

442
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:35,020
 $15?

443
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,020
 So I don't know.

444
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,020
 Homer, it's a...

445
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:40,500
 When you get up on the stage you're allowed to pick any category you like, if it hasn't

446
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,500
 already been taken, right?

447
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:44,100
 So what's the easiest category here?

448
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,100
 Let's see.

449
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,100
 Four.

450
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,100
 That's right.

451
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,100
 What's the hardest one?

452
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,100
 You know what it is.

453
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,100
 Harry ain't in history.

454
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:55,380
 Well, nobody in his right mind would ever pick ancient history, so I'll take that.

455
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:56,380
 And...

456
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:59,380
 Then it's a library studying.

457
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:00,380
 It's ancient history.

458
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,380
 Why not?

459
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,380
 Lots of people are gonna be studying.

460
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:06,380
 - It's a library study. - It's a library study.

461
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:08,380
 Please think you can learn ancient history.

462
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:11,380
 - No, not lots of people learn it. Look at Ms. Agleston.

463
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:15,380
 She didn't learn it, Henry. She was there one and half.

464
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:17,380
 [laughter]

465
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:30,380
 - More calls, sir? - Thank you, Alice.

466
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:32,860
 I know that Henry was at the

467
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:37,500
 six o'clock this morning reading perfectly normal I did it myself when I was

468
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:42,500
 Henry's age I just couldn't get enough of Frank Madewell normally with Henry it's

469
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:47,260
 never because never it's about the same thing they all have their boyhood heroes

470
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:52,940
 and don't you realize Henry's been studying Henry studying Alice I don't

471
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:57,380
 believe it good morning good morning good morning sit down here I'll have

472
00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:00,380
 your breakfast in a moment. I'll thank you mother. I just had a glass of milk and a

473
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:04,340
 couple cookies in the kitchen. Henry, really, you must get to school early this

474
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:09,420
 morning. Homer and I are going to spend a little time in the library. The library?

475
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:14,500
 Yes, Father. If you have no objection. None it's all, Henry.

476
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:20,500
 Yeah, don't work too hard. All right, Father. Alice, now I've seen everything.

477
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:24,460
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

478
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:32,980
 All right, sir.

479
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:35,220
 All right, quiet.

480
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:37,900
 Now, yesterday, we were talking about the athletes

481
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,740
 of ancient Greece.

482
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:43,540
 What were some of the sports in which they excelled?

483
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:48,140
 Well, I see an unfamiliar hand from a brown.

484
00:19:48,140 --> 00:20:00,140
 One of the most popular Greek sports was throwing the discus. The modern record is 181 C, 6, and 3/8 inches, held by a dawpaul consolini of Italy. He established his record.

485
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:02,140
 That's his enough, Pomer.

486
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:06,140
 Let's return to ancient Greece with the rest of the class, shall we?

487
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:08,140
 Yes, Ms. Eggleston.

488
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:17,140
 Now, many of the famous athletes of their day were engaged in the Second Telepenetian War, which took place in more 31 B.C.

489
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:19,540
 And we all rich you will answer on it.

490
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:22,440
 What did you say, Henry?

491
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,440
 431 BC.

492
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,440
 But that's right.

493
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,040
 I know that you're silly, but then

494
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,040
 can we?

495
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:32,540
 Who was the outstanding figure of that war?

496
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:33,540
 Pericles.

497
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:34,540
 What happens?

498
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:39,440
 In the always just tell me one more thing.

499
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,440
 Sure.

500
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:43,440
 When did the second Peloponnesian war end?

501
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,940
 421 BC.

502
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:50,940
 Well, I have been teaching for 23 years,

503
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:55,940
 and in all that time, this is the most wonderful thing that has happened.

504
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:59,940
 If it were in my power, I'd get the entire class of holidays.

505
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:02,940
 Now, Henry, tell me, when did this?

506
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:05,940
 No, no, I better not deserve the miracle.

507
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:06,940
 in there.

508
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:19,300
 Well folks this is very exciting quiz show so far.

509
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:23,420
 The first six contestants were all girls and each of them was able to answer two out of

510
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:27,020
 three questions correctly and win a fifteen dollar prize.

511
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:30,060
 In fact there have been no losers so far.

512
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:33,620
 We have left only two contestants both born.

513
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:36,620
 I'm sure they're not going to let the girls beat them.

514
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:38,620
 Ha ha ha! No, sir, read!

515
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:41,620
 Now, the two categories left are...

516
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:43,620
 Ancient history and sport.

517
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:45,620
 Oh, wait, Homer, it sure worked out on her feet.

518
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:47,620
 What in hell did he say?

519
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:48,620
 Oh, Henry, this is your son.

520
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:49,620
 Sure.

521
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:52,620
 How's the next contestant will be Homer Brown?

522
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:54,620
 He has his choice of two categories.

523
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:55,620
 Sport, San Asian history.

524
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:56,620
 Now, don't forget, Homer.

525
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:58,620
 I'm taking ancient history, dear.

526
00:21:58,620 --> 00:21:59,620
 Homer, do you hear?

527
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:00,620
 Sure, I hear, Henry.

528
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:02,620
 You said all take ancient history.

529
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:05,860
 - I'll take ancient history. - Oh, they're brown picks ancient history.

530
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:11,100
 - Why, do you know why, Homer? - Oh, there must be a wiz in ancient history to pass up for...

531
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:14,100
 - Why, never... - Why, this will probably be duck soup for you.

532
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:16,200
 - Please, I would like it. - Oh, you like it, son.

533
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,860
 - All right, Homer, here's your first one.

534
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:22,500
 Was Julius Caesar a Roman or a Greek?

535
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:27,820
 - He's got to be one of the others. - That's right.

536
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:32,480
 - Did he ever throw the discus? - Well, I'm sure I don't know. He probably did.

537
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,880
 Then he was a Greek.

538
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:37,180
 Oh, I'm sorry, that's wrong.

539
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:39,980
 [HORN HONKING]

540
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:42,580
 No, Julius Caesar was a rogue.

541
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:46,880
 Now, for your next question, who, according to legend,

542
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,140
 fiddled while Rome burned?

543
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:51,180
 He had no much about music.

544
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:54,880
 Hi, if the question in ancient history, Homer,

545
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,880
 he was a Roman.

546
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:58,480
 Roman Julius Caesar?

547
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,580
 Oh, I'm sorry, that's wrong again.

548
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:07,340
 Oh, you missed two out of three and I'm afraid you've lost your chance to win the

549
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:13,260
 fifteen dollar prize. Better luck next time, hold around. And now for our last contestant,

550
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:17,820
 Henry Aldrich, who takes the last category sport. Now here's your first question,

551
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:23,340
 Henry. In the year 1926, there were only two left-handed batters who hit over 350.

552
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:26,980
 One of them threw right hand. Can you tell me the name of the other player?

553
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:29,980
 Would you mind repeating the question?

554
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:35,980
 Not all. In the year 1926, there were only two left-handed batters who hit over 350.

555
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:37,980
 One of them threw right hand.

556
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:40,980
 Can you tell me the name of the other player?

557
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:43,980
 Would you mind repeating the question just one more?

558
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:58,580
 Henry, what's the good of sitting here in the front porch?

559
00:23:58,580 --> 00:23:59,900
 Let's go in the house.

560
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:02,580
 Boy, Homer, did you mess things up?

561
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:04,940
 May, you got me into this, Henry.

562
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:07,260
 I was an unwarying victim.

563
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:09,860
 Besides all the aggravation and loss of sleep,

564
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:12,460
 I've had its already cost me a dollar in cash.

565
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:14,260
 Look, Homer, if you hadn't been so dumb--

566
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:16,060
 Oh, I thought you were, Henry.

567
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:17,460
 I've been looking for you.

568
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:18,460
 I want to talk to you.

569
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:20,180
 You do, Bobby.

570
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:22,380
 Henry, I saw Mr. Randall yesterday.

571
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:25,460
 Father, please remember that there are two sides to every store.

572
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:30,460
 I saw him because Mr. Eggleston called and told me how well you've been doing in ancient history.

573
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:32,460
 Henry, I'm proud of you.

574
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:35,460
 Father, what has ancient history got to do with Mr. Randall?

575
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:41,460
 Well, your mother and I were so pleased that I went to Mr. Randall, and I bought you the scooter you wanted.

576
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:43,460
 Thank you very much, Father.

577
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:47,460
 But, I'm sorry, Henry, to tell you this.

578
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:52,460
 I don't know how it happened, but backing the car into the garage, I ran over the scooter.

579
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:55,460
 I'm afraid I smashed it up quite a bit.

580
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:56,460
 You did?

581
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:57,460
 Yes.

582
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:58,460
 Father!

583
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:02,460
 I mean, but Father really did to tell you...

584
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:04,460
 I don't try to take the blame.

585
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:06,460
 It was entirely my fault.

586
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:08,460
 Well, it's alright, Father.

587
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:11,460
 Fortunately, Mr. Randall carried insurance.

588
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:14,460
 He asked the scooter and is being repaired right now.

589
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:16,460
 Boy, Henry.

590
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:19,460
 And this time, find out where the brake is before you ride it.

591
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:20,460
 Oh, Mary.

592
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:25,460
 And, Henry, I'm glad that from now on you'll be able to ride to the library.

593
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,460
 Library?

594
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:29,460
 Classfather, what would I be doing in a library?

 [MUSIC]

596
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:47,460
 Good evening, Miss Agleston.

597
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:54,460
 Well, sir, what? Can we order it? It's a surprise. Come right here. Oh, no, thank you, Ms. Eggleston.

598
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:59,460
 We just came to extend an invitation to you. An invitation? Well, how nice.

599
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:04,460
 Well, here's the least we can do. After the slow way you call out my family about my schoolwork.

600
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:10,460
 So, Ms. Eggleston, we hereby cordially invite you to be our very first guest.

601
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:15,460
 To take a ride on Henry's new school there. Well, really.

602
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:17,460
 Well, really is right.

603
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:20,460
 But here's really the kind of invitation that folks will snap up.

604
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:24,460
 That's an invitation to dinner with jello for dessert.

605
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:27,460
 Serve your family and friends delicious jello often.

606
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,460
 They're sure to like it.

607
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:31,460
 You have seven flavors to choose from.

608
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:35,460
 Strawberry, raspberry, cherry, orange, lemon, lime, or pineapple.

609
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:39,460
 Each flavor tastes just like the real ripe fruit itself.

610
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:43,460
 For every jello flavor is lost in by a special jello process.

611
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:48,460
 So it's sealed right in so it can't... until you're ready to handle it.
