00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,640
 In just a moment here, the Aldrich family.

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:04,640
 But first, this is Bob McKenzie.

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,540
 You may never have thought about it, but...

4
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:10,380
 NBC spells variety in weekday listening too.

5
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,560
 There's Bob Hope and Dave Garaway,

6
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:15,640
 with two of the most entertaining 15 minutes in radio.

7
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:20,320
 Welcome, travelers. Bring you Tommy Bartlett and interviews with visitors to the Windy City,

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:27,320
 while each weekday evening, John Cameron Swayze, gives you a capsule commentary on the "Sightlights" on the news.

9
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:33,320
 Yes, day in and week out, your best bet in radio is this station.

10
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:37,320
 Now it's the Aldrich family on NBC.

11
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:43,320
 [music]

12
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,320
 Henry! Henry Aldrich!

13
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,320
 Coming, mother!

14
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:51,320
 [applause]

15
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:56,320
 Yes, it's the Aldrich family, as transcribed, written by Clifford Goldsmith.

16
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:06,320
 [Music]

17
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:11,320
 117 Elm Street in Centerville is a house like many other houses,

18
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:16,320
 and it might be a very Solomon State place if there weren't a boy in it.

19
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,320
 And when that boy is a typical teenager like Henry Aldrich,

20
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:23,320
 well, it's a place where unexpected things are always happening.

21
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:27,320
 The scene opens and one of Sunnyville's grocery stores.

22
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,320
 The time is afternoon.

23
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,320
 Hello, hello.

24
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,320
 Hello, Mother. This is Henry.

25
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,320
 Henry, Henry Aldridge, your son.

26
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:38,320
 Oh, is everything all right there? Are you all through with the store?

27
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:43,320
 Practically. I just wanted to tell you, though, they're all out of men's meat, and I've been to two other stores.

28
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,320
 What's that? They don't have any men's meat at all?

29
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,320
 No. Mr. Preston said people shouldn't let their shop and go till the day before Thanksgiving.

30
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,040
 He said that...

31
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,320
 Dear, I don't care what he said, it's going to be a blow to your father.

32
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,440
 But I guess he'll have to be satisfied with pumpkin pie.

33
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,680
 I know, but they don't have any pumpkins either.

34
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,360
 Don't they have any canned pumpkin?

35
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,360
 Oh, canned pumpkin?

36
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,280
 And Henry, have you picked up the turkey?

37
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,520
 No, not yet. I have it over to that side of the store.

38
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:13,360
 Well, there you go over there just as soon as you hang up and tell Mr. McGill you want the turkey I ordered three weeks ago.

39
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,080
 Yes, mother. Only how about Sage?

40
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,120
 What about it?

41
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:17,760
 Hey, Henry.

42
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,560
 What do you want, Homer?

43
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,280
 When you get through with that phone, I want us.

44
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,840
 What's not Henry?

45
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,560
 Mother, I said, what should I do about Sage?

46
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,600
 They're all out of it.

47
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,000
 Henry, they can't be.

48
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,680
 Mr. Preston said it's a cot of the late shopping.

49
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,640
 Well, dear, you ask Mr. Preston whether he can't fix up Mrs. Aldrich

50
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,400
 with just a little Sage for her Thanksgiving dinner.

51
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,840
 I'm sure he has some put away some way.

52
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,680
 Listen, Henry, when can I use that phone?

53
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,800
 You whizzed Homer can't you see?

54
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,040
 I'm talking to my mother.

55
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,040
 What's not Henry?

56
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:43,600
 Nothing, Mother.

57
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,800
 I'm just talking to Homer.

58
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,640
 Henry, you aren't fooling around down there with Homer, are you?

59
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,480
 What's that?

60
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,640
 It sounds to me like you haven't done any of the shopping I sent you to do.

61
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,280
 Well, I'm doing the best I can, Mother.

62
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,160
 She was all I got is two pair of hands.

63
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,840
 Listen, Henry, I've got to use that phone.

64
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,760
 Well, please hurry there and don't waste any time with home.

65
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,640
 But, Mother.

66
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,120
 Goodbye.

67
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,240
 Bye-bye.

68
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,840
 Boy, Henry, it's about time.

69
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,400
 She was home.

70
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,040
 You have to push a guy right out of the booth.

71
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:07,680
 Don't speak to me.

72
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,000
 Don't say a word.

73
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,640
 Trying to remember five different things to tell my mother.

74
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,560
 I got to get some sage.

75
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,520
 Number, please.

76
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,120
 Squash, chestnut, cinnamon.

77
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,120
 Number, please.

78
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,840
 I mean, I operated just make it plain,

79
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,480
 2-3-2 without the cinnamon.

80
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,080
 May I have your number, please?

81
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,080
 I told you, 2-3-2, Elm.

82
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,720
 Elm, 2-3-2.

83
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,840
 Gee whiz, now I've forgotten our whole Thanksgiving dinner.

84
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,920
 Squash, chestnuts, cinnamon.

85
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:33,880
 Oh boy.

86
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,760
 Squash, chestnuts, cinnamon.

87
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,560
 Hello.

88
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,920
 Yeah, listen, mother, what came after cinnamon?

89
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,040
 What's that?

90
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,320
 Who did you want?

91
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,560
 Isn't this my mother?

92
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,080
 Well, yes, her mother, it is.

93
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,680
 And you got everything brought in it.

94
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,880
 Well, the only thing in your list that they've got is bread crumbs and cleaning powder.

95
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,380
 Well, did you get them?

96
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:52,580
 Yes, but it isn't much of a Thanksgiving dinner.

97
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:53,580
 What's that?

98
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,580
 Oh boy, cranberries!

99
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:56,080
 What?

100
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,780
 I just happened to remember cranberries.

101
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,080
 That's what came after cinnamon.

102
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,180
 Well, what about them?

103
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:01,280
 I can't get any.

104
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,280
 Oh, now, home, they must have at least a few cranberries.

105
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,080
 No, they haven't.

106
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,880
 Henry Alders got the last half pound.

107
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,880
 What's that?

108
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,680
 Oh, home, you aren't wasting your afternoon with Henry Alders, are you?

109
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,680
 No.

110
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,180
 Oh, gee whiz, he bought the last cranberries.

111
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:17,180
 Well, dear, I don't see how we can have turkey without cranberries.

112
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:19,880
 Well, you don't have to worry, mother. I've got something even better.

113
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,300
 Oh, that's good. What'd you get?

114
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,300
 Ketchup.

115
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,460
 [laughter]

116
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,300
 Ketchup? To go with turkey?

117
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,780
 Oh, well, I like it on anything.

118
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:27,580
 And so does father.

119
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:28,380
 I know, dear.

120
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:32,540
 And it's red. If you're parred on corn kernels, it looks just like cranberries.

121
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:34,260
 [laughter]

122
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:37,660
 Oh, home, I mean, did you tell Mr. McGill, you want our turkey?

123
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:39,780
 Well, that's another thing. There's only one.

124
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,020
 But one is all we want.

125
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:43,140
 No, I mean, one turkey for everybody.

126
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:45,060
 And Mr. McGill is in shore, but he's pretty sure.

127
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,700
 Mrs. Alderman reserved that.

128
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:50,340
 Now dear, Mrs. Orange didn't reserve that turkey any more than I did.

129
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:53,000
 I asked Mr. McGill to put it aside for me weeks ago.

130
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,800
 You did?

131
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,180
 Yes, now run right over and tell him.

132
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:56,820
 Hey, Homer, I gotta use that phone again.

133
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:57,940
 Just a minute, Henry.

134
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:00,540
 Homer, he's had me all reached there.

135
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:01,580
 Well, yes, mother.

136
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:03,820
 Well, he hasn't got hold of that turkey, has he?

137
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,020
 Just a minute.

138
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,700
 Henry, what's in that big bag there?

139
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:07,340
 Squash.

140
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,700
 Now hurry up, Homer.

141
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:09,620
 Mother, it's all right.

142
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:10,460
 It's Squash.

143
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:12,220
 Oh, Homer, did you get any squash?

144
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:13,660
 That's what I was going to tell you.

145
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:15,220
 They don't have the kind you wanted.

146
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:17,220
 Look, you should like get the kind Henry got?

147
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:22,220
 He had get any kind, just so long as your father has a good squash when he sits down with his ticket.

148
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:25,220
 Okay.

149
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:27,220
 Homer, will you let me have that phone?

150
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,220
 Okay, here.

151
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:29,220
 Well, thanks. Hello?

152
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:30,220
 Hello?

153
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:33,220
 Listen, Homer, why are you handing me your mother? Well, hang her up.

154
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:34,220
 What?

155
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,220
 I mean...

156
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:38,220
 Goodbye, mother.

157
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:41,220
 Boy, will I be glad when Thanksgiving is over.

158
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:45,380
 Will you please get your oranges and flour and stuff out of this booth? I'm getting them out Henry

159
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:48,680
 Listen, where did you get that squad? There aren't anymore? There aren't?

160
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:55,080
 Henry I'm getting sick at you taking the last everything in this place. Oh, you gotta keep your eyes open around here number please

161
00:05:55,080 --> 00:06:00,680
 Elm 303 Elm 303 just a minute there all rich. What's that? Where you got there in your hand?

162
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:05,360
 You can't have pumpkin. It was the last one in the counter. I'll say it was I've been looking all over for this

163
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,760
 That's part of Mrs. Bartlett's order now. Give it to me. Well gee whiz

164
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,200
 Hello mother, what do you think just happened?

165
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,200
 Dear, what is it you want now?

166
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:17,200
 Well, I was going to ask whether one can of pumpkin would be enough.

167
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,200
 Oh, I guess I could make a pie with one can.

168
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,200
 Mother, they just took it away from me.

169
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,200
 What?

170
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,200
 The man said Mrs. Bartlett saw it first.

171
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,200
 Dear, do you realize tomorrow is Thanksgiving?

172
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,200
 It sounds to me as though you aren't even trying.

173
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,200
 Mother, you'll be glad to hear I got a lot of parsley.

174
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,200
 Parsley?

175
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:36,200
 Yeah, it doesn't seem to be much of a demand for that. I took six pounds.

176
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,200
 [audience gasps]

177
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:41,200
 Henry, do you have our turkey?

178
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,700
 Oh yeah, gee whiz.

179
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:43,700
 You say you have it?

180
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,700
 No, I mean I'm glad you reminded me.

181
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:48,200
 Well you hurry right over to Mr. McGill and ask him for it.

182
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,700
 Yes, mother, I'll go right away.

183
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:50,700
 Bye bye.

184
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:53,200
 Hey buddy.

185
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,200
 Yes sir, did you want me?

186
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:58,200
 When you took that can of pumpkin, did you pick up a can of cinnamon too?

187
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,200
 Cinnamon?

188
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,700
 No sir, I haven't even seen any cinnamon.

189
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:04,700
 Well, somebody took the can of cinnamon right out of Mrs. Bartlett's order.

190
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:05,700
 Hey Homer!

191
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:06,700
 What, Henry?

192
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:07,700
 Is Mr. McGill here at the meat counter?

193
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,700
 Yeah, he's in the back room, rapping.

194
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,700
 That is, I mean, he's rapping something up for me.

195
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:12,700
 Okay, I'll wait for him.

196
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,700
 Oh, he may be in there for quite a while, Henry.

197
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,700
 Why waste time?

198
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:19,700
 Why don't you go over to the other side of the store and do some more shopping?

199
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,700
 I finally got all mine done, except for one thing.

200
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,700
 You sure?

201
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,700
 I mean, why don't you go over and get some cinnamon?

202
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,700
 They don't have any.

203
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:28,700
 Well, sure they have, I just got a can.

204
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:31,700
 All I have to buy is something right here for Mr. McGill.

205
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:32,700
 Oh, you do?

206
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:33,700
 Sure.

207
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:36,700
 Hey, Homer, before I forget, have you got your composition written for English?

208
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,840
 for English? We don't have to have a

209
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,480
 gradie until Monday. Well I know but I'm

210
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,600
 going to do mine tonight. Then I'll have

211
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,280
 a free mine for the whole weekend. She

212
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,880
 was what's keeping Mr. McGill? I'm going

213
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,120
 to go back there and look for it. Now

214
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,360
 wait a minute Henry wait before. Well

215
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,000
 the composition is supposed to be about

216
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 what you did on Thanksgiving Day. I know

217
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,600
 well how are you going to write about

218
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,440
 what you did on Thanksgiving Day on the

219
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,520
 day before it? Well I'm going to do

220
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,880
 Homer's eat. I'm going to eat turkey at

221
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,480
 noon and then in the evening I'm going

222
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,640
 to have cold turkey and just before I go

223
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,760
 would have been and would have some more turkey.

224
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,240
 Oh, well, that's nice.

225
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,160
 Sounds like an interesting composition.

226
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,480
 Now then, Homer, here you are.

227
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,160
 A very nice 18 pound--

228
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,000
 Thank you, Mr. McGill.

229
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,880
 Thank you very much.

230
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,040
 It's the last one.

231
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:17,520
 It's so long.

232
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,280
 Homer, you haven't told me what you're going to do

233
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,200
 on Thanksgiving Day.

234
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,840
 Homer?

235
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,400
 She was.

236
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,520
 Is he in a hurry?

237
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,480
 Now then, young man, what can I do for you?

238
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:28,480
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

239
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:36,280
 [Music]

240
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:40,240
 Henry, didn't you explain to Mr. McGill that he promised me a turkey?

241
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,080
 Well, sure, Mother, and he said that he could definitely promise you one.

242
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:43,580
 When?

243
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:44,780
 The day after tomorrow.

244
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:48,680
 Henry, I need a turkey for Thanksgiving, not the day after.

245
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:53,280
 When Homer took that turkey, did you tell him he was really taking our Thanksgiving dinner?

246
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:56,680
 Mother, I didn't have a chance to. He just grabbed it from right under my nose and ran.

247
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:59,940
 And Mr. McGill said Homer told him we didn't want the turkey?

248
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,520
 Well, Mr. McGill said Homer didn't actually say it.

249
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,320
 He just implied that we didn't.

250
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,380
 Very well, Henry, here's what I want you to do.

251
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:10,420
 You're to go over to the Browns and tell Homer's mother exactly what happened.

252
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:11,520
 And demand the turkey?

253
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,260
 You don't have to demand it, dear.

254
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:17,560
 If you just explain things, I'm sure Mrs. Brown will be only too glad to give it to you.

255
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,260
 She will?

256
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:19,760
 Yes, dear. Now start right away.

257
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,260
 Yes, Mother.

258
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,560
 And hurry right back with it.

259
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,360
 Yes, Mother.

260
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,360
 Alice?

261
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,560
 Yes, Sam.

262
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,100
 Where did you just send, Henry?

263
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,100
 Over to the Browns, dear, to get that turkey.

264
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,600
 No, wait a minute, Alice.

265
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,300
 Dear, I'm sorry it isn't theirs, it's ours.

266
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,600
 And we have guests coming.

267
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,200
 But Alice, the Browns are old friends of ours.

268
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,500
 You can't do a thing like that to them.

269
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,300
 Not at Thanksgiving.

270
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:43,400
 And besides, in all fairness, they have an equal right to that turkey.

271
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,100
 Now, the sensible thing to do is...

272
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,100
 Who are you calling?

273
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:46,800
 Number, please.

274
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,900
 Elm 391.

275
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,000
 Elm 391.

276
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,400
 Sam, you aren't inviting anyone else for dinner, are you?

277
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,000
 No, Alice, I'm calling the market.

278
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,320
 Do you believe me? They don't have any more turkeys down there.

279
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,160
 Very well. We'll get something else.

280
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,800
 Oh, he'll mind it. Good afternoon.

281
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,360
 Good afternoon, Mr. Olridge.

282
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,080
 Oh, yes, sir.

283
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,520
 I'd like to play some order with you.

284
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,560
 All right, Mr. Olridge.

285
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,720
 Now then. I'd like a couple of real nice roasters.

286
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,120
 What's that?

287
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,840
 Roasting chickens. Say five or six pounds each.

288
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,880
 But Mr. Olridge, where am I going to get?

289
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,600
 What's that?

290
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,280
 There isn't a chicken left on the plate.

291
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:19,480
 Oh. Well, then you'd better make it a couple of good-sized ducks.

292
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:22,000
 Personally, I like duck just as well as turkey.

293
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,600
 How do you know that?

294
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,400
 No, Doc's.

295
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,000
 Now wait a minute.

296
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,160
 You must have something tomorrow's Thanksgiving.

297
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,320
 I know, Mr. O'errich.

298
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,680
 But it seems like everybody waited till the last minute

299
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,520
 to do their shopping.

300
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:34,600
 My wife and I are having salmon.

301
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,320
 They're having company for dinner.

302
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,200
 I'll tell you what I can do, Mr. O'errich.

303
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:42,640
 How would you like me to cut up a nice oxtail for you?

304
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,000
 Oxtail, what for?

305
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,800
 But Thanksgiving.

306
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,360
 It isn't the same as chicken, but it makes it dandy still

307
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,600
 and very nourishing.

308
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,000
 Yeah, well, just skip the whole thing.

309
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,800
 Now, will that be anything else, Mr. Orange?

310
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,480
 No, thank you. I guess you've got everything.

311
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,480
 Goodbye.

312
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,480
 Come on.

313
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,480
 Alice.

314
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,480
 Which did you get, Sam?

315
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,480
 Chickens or ducks?

316
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,120
 I've been thinking it over, Alice, and it seems to me you have a perfect right to demand

317
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,560
 that turkey from the brown.

318
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:08,320
 And, dear, that's exactly what I told Henry to do.

319
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,320
 Good.

320
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:12,320
 But when Henry comes back with it, the thing to do is to call the browns and insist that

321
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,600
 they come over here and have Thanksgiving with us.

322
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:18,920
 But Sam, that turkey isn't large enough for all of their guests and our guests, too.

323
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:24,520
 Oh, that's too bad. I hate to see the Browns go without the eyelashes.

324
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:28,920
 Of course, if we serve plenty of muffins and yams, we might be able to strike it.

325
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:29,720
 Hello?

326
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,720
 Is this you, Father?

327
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,720
 Yes, Henry, where are you?

328
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,320
 You went downtown.

329
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,920
 Well, hurry on home. Don't dawdle with that turkey.

330
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,920
 Father, I'm dawdling without the turkey.

331
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:37,920
 What?

332
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,120
 They wouldn't give it to me.

333
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,320
 Mr. Browns, did they bought and paid for the turkey, and that's all there was to it.

334
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,720
 Oh, he did.

335
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,920
 Father, isn't there any other place to get a turkey?

336
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,920
 I'm not interested in any other turkey.

337
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:53,080
 We're gonna have that when the Browns have and we're gonna eat it tomorrow alone. They're not invited

338
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:56,240
 No, I'll take care of it

339
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,000
 Never mind that Henry you come right home Henry

340
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:06,880
 Yes, and what's the matter I have tried to be patient I have tried to be considerate now

341
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:12,600
 I am going to do something what here Alice take this phone. I want you to call the Browns and demand our turkey

342
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,600
 [Laughter]

343
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:22,600
 [Music]

344
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,100
 Is that what she said Elizabeth?

345
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,100
 Yes Will.

346
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:29,100
 Well in all the years I've known Alice Aldrich, I've never heard her talk that way to anyone.

347
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:33,100
 Alright, alright. If they want to make an issue of the turkey, it's alright with me.

348
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,100
 Mother I'll be back in a little while.

349
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,100
 Oh my where are you going?

350
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,100
 Just over to Henry's. It isn't so late Mother.

351
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,100
 Oh my let's get this straight.

352
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,900
 You're not to have anything to do with Henry Aldrich.

353
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:43,860
 Not ever?

354
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:45,700
 Not until we've eaten that turkey.

355
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:46,420
 [laughter]

356
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:49,060
 And if he wants to speak to you, that's his loss.

357
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,740
 But look, I've got to write a composition,

358
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,660
 and I need a little advice about Thanksgiving.

359
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:54,180
 Well, you won't get it over there.

360
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:57,620
 I don't think the Aldrich is a celebrating Thanksgiving this year.

361
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:59,700
 Well, Cag, one of you answered that phone.

362
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,380
 Now, Elizabeth, don't touch it.

363
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:05,380
 It's probably Sam Aldrich calling to pick a fight with me about that turkey.

364
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:07,940
 Well, now, will the least you can do is talk to him.

365
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:10,660
 Even if he loses his temper, you don't have to lose yours.

366
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:14,260
 Elizabeth, I'm just going to sit here absolutely calm.

367
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,740
 Father, would you be willing to help me with my composition?

368
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:17,940
 What's your problem?

369
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:22,260
 Well, I have to compare what the pilgrims did on their first Thanksgiving with what I did tomorrow.

370
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:26,100
 Well, for one thing, you can point at what you did tomorrow.

371
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:26,820
 Yes, sir.

372
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,580
 What did you do tomorrow?

373
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:29,860
 What's that?

374
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:32,020
 Homer, what are we talking about?

375
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:36,420
 Well, I think you should at least go to the phone and tell Sadner not going to give him that turkey.

376
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:38,020
 He'll find out soon enough Elizabeth.

377
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:39,220
 He'll find out.

378
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:41,980
 He's found out already.

379
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:44,380
 Well, what's that?

380
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:45,700
 It's the fun door.

381
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:48,340
 And I'm not going to sit here and just hear bells ringing.

382
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,300
 I'll go to the door.

383
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,340
 I'm willing to do that.

384
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,580
 Let me know who it is.

385
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,660
 The same here father.

386
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,980
 Hello there, Will.

387
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:58,740
 Well, well, Sam Olrich.

388
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:01,220
 Aren't you, that is.

389
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:03,420
 Won't you come in?

390
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:04,380
 No thanks, Will.

391
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:05,620
 And Mr. Broad is Homer here.

392
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:09,020
 Now Henry, you stay right here on the steps where you are. Don't bother the brow.

393
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:13,820
 Oh, Henry's no bother. Is there something I can do for you, Sam?

394
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:21,420
 Well, I don't know what this is all about, but I take it that Alice lost her temper when she phoned your wife a few minutes ago.

395
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:25,620
 And just between ourselves, will women have a tendency to exaggerate the importance of things?

396
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:31,920
 You're right, Sam. I tried to reason with Elizabeth. I'm afraid she went a little overboard herself.

397
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:36,920
 When you get right down to it, there isn't any Turkey in the world worth sacrificing our friendship over.

398
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,020
 No, no, of course not.

399
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:41,320
 And Alice will be the first to admit the same thing.

400
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,420
 That's just the way Elizabeth feels.

401
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:48,320
 So, I just wanted to tell you to enjoy the Turkey and have a fine Thanksgiving.

402
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,820
 Now, wait a second, Sam.

403
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:53,220
 The fact is, I was just going to start for your house with that turkey.

404
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:54,320
 No, no, no, no.

405
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,320
 Just forget the whole thing.

406
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,620
 No, Sam, I mean it.

407
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:59,620
 [LAUGHTER]

408
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:02,620
 She was fathers Mr. Brown really gonna give us the turkey?

409
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:05,620
 And if he brings the turkey out here we're not gonna take it.

410
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:06,620
 Why not?

411
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:10,620
 Don't you think I have any pride? I never got down on my knees for a turkey before, isn't it?

412
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:13,620
 Hey, here you are Sam, it's all wrapped in everything.

413
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,620
 No, no, we'll know, no, no, no.

414
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:16,620
 Where are you going with that turkey?

415
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:18,620
 Be quiet, Elizabeth!

416
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:23,620
 Oh no, I wouldn't think of it. You keep it and have a nice dinner tomorrow.

417
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:26,620
 Now Sam, there's no use in your going down those steps without this.

418
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:27,620
 Here Henry, you take it.

419
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:28,620
 Shall I, Father?

420
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,620
 -Oh, no. -Henry, come along.

421
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:31,620
 Sam.

422
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:32,620
 There's no use following us.

423
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:34,620
 Will, get your turkey.

424
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,620
 No, Sam, it's yours.

425
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:40,620
 I'm putting it right here on the front walk.

426
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:44,620
 All right, Will, if you want to leave it there, it's all right with me.

427
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:46,620
 There it is on the sidewalk, Sam.

428
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,620
 I'm going back in the house.

429
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,620
 And Henry and I are going down the street.

430
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:51,620
 Father, hey, Father.

431
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:52,620
 What's the matter?

432
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:53,620
 Look at those three dogs coming.

433
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:54,620
 What's that?

434
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,620
 Hey, get away from there.

435
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:56,960
 - Get away from there, step!

436
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,820
 - She got us looked, and one of them took us.

437
00:15:58,820 --> 00:15:59,660
 - And what, sir?

438
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:00,500
 He took it.

439
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,420
 (whistling)

440
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:02,580
 - They come back here.

441
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:03,940
 (whistling)

442
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:05,700
 - Well, well, that was certainly

443
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:08,060
 a foolish thing for you to do.

444
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:10,140
 - What do you mean for me to do?

445
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:11,300
 What did you leave it there for?

446
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,700
 - I left it, I left it.

447
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,020
 You put it down there yourself.

448
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:15,100
 - Well, why didn't you pink it up?

449
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,540
 - Why should I at your turkey, Will?

450
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:18,420
 If you wanted to go get it, come on, Henry,

451
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:19,620
 we've got other things to do.

452
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:20,740
 - What about you, Wizfather?

453
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:22,100
 - Well, of all of them.

454
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:22,940
 - A boss?

455
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,780
 - What's the matter, Father?

456
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:28,460
 Come on, Homer, we've got to chase a dog.

457
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:29,820
 A dog, Father?

458
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,020
 For Thanksgiving?

459
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:34,020
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

460
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:44,060
 We'll return to the Alders family in just a moment.

461
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:46,260
 Now, I don't know how it's going to turn out,

462
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:49,060
 but it's one sure bet that tonight's Phil Harris Alice

463
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:53,180
 Facio will deliver a full half hours' worth of family comedy.

464
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:56,940
 And right after the Harris-Fay show on most of these NBC stations,

465
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:59,780
 theater guild on the air will bring you Basil Rathbone,

466
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:02,700
 Alan Webb, and Margaret Phillips in the radio version

467
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:05,620
 of the Broadway hit "The Winslow Boy."

468
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:09,060
 And then there's "Adventure" with a pair of NBC programs

469
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:12,140
 as Jack Webb stars in this week's "Dragonette Story"

470
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:14,780
 from the files of the Los Angeles Police Force,

471
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:17,340
 while William Gargon will be on hand in the title role

472
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:20,500
 of Barry Craig, confidential investigator.

473
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,900
 So stay tuned to this NBC station

474
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:25,780
 and listen for the Phil Harris Alice Faye Show,

475
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:27,300
 Theatre Guild on the Air,

 Dragnet, and Barry Craig, confidential investigator.

477
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:33,680
 (upbeat music)

478
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:43,740
 Now getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldrich.

479
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:47,180
 The Browns have somehow got a turkey from the meat market

480
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:49,780
 that had been reserved from Mrs. Aldrich.

481
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:51,740
 And then while Mr. Aldrich and Mr. Brown

482
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:57,220
 each trying to outdo the other with politeness over the bird, a stray dog ran off with it.

483
00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:02,460
 The scene opens in the basement of the Elm Street Church. The time is that same evening.

484
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:07,420
 Step right in, folks. Step right in. The auction's going to begin shortly.

485
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:08,760
 Hello there, Mr. Johnson.

486
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,520
 Oh, hello, Mr. Alridge. Hi, Henry.

487
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,860
 Hello. Has the bidding started yet?

488
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,460
 No, we'll be starting pretty soon.

489
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:14,460
 Pretty nice, Turkey.

490
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:17,140
 Uh, nicest bird you ever saw. 25 pounder.

491
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:17,840
 Come on, Henry.

492
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,440
 Step right in, folks. The auction will begin shortly.

493
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:25,480
 Father I just happen to remember something you know that darn dog that stole our turkey mr. Brown's turkey

494
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,040
 Yes, sir

495
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:31,240
 Well, I think his name is dodo when he belongs to that family that lives down on the corner of Maine and elm where you know

496
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,240
 We're the fences broken down. Oh, yeah

497
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:39,640
 That's the family. Well Brown's always complaining about they get about 15 children. Yeah, and do dogs for every child

498
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:42,840
 I want to get right up here in front

499
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:48,640
 We're auctioning off just one turkey tonight, but it sure is a beauty.

500
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,440
 They say it's a direct descendant of the first turkey the pilgrims ate.

501
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,960
 [LAUGHTER]

502
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,200
 Hello there, Mr. Johnson.

503
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,240
 Oh, hello, Will Brown.

504
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:55,840
 Hi, Homer.

505
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:56,360
 Hi.

506
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,480
 We are late, are we?

507
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,160
 You haven't sold a turkey yet, have you?

508
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,880
 No, sir, but we're going to start right away.

509
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,120
 Come on, Homer.

510
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,640
 Let's get over here to one side.

511
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,960
 Oh, you're my tired.

512
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,080
 Does this tear in my pants show?

513
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,000
 What tear?

514
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,320
 When that dog tripped me.

515
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,040
 [LAUGHTER]

516
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,680
 Well, it doesn't show too much.

517
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,360
 If you don't bend down.

518
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:17,800
 Oh my, why couldn't you have remembered this auction before I tried to climb that fence?

519
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,440
 [bell ringing]

520
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,680
 All right!

521
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,400
 All right friends, here she is.

522
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,400
 It's all for charity and worthy co-op.

523
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,840
 Bit freely and generously.

524
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,880
 You may be sure good use will be made of the money.

525
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,720
 Now, what am I offered for this beautiful turkey?

526
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,880
 $15.

527
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,040
 $15 I'm bid.

528
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,760
 That's an insult to this beautiful bird.

529
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:37,320
 I wouldn't be surprised to see her get up and walk off in a hut.

530
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,560
 [laughter]

531
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,720
 Who made it 18?

532
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,160
 20.

533
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,080
 20 I have.

534
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,000
 Why, the drumsticks are worth that.

535
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:43,960
 [laughter]

536
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:49,120
 Now it's 25. Now it's 25. Now it's 30. Now we're going, I have 30 bit.

537
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,960
 Father, aren't you going to bid? 30 dollars and 50 cents.

538
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:56,560
 I'm sorry Mr. Brown. I'm only taking dollar bids on this. It's all for charity.

539
00:19:56,560 --> 00:20:00,760
 All right then, make it 31. 31 watt father. 31 watts.

540
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,280
 There it is. I'm afraid.

541
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:06,360
 31, 31 it is. Who made it 32? 33. I mean 32.

542
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:09,760
 I heard you the first time lady. 33 you made it and thank you.

543
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:13,460
 35. 35 on bid. 35.

544
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:15,260
 Well Homer, I guess that lets us out.

545
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:17,300
 35 I have from Mr. Oderick.

546
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,140
 Who make it 40?

547
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:19,380
 Homer, did he say Aldrich?

548
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:20,200
 Well, she wins.

549
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,100
 Who make it 40?

550
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:21,980
 45.

551
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:23,660
 45 I'm bit, 45.

552
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:24,860
 That'll show Sam already.

553
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:26,060
 55, it's 50.

554
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:27,060
 55.

555
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,380
 She wins, father.

556
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:29,460
 Keep quiet, Homer.

557
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:31,060
 55 I'm bit, 55.

558
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:31,960
 Who make it 60?

559
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:32,960
 60.

560
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,700
 Oh, thank you, Mr. Brown.

561
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:35,860
 You raised your own bit.

562
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:36,700
 Thank you.

563
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:37,700
 (audience laughing)

564
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:38,780
 I'm bit.

565
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:40,140
 65, 65.

566
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:40,980
 65.

567
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:41,820
 65.

568
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:42,660
 70.

569
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:44,660
 70 I have.

570
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:45,900
 70 for charity.

571
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,220
 70 once.

572
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:48,140
 70 twice.

573
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,780
 Father, suppose mother years about this.

574
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:51,460
 70 twice to a him or?

575
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:52,420
 What did he say, Homer?

576
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:53,740
 I don't want to make another mistake.

577
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:54,580
 You are him or?

578
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:55,420
 Father, I'd like to tell you.

579
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,820
 Now listen, Homer, for the last time, be quiet.

580
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:01,100
 Sold for $70 to Samuel Loner.

581
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:03,020
 [APPLAUSE]

582
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:04,500
 To who?

583
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,940
 That's a fine thing.

584
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,500
 And Homer, it's all your fault.

585
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,340
 Mine.

586
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:09,460
 How are you, Will?

587
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:10,620
 How are you, Sam?

588
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:13,420
 Mr. Allrich, if you'll step up here and pay your $70.

589
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:14,940
 All right, I'll be happy to.

590
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,340
 Bye, Homer. Bye, Henry.

591
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:21,500
 Mr. Allrich, I want you to know this turkey is going to be wrapped and sent to one of the most deserving families in town.

592
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,100
 What's that?

593
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:25,540
 And presented, of course, with the compliments of the whole Allrich family.

594
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:26,540
 [LAUGHTER]

595
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:28,540
 Oh, boy!

596
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:38,800
 Here, Dodo.

597
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,420
 Come here, Dodo.

598
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:42,660
 Nice, doggy, Dodo.

599
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:44,860
 - Morning, give you the turkey, Papa.

600
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:46,780
 Dodo, give Papa the turkey.

601
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:49,220
 - Junior, keep away, do you wanna frighten him?

602
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,660
 Here, Dodo.

603
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:52,860
 Give me that turkey.

604
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:55,240
 That's a nasty turkey, Dodo.

605
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,460
 You won't like it.

606
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:58,100
 - Papa, where do you suppose you got it?

607
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:00,500
 - Natalie, will you stand back and all the rest of you,

608
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,340
 keep back.

609
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:02,940
 - All right, stand back, everybody,

610
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,380
 and let Papa get the turkey.

611
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:08,220
 Now Dodo, for the last time, I want that turkey.

612
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:10,820
 We need that turkey cap.

613
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,720
 I'm gonna take dinner in this house in years.

614
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,180
 Daddy, go out of the country!

615
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:15,020
 Where's the girl?

616
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:15,860
 I'm sorry.

617
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:16,780
 Look at it, look at it.

618
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:19,860
 Where do you suppose Dodo found that turkey poppa?

619
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:23,620
 Well, I don't believe in looking a gift dog in the mouth.

620
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:26,460
 Besides, Dodo knows a lot of people in this town.

621
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:27,940
 (knocking)

622
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:28,940
 Is that the front door?

623
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:29,940
 Yes, Papa.

624
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:31,220
 It is?

625
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:33,020
 Now look, Junior, take this turkey

626
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,740
 and go into the kitchen with him.

627
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:37,040
 - All right, it's our turkey now.

628
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,040
 (knocking)

629
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,100
 - Good evening, Mr. Foley.

630
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,540
 I've got a surprise for you.

631
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:43,260
 - What's that, Mr. Jassen?

632
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:44,500
 - Here you are.

633
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,060
 It's partly from the Elm Street Church

634
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:48,180
 and partly from Sam Olridge.

635
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:49,500
 - Oh, what's this, a turkey?

636
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:52,060
 - A 25-pounder and all the trimmings to go with it.

637
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:53,140
 - Oh, Papa!

638
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,740
 - She was another church!

639
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:55,580
 - Thanks, give it up!

640
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:58,580
 - I'm going to die, I'm scared and happy day to do the help!

641
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:01,160
 (upbeat music)

642
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,740
 (bell ringing)

643
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:09,480
 - Just a minute, Alice, and I'll turn the light out.

644
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,680
 - Don't forget to open the window

645
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,640
 before you get it to bed.

646
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,480
 - Mother.

647
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,400
 - Yes, Henry, come in.

648
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,400
 - Mother, I hate to bother you,

649
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,600
 but could you look over this composition for spelling?

650
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,120
 - Not tonight, dear, but leave it here.

651
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,440
 I'll go over it in the morning.

652
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,560
 - All right, and thanks.

653
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,400
 - Good night, Henry.

654
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,700
 - Good night, dear.

655
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:27,520
 - And now, Alice, I've been thinking it over.

656
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,560
 - You've been thinking what, over, Sam?

657
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:32,760
 I don't see any reason why we should ask the Browns over for dinner tomorrow.

658
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,880
 To be quite frank, dear, I agree with you.

659
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,760
 I'll admit we've been good friends, but after the way we'll act today...

660
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:41,360
 And I didn't like Elizabeth's attitude.

661
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,600
 So we might just as well...

662
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:45,240
 Dear, how do you spell Pocahontas?

663
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,160
 What's that?

664
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,200
 I guess Henry spelled it right.

665
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:52,040
 Anyway, I don't see any point in having guests here for the dinner of cranberries and chestnuts.

666
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:55,160
 But dear, I told you we're also having corned beef hash.

667
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,000
 Hash?

668
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,760
 Of course, I know it isn't turkey, but...

669
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:01,260
 Sam, how do you spell Pocahontas?

670
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:02,260
 Pocahontas?

671
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:04,760
 There's no K in it, is there?

672
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:05,760
 [LAUGHTER]

673
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,760
 There may be in the original Indian spelling.

674
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,760
 Sam, listen to this.

675
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:11,760
 Listen to what?

676
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:15,260
 What I did on Thanksgiving by Henry W. Aldrich.

677
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:16,760
 Thanksgivings tomorrow.

678
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,760
 Yes, dear, but stop interrupting.

679
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:24,760
 This year, the same as last year, we did the same old stuff that we did every other year.

680
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:27,760
 To begin with, our dinner consisted of turkey.

681
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,760
 Only he scratched that out and wrote chicken.

682
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,760
 Yeah?

683
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,760
 Where does he think he's going to eat chicken?

684
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,760
 Then he scratched that out and just left it blank.

685
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:35,760
 Oh.

686
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:41,560
 After we finished this hearty meal, we felt very stuffed and all sat around and talked

687
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:46,760
 about the price of things and the weather and business and stuff like that.

688
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:49,760
 Back in the old days, however, it was much more interesting.

689
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:54,760
 Then there wasn't much food for anybody and the pilgrims had to shoot turkeys just like

690
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,760
 Indians.

691
00:24:55,760 --> 00:25:01,080
 Pocahontas was one Indian, for example, but she was a good Indian.

692
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:07,800
 Mints meat, in those days, they didn't have at that time, nor things like sage, because

693
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:10,760
 no more ships came in that year.

694
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:15,960
 When you once got some food, you had to hang on to it for dear life, because almost anybody

695
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,520
 might steal it.

696
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,560
 Usually a wolf.

697
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:23,880
 There were no stores to buy things, so if a wolf took your turkey and stuff, you were

698
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,040
 out of love.

699
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:27,440
 Let me see that out.

700
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:34,200
 But it was because of all this that the Pilgrim Fathers, from whom we are all sprung, celebrated

701
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:40,720
 their first Thanksgiving and bowed their heads when they sat down over what was in many cases

702
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:47,120
 just plain cornmeal mush, which is something that even my mother has never gotten me to

703
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:52,400
 like as much as I admire the Pilgrims for the other things they did.

704
00:25:52,400 --> 00:26:00,640
 Even cornmeal mush is all right, I guess, as long as they had neighbors to share it.

705
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:06,560
 Because, as my father says, when it comes to Thanksgiving, it's the spirit and not the

706
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,800
 stuffing that counts.

707
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:15,160
 Your father, Homer's on the phone.

708
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:18,080
 His folks say if we could bring over a few eggs, they have some cornmeal to make cornmeal

709
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,080
 muffins.

710
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,800
 And won't we come over for dinner tomorrow?

711
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:25,800
 "What do you mean won't we come over? You tell them to pack up their cornmeal and come over here!"

712
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,800
 "I can ask them?"

713
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:31,800
 "Yes dear, and tell Mrs. Brown if she has any cinnamon to please bring it. I'm going to make apple sauce."

714
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:46,800
 Fight communism by joining the Crusade for Freedom,

715
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:52,040
 freedom, the independent movement of the American people which supports Radio Free Europe and

716
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:57,700
 Radio Free Asia. These two networks are shattering the isolation which the Kremlin has imposed

717
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:03,220
 on its slave states. As a private enterprise they can hit hard and expose the falseness

718
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:07,980
 of the communist line. They can spike the hate and lie campaign of the Soviets against

719
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:15,220
 the free world. So help build more transmitters for Radio Free Europe and Radio Free Asia.

720
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:20,220
 your contribution to "Crucade for Freedom" care of your local postmaster.

721
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:41,220
 Mother, at what time are we having dinner?

722
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:43,220
 Not for another hour, Sylvia.

723
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:46,140
 Look, Mr. Foley's dog, Dodo is out in the front yard.

724
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:46,980
 Yes, Henry.

725
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:49,020
 And Homer and I are going to take him and do a little hunting.

726
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:50,140
 Hunting, do you?

727
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:52,860
 Just around the neighborhood and see what we can dig up.

728
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:55,360

735
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:36,300
 Listen again next week, same time, same station,

736
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:40,140
 for another sparkling half hour with the Aldridge family.

737
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:41,140
 Good night, everybody.

738
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:43,140
