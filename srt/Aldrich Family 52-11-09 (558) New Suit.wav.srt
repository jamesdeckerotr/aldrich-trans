 Henry Henry-O-Rich!

00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 Coming Mother!

00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 As every grown-up knows, a typical teenage boy never has to go looking for interesting problems to solve.

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 The problems come looking for the boy, and you can be sure that a new and startling one pops up every day, especially for Henry Aldridge.

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 The scene opens in the Aldridge living room. The time is evening.

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 Mother, could you look at it this way?

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 I'm sorry, Henry, but I don't want to discuss it anymore.

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 Mother, don't misunderstand me. I'm not trying to discuss it.

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 I just want to ask you.

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 Henry, Mrs. Brown came over here to visit with me, not to listen to us argue about whether you should have a new suit.

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 Oh, excuse me, Mrs. Brown.

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 That's all right, Henry. It's nice to see you take an interest in clothes.

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 Sure. Mother, have you thought of it this way?

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,340
 You've gotta buy me a new suit sometime.

18
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:27,880
 Why not get one tomorrow and let me get a little wear out of it?

19
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,620
 Henry, I think it's time for you to go to bed.

20
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:32,200
 Without a... without a...

21
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,300
 Henry?

22
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:34,800
 Yes, mother. Good night.

23
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:35,600
 Good night, dear.

24
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,380
 Good night, Mrs. Brown.

25
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:37,440
 Good night, Henry.

26
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,100
 I hope you'll pardon the way my bathrobe hangs in the back.

27
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,100
 Yes, dear.

28
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:45,500
 Well, Alice, I didn't want to say anything about it while Henry was here.

29
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,100
 But would you mind if I suggest something?

30
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,100
 No, not at all.

31
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:53,260
 But it's only because I know you don't want to buy anything that isn't absolutely necessary,

32
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:56,760
 but Homer has a new suit I think would fit Henry.

33
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,260
 Really?

34
00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:00,260
 He put it on just once, and Alice, believe it or not,

35
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:02,340
 it's been hanging in the closet ever since.

36
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:03,700
 My goodness, Elizabeth!

37
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,580
 And it's a good shoe-dalless!

38
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:07,540
 Homer's uncle said it to him all the other day.

39
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:08,420
 You don't say!

40
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,820
 Yes, and he's an awfully good dresser.

41
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:13,540
 He sells things all over the country.

42
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:18,060
 And the shoe-dalless, well, when you first see it, you might say,

43
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,100
 Well, yes.

44
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:22,560
 But when you stand off at a distance, dear, the chicks,

45
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,960
 they're brown with a sort of orange stripe in the background.

46
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,800
 Well, the chicks all seem to blend right in.

47
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,560
 And Homer refused to wear it?

48
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,960
 Yes, but he doesn't care a thing about clothes.

49
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,760
 You know how Homer is.

50
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:37,160
 Oh, sometimes I think he doesn't care about anything.

51
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,660
 No, I wouldn't say that.

52
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:40,860
 Oh, Alice, you just don't know.

53
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:46,260
 Well, I said to him, I said, "Homer, that suit will make people stop and look at you."

54
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:49,600
 And Alice, he acted just the way he does about broccoli and salad.

55
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,260
 Mother!

56
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:52,340
 Yes, Henry!

57
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:56,460
 Did you know that the government expects a wool shortage before spring?

58
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:59,160
 There I want you to get right into bed.

59
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,160
 Yes, Mother.

60
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,060
 Only don't you think we should take advice from our own government?

61
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,160
 Good night there!

62
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:08,060
 Elizabeth, are you positive you wouldn't mind Henry having that suit?

63
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:10,660
 Alice, I think it will teach Homer a lesson.

64
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:14,960
 And if you aren't doing anything, now, why don't we walk over to my house and get the suit?

65
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,960
 That's a wonderful idea.

66
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:21,100
 I'll put it on the chair beside Henry's bed in the morning and surprise him.

67
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:33,340
 Good breakfast, Alice. Good breakfast.

68
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:35,940

69
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,780
 Sorry, goodbye. Goodbye, dear.

70
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,980
 Tell Henry I'm sorry I didn't see him before he came down.

71
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:40,860
 I will.

72
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:41,980

73
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,020
 Yes, Mary.

00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:43,660
 Hey, Henry.

75
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:46,820
 He'll be down in just a few minutes, dear. He's in the bathroom washing.

76
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:47,320
 Oh.

77
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:53,000
 And Mary, while he's in there, I want you to take this up to his room so he doesn't see you and lay it on his chair.

78
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,720
 This mother?

79
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,740
 Yes, Mary. I just finished pressing it.

80
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:58,640
 Oh. What are you going to do? Cover his chair with it?

81
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,640
 What do you mean, cover his chair?

82
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:04,560
 Well, it isn't as a slip cover or something.

83
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,440
 Now, Mary, that's a perfectly good suit.

84
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:10,320
 Mother, you mean, Henry has to wear that?

85
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,740
 Where did you share that?

86
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:17,340
 Dear Mrs. Brown gave it to Henry, and the only reason you don't care for it is because it's folded,

87
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,840
 and you're standing too close to it.

88
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,540
 But, Mother, you can see these checks a block away!

89
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:25,640
 Now, dear, please take it upstairs.

90
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:29,640
 Yes, Mother. I just hope Henry doesn't find out that I had anything to do with it.

91
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,740
 And now, Mary?

92
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:33,040
 Fine, Mrs. Aldridge, is Henry ready for school?

93
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,340
 But, good morning, Homer. Aren't you just a bit early?

94
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:39,540
 Boy, I'll say. I wanted to get out of the house before...

95
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:42,980
 I was afraid my mother might make me wear a good morning.

96
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:47,780
 Well, Homer, I'm afraid it's going to be sometime before Henry gets down and,

97
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:49,880
 dear, you don't want to be late, do you?

98
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,940
 Well, I don't mind waiting.

99
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:51,580
 Oh.

100
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:52,940

00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:54,140
 No, Homer.

00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,480
 Hey, yes, Henry!

105
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,180
 What's this thing up here?

106
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:02,180

107

 Why, Henry, that's for you.

109
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:07,500
 For me?

110
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,660
 This?

111
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:11,060
 Yes, you asked for one, didn't you?

112
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,860
 I... I asked for a rug.

 [audience laughter]

114
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:19,660
 Henry, if you'll unfold it, you'll see it is not a rug.

00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:21,360
 But what is it, Mrs. Aldrich?

116
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,660
 Well, Gee, when?

117
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,160
 Just put it on there.

118
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,260
 What's she got, Mrs. Aldrich? What's she got?

119
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:27,460
 What's bad, Homer?

120
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,660
 Mother, I don't mean to criticize, but...

121
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,660
 Where did you get this?

122
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:34,060
 Well, what is it, Mrs. Aldrich? What is it?

123
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:36,860
 Oh, my... I'm sorry to be inhospitable, but...

124
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:39,860
 Henry may have a lot on his mind when he comes down.

125
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:42,860
 I mean, Homer, you better be going now.

00:05:58,860 --> 00:05:59,860
 I've got time, mother.

134
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,860
 I just had a phone and asked you something.

 Well...

 It's about this darn suit I'm wearing.

140
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:15,860
 Now Henry, I don't want to hear you speak that way about that suit again.

 Well, I didn't mean to be disrespectful about it.

 You think this is...

144
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:23,860
 This is really a school suit?

145
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:26,860
 Henry, if you didn't wear it to school, where would you wear it?

146
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,860
 Well, that's true.

147
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,860
 Now, dear, just think back a minute.

148
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:34,860
 Remember how we both agreed it made you look much bigger and older?

00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:48,940
 (audience laughing)

176
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:52,300
 - Now listen Lucy, this dude happens to be all wool.

177
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,580
 - I'll say, and a yard wide.

178
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:56,740
 - Hey, Lucy.

179
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:58,540
 - Homer, Homer look.

180
00:07:58,540 --> 00:07:59,620
 - What?

181
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:00,880
 Oh gee whiz.

182
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,080
 Henry is that...

183
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,640
 Is that...

184
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,380
 Now listen, Henry, let me see that.

185
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:06,780
 What's the matter, Homer?

186
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:07,880
 Well, I'll be done.

187
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,720
 What?

188
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,780
 Sure.

189
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,860
 That's what I thought the minute I sawed.

190
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,380
 That's my uncle, Oscars.

191
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,080
 What, Homer?

192
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:14,980
 Well sure it is.

193
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:17,220
 I could tell that suit a mile away.

194
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:18,820
 You're a crazy Homer.

195
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:20,260
 My mother bought this suit for me.

196
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,580
 Well, you're crazy yourself.

197
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:22,540
 Here he is, Charlie.

198
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:24,180
 Take a look at that suit.

199
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:24,860
 Yeah!

200
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:26,180
 Well, my doctor, glasses.

201
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:28,180
 The golden patch, all one piece.

202
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,060
 Listen, fellas.

203
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:31,060
 I want you to meet my uncle Oscar.

204
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,060
 Hi, Oscar.

205
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:33,060
 Hi, hi.

206
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:35,060
 Oh, Oliver, you're killing me.

207
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:38,060
 Homer, I'm warning you. I'm warning you. I've got just so much patience.

208
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:41,060
 I suppose you think I'm making it up about my uncle Oscar.

209
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:42,060
 Sure you are.

210
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:45,060
 All right, Henry, I'll prove it to you. Let me see the label.

211
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,060
 Now, wait, Homer, keep your hands off me.

212
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:49,060
 Go ahead, Homer. You want me to hold them for you?

213
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:52,060
 Sure. Now, Homer, I warn you, keep your hands off this.

214
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:54,060
 Henry, that you...

215
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,060
 Hello, Eleanor.

216
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:57,060
 Well, aren't you going to be late to history?

217
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:59,060
 What are you getting right about Oscar?

218
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:02,060
 For the last time fellas, let's cut this out and just...

219
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:04,060
 Just all go to history.

220
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:06,060
 You got me checkers with you fellas?

221
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:08,060
 Light on, Oscar, quick and flaky.

222
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:10,060
 [laughter]

223
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:11,060
 Okay, that's so, Willie.

224
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:14,060
 Well, I'll have you understand the suit never belonged to Homer's uncle.

225
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:16,060
 What does it say on the label, Homer?

226
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:17,060
 Here, I'll show you.

227
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:19,060
 Stand back, Homer, stand back.

228
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:21,060
 Why should I sure go ahead, Homer?

229
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:24,060
 That's your uncle's suit, and you can do anything you want.

230
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,060
 Sure, I can't.

231
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:27,060
 sure I can sure I can.

232
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,060
 The last time Homer remember what I said.

233
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:31,060
 Go ahead Oscar Sock, I'm sure I will.

234
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:33,060
 And stop calling me Oscar.

235
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:35,060
 Let me fight Gregory school.

236
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:38,060
 I'm not fighting Eleanor, I'm just protecting myself.

237
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:40,060
 Go ahead Homer, pile into him.

238
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:42,060
 I suppose you think I'm afraid to take another step.

239
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,060
 Well why not, Jenna?

240
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:45,060
 Now listen, Willie, quit pushing me.

241
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:46,060
 He took another step, Henry.

242
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,060
 He took another step.

243
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:49,060
 Well that one doesn't count.

244
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:52,060
 But Homer, if you take another, boy will you?

245
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,060
 Will you?

246
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:53,900
 Will you?

247
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:56,160
 Stand back fellas, stand back and give them room.

248
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,340
 Boys, I think you're both just dawgles.

249
00:09:58,340 --> 00:09:59,600
 Are you really gonna fight?

250
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,640
 Lucy, I hope you don't think...

251
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,100
 I hope you don't...

252
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,500
 Does anybody got the time?

253
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,140
 Yes, it's time for history.

254
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:07,440
 It is?

255
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,240
 Well, listen Homer, it's a very good thing for you it is.

256
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,620
 And it's a very good thing for you, Joe Henry.

257
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:13,880
 You mean you're gonna quit?

258
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,320
 Hey, Tobby, let's get the two of them together at three o'clock.

259
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,120
 Hey, that's an idea right after the last period.

260
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,260
 Today?

261
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:22,020
 I mean, I gotta fight Homer at three o'clock?

262
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:24,020
 That's right, what's for?

263
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:26,020
 I mean, I've got to fight Henry.

264
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,020
 Sure!

265
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:29,020
 Well, that's fine.

266
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:31,020
 Sure, that's fine.

267
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:33,020
 (SIREN WAILING)

268
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:45,020
 Elizabeth?

269
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,020
 Yes, Will.

270
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,020
 Was that Homer on the phone?

271
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,020
 Yes, dear.

272
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:51,020
 He wanted me to get him out of school early this afternoon.

273
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:53,320
 What for? I hope you didn't tell him you would.

274
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,320
 Oh no, well of course I didn't.

275
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:59,020
 But he literally begged me to make an appointment for him after dentist.

276
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:00,020
 Oh, Mergent?

277
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:02,420
 Before the last period this afternoon.

278
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:05,220
 That's the problem with you, Elizabeth. You're just spoiling him.

279
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,820
 Let him have you go and wait about everything.

280
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:09,820
 Well, I told him definitely he could not leave early.

281
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:12,020
 Even if he does need some dental work done.

282
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:14,220
 Oh good. And what's more, Elizabeth?

283
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:18,220
 I think it's time we put our foot down and made him wear that suit that Oscar sent him.

284
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:20,520
 Yes, dear, I agree with you.

285
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:24,520
 Only first, I think maybe I ought to tell you something.

286
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,520
 Well?

287
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:28,520
 Now, don't fly off the handle, Will, and don't hit the ceiling.

288
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,520
 Only, uh...

289
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,520
 Only what?

290
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:33,520
 I gave it to Henry Orridge.

291
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,520
 You did?

292
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,520
 Now, you're brown.

293
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:38,520
 Homer is your son, and he has your stubbornness,

294
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:41,520
 and I just couldn't go through life fighting both of you over one too.

295
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:45,520
 I know, Elizabeth, but suppose Oscar arrives and wants to see how it looks on Homer.

296
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:49,520
 But, dear, we can't go over and ask Henry to return, as you can, will you?

297
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:55,520
 Why not? Which is more important, Henry or my brother Oscar, who makes $11,000 a year.

298
00:11:55,520 --> 00:12:11,520
 Look, Lucy. Look at what somebody put up on the bulletin board.

299
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,520
 Where, Eleanor? Right in front of you.

300
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:19,240
 That big poster today at three o'clock the fight of the century. Oh my goodness

301
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:22,280
 Homer Brown versus off to the flash

302
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:28,480
 Come on Lucy. We'll be late for English. All right. Where's the fight gonna be Eleanor? I don't know I

303
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:33,720
 Certainly hope you aren't going well. I just hate right, but I haven't anything else to do

304
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:37,880
 Hi Lucy. Have you seen Homer anyplace? No, I haven't told you know what I told him I do for him

305
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,880
 What Toby be a second this afternoon

306
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:43,640
 His wife? His second, his second. And Willie's gonna be Henry's second.

307
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:47,320
 You mean when Henry and Homer get tired of fighting you and Willie are gonna fight?

308
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:51,320
 No, we tell them what to do and then we get him water to drink.

309
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,320
 My goodness, they're even gonna drink water?

310
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:59,960
 Hey Toby, hi Charlie. The football team's getting up a petition for the coach to cancel practice this afternoon so they can all go see the fight.

311
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:03,000
 Oh, goodness, you think I'll be making a mistake if I didn't see it?

312
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,440
 No, see, it's a grudge fight. Why, it's been building up for three years.

313
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,280
 Oh, let's go into English.

314
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:13,660
 Quietly! Quiet! That's good gummy water.

315
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:14,920
 Hello, Henry.

316
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:15,920
 Hi, Eleanor.

317
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,120
 Hey, what are you fitting way back here?

318
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:21,560
 Oh, I just decided to change my seat.

319
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,720
 Quietly!

320
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,840
 Now, please turn to page 103.

321
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:32,640
 By the way, Henry Aldrich, may I ask why you're sitting way back there in the last row?

322
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,040
 Why, uh...

323
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,320
 Why just...

324
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,000
 Howton to sit down here?

325
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 Could you mind standing up when you speak please?

326
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 No, Ms. Eggleston.

327
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 Oh, my goodness.

328
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 Quietly, quiet.

329
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 I don't see anything funny to laugh at.

330
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 And Henry, as long as you do not like your regular seat,

331
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 suppose you come right down here and take the seat in the front row by me.

332
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 No?

333
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 Yes, please.

334
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 Quiet, quiet.

335
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,380
 It seems to me, Henry, you should have plenty to do without deliberately upsetting this entire class.

336
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:13,580
 Yes, Ms. Eigleston. You want me to sit here?

337
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:16,120
 Well, as long as you're standing, I'll call on you first.

338
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,080
 To read?

339
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:21,460
 Please start for the first paragraph at the top of page 103.

340
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,860
 Yes, Ms. Eigleston.

341
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:24,360
 [clears throat]

342
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:27,960
 During the mold decade at the end of the 19th century,

343
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:33,700
 there passed across the English literary scene a figure whose prominence derived not only from his writing,

344
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:42,500
 But from his elaborate taste and clothes, this man was Oscar Oscar Oscar the flash.

345
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:46,500
 She wins Oscar Wilde.

346
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:59,620
 Alice Alice I want you to come into the living room and meet a business friend of mine.

347
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:01,620
 - Then you mean you brought him home for lunch?

348
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,420
 - How does he doesn't expect much?

349
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:04,700
 Just have something real nice.

350
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,540
 - That's all he got.

351
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:06,540
 - But say it, mother!

352
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,620
 - Yes, Mary, I'm in the dining room.

353
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:10,260
 - Mother, I was just downtown,

354
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:12,020
 and what do you think somebody told me?

355
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:14,700
 - I've got to go back to the kitchen and take off this apron.

356
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:17,180
 - Father, would you like to hear what I heard about Homer Brown?

357
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:18,700
 - Mary, there's a gentleman in the living room

358
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:21,380
 who comes to town, a rather important...

359
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:24,140
 Mary, even where that dress for lunch?

360
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:26,100
 - Why, I plan to, Father.

361
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,220
 - Yeah?

362
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:29,520
 I suppose you run upstairs and see whether you can't, uh...

363
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,720
 what do you can't do?

364
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,820
 You mean you want me to put on something a little nicer?

365
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:33,520
 Yes, ma'am.

366
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,420
 Mother!

367
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:35,520
 Henry, come here, please.

368
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,320
 I'll ask Mother what I should put on.

369
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,220
 Henry, where are you?

370
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,420
 Right here in the hall.

371
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:40,620
 Is there something you want?

372
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,520
 Yeah, I want you to come in and meet...

373
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,520
 Henry.

374
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:46,220
 You know what, Father?

375
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:48,620
 I can't help it. Mother made me wear it.

376
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,020
 That thing? Where did she...

377
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:52,020
 That's what I'd like to know.

378
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:53,820
 Turn around.

379
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,720
 Father, who is it you want me to meet?

380
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,720
 No one.

381
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,120
 (audience laughing)

382
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,520
 Hey, Mary.

383
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,680
 - Mary, what are you doing home for lunch?

384
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,120
 - Well, Mother, I just thought I'd rather eat here.

385
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,080
 - Here, dear.

386
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:08,000
 Isn't this hot dog day in the school cafeteria?

387
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,840
 - Well, yes, Mother, and I like hot dogs,

388
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,400
 but frankly, I don't enjoy eating them in a place

389
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,720
 where everyone's there and sees...

390
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,560
 and sees...

391
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,160
 - Oh, my goodness.

392
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,440
 - Now listen, Mary.

393
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,880
 - I'm Henry.

394
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,400
 - Mary, I thought you were going upstairs

395
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,240
 and change your dress.

396
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,240
 - I am, only you mean I have to change

397
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,240
 and you're going to let Henry--

398
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,080
 - No, Mary.

399
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:30,840
 Yes mother only first is I tell you what I heard about Homer what about him he's

400
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:35,480

401
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:41,800
 would Oscar somebody who could that be with Oscar

402
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:46,680
 the whole time talking about it Henry I think if Homer's going to turn out to

403
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:51,160
 be that kind of a boy the less you have to do within the better they're sure

404
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:54,640
 mother I don't like any of that crowded school that's why I thought I come home

405
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:58,840
 for lunch and they're not going to eat here with us are you well guess father

406

 But you really think it's worth fighting over I'm simply telling you it's handsome. Now go ahead and wear it

413
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,600
 Well, Mr.. Alberts is this your family here in the hall? Yes, Mr.. Thomas. This is Mrs.

414
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:43,960
 All Richard here. This is mr.. Tom. How do you do and I'm sorry, but my daughter Mary's just stepped out

415
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:47,980
 Was that Henry I see right behind you? Yes, this is Henry

416
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:53,240
 He just came home to put on a costume for a school play.

417
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:56,440
 Now he's got the rush right back.

418
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,440
 What's up, Otter?

419
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,240
 Goodbye, Henry. Goodbye. Good luck.

420
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:16,040
 The Aldrich family has been family listening for a long time.

421
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:20,040
 But here at NBC we have a number of families who bring you top comedy.

422
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:23,040

 and of course a half hour of real entertainment.

00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:33,040
 Great stars of the screen will be featured next on NBC,

426
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:37,040
 when theater guild on the air presents Rosalind Russell and Mel Ferrer,

 So stay tuned to NBC for your top radio shows.

433
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:12,040
 Now getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldrich.

434
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:16,760
 Because Henry has had to wear a suit that formally belonged to Homer Brown's on Colosca,

435
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:20,040
 he suffered more than his share from the gang of school.

436
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:26,040
 As a result, the students have scheduled an open fight at three o'clock this afternoon between Henry and Homer.

437
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,140
 The scene opens in the principal's office.

438
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:30,240
 Come in.

439
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,040
 Did you want to see me here in your office, Mr. Bradley?

440
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,340
 Yes, Ms. Eggleston.

441
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,040
 Sit down.

442
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,840
 I hope I didn't call you from any class.

443
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:40,940
 No, Mr. Bradley.

444
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:45,540
 Miss Eggleston, I happened to pass by your English past this morning,

445
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:49,540
 and frankly, it seemed to me I heard more disturbance than was really necessary.

446
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:51,040
 Mr. Bradley, may I say something?

447
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:54,040
 Yes, Miss Eggleston, just as soon as I am finished.

448
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:57,540
 A reasonable amount of laughter is quite an order in any class,

449
00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:01,540
 but when the students' sound as though they were rolling on the floor,

450
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:04,540
 I can only conclude that the teacher has lost all control.

451
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:06,540
 Now, may I say something, Mr. Bradley?

452
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:09,540
 Yes, Miss Eggleston, as soon as I have finished.

453
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:16,540
 As I passed by your partly open door, it seemed to me that in the midst of all this commotion I saw you laughing.

454
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:18,540
 But, Mr. Peddley, I'm only human.

455
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:19,540
 Er, did they go part?

456
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:23,540
 I'm sorry, but it would be impossible for me to describe what happened.

457
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:27,540
 Now, come, Ms. Eggleston, I can appreciate a joke just as much as anyone.

458
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:30,540
 Oh, but, Mr. Peddley, I didn't mean to insinuate that you couldn't. I just met...

459
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:33,540
 Regardless of what you meant, that's certainly the way it sounded.

460
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:37,540
 And to be frank, I think it would be very wise if I visited your class tomorrow.

461
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:39,340
 Come in.

462
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:41,340
 You sent for me, Mr. Bradley?

463
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:42,640
 Yes, Willie. Come in.

464
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,640
 That will be all, Mr. Bradley.

465
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,740
 That will be all.

466
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:48,640
 And tomorrow we'll all have a good laugh together.

467
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,140
 Very well.

468
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:51,340
 Now then, Willie?

469
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:52,340
 Yes, Mr. Bradley.

470
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:53,340
 Close the door, please.

471
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:54,940
 Oh, yes, Mr. Bradley.

472
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:59,240
 Well, I had a talk with him, Mr. Bradley.

473
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,740
 I told him just exactly what you said.

474
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,840
 So there won't be a public fight on the school grounds

475
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,640
 this afternoon.

476
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,140
 Are you made it quite clear, Willie?

477
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:13,180
 willy oh yes mister brad and the fight is off entirely well not entirely that

478
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:17,980
 is instead we decided i mean they're gonna have it on the vacant lot and

479
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:22,780
 back of willy isn't gonna be on the school ground willy i understand you

480
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:29,300

481
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:35,540
 i'm just a second you're sure of that oh mister bradley if there's one thing i

482
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:38,340
 I hate to see it's two guys in a good fight.

483
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:40,260
 (audience laughing)

484
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:43,860
 - Well, I suppose if they've got to get it out of their system,

485
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:47,500
 understand, Willy, I am emphatically against boys fighting.

486
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,340
 But if it's off the school grounds,

487
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:51,900
 I don't see how I can in any way interfere.

488
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:52,940
 - Yes, Mr. Bradley.

489
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:54,020
 - That will be all?

490
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:55,620
 - Yes, Mr. Bradley.

491
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:57,660
 - Oh, Willy, just one moment.

492
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:58,820
 - Yes, Mr. Bradley.

493
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:01,300
 - Where did you say this fight is going to be held?

494
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,140
 (audience laughing)

495
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:07,500
 I didn't say yes that would be all

496
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:24,500
 He fellas look what I've got for Homer a pale on the spot wall

497
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:29,140
 I'll ask you nothing look at what I got for Harry a shot. Oh, I'm it who's gonna keep time

498
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:31,500
 I am Willie. I am. Where's Henry and Homer?

499
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:34,900
 Oh, they'll be along. Henry said he'd get here as fast as he could.

500
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,980
 Boy, was he actors to get another this.

501
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:39,620
 Well, Homer was anxious too. He said he wouldn't be late.

502
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:43,400
 My goodness, Eleanor, isn't this exciting? I think it's terrible.

503
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:47,500
 That's what I mean. That's what I mean. I can hardly wait.

504
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:57,500
 [Music]

505
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:01,500
 What time is it, Homer?

506
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,500
 It's, um...

507
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:05,500
 Exactly, 25 minutes after three.

508
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,500
 Is that right?

509
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,500
 [Growling]

510
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,500
 Mmm, it's a pretty good soda, isn't it, Henry?

511
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,500
 Boy, I'll say.

512
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,500
 And don't misunderstand me.

513
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:17,500
 I'd be perfectly willing to go over that lot and fight you, Henry.

514
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:20,500
 Only...only sure. I know what you mean.

515
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:23,500
 But I hope you don't think I wouldn't be willing to fight you, Homer.

516
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:26,500
 She was. I'd be willing to knock your block off for you.

517
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:30,500
 But as the fella disorder fountain just told you, your father's been looking all over town for you.

518
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:34,500
 Sure. And if he wants me to keep an appointment at the dentist or something,

519
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,500
 naturally, I can't disobey him.

520
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:41,500
 Naturally. You know, we don't look toward the door now, but I think some of the gangs just went by.

521
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,500
 You think they're still looking for us?

522
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,860
 - Looking for her? - Sure.

523
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:45,500
 Let's have another soda.

524
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,740
 (audience laughs)

525
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:47,860
 - I'll pay for this one.

526
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:49,380
 - Oh no, Henry, you let me.

527
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:50,220
 - Are you crazy?

528
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,220
 Who am I gonna get a quarter right here?

529
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:53,020
 - Now wait a minute.

530
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:54,780
 - Oh, Chiwiz, did I knock it out of your hand?

531
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:55,620
 - Well, that's all right, Homer.

532
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:56,780
 It's right down here in the floor someplace.

533
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:57,620
 - Oh, wait a second, Henry.

534
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:58,860
 You let me get it for you.

535
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:00,300
 - Well, I'm already into the table, Homer.

536
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:01,140
 - So am I.

537
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,060
 - Hey, fellas, here they are.

538
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:02,940
 - Where, Charlie?

539
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,980
 - They're wrestling, under the table.

540
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,700
 - Who, Chiwiz. - Listen, fellas,

546
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:37,580
 There is least six feet away from each other.

547
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:39,100
 Rush them, Henry. Rush them.

548
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,940
 Sure, I will. Sure, I will.

549
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:43,180
 Homer, what do you keep circling around him for?

550
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:44,220
 I'm measuring him.

551
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:46,060
 Come on, let's have some ice.

552
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:47,500
 Yeah, let's what I say.

553
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,300
 Hang on.

554
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:49,900
 Here's what I say.

555
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:52,380
 How can I hit him? Look at him keep backing away.

556
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:54,460
 You are crazy. You're backing away yourself.

557
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:55,260
 I am not.

558
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,540
 Oop. What happened?

559
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:57,660
 Hey, who tripped me?

560
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:59,420
 Hey, help Henry out somebody.

561
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:00,860
 'Cause I'm all right.

562
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:03,420
 Now listen, Homer, stop running all around me like that.

563
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:04,920
 Oh, he's running! Oh, he's running!

564
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,460
 Oh, that's talking to him, Homer.

565
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:07,800
 That's telling him when to get off.

566
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:10,100
 Homer, tell him what you think of his soap.

567
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,600
 Oh, sure!

568
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,260
 Some soap! Some soap!

569
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:15,000
 You look just like my uncle Oscar.

570
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 [LAUGHTER]

571
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,800
 Now listen, Homer, do call me that once more.

572
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,160
 Oh, Henry, go back for him.

573
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,160
 Sock, I'm going.

574
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,160
 Who I'm going to.

575
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,160
 [LAUGHTER]

576
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,600
 Hey, what you with?

577
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,600
 Homer, run here.

578
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,600
 Is that you?

579
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,940
 Do I have to go to the dentist?

580
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:29,200
 You come with me.

581
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,040
 Now?

582
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,880
 Mr. Brown, you mean I can't beat Homer up?

583
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:34,880
 And as for you Henry, you come along too.

584
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,880
 And ring that suit with you.

585
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:51,900
 (

586
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:55,700
 Am I ashamed? Am I ashamed?

587
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:59,240
 Well listen Homer, here we are all the way out in the edge of town.

588
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,240
 She was untired walking.

589
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:03,540
 Boy, am I ashamed.

590
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:07,240
 Oh, it doesn't look so bad on your home or not. The sun's going down.

591
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:12,240
 All the checks are sort of blended together.

592
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,240
 Yeah, I know.

593
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:16,540
 But my father said, "I've got to wear this suit to school tomorrow."

594
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:22,240
 Listen, Henry, you've already broken it in. Wouldn't you like to wear it?

595
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:25,240
 Well, wouldn't your father tell you I couldn't keep it?

596
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:27,340
 But he wanted you to have the pleasure of wearing it?

597
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:29,140
 Yeah, sure.

598
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:31,640
 What do you think I want everyone in town to call me?

599
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:34,640
 Ask her this and ask her that for as long as I live here?

600
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,940
 I wonder...

601
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:40,340
 I wonder... you wonder what?

602
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:42,840
 I don't suppose we could burn the suit, could we?

603
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:43,840
 Right on me?

604
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:50,840
 Well, the only thing is, Henry, my father wouldn't believe it was an accident.

605
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,140
 You know what I mean.

606
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:55,040
 Well, listen, let's go back into town then.

607
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,940
 Oh, no, not until it's pitch black.

608
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:57,840
 Hey, Homer, look out.

609
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:02,640
 What's the matter? You see what I see crawling across the road? Henry, what is that?

610
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:10,080
 She wears it. It's a skunk, isn't it? Henry, is that a skunk? Are you sure it's a skunk?

611
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,440
 Sure it is.

612
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:22,480
 Here, kitty, kitty, kitty. Here, kitty, kitty. Come to Homer. Homer, hurry. He's getting away from you.

613
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:29,480
 [Music]

614
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:36,480
 Right now, even in November, many sections of the country are unusually dry.

615
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,480
 This increases the danger of forest fires.

616
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:42,480
 So every time you're out in the fields of forest,

617
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,480
 follow these rules.

618
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:46,480
 Crush out cigarette, cigar, and pipe ashes.

619
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,480
 Break matches in two after using them.

620
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:53,480
 Brown all campfires, then stir and drown them again.

621
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:57,480
 Learn and respect the law before starting any fire.

622
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:02,480
 Forest rangers can fight forest fires, but only you can prevent them.

623
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:09,480
 - Thank you, Oliver? - Yes, Father.

624
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:13,480
 - Are you back already? - Well, Father, it's like this.

625
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:16,480
 Homer didn't I tell you to go down to the dentist?

626
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:23,480
 I did. Only he said he'd rather wait a week or two before he works on me.

627
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:32,720
 The Aldrich family is transcribed as written by Clifford Goldsmith.

628
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:36,240
 Henry is played by Bobby Ellis and Homer by Jack Grimes.

629
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,520
 Mr. and Mrs. Aldrich are house Jameson and Catherine Roth.

630
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:45,400
 Your now sir is ticked up.

631
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:51,900
 Listen again next week, same time, same station for another sparkling half hour with the Aldrich family.

632
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:52,900
 Good night, everybody.

633
00:28:52,900 --> 00:29:00,900
 Tonight it's the Phil Harris Alice Fay Show on NBC.

634
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:06,900
 [Music]
