00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,680
 [Music]

2
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:12,240
 And now, Jello Pudding's present...

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,760
 Henry! Henry Aldrich!

4
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:17,040
 Coming, mother!

5
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:20,960
 [Applause]

6
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,800
 The Aldrich family based on characters originated by Clifford Goldsmith,

7
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,400
 and sorry, as was shown as Henry with Jackie Countess Holberg,

8
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,400
 And here they are.

9
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:36,400
 Just a taste of jello puddings. And believe me, you will know

10
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:42,400
 They are made by famous J-E-L-L-O

11
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:47,400
 Yes, and more people eat jello puddings than any other prepared puddings in the world

12
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,400
 Because you never tasted anything better

13
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,400
 Jello chocolate, butter, scotch, and vanilla puddings

14
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:57,400
 A trio of treats, chock full of old-fashioned, homemade goodness

15
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:02,200
 Goodness try it see if you don't say that Jell-O-puttings are richer creamier

16
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:08,220
 More all-round delicious they're made with milk and nourishing and they cook to perfection in just about five minutes

17
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:13,960
 But the great thing about Jell-O-puttings is you never tasted anything better

18
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:20,880
 And now for the Aldrich family

19
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:28,120
 As summer arrives everybody makes plans for a change of scenery, but a teenage boy needs no such change

20
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:35,480
 for every new activity is impulsive mind touches on opens up new avenues toward trouble and excitement

21
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:41,020
 It's Saturday morning and the scene opens in the Aldrich front hall where Henry is on the telephone

22
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:43,020
 Is everything all set Homer?

23
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,780
 Sure, I hope you like mustard sandwiches.

24
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:46,780
 I love them.

25
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:48,780
 With a little chili sauce.

26
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:49,280
 Yeah?

27
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:57,160
 Are you bringing something to wash them down? Sure. There's water. Well, anyway once we get out to my corkos rocks

28
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:03,400
 We won't care if we eat or not. We won't. I'll get my bike and come right over. Look. Why don't I come over there?

29
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:07,060
 I want to get out of the house. Why? My mother's on the war path

30
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:12,880
 Boy, wouldn't you know she'd pick the first decent day this year to decide the garage had to be painted?

31
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:17,680
 She was there. She expect you to paint it? Well, she's working on my father right now

32
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,920
 But something tells me she'll be after me in a minute.

33
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,420
 You mean your father's putting up an argument?

34
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:25,920
 With my mother, don't be crazy.

35
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,420
 He's pretending he's asleep.

36
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:31,420
 Well, in that case, in that case you better get out quick.

37
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:34,420
 That's what I say. If I can just get past the breakfast dishes.

38
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:37,920
 Gee whiz, Homer. I don't know why it is every time I plan something with you,

39
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,420
 some member of your family tries to throw a monkey wrench into things.

40
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:44,920
 Well, get out, Henry. Don't worry. I'll be over there in five minutes.

41
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,420
 Well, okay.

42
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:48,420
 What's that, Mother?

43
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:49,420
 Hello, Henry.

44
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:50,420
 Yeah?

45
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,420
 I'll be right over.

46
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:54,420
 Just as soon as I bring in the washing.

47
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:58,420
 Listen, Homer, why do you let your family walk all over you like that?

48
00:02:58,420 --> 00:02:59,420
 Gee, I don't know.

49
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:01,420
 Why don't you stick up for your rights?

50
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:02,420
 Sure.

51
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:03,420
 Okay.

52
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:04,420
 Sure.

53
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:06,420
 I'll be there as soon as I bring in the washing.

54
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:09,420
 Homer, I'm counting on you.

55
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:10,420
 Sure.

56
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:11,420
 So long.

57
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:12,420
 Goodbye.

58
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:13,420
 Yes, Mother?

59
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:14,420
 What are you doing, dear?

60
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:17,020
 Well, Jean, I'm not doing anything.

61
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:19,660
 Well, then please come out here and do the breakfast dishes.

62
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:22,420
 Well, mother, when I said I wasn't doing anything,

63
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:25,420
 I didn't mean I wasn't doing anything.

64
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:28,540
 I mean, Henry, don't stand up there and yell.

65
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:29,420
 I know, but--

66
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:30,260
 Henry!

67
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:31,660
 Father, is that you?

68
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:32,340
 It is.

69
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:34,180
 And Henry, do you see the package?

70
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:36,620
 Sure only, I thought you went to the office, Father.

71
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:39,900
 I started to, but Henry, wait until you step outside.

72
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:40,740
 What's outside?

73
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:42,100
 Somewhere, my boy, summer.

74
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:44,740
 The sun shining, the birds are singing.

75
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,660
 It's no day to sit in an office.

76
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:47,260
 Look here.

77
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,300
 Let me show you what I bought.

78
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,660
 Gee, Father, why?

79
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:50,300
 You'll see.

80
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,860
 You'll see.

81
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:53,140
 Um, seeds.

82
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:53,980
 Yes, sir.

83
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:57,500
 Vegetables, flowers, enough for a whole late planting.

84
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,300
 And I've got another surprise for you.

85
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,020
 You have?

86
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:03,540
 I'm going to turn this entire day over to the garden and to you.

87
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:04,420
 To me?

88
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:07,540
 I've been pretty busy this winter, son.

89
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,820
 I haven't been able to see as much of you as I would have like.

90
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:10,620
 I know, but I--

91
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:11,780
 You've got a remedy that.

92
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:14,680
 When I go to spend one grand day working in our garden.

93
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,180
 Today?

94
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,780
 Yes, sir.

95
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:22,080
 We'll put her around in the sunshine and catch up on each other's news.

96
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:25,580
 Maybe top the whole thing off with a soda at the Haven Drug Store.

97
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:26,780
 How's that sound?

98
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:28,580
 That sounds swell, Father.

99
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:29,580
 Only...

100
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:30,480
 Only what?

101
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,980
 Well, Homer and I...

102
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:35,480
 Well, Gee, if I had any idea you were planning on...

103
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,080
 You made some plans with Homer?

104
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,380
 Well, that's all right, son. I don't mind if Homer joins in.

105
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:40,980
 The only thing is...

106
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:41,480
 Yeah?

107
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:45,380
 Well, it's just that Homer was kind of looking forward to...

108
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:48,180
 to these other plans we've made.

109
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,880
 Oh, I see.

110
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,980
 Father, I...

111
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:53,980
 That's perfectly all right, Henry.

112
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:57,980
 Naturally, I wouldn't force you to spend the day with me.

113
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:59,480
 Father, I don't want you to thank...

114
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:02,480
 Please don't give it another thought. Just forget the whole thing.

115
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,480
 Gee.

116
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,480
 Gee, what kind of seeds have you got there anyway?

117
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,480
 Nothing at all, just the same old thing.

118
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:13,480
 But father I'd be very interested in seeing them.

119
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,480
 Henry Oldridge.

120
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,480
 I've never been so ashamed of you in my life.

121
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:20,480
 I just feel as though I've failed somewhere along the line as a mother.

122
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,480
 You mean you've been listening?

123
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:27,480
 Henry, do you realize that you spend practically 365 days a year with Homer Brown?

124
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,480
 That's right.

125
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,480
 And all that time your father is out working his fingers to the bone

126
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:34,480
 so he can feed and clothe you and give you a good education.

127
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,480
 See, mother, I didn't mean to hurt his feelings.

128
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,480
 Well, you did, dear.

129
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:43,480
 -Gee, what do you think I should do? -I'm sure I don't know.

130
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,480
 The whole thing is entirely in your own lap.

131
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,480
 Mother, where are you going?

132
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:50,480
 I'm going to leave you alone so you can think things over.

133
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:53,480
 Why, Sam, what are you doing out there?

134
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,480
 I'm sitting, Alex.

135
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,480
 Can't you find any place more comfortable than the stairs?

136
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,480
 I don't want to be comfortable.

137
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:03,480
 -No, Sam. -Allis, please go on with your housework.

138
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,480
 What are you going to do, dear?

139
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:09,480
 Well, I need to go to the office, so get a haircut.

140
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,480
 I haven't decided which.

141
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,480
 So I'll answer the phone.

142
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,480
 Thank you, Sam.

143
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,480
 Hello?

144
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,480
 Hello, Sam. This is Will Brown.

145
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,480
 Yes, Will.

146
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:20,480
 Look, I only have a minute while Elizabeth's talking to the milkman.

147
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,480
 You doing anything today?

148
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,480
 Not a thing.

149
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,480
 What do you say we run out to Fletcher's pond and get him some fishing?

150
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,480
 Well, I had planned on working in the garden, but...

151
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:32,480
 On a hot day like this, bring your back over a hole and shovel?

152
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:36,320
 Well when you could stretch out in the grass and watch the clouds roll by

153
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:40,620
 Well, you're 100% right. I don't know what I was thinking of. I'll be right over

154
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:46,880
 No, I'll come over there. Huh Elizabeth's got our garage on our mind and if I don't oh here she comes what's that?

155
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:51,500
 Yes, sir. Yes indeed mr. By all means I'll drop in a cheaper

156
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:55,740
 I'll drop in right away and we'll sign the contracts on that deal what goodbye?

157
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:58,360
 Well, well, what are you talking about?

158
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,560
 Yes, Henry.

159
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,560
 Father, I've been thinking it over in G. Let's go.

160
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,560
 Let's go where?

161
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,560
 Out to the garden.

162
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:08,560
 Oh, Henry, why don't we just leave the garden for some other day?

163
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,560
 G, Father, you don't have to pretend with me.

164
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,560
 Huh?

165
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,560
 Well, look at it this way.

166
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,560
 The sun's boiling hot.

167
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,560
 And the first thing you know, you're breaking your back over a hole.

168
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,560
 Well, of course, if you'd rather not.

169
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,560
 Oh, no, don't feel it.

170
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:25,560
 Well, I mean, naturally, what I want to do is work in the garden with you, of course.

171
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,560
 Well, then, I guess it's all settled.

172
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,560
 I guess.

173
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,560
 Yes, I guess it is.

174
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:45,560
 Listen Henry, why don't you come right out and tell your father.

175
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,560
 And break his heart home?

176
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,560
 She was.

177
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:50,560
 Are we going to have to spend the whole day planning your garden?

178
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,560
 Listen, Homer, can you casually look down at the other end of the garden without my father seeing you?

179
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,560
 Sure.

180
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,560
 What's he doing?

181
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,720
 seems to be having an argument of some kind with my father.

182
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,720
 Yeah?

183
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,800
 Listen, Henry, just tell me one thing.

184
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,800
 What?

185
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,240
 Do you really want to go out to Macquarkle's rocks with me?

186
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,800
 Because if you don't, just say so.

187
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,800
 I'll understand.

188
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,800
 Sure I do, Homer.

189
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,800
 Sure I do.

190
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:15,960
 But first, I have to think of some way to get my father occupied here.

191
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:16,960
 You'll be planning this row.

192
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:21,160
 But if I'm going to spend the day working, I might just as well be home, painting my

193
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,160
 garage.

194
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,160
 Painting your...

195
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,160
 Painting your...

196
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,160
 Homer.

197
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,160
 Why?

198
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,160
 Homer, you're a genius.

199
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:32,400
 Oh, Lee. Listen. Listen, I know how I can get my father to kick me out.

200
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,040
 Yeah, Gee, whiz how?

201
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,600
 Look at our garage, Homer. Isn't it a mess?

202
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,660
 Now that you mention it, sure.

203
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:43,200
 Well, all I have to do is get my father interested in painting it, and I'll be free.

204
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,700
 I don't follow you, him.

205
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:47,640
 Whenever he gets painting the garage, he always throws me out.

206
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,720
 That's one thing he'll never let me touch.

207
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,000
 Why would you want to?

208
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 Why do you think?

209
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,200
 Because he won't let me.

210
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,640
 But, Henry, where are you going?

211
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,320
 To start the ball rolling.

212
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,160
 Bam, all you have to do is come right out and tell Henry.

213
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,160
 Tell me what, Father.

214
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,420
 Oh, well, nothing, Henry.

215
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:02,320
 Not a thing.

216
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,680
 How's the garden coming along?

217
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,920
 I'm just fine.

218
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,080
 How's your end?

219
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,520
 We're getting there.

220
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,160
 Well, look, Father.

221
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:12,040
 Have you happened to notice our garage recently?

222
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,200
 Isn't it a site?

223
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,240
 Why, uh--

224
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,160
 Don't you think it could use a coat of paint?

225
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,040
 Why, yes, Henry.

226
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,680
 That's an excellent idea.

227
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,400
 Look at it, Will.

228
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,400
 Isn't it a site?

229
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,640
 It looks all right to me.

230
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,960
 Will.

231
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,480
 What?

232
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,760
 You stay right here, Father.

233
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:31,760
 I'll go and get the paint. You do that, son. Sam, have you gone crazy? Look, Will, this is a chance to get away and go fishing.

234
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:35,760
 Yeah? For as long as I can remember, Henry's wanted to paint the garage and I've never let him touch it.

235
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,760
 Is that right? But today, Will, I'm going to let him paint the whole thing himself.

236
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:53,760
 No, I'm not busy, Elizabeth. I'm glad you've followed. But I won't keep you, dear. I just wanted if you had any large paintbrushes.

237
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,040
 How large?

238
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,360
 For painting a garage.

239
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,560
 Oh, you're having your garage painted?

240
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,960
 No, Alice. I'm painting it myself.

241
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,960
 Really?

242
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,960
 And I might even fall off the ladder and break my neck.

243
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,960
 What's that?

244
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,960
 Then perhaps they'll be sorry.

245
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,960
 Who, Elizabeth?

246
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,960
 Will and Homer.

247
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:11,560
 Honestly, Alice, those two would go to the end of the earth to avoid a little work.

248
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:15,160
 Are you sure they wouldn't do it for you, Elizabeth, if you asked them nicely?

249
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:18,160
 Alice, dear, I've asked them nicely in every other way.

250
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,560
 Oh, well, men are all the same, I guess.

251
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,960
 Well, I guess I'm pretty lucky.

252
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:23,960
 Are you dear?

253
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:29,260
 Yes, it's quite a coincidence, but Sam and Henry are getting ready to paint our garage right now.

254
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:30,260
 They are?

255
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:32,460
 Well, how long did you have to work on them?

256
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:34,960
 As a matter of fact, I didn't say a word about it.

257
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:38,960
 They always seem to know what I want done without my even having to say.

258
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,960
 Really?

259
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:43,560
 Well, of course Homer and Will think a lot of me too.

260
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,560
 Oh, certainly.

261
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,260
 I don't believe in judging a man by how much work he does around the house, do you?

262
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:49,460
 Oh, of course not.

263
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:52,860
 And Elizabeth, if you want to come and pick it up, I'd be glad to lend you a paintbrush.

264
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:57,760
 All right. And Alice, do you think people will talk if I come over in my overalls?

265
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:10,360
 Father! We're around behind the garage, son.

266
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,360
 And well, Henry, have you got all the paint out?

267
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,860
 Yes, sir, and here, Father. I thought you might like to start with this big brush.

268
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:17,360
 Henry, I have a big surprise for you.

269
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:17,860
 You have?

270
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,360
 He sure has, Henry.

271
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,360
 Yes, sir. You may keep it.

272
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,360
 Keep what?

273
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:26,600
 brush father watch for I've been pretty unfair in the past Henry when you wanted

274
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:30,440
 to paint the garage I realize that now so you have my permission to go to it but

275
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:35,120
 but but but I had quite believe it as well it's a fact but father I can't be

276
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:41,920
 trusted with a paint brush well who said so you said so I was wrong Henry you go

277
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,400
 ahead and enjoy your I know but you were getting right out of your way and leaving

278
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,520
 you a clear feel and Homer can help you

279
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,440
 The paint's already here.

280
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:53,440
 Yeah, well listen Homer, I have something to tell you.

281
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,680
 And did you see his face?

282
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:58,480
 Well, I don't think I've ever seen anybody so surprised.

283
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,840
 I have to hand it to you Sam, it worked like a charm.

284
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,040
 Now just dash in the house and grab my fishing tackle.

285
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,480
 OK, I'll only be five minutes.

286
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,360
 Say, these are pretty nice brushes.

287
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,840
 While I'm waiting, do you mind if I dog a little red trim

288
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,080
 around the door here?

289
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,320
 I don't mind if Henry doesn't.

290
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,000
 Just a few inches here.

291
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,880
 I can't resist red paint.

292
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,520
 Help yourself, Will.

293
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:19,860
 [humming]

294
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:20,860
 Is that you, Sam?

295
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:23,960
 Yes, Alice. Oh, oh, I didn't know we had company.

296
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,120
 Good morning, sir.

297
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,200
 What's that?

298
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,400
 By Elizabeth.

299
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,800
 In those with your back turd, I thought--

300
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,300
 And Elizabeth came over to borrow a paintbrush, Sam.

301
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,040
 Oh, well, they're all out in the backyard.

302
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,500
 Excuse me. How are you, Elizabeth?

303
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,100
 Oh, not too bad, Sam.

304
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,400
 I've been having a little trouble, though, with my--

305
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,920
 with my-- well, I guess he's gone.

306
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,940
 Reminds me as well, go out and get that brush.

307
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:46,440
 Oh, yes, and I do appreciate your--

308
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,440
 Elizabeth, what are you staring at?

309
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:51,440
 My goodness, what do you see out in the backyard?

310
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,940
 Unless my eyes deceive me, I see my husband Will and my son Homer.

311
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:56,940
 Yes?

312
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,940
 Hinking your garage.

313
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:03,440
 My goodness!

314
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,440
 Excuse me!

315
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,440
 Elizabeth, where are you going?

316
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,440
 Wheel down!

317
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,440
 Hello Elizabeth!

318
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,440
 Homer!

319
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,940
 Gee, Liz, what are you doing over here?

320
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:12,940
 Is anything wrong, Elizabeth?

321
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,440
 We'll put down that paintbrush.

322
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,440
 Put it down?

323
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,840
 No, on second thought, keep it.

324
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,980
 You too, Homer.

325
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,280
 Now march, both of you.

326
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,000
 March, in which direction?

327
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,760
 In the direction of our garage.

328
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,560
 Listen, Mother, I'll come quietly

329
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,840
 and meet you as I go in my ear.

330
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,560
 Now march, right, left, right, left.

331
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,560
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

332
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:44,760
 There are miracles of goodness, a marvel of speed.

333
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:49,800
 So sensational new Jello Tapioca puddings, newest members of the famous Jello pudding

334
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,800
 family.

335
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:55,360
 Try these delicious new desserts, and you'll find here's another reason why more people

336
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,640
 eat Jello puddings than any other prepared puddings in the world.

337
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:03,040
 There's luscious light and delicate Jello vanilla tapioca.

338
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,320
 There's rich candy-good Jello chocolate tapioca.

339
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:11,040
 And newest of all, there's Jello Orange coconut tapioca, tempting orange flavor with coconut

340
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,040
 added.

341
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,640
 creamy, smooth treat of tropical goodness.

342
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:17,000
 All three jello puddings are ready prepared,

343
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,880
 quick as a flash to fix and nothing to go wrong.

344
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,280
 All you do is add the milk,

345
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,360
 then cook in an ordinary saucepan.

346
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,320
 And jello puddings cook to perfection

347
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,120
 in just about five minutes.

348
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,320
 So remember, now you can get jello vanilla tapioca,

349
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,800
 jello chocolate tapioca,

350
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:35,120
 and newest of all, jello orange coconut tapioca.

351
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,840
 Ask for jello tapioca puddings,

352
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,760
 a miracle of goodness, a marvel of speed.

353
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:47,760
 And now getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldrich.

354
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,480
 After having made plans to go on a picnic with Homer, Henry was led to believe that his

355
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,640
 father wanted a Sherry's company today.

356
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:57,800
 But actually Mr. Aldrich is anxious to get away fishing with Will Brown.

357
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:02,240
 As a result of their efforts to get away from each other, each has lost his partner.

358
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,040
 It's just after lunch and the zine opens in the Aldrich living room.

359
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,040
 Henry?

360
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,040
 Yes, Father.

361
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,480
 Do you think you should be fiddling in the living room?

362
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,480
 I'm being careful father. Besides, what else is there to do?

363
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,480
 You have a point there.

364
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,480
 It isn't that I'm not enjoying your company father.

365
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,480
 Oh, of course. It's grand having to stay together.

366
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:26,480
 Sure. How's business?

367
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,480
 Had any interesting cases lately?

368
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,480
 Yes, but they're rather complicated if you wouldn't understand.

369
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,480
 Oh. How's school?

370
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:38,480
 It's fine. It's all over.

371
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,280
 (audience laughing)

372
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:45,320
 - Did you know the baseball team tied Abbott City last week?

373
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,400
 - Yes, that's too bad.

374
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,280
 - Too bad?

375
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,400
 I guess you didn't hear me, Father, they tied.

376
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,240
 - Yes, but--

377
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,000
 - It's the closest we've come to winning in two years.

378
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,080
 (audience laughing)

379
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,960
 - Oh, oh well, that's fine.

380
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:59,760
 - Gee, do I feel sorry for Mr. Brown and Homer

381
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,960
 painting their garage?

382
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,760
 They don't have any rights at all.

383
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:03,720
 - Apparently not.

384
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,680
 - Wouldn't you think on a nice day like this,

385
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,840
 Mr. Brown would let Homer go out in the woods

386
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:12,080
 be wanted to you certainly would what was that you said about going out in the

387
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:15,720
 world that's what Homer and I am planned on doing today but I thought you wanted

388
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:21,200
 to stay around home I wish you wanted to do that no I want to go fishing you do

389
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:26,000
 well gee wish father why didn't you say so I love fishing well say what are we

390
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,560

00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:35,040
 worms and then oh I head and I going fishing Alice today and are we gonna

392
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,300
 - You're gonna have fun.

393
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,760
 - Sam, you must be joking.

394
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,600
 - What do you mean?

395
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,600
 - Well, my goodness, you certainly can't walk out

396
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,600
 and leave our backyard in the state, it's in.

397
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,700
 - What's the matter with it?

398
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,400
 - Well, the garden have dug up,

399
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,840
 packages of seeds all over the place,

400
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,240
 and what's more important, the garage has painted.

401
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,040
 - Alice, we'll paint the garage tomorrow.

402
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,680
 - Why can't you go fishing tomorrow?

403
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,360
 - Because the paper says it's gonna rain.

404
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,680
 - Well, dear, how can you paint the garage in the rain?

405
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,560
 - We'll cross that bridge when we come to it.

406
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,560
 - I'll answer the phone.

407
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,120
 You two stay right there.

408
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,920
 - Father, why don't we stick up for our ride?

409
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:04,920
 Hello?

410
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,920
 Alice, this is Elizabeth.

411
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:07,920
 Oh, hello Elizabeth.

412
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,920
 I just called to tell you how nicely things are going.

413
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,920
 Honestly, I'm so pleased.

414
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,920
 Really?

415
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,920
 I wish you could see what a good time Homer and Will are having.

416
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:16,920
 What are they doing?

417
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,920
 Paining the garage.

418
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,920
 I've been watching it from the window.

419
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:22,920
 Wheels painting one side and Homer's painting the other.

420
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,920
 And I've never seen him so engrossed in anything.

421
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,920
 Well, isn't that nice?

422
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,920
 Sam and Henry painting your garage must have set a good example.

423
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,920
 Sam and Henry?

424
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:31,920
 Yes.

425
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,700
 How did you ever train them to be so helpful, Alice?

426
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:38,800
 What? Well, I believe in taking the bull by the horns.

427
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,300
 Yes.

428
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:43,520
 And when I have a problem to face, I feel the only thing to do is...

429
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,800
 Well, face it.

430
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,320
 Oh, that's so true, Alice.

431
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,140
 Oh, would you excuse me now, dear?

432
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:49,140
 Of course. Goodbye.

433
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,040
 Goodbye.

434
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,560
 Sam!

435
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,740
 What in the dalas?

436
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:53,880
 Please come here!

437
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,680
 Mother, just take the bull by the horns.

438
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,680
 Yes, Father.

439
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,180
 Yes, I will.

440
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:59,720
 Now listen, Alice.

441
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,880
 Now listen, Sam.

442
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,080
 You listen to me!

443
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:13,980
 [Music]

444
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:14,780
 Homer!

445
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:15,980
 Yes, Mother!

446
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:17,980
 How's the painting coming along, dear?

447
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:19,980
 Why, I'm fine, Mother!

448
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:21,580
 Don't bother coming over!

449
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:24,380
 I guess, won't death or I'd come and see how you were getting along!

450
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:25,980
 Well, listen, Mother, you wouldn't...

451
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:26,980
 Homer, Brown!

452
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,380
 I'm gonna paint over!

453
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:32,380
 Do you mean to say you spent an entire hour playing pick that toe with perfectly good paint?

454
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:35,880
 Not entirely. I painted this strip along the bottom.

455
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,880
 And what's this over here?

456
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,880
 What's why?

457
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,380
 This heart with Agnes loves Homer printed inside.

458
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:44,880
 Or you should be ashamed of yourself smearing a thing like that all over the garage.

459
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,880
 But mother, she said she didn't care if the whole world knew it.

460
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:48,880
 Where's your father?

461
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,380
 He's around the other side.

462
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:51,880
 Wait till he sees this.

463
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,380
 Will!

464
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:54,380
 But mother, I'm gonna paint over.

465
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:54,880
 Will!

466
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,880
 What do you want, Elizabeth?

467
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,880
 I want to tell you what your son's been doing.

468
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,840
 Look Elizabeth, why don't you run along in the house?

469
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,820
 Since you apparently weren't interested enough to...

470
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:04,320
 Will Brown.

471
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,320
 Now look Elizabeth.

472
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,620
 May I ask whose art work this is?

473
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:08,620
 Mine.

474
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:09,620
 Oh!

475
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:12,140
 But don't get excited, I'm going to paint over them.

476
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:13,140
 What are they?

477
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:15,540
 Smallmouth bass.

478
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:18,940
 This one here's a guppy.

479
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:21,140
 Honestly Will, I don't know what to say to you.

480
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:23,580
 Now look, do I tell you how to do your housework?

481
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:26,100
 But these horrible fish, what were the neighbors' things?

482
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,580
 I'll have them filled in before the neighbors even see them.

483
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:30,780
 Besides, it's nobody's business but my own.

484
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:31,300
 But will!

485
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:35,580
 If a man has to work, there's no law that says he can't enjoy himself is there.

486
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:36,340
 All right, Will.

487
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:37,940
 Go ahead and do it your way.

488
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:39,540
 But don't expect another meal in this house

489
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:41,100
 to do that garage is painted properly.

490
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,260
 Don't worry, Elizabeth.

491
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:43,260
 Father!

492
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,100
 Yes, Homer.

493
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,140
 Father, can we have another can of paint?

494
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:48,460
 What happened to all the paint we had in the garage?

495
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:49,500
 We used it.

496
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,300
 You mean to say we haven't any more?

497
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:52,620
 I guess not.

498
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:55,020
 Say, those are pretty good submarine.

499
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:57,820
 Well, come on, we'd better get down to the paint store and get some.

500
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:58,820
 I'll say.

501
00:19:58,820 --> 00:19:59,180
 Adri-

502
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:01,020
 Well, what do you mean, submarine?

503
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:13,620
 Ouch!

504
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:14,820
 Henry, hold still.

505
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:16,220
 How can I?

506
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:18,220
 Well, lean back against the garage.

507
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:22,020
 But the turpentine's running down my face and it stings!

508
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,920
 Well, that's unfortunate, but I either have to scrub

509
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:27,000
 your head or cut your hair off.

510
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,320
 Now take your choice.

511
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,840
 - Scrub.

512
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:30,920
 - All right.

513
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,840
 Oh still.

514
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,080
 - Gee, what time is it?

515
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,120
 - It's 2.30, it's no use,

516
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,760
 and no matter how fast we paint,

517
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,400
 we won't get any fishing done today.

518
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,840
 - Unless there was some way to speed things up.

519
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:41,680
 - For example.

520
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:45,320
 - Well, look, did I tell you about that swell gadget

521
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,080
 I saw in Springer's hardware?

522
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:47,920
 - Oh, what is it?

523
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:48,840
 - It's a paint sprayer.

524
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,440
 You take the fan belt off of your car, see,

525
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,880
 and attach the sprayer,

526
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,880
 And boy, you can paint a whole house in four hours.

527
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,540
 You can?

528
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:58,380
 Sure.

529
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,000
 What are you doing, Father?

530
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,200
 Taking the fan belt off.

531
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,400
 And we'll walk down to Springer's

532
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,480
 and look at one of those things.

533
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,560
 Do you mean it, Father?

534
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,640
 You just hand me that wrench, please.

535
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,280
 Sure.

536
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,280
 And then I can go hunt up my fishing pole.

538
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:22,560
 Well, Homer, there's no use hiding outside, you.

539
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,560
 Oh,

540
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,560
 Hello Elizabeth, this is Alice.

541
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,560
 Yes, Alice.

542
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:31,560
 This is a little embarrassing, Elizabeth, but are Henry and Sam over there?

543
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:34,560
 No, they aren't. And neither are we'll and Homer.

544
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:37,560
 You mean they disappeared too? Well, that's settled.

545
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,560
 Set us what?

546
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:42,560
 I know very well where they've gone, Elizabeth, the whole four of them.

547
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,560
 Where?

548
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,560
 Fishing. Out at Fletcher's pond.

549
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,560
 Alice, they wouldn't dare.

550
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:51,560
 They've been talking about it all day, and if I know anything about men, that's where they are.

551
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,960
 I can't believe it.

552
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,360
 What sort of condition is your garage in?

553
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,160
 You wouldn't believe it if I told you.

554
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,660
 Well ours is the same.

555
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:00,660
 And do you know how I feel Elizabeth?

556
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:01,360
 How?

557
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,960
 If we let them get away with this,

558
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,160
 we'll never be able to do another thing with them.

559
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,560
 I'll do whatever you say Alice.

560
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,160
 You're so good at managing them.

561
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,860
 Alright I'll be right over with a car to pick you up.

562
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:12,060
 But where are we going?

563
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:14,860
 Up to Fletcher's Pond and take the bull by the horn.

565
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:25,860
 Come on in the house, Will.

566
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:28,360
 The only thing is I should be getting home.

567
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,860
 Only I don't dare.

568
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:30,860
 Come on in for a few minutes.

569
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:34,360
 You can explain to Elizabeth how we ran into each other down at the hardware store.

570
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:37,860
 Yeah, but how am I going to explain that I can't find any of the right color paint?

571
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:38,860
 Well, just...

572
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:40,360
 Just stand up for your rights, Will.

573
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,360
 Tell her you'll finish painting the garage next week.

574
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,760
 But you haven't seen what I painted on the toe.

575
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,760
 Well, I never liked our neighbors anyway.

576
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,160
 [audience laughing]

577
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,960
 Father, I've been walked through the house

578
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,360
 and mother seems to be out.

579
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,360
 Cheers. Sit down, Will.

580
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,860
 Why don't I make some lemonade

581
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:56,360
 and we'll all relax for a while?

582
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,860
 That'd be great. Henry, go make some lemonade.

583
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:02,360
 Oh, me? Father, you mean we don't have to go home?

584
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,360
 Not right away.

585
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,360
 Didn't mother say so?

586
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,860
 I said so.

587
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:07,860
 You, Father.

588
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:10,860
 We are sure wish they'd had one of those paint sprayers left.

589
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:13,860
 Let's not talk about paint. Let's enjoy ourselves while we can.

590
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:18,860
 Say, Father, didn't you leave your car in the driveway when we went down to the hardware store?

591
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:19,860
 Yes, of course.

592
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:21,860
 Well, look out the window. It's gone.

593
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:23,860
 Good heavens, you don't suppose your mother took it, do you?

594
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:28,860
 Sure, that's probably it. But I took the fan belt out. She won't get ten miles with it.

595
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:29,860
 Is that the phone?

596
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:30,860
 I'll answer it.

597
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:31,860
 How about that lemonade?

598
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:33,860
 Hello.

599
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:34,860
 And let me speak to Matt.

600
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,860
 Wait a minute. Who is that?

601
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:37,860
 Alice, is that you?

602
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:39,860
 Sam, I'm Stuart.

603
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:43,860
 Did you go? Are you at home?

604
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:44,860
 Of course I'm at home.

605
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:45,860
 Oh my goodness.

606
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:46,860
 Where are you?

607
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:50,860
 I'm coming from a roadside stand out near Fletcher's pond.

608
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:51,860
 You're where?

609
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:54,860
 At the... I don't know quite how to tell you, but...

610
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:56,860
 There seems to be something wrong with the car.

611
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:58,860
 Oh, is that so?

612
00:23:58,860 --> 00:23:59,860
 Alice, what did you do to it?

613
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:01,860
 I didn't do anything.

614
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:04,860
 Elizabeth and I were just driving along and it got very hot inside

615
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,860
 and then the whole thing started smoking.

616
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:07,860
 Now look, Alice.

617
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:09,120
 - Hello, you're getting angry.

618
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,480
 Sam, I give you my word.

619
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,180
 I didn't brace the motor.

620
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:15,320
 And I know I put the emergency break off before I started.

621
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,160
 - I see.

622
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,800
 Well, we'll discuss that later.

623
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,640
 - Yes, Sam.

624
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:22,440
 And do you think you and Will could come out and get us?

625
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:25,120
 - Yes, I suppose we'll have to.

626
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,240
 But on our own terms, you understand?

627
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,080
 - Yes, Sam.

628
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,120
 - All right, goodbye.

629
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,240
 - Goodbye, dear.

630
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,600
 And thank you.

631

 - Will, boys!

00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,720
 - Yes, Sam.

633
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,560
 - Yes, Father.

634
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:37,520
 - Elect to tackle everyone, we're going fishing.

00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:55,920
 That's gratitude, Henry. That's gratitude for you.

637

 No, listen, Homer.

638
00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:00,520
 If you don't want to go over to Agnes's for dinner tomorrow, okay.

639
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:01,520
 Well, gee, Homer.

640
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:05,520
 Only I happen to know they're having Jell-O butterscotch pudding for dessert.

641
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,880
 I guess they'll be glad to have me eat your dish of it too.

642
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,560
 Now, wait a minute, Homer.

643
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:13,920
 It has better change your mind and a hurry about that invitation, Henry,

644
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:17,920
 because you never tasted anything better than jello puddings.

645
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:21,040
 Jello chocolate, butter scotch, and vanilla puddings.

646
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,480
 A trio of treats.

647
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:27,760
 And that's why more people eat jello puddings than any other prepared puddings in the world.

648
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,440
 Sure, jello puddings are nourishing.

649
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:33,200
 Sure, they're luscious to look at and sure they're easy to fix.

650
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,660
 But first and foremost, Jello Pudding's taste so grand.

651
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:40,600
 Smooth as cream, chock full of old-fashioned homemade goodness.

652
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:43,700
 Jello Pudding's made with milk cooked in just about five minutes.

653
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:45,900
 But above all, there are treat to eat.

654
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,600
 That's Jello Pudding's.

655
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,000
 You'll never taste it anything better.
