00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,360
 Henry! Henry Aldrich!

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:05,760
 Coming, Mother!

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:09,600
 Postum presents The Aldrich Family written by Clifford Goldsmith.

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:13,200
 Entertainment for All the Family, brought to you by Postum,

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,240
 attempting wholesome drink for All the Family.

6
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:17,240
 Postum.

7
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:31,240
 [Music]

8
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:35,240
 Before we join the Aldrich family, it may we offer you a friendly challenge.

9
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:39,240
 I've heard it said that if the average person hears five separate statements,

10
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,240
 he has a hard time repeating even four of them.

11
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,240
 See how far above average you are.

12
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,240
 One?

13
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:52,240
 Many people can drink coffee without ill effects, but there are a good many other people whose nerves are set on edge by coffee.

14
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:58,240
 Two, people who are affected by coffee may find it helpful to drink post-em regularly instead of coffee.

15
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:05,240
 Three, post-em contains no caffeine, no stimulant of any kind that could possibly upset anybody's nerves.

16
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:09,240
 Four, post-em is a hearty, robust, really swell drink.

17
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,440
 Enjoyed every meal time by millions of Americans.

18
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:15,520
 Five. You can get post them at your grocers.

19
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,080
 Now how many of those statements can you remember?

20
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,200
 Well I'll give you a little tip. If you remember only the last one to

21
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,840
 get post them at your grocers then you remember the one that you will be most

22
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,840
 grateful for.

23
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:30,440
 For it's when you get it that you can give post them a fair trial.

24
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:34,080
 You can then see if you don't agree that post them is a grand drink.

25
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,560
 See if you aren't much less nervous, more at ease

26
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,560
 Thanks to your switch to post them.

27
00:01:39,560 --> 00:02:05,560
 One of the attractive things about teenage youngsters is that they manage to get a lot of fun out of things which to their elders are apt to be pretty much of a bore.

28
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:10,560
 Let's see how Henry Aldrich handles the problem of moving day, for instance.

29
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,560
 The scene opens in Kathleen Anderson's living room.

30
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,560
 Now wait a second Homer. Kathleen asked me to lift that box for.

31
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,560
 Henry, will you take your hands off if you're only making it heavier?

32
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,560
 I know, Homer, but everything I've picked up you've tried to grab too.

33
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,560
 Anybody think the Anderson's weren't able to move without your budding in?

34
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,560
 All right, then. All right, then. Take it. I hope you break your bag.

35
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,560
 Well, Gee Whiz, Homer, that's a nice thing to do.

36
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,560
 I don't Kathleen's mother's hardwood floor.

37
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,280
 They're moving out of here, aren't they?

38
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,880
 And someone's moving in, aren't they?

39
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,360
 Henry, did you hurt yourself?

40
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,320
 No, I didn't hurt myself.

41
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,520
 Homer, could you...

42
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,560
 Could you give me a hand with this?

43
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,200
 I thought you wanted to lift it yourself.

44
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,920
 Wait a second now, and I'll put this other pile of books in.

45
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,400
 Oh, you're going to put more in it?

46
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,000
 Henry, we have to get everything we own out of here by tonight.

47
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,280
 You do? Yes, Henry.

48
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,280
 Well, see, where are you going to have dinner?

49
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:58,960
 I don't know.

50
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,640
 Listen, Kathleen, why don't you come over to our house for dinner?

51
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,640
 Over to your house? Really, Homer?

52
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,640
 Homer, over to your house?

53
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,140
 And now wait a second. Why should she want to come over to your house?

54
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:09,140
 Why shouldn't she?

55
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:10,140
 I'd be close, Homer.

56
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:12,640
 In the first place your mother and father are both on a diet.

57
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,140
 And you know what that means.

58
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:15,140
 What does it mean?

59
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:17,140
 Yes, Mrs. Anderson.

60
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,640
 Are you calling I?

61
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,140
 Could you come here and help me with this step ladder?

62
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:22,140
 Yes, sure.

63
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:25,140
 Homer, move that box of books out on the porch for Kathleen.

64
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:25,640
 Alone?

65
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,140
 Is it too heavy for you, Homer?

66
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,140
 Well, I'll tell you.

67
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:30,640
 Listen, Kathleen.

68
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,440
 Why don't you all come over for dinner?

69
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,880
 As long as your mother's gonna have all your dishes packed.

70
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:38,520
 Oh, I don't think we should impose on your mother and father like that, Homer.

71
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,160
 Well, that's the beautiful part of it.

72
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:43,120
 If you come over, my mother will have to cook something good for a change.

73
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,120
 No, Homer, I don't think we'd better.

74
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,600
 Now, would you move that box, please?

75
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,800
 Okay.

76
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,800
 Say, I've got a better idea, Kathleen.

77
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,720
 All the hominists, my mother. Then I can explain the whole thing.

78
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,840
 And if she says she'd rather we wouldn't come, will you be frank and tell us all?

79
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,200
 Oh, gee, what's Kathleen? You don't have to worry about a thing like that.

80
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,400
 Hey Homer, how about coming down to the basement and give me a hand with a barrel of stuff?

81
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,600
 I've got a beaded Henry. As soon as you get the barrel up, move that box of books there.

82
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,700
 Listen, Kathleen, where's he going?

83
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:12,900
 Home to see whether his mother would mind having anyone extra for dinner?

84
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:16,700
 You mean you're going? You're going? And instead of coming over to my house?

85
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,700
 Well, Henry, you hadn't even mentioned your house.

86
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,400
 Kathleen, don't you remember my saying...

87
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,600
 Am I saying...don't you want to eat with my family?

88
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,700
 I didn't say I didn't want to. I'd much rather only...

89
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,160
 Well, only how about your mother my mother?

90
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,100
 What would my mother have to do with your coming over for dinner?

91
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:36,000
 I mean, oh, all I have to do is phone and say you're coming.

92
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,200
 Hello?

93
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,900
 Hey, good as I guess your mother's better natured than my mother.

94
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,500
 Oh, gee, as soon as I send--

95
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,100
 But please, listen, mother.

96
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,000
 Number please.

97
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,500
 Oh, uh, L-303.

98
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,700
 L-303.

99
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:48,500
 Kathleen?

100
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,500
 Yes, mother?

101
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,500
 Could you help me, please?

102
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,200
 All right.

103
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,400
 And I have something I'll think I should tell you.

104
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,600
 And Kathleen, after dinner, maybe we can go to the meeting

105
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:03,320
 movie hello hello listen mother Henry where are you I'm just over helping I'm

106
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:06,320
 sort of you won't be late getting home for dinner tonight with you dear we're

107
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:11,780
 going to eat early oh we are mother I want to tell you something what is it

108
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:16,280
 you know the Anderson's has something happened to them no they're an awful

109
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:20,000
 predicament they have to get out of their house by tonight see really where

110
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,800
 are they going over on Center Street well don't be nice well don't be late

111
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,800
 - Wait a second, Mother. I haven't finished with that predicament.

112
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,800
 - There, I can't stand here and talk with you. I'm putting up applesauce.

113
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,800
 - You are? Well, that's good.

114
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:37,800
 - Well, what would you think of sort of helping out and asking Kathleen to come and eat with us?

115
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:42,800
 - Henry, this is no time to ask anyone for dinner. I've got Jaws and applesauce all over the kitchen.

116
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,800
 - But Mother, she's very fond of applesauce.

117
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,800
 - Frank, but Henry, I don't like you bringing home a guest when I'm working as hard as I am.

118
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,800
 - But, Mother. - There you may have her any night, but tonight.

119
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,800
 - Henry!

120
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,800
 Let me explain something.

121
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,800
 - Henry, there's nothing to explain. - Mother, listen.

122
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,800
 - Good idea. - Good mother.

123
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,800
 - Henry, did you catch your mother? - Yes, and...

124
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,800
 - Oh, yeah. - It's wonderful, because Mother says she'd be glad to let me go.

125
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,800
 - What's that? - Well...

126
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,800
 - That's fine.

127
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:24,120
 In the first place Alice Henry shouldn't have asked you but Sam I told him he could not have Kathleen tonight

128
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,960
 Oh, well, I'm glad to hear that not that Kathleen isn't welcome here

129
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:31,440
 But there's a chance that Ed Wilson will be in town. You mean you've asked him to have dinner here

130
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,520
 No Alice, but if he does arrive in town tonight

131
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:38,440
 I'd like to feel free to ask him for dinner so we can talk business then I'm all the more glad Kathleen isn't coming

132
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:44,480
 Mother Henry is that you? Yes, where are you? We're in the living room. We'd like very much to speak to you

133
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,280
 You mean fathers in there with you? I am oh

134
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,320
 Hello, Father.

135
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:49,820
 Hello.

136
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:53,000
 Henry, I certainly hope Kathleen understood why I couldn't have it tonight.

137
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 Well, Mother...

138
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,900
 If you aren't awfully busy, could I speak you out in the dining room where we can be alone?

139
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,300
 I mean, there is no use here bringing the subject up.

140
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:04,400
 Your father agrees with me. We cannot have Kathleen tonight.

141
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,400
 Or we can.

142
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,800
 Henry, remember this for as long as you live.

143
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,900
 Don't ever ask anyone to this house for dinner as a...

144
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,400
 as a surprise to us.

145
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,400
 Well, yes, Father.

146
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,800
 Is that clear, dear?

147
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,800
 Yes, Mother.

148
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,580
 That doesn't go just for Kathleen. It goes for home of Brown.

149
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:19,560
 But Jimmy Bartlett.

150
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,280
 Yes, Father.

151
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,340
 For everyone and anyone you happen to have an imposter ask.

152
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:26,380
 Yes, Mother. Only first there's just one thing I want to explain.

153
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:30,060
 Don't try to explain anything. Kathleen is out of the picture as far as tonight is concerned.

154
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:30,920
 Sam, where are you going?

155
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,780
 Out of the garden.

156
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:33,980
 Mother, would you be interested in listening to me?

157
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:34,580
 Ten minutes.

158
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:35,980
 Not hear any more about it.

159
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,860
 But, Mother, look what Mrs. Anderson gave me.

160
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:40,400
 What is it? Are those ration stamps?

161
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,500
 Yes, sure. She felt that bad about it.

162
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,560
 Well, my goodness!

163
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,740
 Look, three stamps.

164
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:46,240
 That gives you some idea, Mother.

165
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:46,740
 How?

166
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:47,240
 How?

167
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,540
 Well, Henry, you certainly couldn't have been very cordial in your invitation.

168
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:51,340
 What's that?

169
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:54,740
 Henry, what did you say to Mrs. Anderson that made her feel she had to give you those?

170
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,040
 That's the funny part of it.

171
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,040
 It came right out of a clear blue sky.

172
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:01,040
 Did you realize how embarrassed this makes me feel?

173
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:05,540
 Apparently she thought the reason we couldn't have Kathleen was because we didn't have enough racial stance.

174
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:06,340
 My mother?

175
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:09,640
 Here, when you're inviting anyone for dinner, there are two ways to do it.

176
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:14,640
 Either don't ask them at all or you ask them wholeheartedly and really make them feel as though they're wanted.

177
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,640
 You do?

178
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:18,640
 Yes, dear. Of course you do. What's the Anderson's number?

179
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,640
 You're going to call them? Of course I am.

180
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,640
 Why? It's... it's L34-4.

181
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,640
 L34-4?

182
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,640
 Number, please.

183
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,640
 No, I'm afraid. I want L34-4.

184
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,640
 L34-4?

185
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,640
 Henry, do you see that list of groceries on the table?

186
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,640
 Yes, mother.

187
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,640
 Now, I want you to take it and go right over to the store.

188
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,640
 Yes, sure. And thanks very much.

189
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,640
 And don't even mention this to your father. You let me explain things to him.

190
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,840
 Yes, mother. Hello. Hello. Is this Betty Anderson?

191
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,140
 Yes. This is Alice Oldridge, dear.

192
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:46,740
 I've just been talking with Henry and, frankly, Betty,

193
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:48,540
 I've never been quite so embarrassed.

194
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:49,740
 Well, who are born, Alice?

195
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:51,940
 Anyone that has to move at a time like this,

196
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:53,740
 and is in the position you're in.

197
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,840
 Well, Betty, we just love to help you all.

198
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,940
 Oh, really? Oh, of course.

199
00:08:58,940 --> 00:08:59,740
 What's that?

200
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:00,740
 What's that?

201
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,240
 Oh, you mean you can all...

202
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,240
 Well, that's fine, Betty.

203
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:08,340
 I was afraid for a minute, and Henry had asked just Kathleen.

204
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:12,020
 Now Alice, are you sure you can have us all on this short notice?

205
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:14,540
 Why? Why, Betty, I give you my word.

206
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:18,340
 Nothing would give us more pleasure than making you feel that our home is your home.

207
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:20,740
 Really, Alice? Well, that's awfully sweet of you.

208
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:23,340
 Not at all. Goodbye. Goodbye.

209
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:27,340
 Sam! Sam, I've got to tell you something!

210
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:40,340
 [Music]

211
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,340
 Hello?

212
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:42,340
 Hello?

213
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:43,340
 Bob, this is Betty.

214
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:46,340
 What do you think the older you did have come to the rescue?

215
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:47,340
 They've asked us over to their house.

216
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:48,340
 Yes?

217
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,340
 For the next three days?

218
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:50,340
 Why no, Bob.

219
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,340
 No, of course not.

220
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,340
 Just for dinner.

221
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:56,340
 Well, that takes care of one meal, but where are we going to stay tonight and tomorrow and

222
00:09:56,340 --> 00:10:00,620
 other places ready well couldn't you get room to the mansion home oh no they're

223
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:04,500
 all filled up you don't suppose the orages would put us up for a few days do

224
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,740
 you know Bob I'm even a little embarrassed about going over there for

225
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:11,580
 dinner but they know we can't move into the other house yes and I don't see why

226
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:15,860
 they don't ask us we do the same for them well Alice or it's did say she wanted

227
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:19,500
 just to feel that their home was our home but I don't think she expects us to

228
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:23,820
 stay three days why don't you call it back and make sure no Bell I can't do that

229
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,820
 Let's just wait and see what happened.

230
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:26,820
 Oh, well.

231
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:27,820
 And Bob, somebody's at the door.

232
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,820
 I just got to hang up and see who it is.

233
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:30,820
 Bye.

234
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:31,820
 Goodbye.

235
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:32,820
 And Sandra's up.

236
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,820
 I'm out here in the front hall.

237
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:36,820
 Is Kathleen here?

238
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:37,820
 Hello, Henry. What is it?

239
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,820
 Nothing, Kathleen. Nothing.

240
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:42,820
 I was just on to my way to get some groceries for something.

241
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:44,820
 And I just thought I'd drop in.

242
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:45,820
 Oh.

243
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,820
 All I want to know is, I want to make sure.

244
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:48,820
 Yes, Henry?

245
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:49,820
 Well, I want to be positive, see.

246
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:50,820
 Yes, Henry.

247
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,820
 I just had to talk with my mother.

248
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:55,820
 She called you, didn't she? Yes, and that was very sweet of it.

249
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:58,820
 Boy, was she upset over the way I asked Kathleen.

250
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:01,820
 Well, your mother was certainly nice to call an ask-a-thaw.

251
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,820
 Oh, all of you? Yes.

252
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,820
 Oh, gee, that's the way my mother is.

253
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:09,820
 Once she decides to do something, she'll even turn over her whole house to you.

254
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:14,820
 Really? As a matter of fact, Henry, she did say we were to feel your home was our home?

255
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:17,820
 Sure. All she's got to know is you're in a jam and, and boy!

256
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:21,820
 Only, Henry, are you positive we won't be crowding you?

257
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:25,740
 crowding us she was how could you do a thing like that are you sure any

258
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:29,700
 Kathleen you talk as though we'd never had company before she was there's plenty

259
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:34,100
 of room and your mother told you to stay there sure she certainly said I was to

260
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:38,260
 be cordial well goodbye goodbye and thanks very much for coming over

261
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:42,820
 Kathleen go to the phone call your father yes mother tell him it's all settled

262
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:47,500
 we won't have to go to the hotel yes Homer where are you I'm not here at the

263
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:51,180
 back door where are you I'm just going to put in a phone call well look I've got

264
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:55,700
 a sort of embarrassing message for you see. My mother said she'd like to have you folks

265
00:11:55,700 --> 00:12:01,100
 come for dinner. In fact there's nothing she'd rather have you do. Only don't you think

266
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:05,180
 as long as you folks are going to be so tired from moving and everything, it would be better

267
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:10,500
 to wait and come sometime afterwards when you feel fresher and you can keep your mind

268
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,500
 on what you're eating.

269
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:14,140
 Well Homer, as a matter of fact we're all going over to Henry.

270
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:15,140
 For dinner?

271
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:16,140
 Yeah.

272
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,140
 Everybody?

273
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:20,380
 Well she was, that's a fine thing. Could I use your telephone before you do?

274
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:21,380
 I guess so.

275
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:22,380
 Hello.

276
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:23,380
 If that isn't it.

277
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:24,380
 Gee whiz.

278
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:25,380
 Number three.

279
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:26,380
 Elm two three two.

280
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:27,380
 Elm two three two.

281
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:30,380
 And Homer, as soon as you get through, could you come in the living room and help me move

282
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:32,380
 that box of books from Mother?

283
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:34,380
 Didn't Henry take care of it?

284
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:35,380
 A wall of...

285
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,380
 Hello, Mother.

286
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,380
 I won't be home for dinner.

287
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:38,380
 Why not?

288
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:46,380
 The old witches are throwing a party.

289
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:49,380
 (Ding)

290
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:52,380
 But mother, I didn't ask them all for dinner. You did.

291
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:56,380
 Well, incidentally, since you knew how many would be here, why didn't you get enough string beans?

292
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:58,380
 I did. That's a beautiful part of it.

293
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,380
 Then why didn't you tell me before I sent your father to the store?

294
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:03,380
 You did? Well, I'll go right out and get him.

295
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:06,380
 Now, don't do anything more. You've done enough as it is.

296
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:07,380
 Where are you going?

297
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:10,380
 Over to Mrs. Kilmer's and try to borrow a large tablecloth.

298
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:12,380
 And dear, I hope you'll let this be a lesson.

299
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:19,020
 Don't ever ever start inviting people in a wholesale way like this again. Yes, mother only I just asked Kathleen

300
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:21,260
 Please go answer that phone. Yes, mother

301
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:27,180
 Maybe this is mrs. Anderson saying they thought it over and now them can come except Kathleen

302
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:32,840
 Hello, hello, man. I speak with mr. Oh, would you please wait mr. Oh, just in here right now?

303
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:37,940
 Could you tell me how I might doesn't touch with him, please? I don't think you can't he's not trying to scrape up some string beans

304
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:39,000
 What's that?

305
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 May I ask who this is speaking?

306
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 This is his son.

307
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 Oh, yes. This is Mr. Wilson.

308
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 I believe I met you when I was in town last week.

309
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 Oh, yes. Up on the roof.

310
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 Henry, I've been sort of a champ down here at the hotel.

311
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 I've been trying to get a room and they tell me there isn't a chance.

312
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 There isn't?

313
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 As a matter of fact, even the dining room is packed.

314
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 You mean you can't get in and get anything?

315
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 That's why I called. I was wondering whether you might have any suggestion to make.

316
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 Well, I tell you. No.

317
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 What's that?

318
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 I'm pretty sure I'd better not make that one.

319
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,400
 Do you know any place to get a room or a meal?

320
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,000
 Well, I... no.

321
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,500
 No, my mother was just saying a little while ago.

322
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,400
 No. Everything's all tied up.

323
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,000
 I see.

324
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,200
 How about...

325
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,600
 How about my father phoning you when he comes in?

326
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,300
 That won't do any good. I can't wait here.

327
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,000
 I've got to find a place to eat and sleep.

328
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:25,600
 Oh.

329
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,400
 Just forget the whole thing. Good-bye.

330
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:31,400
 [music]

331
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:40,400
 [Music]

332
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:45,400
 For Henry, he's certainly picked the wrong time to take his parents literally.

333
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:49,400
 But if I may say so, it's the right time for you to take me literally.

334
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:54,400
 When I suggest that some of you have a big surprise coming, the first time you tried postem.

335
00:14:54,400 --> 00:15:01,120
 For undoubtedly some of you will take your first sip of Postam expecting it to taste like coffee and it doesn't.

336
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:08,320
 Postam is an entirely different drink which you shouldn't expect to taste like coffee anymore than you'd expect coffee to taste like tea.

337
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:15,520
 The flavor of Postam is distinctively its own and so lusty and satisfying, so incomparably good,

338
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:20,360
 that whole family's favor post them over any other meal time drink they've tried.

339
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:26,360
 We'd like you to enjoy Postam two friends, enjoy the rich, hearty, bracing flavor,

340
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:31,360
 and discover why one of America's great mealtime drinks is Postam.

341
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:45,360
 Now getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldrich,

342
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,360
 the Aldrichs are upset to think that Kathleen Anderson and her family

343
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:53,440
 coming for dinner this evening never dreaming that the Anderson's are really

344
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:58,000
 preparing to stay for three days the scene opens in the older's living room

345
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,560
 Mr. Obrich is speaking Alice where are you?

346
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:04,740
 I'm in here straightening up the living room Sam my goodness where have you been

347
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:08,200
 all this time I've been out trying to find enough groceries but did you realize

348
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:11,520
 it's hardly an hour left before the Anderson's will be here Alice I couldn't

349
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:14,760
 help it if somebody had bought all the string beans in town the Anderson's will

350
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:19,080
 have to eat eggplant I do hope they won't stay long after dinner father is that

351
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,080
 It is.

352
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,080
 Well, she was, I've been waiting for you.

353
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,580
 There was a phone call for you.

354
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:24,080
 Yes?

355
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,080
 For Mr. Wilson?

356
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:25,580
 Yes, sir.

357
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:26,580
 Oh, then he's in town.

358
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:27,080
 That's fine.

359
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,580
 I tried to phone him from the drugstore.

360
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:29,580
 Yes, Father.

361
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:31,580
 And boy, are they jammed down at the hotel.

362
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:32,580
 You mean he can't get a room?

363
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:33,580
 No, sir.

364
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:35,080
 Well, you told him to come up here, didn't you?

365
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:35,580
 Up here?

366
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:36,580
 What for?

367
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,580
 Why for dinner, dear, and stay overnight?

368
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:39,580
 Why?

369
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:42,080
 No, Mr. Wilson, he came to town to do business with me.

370
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:46,580
 I know, Father, but you gave me a lecture about asking people right out of a clear sky like that.

371
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:48,580
 There's nothing about it that's out of a clear sky.

372
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:54,740
 Where did he say I could reach him? He said you couldn't he said he was going out to look for someplace to sleep Henry old rich

373
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:57,300
 But but mother you don't you see the position?

374
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:01,740
 I was in Henry if we have antagonized mr. Wilson and he goes back to Chicago without seeing me out

375
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:08,740
 I am now Sam. I'm sorry father but Alice of all the people we know Ed Wilson Ed Wilson after all we do have a guess now

376
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:14,420
 Sam don't be upset. That's probably mr. Wilson at the door this minute. Yes. Well see with let me go to door

377
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:17,340
 I'd like to be the one who invites you now wait a minute Henry wait a minute

378
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:21,960
 What's the matter Alice look out the window with Sam look who's on the front porch?

379
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:26,540
 Oh gee with it's Kathleen and her mother Sam Sam. What are they here now for?

380
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:28,360
 I don't know what time did you tell them to come?

381
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:32,020
 I certainly didn't tell them to come this early. I'm not even dressed father

382
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:35,060
 Do you suppose something's happening and they can't come well?

383
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:38,500
 You mean they can't come Sam don't let them into I get these papers straightened up

384
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:42,540
 Can't one of you help me with them? Where do you want me to put them here Henry take them out to the kitchen?

385
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:45,440
 Yes, father Sam open the door. Oh wait a minute dear

386
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:50,420
 Here's a match I didn't pick up and we take this match out who's gonna notice a match at a time like this

387
00:17:50,420 --> 00:18:00,020
 Well, well hello there. Oh Sam. Hello, Alice. Any dear. Hello. Mr. Mrs. Aldrich. Hello. Don't tell me you can't you can't come in

388
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:03,880
 I thought perhaps it would be too early for you, but that house is driving me crazy

389
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:07,920
 I just had to get out of it. That's quite all right. Tell me where's Bob?

390
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:14,340
 He's coming with the car Alice. Oh, yes mother and I walked over really well. That's just fine. Yes. That's fine

391
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:17,140
 Let's... let's also now.

392
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:18,620
 Mr. Aldrich, is Henry here?

393
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:20,380
 Yes, Kathleen. Henry!

394
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:21,900
 Henry!

395
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,340
 I guess he doesn't hear. You'll be back in a minute, though.

396
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:25,860
 To suppose I go and get him.

397
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:28,340
 I've got one or two little things to attend to in the kitchen.

398
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:31,460
 Anyhow, if you just excuse me, can Kathleen not help you out?

399
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:33,700
 Well, no, dear. There isn't a thing to do.

400
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,780
 But there's the doorbell. I guess that's father.

401
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:37,220
 Yeah? Well, that's fine.

402
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:40,900
 Mr. Aldrich, do you suppose you could go out and help him bring in grandmother?

403
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,100
 What? What's that?

404
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:44,700
 Yes, Sam Bob's mother. You remember her, don't you?

405
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:47,300
 Oh, yes. Yes, that's fine.

406
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,140
 Hello, Sam. Here we come.

407
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:50,180
 Hello, Bob.

408
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:52,100
 And this is Anderson. How are you?

409
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:54,060
 Uh, just take her other arms, Sam.

410
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:55,060
 Yeah?

411
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:56,860
 All right, sir. Here we come.

412
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:57,900
 Do you want some help, Father?

413
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:00,500
 Yes, Kathleen. Go out the car and get grandmother's cushion.

414
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,620
 All right. Have you any idea what Henry is?

415
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:04,980
 Henry! Henry!

416
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,940
 I hope we're not going to be crowding you, Sam.

417
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:09,220
 No, no, not at all. Everything's going to be fine.

418
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:12,620
 Here we go, grandmother, right down into the big chair.

419
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:15,220
 - What do you want me to do? - Just let go of the sand.

420
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16,820
 She does better if you let it drop in.

421
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:18,620
 - Yeah? - Well, that's fine.

422
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:19,820
 There we are.

423
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:22,220
 Sam, I can't begin to tell you how grateful we are

424
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:23,620
 for you're pulling us out of this jam.

425
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,620
 - That's all right. - Yes, indeed.

426
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:28,020
 Now, Sam, I want to tell you one thing.

427
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:30,020
 Betty and I decided before we came over,

428
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:32,020
 we're going to make as little trouble for you as possible.

429
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:36,020
 - Bob, what are you talking about trouble for? - Well, let's work out a schedule for the bathroom.

430
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:38,420
 You know what I mean? So we won't get in your way.

431
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:39,260
 What's that?

432
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:44,220
 And tell me, frankly Sam, would you rather we eat with you or a little head of you?

433
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,020
 What's that?

434
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:47,020
 Well, why don't you let us do this?

435
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:50,820
 I was just thinking, we'll eat first and clean up the kitchen and get out of your way.

436
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:52,180
 - Let's get you? - Sam!

437
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:53,420
 Yes Alice, what is it?

438
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:56,300
 - But you please come here right away? - Yes Alice!

439
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,740
 If you folks would excuse me, I'd go see what she was.

440
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:02,500
 Sam, do you suppose there'd be any objections to grandmother eating upstairs?

441
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,740
 Upstairs?

442
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,420
 Well, no, that would be fine.

443
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:07,300
 Sam, I want you to tell me something.

444
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,300
 Alice, there's something I want you to tell me.

445
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:12,000
 Here, can you cut these spring beans while I go out and change my clothes?

446
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,180
 Alice, what's going on here?

447
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:13,940
 What do you mean?

448
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:15,540
 The endersons don't want to eat with us.

449
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:16,540
 You mean they're leaving?

450
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:19,500
 No, they want to eat in the kitchen before we do.

451
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,440
 And grandmother's going to eat upstairs.

452
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,500
 What's that?

453
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,900
 What grandmother?

454
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:26,820
 Alice, what do they mean by wanting a schedule for the bathroom?

455
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:28,620
 Well, they show them where it is.

456
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:31,460
 No, they want a schedule for it, a schedule.

457
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:33,320
 Here, what are you talking about?

458
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,780
 Oh, my goodness, who'd you suppose that is?

459
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:36,420
 I don't know who it is. How would I know?

460
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:39,060
 Well don't just stand there days, go on to the front door!

461
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:41,420
 Where's Henry? Why can't Henry take care of some of this?

462
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:43,300
 I have no idea where Henry is!

463
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,260
 Alright Mr. O, did you answer the door?

464
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:46,780
 Yes, it wasn't Mr. Wilson was it?

465
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,940
 No, it's just the express man with our baggage.

466
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:49,420
 What's that?

467
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:51,380
 Father didn't want to love it because he was so tired.

468
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:52,420
 Oh, oh.

469
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:54,020
 Now don't you let the fingers hang.

470
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:55,940
 You let that fellow out there bring everything in.

471
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:57,740
 Oh, yes, or all those...

472
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:59,060
 All those...

473
00:20:59,060 --> 00:20:59,980
 Is that your baggage?

474
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:02,500
 Yes, I told him to take them around and bring them in the back way,

475
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,220
 so he won't scratch up the front hole.

476
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:04,980
 Sam!

477
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:05,780
 Yes, Betty?

478
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:09,540
 I forgot to tell Alice we brought our own sheets and telecases and our own towels.

479
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:10,100
 But, sir?

480
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,580
 Enough to last for three days.

481
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,060
 Well, that's fine.

482
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:13,980
 Sam, who was it?

483
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:14,900
 Nothing, Alice.

484
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:17,780
 Just the man with the Anderson sheets and towels.

485
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:18,860
 For the Anderson squad?

486
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:21,300
 But they say they could only be with us for three days.

487
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,300
 What's that?

488
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,260
 I mean...

489
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:25,660
 Oh, only three days?

490
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:28,380
 Why, we certainly thought you could be with us at least.

491
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:29,260
 At least.

492
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:30,940
 Hello, Henry, my lady.

493
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,140
 Homer, is that you?

494
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:33,460
 Yes, Mrs. Orr.

495
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:36,460
 I would have been here sooner only my father couldn't come at the last minute.

496
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:37,060
 What's that?

497
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:38,260
 Just my mother couldn't make it.

498
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:39,260
 Hello, Sam.

499
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:42,060
 Oh, I do hope you understand, we'll not be able to come along.

500
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:43,860
 Well, that's quite all right, Elizabeth.

501
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,860
 We'll try to understand what we are, Liz.

502
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:46,860
 Yeah.

503
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:49,860
 Well, anyway, Sam, happy birthday.

504
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:50,660
 Happy birthday.

505
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:51,260
 Yes.

506
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:53,260
 Yes, isn't that what you're celebrating?

507
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:55,660
 No, Elizabeth, I wouldn't go so far as to say that.

508
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:59,460
 Oh, well, anyway, I know you're celebrating something.

509
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,860
 Oh, isn't that bad Mother Andes nice in there?

510
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:09,440
 My grandmother and this boy am I looking forward to dinner to dinner dear sure just for dinner you can't stay overnight

511
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:13,720
 Well, I guess I could where's Henry I wish I knew

512
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:17,140
 Right out in front. What can't you see?

513
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:21,840
 I mean just got out of that taxi. Hey Ray, where have you been? My father look who I found dear

514
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:26,940
 Who is it? Can't you see it's mr. Wilson and his wife and children? I told them you wanted them to stay overnight

515
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:28,940
 What's that?

516
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:30,940
 (screaming)

517
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:33,520
 (somber music)

518
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,100
 (somber music)

519
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:38,680
 (somber music)

520
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:41,260
 (somber music)

521
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:43,840
 (somber music)

522
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,500
 (somber music)

523
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,200
 - Alice, let me look at this list once more.

524
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,260
 - Quiet, Sam.

525
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:51,260
 You wanna wake everyone in the house up?

526
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:53,740
 - No one can hear us here in the kitchen, Alice.

527
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:54,860
 I just wanna look at the list

528
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:56,300
 and see where everyone is sleeping.

529
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,900
 - Just a moment while I turn this other light on.

530
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:03,980
 Now let's see Bob and Betty Anderson are in there in our room. Do you know?

531
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:09,580
 Oh, yeah, Kathleen is in with Mary. Where's grandmother? She's in Henry's room. Oh, yes, and mr

532
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:15,480
 and Mrs Wilson are in the guest room and their daughter is on the sofa in the living room and their son's on that card in the dining room

533
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:19,180
 Oh, yes, and I'm good asleep on that card. I put up the side Mary and Kathleen

534
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:25,140
 Yeah, and where is it grandmother sleeping? I told you in Henry's room. I said Henry over to stay with home

535
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:27,040
 I realized that, Alice.

536
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,340
 Well, it worked out very well.

537
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:30,240
 I thought so too.

538
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,540
 Now, wait a minute.

539
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:33,040
 Wait a minute.

540
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,340
 Where am I?

541
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:35,740
 You, dear.

542
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,540
 Don't I have you on this list?

543
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:39,340
 Let's go through it once more.

544
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:41,140
 Sam, I guess I don't have you.

545
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:42,440
 That's a fine thing.

546
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,140
 Well, there you've got to lie down someplace.

547
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:46,140
 You've had a hard day.

548
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:48,140
 Why, uh, why--

549
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:50,340
 What were you going to suggest?

550
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:51,140
 No.

551
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:53,840
 I guess the Wilson boy couldn't possibly sleep with grandmother.

552
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,440
 No, dear.

553
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:57,440
 No, we all agreed that grandmother better sleep alone.

554
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
 How about...how about...no?

555
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,440
 Of course.

556
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,440
 Yes.

557
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,440
 There's that old blanket that Henry's goat used to sleep on.

558
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:07,440
 But I frankly don't think you'd be comfortable on that.

559
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,440
 No.

560
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:12,440
 But I might take a couple of leaves from the dining room table and put them across the bathtub.

561
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,440
 What?

562
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,440
 And just lie there holding the bathroom schedule.

563
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,440
 Now Sam, I'm doing the best I can.

564
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,440
 I know Alice, but I've got to do some work tomorrow.

565
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,440
 I can't just stand up against the wall all night.

566
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,280
 How this was that?

567
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,040
 - Sam, it's Henry. Yes, dear?

568
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,840
 - Mother, I wanna tell you something.

569
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,200
 - Not so loud, Henry.

570
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,480
 Did you forget something?

571
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,680
 Forget something?

572
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,520
 What was it?

573
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,400
 - She doesn't know.

574
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,520
 Your mother's asking you.

575
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,480
 Why are you back?

576
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,000
 - I can't sleep over at Homer's.

577
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,040
 - Why not?

578
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:39,440
 - Well, Homer's uncle Joe showed up on a furlough,

579
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,120
 and he brought two soldiers along with him.

580
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:41,960
 - What's that?

581
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,080
 - So I had to come home.

582
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,360
 Sam, what are we going to do?

583
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,360
 - I don't know what they're going to do.

584
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,320
 It's grandmother that's messing up the whole work.

585
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,240
 - What are you walking out of the room like that, Thor?

586
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,680
 - I'm wearing no answer to the telephone.

587
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,280
 Would you like me to father?

588
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,080
 Hello.

589
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,480
 Hello. Do you have a Mr. Wilson there?

590
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,080
 Yes.

591
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,480
 Could I speak to him please?

592
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,280
 Why?

593
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,380
 He can't come to the phone right this minute.

594
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:02,480
 Could I take a message?

595
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,880
 This is the mansion house.

596
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:06,280
 Mr. Wilson had his name on our reservation list

597
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,580
 and asked us to give him a call if anything turned up.

598
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:09,180
 Yes.

599
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:10,680
 We've just found one bed.

600
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:13,180
 If he doesn't mind, it's being in a room with another gentleman.

601
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:15,080
 A Mr. Wiggins from Battle Creek.

602
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:15,680
 Yes.

603
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,680
 Good. Hold it.

604
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,880
 Henry.

605
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:18,480
 Yes father.

606
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,280
 Come with me.

607
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:19,880
 Where to?

608
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:22,980
 You're gonna sleep with a man with the name of Wiggins from Battle Creek.

609
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:30,980
 Stay tuned in, won't you?

610
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:34,980
 The all-rich-as-sleeping problems aren't quite solved even yet.

 [Music]

612
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:08,800
 You won't forget, will you, friends? Postum comes in two economical forms.

613
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:12,320
 Postum, which you brew in pot percolator or drip maker,

614
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:17,720
 and instant postum, which is dissolved instantly in your cup by adding boiling water.

615
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:21,160
 Both have the same unbeatable postum flavor.

616
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:25,520
 So no matter which you enjoy, you can't help but say sincerely,

617
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,160
 "What a swell drink postum is!"

619
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,600
 Father, can't we please turn on the light?

620
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:04,200
 No, Henry. I told her to be sure not to wake up Mr. Wiggins.

621
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:07,200
 But, she was like, can't see the button my pajamas.

622
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,600
 Get into bed.

623
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:11,600
 I am in bed. I'm trying. I'm trying.

624
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,200
 Father, where are you?

625
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,600
 I'm right over here.

626
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,000
 You're not here with me?

627
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,200
 Well, she was who's this I button my pajamas to.

 The Oldridge family is written by Clifford Goldsmith, the original musical score is conducted by Jack Miller.

 And this is Dan Seymour saying, "Your host tonight is Postam."

632
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,200
 And Postam is one of America's great mealtime drinks.

633
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,200
 It's good drinking. Good night.
