00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,600
 You know something, your coffee dollars last longer when you buy instant

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:12,480
 sycra coffee because a jar of the new improved instant sycra costs a good

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,560
 third less than a pound of most ground coffees. It costs less and it gives you

4
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:22,640
 more. Besides a new wonderful flavor, instant sycra offers you freedom from

5
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,400
 caffeine effect and if the caffeine and coffee upset your nerves or sleep you

6
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,960
 You know what a priceless advantage that is.

7
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:30,960
 Try it.

8
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,400
 Economical instant-sica coffee.

9
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:43,640
 Hello, everybody.

10
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,640
 Now America's red letter desserts present.

11
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,640
 Henry!

12
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,640
 Henry Oldridge.

13
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,640
 Coming, mother.

14
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,640
 Yes, it's the Oldridge family.

15
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,640
 [applause]

16
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,640
 Yes, it's the old hit family.

17
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:02,640
 Based on characters originated by Professor Goldsmith and starring Ezra Stone as Henry with Jackie Kelke as Homer.

18
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,640
 And yes, it's the Jell-O family. America's red letter dessert.

19
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,640
 [music]

20
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:15,640
 Oh, the big red letter stand for Jell-O family. Oh, the big red letter stand for Jell-O family.

21
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,640
 That's Jell-O, yum-yum-yum.

22
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,640
 ♪ Tell the warnings, yum yum yum ♪

23
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:24,640
 ♪ Jell-a-tack, bioca planning, chassery ♪

24
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,640
 And now for the Aldrich family.

25
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:34,640
 It's late afternoon and the scene opens in the Aldrich front hall.

26
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,640
 Henry, I just spoke to Mal and Patrick on the phone

27
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,640
 and she wants to know if you're coming to her weekend skating park.

28
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,640
 - Sure I'm coming, Mary. - Well, she asked me to make up a list.

29
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,640
 Who are you going to take?

30
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,340
 Just put a question mark down temporarily.

31
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:49,740
 You have nast anybody?

32
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,140
 Oh sure, I've asked.

33
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:52,340
 Anita Swanson.

34
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:54,640
 Whose father owns the supermarket on Elm Street?

35
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,140
 Yeah.

36
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:56,140
 What are you doing?

37
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:57,340
 I'm putting her name down.

38
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:58,340
 Oh, wait, Mary.

39
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:00,840
 There's just one fly in the ointment.

40
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,640
 What's that?

41
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,640
 Her father.

42
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,640
 He has to approve of whoever takes her.

43
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,740
 What are you doing?

44
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,040
 Crossing her off.

45
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10,040
 Well, Mary, don't be so hasty.

46
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,040
 Mother!

47
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,540
 I'm in the kitchen, Henry!

48
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:13,440
 Excuse me, Mary.

49
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,740
 If Anita doesn't work out Henry, you can always ask the mother girl.

50
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:19,340
 Mary, every girl has a father.

51
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:20,940
 What is it, Henry?

52
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,840
 Mother, would you mind if I ask you a frank question?

53
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,340
 How frank?

54
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:26,540
 Very frank.

55
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:29,840
 Are you sure it isn't something you'd rather ask your father?

56
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,940
 Mother, I think you're right. I'll ask him.

57
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:32,940
 Father!

58
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:33,440
 What is it?

59
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,740
 Are you in the den?

60
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:35,740
 Not anymore.

61
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:38,740
 Well, Father, I'd like to ask you something.

62
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:40,440
 I think I'd better leave.

63
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,440
 What is it you want, Henry?

64
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,740
 Can I ask you a frank question?

65
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:44,240
 Well...

66
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,240
 A very frank question.

67
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:49,440
 Erm, well, just wait until I light my pipe.

68
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,140
 You won't need your pipe, Father. It's not that frank.

69
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,140
 Oh.

70
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,640
 What is it?

71
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:59,140
 Father, you've known me a good many years over the years, haven't you?

72
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,640
 I have.

73
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,640
 Suppose you just forget I'm your son.

74
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,640
 I'm willing.

75
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,640
 Yeah, huh?

76
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,840
 (Laughter)

77
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,840
 Now, now, what would you say, just looking at me,

78
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,340
 What's your general impression of me?

79
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,140
 Well...

80
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,340
 Be Frank.

81
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:16,840
 You really want a Frank opinion?

82
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,340
 Be...

83
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,840
 How Frank?

84
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,840
 (audience laughing)

85
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,840
 Very Frank.

86
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,840
 Father, maybe my question was too general.

87
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,840
 Let me put it this way.

88
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,840
 Do you consider me reliable?

89
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,840
 Enry over the years and forgetting you're my son.

90
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,840
 Let me put it this way.

91
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:37,340
 There have always been certain things I could rely on you for.

92
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:39,340
 Gee, Father, thanks.

93
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:42,340
 And would you be willing to tell that to Mr. Swanson?

94
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:44,340
 Mr. Swanson owns the supermarket.

95
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,340
 Oh, yes, the one that has that very pretty daughter?

96
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:47,340
 Yeah, she's super, too.

97
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:50,340
 Yeah, come to think of it, he does have a daughter.

98
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:51,340
 Yeah.

99
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:52,340
 So, would you?

100
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:56,340
 Henry, I don't think a recommendation from your father would carry much weight.

101
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,340
 No?

102
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:00,340
 Well, how about a recommendation from Ms. Agleston?

103
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,340
 Your English teacher?

104
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,340
 No, you're right. That would be too much weight.

105
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:07,340
 Hey, are you out of the home?

106
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:12,680
 I'll be right there Homer. Thanks anyway, father. They get something you have to work out for yourself

107
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:18,920
 I guess so. Hi Homer. Can I have you spoken to Anita's father yet? No, I'm just sort of making plans to listen

108
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:25,200
 I just found out something interesting that might interest you what mr. Swanson has a job open in a supermarket

109
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:31,440
 He has don't you think that's interesting? You mean I should take the job Henry? I think you've hit on a wonderful idea

110
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:37,440
 I've not wait a minute. Don't you see? Once you're a fellow co-worker, Mr. Swanson's, how can he refuse you?

111
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,440
 Would you mind telling me why you're so interested?

112
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:47,440
 Well, Geraldine told me her father said she could go with me, only if Anita's father lets her go with you.

113
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,440
 What? So Henry, don't you see? You'll really be making an impression for both of us.

114
00:04:51,440 --> 00:05:00,440
 [Music]

115
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:03,440
 Alice, have you seen that old briefcase of mine anywhere?

116
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:08,440
 No. And Sam, I'm just wondering if you should have let Henry go down and apply for that job.

117
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,440
 Alice, he had his heart set on it. What could I say?

118
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,440
 Well, if he was so anxious to work, why couldn't you give him a job in your office?

119
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,440
 That's exactly what I offered to do.

120
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,440
 What did he say?

121
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:22,440
 Unless I gave Mr. Swanson a job to it, wouldn't do him any good.

122
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,440
 I don't understand.

123
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,440
 Who does? I could have sworn I put that briefcase right here by my desk.

124
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,440
 I thought you discarded that old briefcase.

125
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,440
 I did, but to handle all my new one broke,

126
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,440
 and I'm using the old one, meanwhile.

127
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,440
 Have you seen it?

128
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,440
 It must be around somewhere.

129
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,440
 I should hope so. I've got some very important papers in it

130
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,440
 that I need for this afternoon.

131
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,440
 Sam, do you think Henry was dressed warmly enough?

132
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,440
 I'll just forget Henry for a minute,

133
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,440
 and let's find that briefcase.

134
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:00,800
 See Henry there's the sign help once yeah, how do I look Homer fine?

135
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,640
 What have you gotten that briefcase nothing?

136
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:07,160
 It's just for the interview Homer to give me a business like air. Oh

137
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:11,800
 It's an old one of my fathers. Come on. Let's go in and see mr. Swanson

138
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,800
 There he is right the checkout camera. Yeah

139
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:26,080
 Oh mr. Swanson yes, what can I do for you? I came in about the job you have in the window

140
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,080
 Oh, oh, one second. Charlie, take over here will you?

141
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,080
 Oh, okay, Mrs. Watson.

142
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,080
 No, just step over here.

143
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,080
 Yes, sir.

144
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,080
 You want a job, huh?

145
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,080
 Yes, sir.

146
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,080
 Yes, sir.

147
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,080
 Oh, wait a minute. Are you both applying for this job?

148
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,080
 Oh, no. Not me.

149
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,080
 What are you doing here?

150
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,080
 Wait. I'm just doing a little shopping.

151
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,080
 Shopping. How much are these cookies?

152
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,080
 23 cents.

153
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,080
 For how many boxes?

154
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,080
 One.

155
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,080
 Well, I'll just be shopping around.

156
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,080
 What's your name, son?

157
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,080
 Henry, Henry Aldridge.

158
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,080
 Mm-hmm, never worked before?

159
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,080
 Oh, sure, quite a few places.

160
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,080
 What was your last place of employment?

161
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:11,080
 Well, that was for quite a prominent attorney.

162
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,080
 What's his name?

163
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,080
 Does his name matter?

164
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,080
 Of course.

165
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,080
 It was a Mr. Samuel Aldridge.

166
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,080
 Oh, a relative.

167
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,080
 In a way.

168
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,080
 Where else did you work?

169
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:29,080
 Well, odd jobs. I've done quite a few odd jobs.

170
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,080
 Who for?

171
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,080
 Who for?

172
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,080
 Well, mostly, uh...

173
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:36,080
 Do you know a Mrs. Haldry jump on Elm Street?

174
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,080
 Another relative.

175
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,080
 Yeah, sorta.

176
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,080
 Mm-hmm.

177
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,080
 Well, son, I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll give you a trial.

178
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:49,080
 You will? Oh, boy. Thanks, Mr. Swanson. Thanks a lot.

179
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,480
 Put your briefcase down and slip on this apron.

180
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,480
 Yes, sir.

181
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:56,480
 Now, as an employee of Swanson's market, I want you to keep two things in mind.

182
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:00,680
 First and foremost, there's our motto, Swanson's self-service, hell-service.

183
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,380
 Yes, sir.

184
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:04,080
 Swanson, Swanson's swans-- is this a Swanson swells--

185
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,080
 s--

186
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,480
 gee, that's a swell motto.

187
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:07,980
 Yes, sir.

188
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:09,380
 Tells the story.

189
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:11,980
 Person who thought that up certainly was clever.

190
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:13,080
 I suppose that was you.

191
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,680
 How much do you-- how much do you-- I mean Mr. Swanson?

192
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,480
 No, Mrs. Swanson.

193
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:17,980
 Oh.

194
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:20,140
 Now, secondly, you see that sign?

195
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,140
 Think?

196
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:24,620
 No, it may not sound like much, but just think about it.

197
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:25,620
 Now?

198
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:26,620
 What?

199
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:29,740
 You want me to think about it now?

200
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:30,740
 All the time.

201
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:33,420
 You keep thinking and you'll avoid costly mistakes and accidents.

202
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:34,420
 Think.

203
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:35,420
 That's pretty good.

204
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:36,420
 I'm going to write that down, T.

205
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:37,420
 That isn't necessary.

206
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:42,860
 Well, as far as I'm concerned, Mr. Swanson, I couldn't stop thinking if I tried.

207
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,140
 Yes, sir.

208
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:47,500
 No matter what else I'm thinking about, I'm always thinking.

209
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,500
 Yes, sir.

210
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,500
 All right.

211
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,500
 Now, suppose you unpack these cartons of canned tomatoes.

212
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,500
 Yes, sir.

213
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,500
 Just stack them right there on the top shell.

214
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,500
 Yes, sir.

215
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,500
 Henry, you're working.

216
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,500
 Yeah, he's giving me a one day he's pre-trying.

217
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,500
 Boy, that soil.

218
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,500
 I knew you could do it.

219
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,500
 Well, so long.

220
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,500
 Wait a minute, Homer.

221
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,500
 Hand me these cans and help.

222
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,500
 What?

223
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,500
 Don't you feel Geraldine is what's stacking for?

224
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,500
 Well, okay.

225
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,500
 When you put it that way.

226
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,340
 Here.

227
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:19,840
 Henny, I think you're stacking them too high.

228
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,680
 - No, I'm not.

229
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,520
 - Yes, you are.

230
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,360
 It's teetering.

231
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,200
 - Looks perfectly straight to me.

232
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,720
 - Back up a little and you'll see.

233
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,280
 - It still looks okay.

234
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,480
 - Back up a little further.

235
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,320
 - Looks straight.

236
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,360
 - Further, straight.

237
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,200
 - Further.

238
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,320
 - Henry, look out!

239
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,580
 (clattering)

240
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:36,920
 Oh boy.

241
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,760
 - What happened?

242
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,520
 - You back tried into that stack of beer cans

243
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,000
 and here comes Mr. Swanson.

244
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,840
 - Oh boy.

245
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,280
 - So long him.

246
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:49,080
 You mean you're gonna leave me to face the music alone Henry from the look on mr.

247
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,600
 Swanson's face. I don't think there's gonna be much music

248
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,680
 I'll just be shopping around but home

249
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,180
 What is it what happened?

250
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:58,040
 Why you're it's nothing that can't be straight now mr. Swanson

251
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:03,240
 It's a good thing that beer comes in cans. Yes. It's too bad that ketchup doesn't

252
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:09,360
 Catch up where oh boy. Well, that'll come off the walls pretty easily. Don't you think?

253
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,120
 Think don't you?

254
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:17,180
 Suppose you take off that apron. You mean I'm fired? Have you got a driver's license?

255
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:17,640
 Yes, sir

256
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:21,820
 I'd like you to take some deliveries out on the truck on the truck say that would be swell

257
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:26,080
 I only shouldn't I clean up the ketchup first? No, I think you'll be a lot safer on the outside

258
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:32,880
 Hear the keys. Oh, mr. Swanson. Have we got a Henry Aldrich here? We certainly have what is it?

259
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,800
 He's wanted on the phone. I am

260
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,740
 Gee was who would be calling me here go ahead and answer it. Hey, while you're on the phone

261
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:44,760
 I'll be taking you orders and I thought you were going you thought I'd leave you in a spot like that

262
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,340
 Where are the keys to the truck?

263
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:53,280
 You're gonna take this call Aldrich. Yes, sir. Okay. Homer. You'll be loading the truck right there on the counter. Thank you

264
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:58,660
 Hello hello, Henry. This is your father. Hello father. How's everything going? Why?

265
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:05,820
 It's going father. Good Henry. I don't suppose you know anything about it, but frankly I've looked everywhere and I'm desperate

266
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:09,140
 You didn't see that old briefcase of mine. Anywhere did you well?

267
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:10,900
 Do you need it?

268
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:15,780
 Yes, there's some papers in it that I've got to have for a very important conference over in Abbott City this afternoon.

269
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:16,680
 Have you seen it?

270
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:22,280
 As a matter of fact, Father, I know just where I can lay my hands on it, and suppose I bring it down to your office.

271
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,740
 Fine, and the sooner the better, Henry.

272
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:25,140
 Yes, Father, goodbye.

273
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:27,480
 Okay, Aldrich, suppose you get started on those orders.

274
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:32,080
 Yes, sir, and Mr. Swanson, would you reach under the counter and hand me that briefcase, please?

275
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,740
 There's no briefcase back here.

276
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:37,240
 What? Oh, boy, but I put it right behind there with my coat.

277
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,040
 Well, it's not here. Now get started.

278
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:39,840
 But that briefcase...

279
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,740
 Now look, son, do you want to work or just talk?

280
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:42,240
 But you see...

281
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,040
 Maybe I better put that sign back in the window.

282
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,240
 Well, I'm going, Mr. Swanson. I'm going.

283
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,140
 Gee, I could swear I'd put that briefcase right here next to the coffee grinder.

284
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:51,640
 Well, I'm going, Mr. Swanson.

285
00:11:51,640 --> 00:12:06,640
 Now, Homer, have you got that stray shoe or hen?

286
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:10,900
 While you're making this delivery, I'll go back to the store and see if I can find the briefcase.

287
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:14,800
 And remember, don't let Mr. Swanson catch sight of the truck.

288
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,240
 Don't worry, I won't. And I'll come right back here and pick you up.

289
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,240
 Soooooooow.

290
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,940
 Hello.

291
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:24,640
 Good morning, Swanson's self-service, self-service.

292
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,340
 I'm from Swanson's.

293
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,840
 Oh, come right in.

294
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,240
 Just bring it right into the kitchen, please.

295
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,040
 Yes, ma'am.

296
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,540
 Set it right down on this chair.

297
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:33,240
 Yes, ma'am.

298
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,940
 Oh, uh, just a minute.

299
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:36,860
 Are you sure this is my order?

300
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:38,260
 It's got your name on it.

301
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:40,620
 Yes, but I didn't order this briefcase.

302
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:41,500
 What?

303
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,100
 Oh boy, I've been looking all over for that.

304
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,420
 Well, goodbye.

305
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:47,740
 Well, look, before you leave,

306
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:49,740
 I wonder if I could ask a favor of you.

307
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:50,780
 Gee, sure.

308
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:53,420
 So I had some self service, self service, you know.

309
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:55,340
 No, I didn't know.

310
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:56,860
 It's our motto.

311
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:00,540
 Oh, well, do you see that home freezer over by the sink?

312
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:01,380
 Yes, ma'am.

313
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,820
 It was just delivered this morning,

314
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:07,560
 I had the men put it next to my stove. Now I realize I can't get the oven door open.

315
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:12,640
 Ha! Is that right? Would it be too much trouble if I asked you to move it over by the sink

316
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:17,300
 for me? Nothing's too much for a science and self-service, which sells service. A new

317
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:24,220
 freezer, huh? Isn't it lovely? I guess it holds quite a bit, huh? Oh my goodness, yes.

318
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:28,740
 You can get a whole side of beef and over 200 pounds of fruit and vegetables in there.

319
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:29,740
 Yeah, is that right?

320
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:30,740
 Yeah.

321
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:33,740
 Boy, that's going to mean a big order for some store, isn't it?

322
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:34,740
 I guess so.

323
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:38,620
 Well, ma'am, I don't want to influence your decision, but wouldn't you prefer to buy

324
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:42,580
 it in a place like Swanson's where the employees keep thinking all day long?

325
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:45,580
 As a matter of fact, I probably will buy it there.

326
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:46,580
 Really?

327
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:50,540
 Well, I wouldn't necessarily expect you to tell Mr. Swanson I recommended you, but that

328
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:52,540
 is unless you really feel you want to.

329
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,340
 Well, I'll be glad to tell him that.

330
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:55,340
 You will?

331
00:13:55,340 --> 00:14:01,340
 Oh boy, if you do that, Mrs. Billings, there's no question who I'll be ice skating with next weekend.

332
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,340
 I beg your pardon?

333
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:04,340
 Over by the rink, uh, sink, huh?

334
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:05,340
 Yeah.

335
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:07,340
 I'll have it over there in a jiffy.

336
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:12,340
 Is it very heavy?

337
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:14,340
 T-wiz, no.

338
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:21,340
 You're sure you don't mind.

339
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:23,340
 Glad to do it.

340
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:26,340
 [groaning]

341
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:29,340
 [groaning]

342
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:30,340
 How's that?

343
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:33,340
 I think it almost moved that time.

344
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,340
 [laughing]

345
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,340
 I just need more leverage.

346
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:37,340
 Yeah.

347
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:38,340
 [groaning]

348
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:39,340
 There!

349
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:40,340
 I'm getting it now!

350
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:43,340
 Oh, wait a minute. I think you better--

351
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,340
 [groaning]

352
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:45,340
 That's okay, guys!

353
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:47,340
 Did you turn the lights off?

354
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:49,340
 Don't you see what you did?

355
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:51,340
 You pulled the cord right out of the freezer.

356
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:55,540
 of the freezer. Oh boy, guess I forgot to disconnect the plug. Oh and now you've

357
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:59,820
 probably short-circuited the whole house. Wait, isn't there something they do with

358
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:05,860
 a penny? Not these days. No, just don't stand there, Sonny. Do something.

359
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:17,780
 [Music]

360
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:20,780
 Oh, mister, you and the truck there.

361
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:21,780
 Ah, yes, honey.

362
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:26,780
 You haven't seen a couple of dozen oranges laying around in the street, have you?

363
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:30,780
 Oh, she was. They dropped off my truck somewhere around here.

364
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:32,780
 Well, thanks.

365
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,780
 Oh, oh, honey, just a second.

366
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:35,780
 Yeah?

367
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:37,780
 Would you mind giving me a push? I think my battery's gone.

368
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:42,780
 Well, I'd like to, but I couldn't find the briefcase, and now on top of that I've lost the oranges,

369
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:44,780
 and he's probably wondering what's keeping me.

370
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:49,780
 It'll only take a second and I was supposed to deliver those chickens a half an hour ago.

371
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:50,780
 Chicken?

372
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:51,780
 Yeah, I'm like truck.

373
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:52,780
 Just take a second.

374
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:54,780
 Okay, I'll back up behind your truck.

375
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:55,780
 Yeah.

376
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,780
 No, wait till I get in now.

377
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:00,780
 Just keep rolling, fly away, and then cut away.

378
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:01,780
 Okay.

379
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:02,780
 Let it go.

380
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:04,780
 All right, keep going.

381
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:07,780
 No, no, no, wait, wait, hold it.

382
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:08,780
 What?

383
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:09,780
 Hold it!

384
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:10,780
 My crates are starting to...

385
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:11,780
 Hold it!

386
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:12,780
 No!

387
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:13,780
 No!

388
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:15,780
 Oh no, no!

389
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:17,780
 What happened? What happened?

390
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:19,780
 Look! Oh boy!

391
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:21,780
 Look at my chickens! They're all over the place!

392
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,780
 You never mind the chickens?

393
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:25,780
 Whose bumper is that laying on the ground?

394
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:39,780
 If you think Henry and Homer have problems,

395
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:41,780
 just listen to what Willie Marshall has to say.

396
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:42,780
 to say.

397
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:47,020
 Problems, problems, I'll say I got problems. My folks go out nights, I have to stay home

398
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:51,500
 as babysitter for my younger brother, Gulliver. But my folks have people in nights, I have

399
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:55,900
 to entertain them playing hearts and flowers on the piano. He gets a little guy, I can't

400
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,900
 even enjoy his dinner.

401
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:02,380
 Cheer up, Willie. Just ask your mother to have Jell-O for dessert and you'll feel swell,

402
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:05,980
 whatever happens. And say, have you folks heard about the new quick setting way to make

403
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:10,620
 Jell-O? You know, you get beautiful finished Jell-O desserts in just about one hour. Now

404
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:13,980
 Now all you do is dissolve the jello in one cup of hot water.

405
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:18,220
 Then add one cup of ice cubes or crushed ice filling the cup to the brim with water.

406
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:22,020
 Stir until the ice melts thoroughly then chill firm in the refrigerator.

407
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:27,340
 And adjust about one short hour there's a beautiful jello dessert already to serve.

408
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:30,580
 Try a jello treat this new quick setting way tomorrow.

409
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:34,080
 Remember, it's jello for red letter desserts.

410
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,820
 (dramatic music)

411
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:43,060
 And now getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldrich,

412
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:45,260
 it's later the same day, and the scene opens

413
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:47,980
 in a phone booth somewhere in Centerville.

414
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:48,820
 - Hello?

415
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,900
 Is this Harrison's electric shop?

416
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:51,740
 - That's right.

417
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:53,060
 - Well, I don't know if fellow who just bought

418
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:54,340
 some fuses there.

419
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:55,340
 - Yeah, who?

420
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,300
 Speak up, Sean.

421
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,340
 - The fellow from Swanson's market.

422
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:00,640
 Oh, you're the fellow who just bought some fuses.

423
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,240
 Well, what's wrong now?

424
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,540
 Were those very good quality fuses?

425
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:05,540
 Well, sure.

426
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:08,840
 Well, I'll tell you every time I put one in, it blows right out again.

427
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,940
 Well, there's nothing wrong with those fuses.

428
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:12,940
 You still got a short somewhere.

429
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:16,440
 I told you you should never fool around with those pennies in the fuse box.

430
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,840
 That wasn't my idea.

431
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,940
 It's illegal, too.

432
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:19,740
 I know.

433
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:23,040
 Besides, you can get terrible damage resulting from that.

434
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:26,540
 Well, maybe you better come over and take a look at it yourself.

435
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:27,740
 Well, I can't right now.

436
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,540
 But he was not in a terrible spot.

437
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:30,940
 I don't want to lose a good customer,

438
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:33,740
 but on the other hand, what's Mr. Swanson going to say?

439
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:34,240
 Who?

440
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,240
 Mr. Swanson, Mr. Swanson.

441
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:36,940
 Oh, yeah.

442
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:38,940
 Yeah, one of his fellows was in here a while ago

443
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,140
 and bought some fuses.

444
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:41,440
 Well, that was me.

445
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,240
 And so?

446
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,340
 Can't you please come over?

447
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:48,240
 Sorry, I won't be free for another hour, at least.

448
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,040
 But I'll tell you what you can do, meanwhile.

449
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:50,640
 What?

450
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,140
 You know where the fuse box is.

451
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:52,840
 Of course.

452
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,740
 OK.

453
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:54,840
 Open it up, see.

454
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:55,440
 Yeah.

455
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,940
 Take out all the fuses.

456
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:57,740
 Yeah.

457
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,940
 Be sure you got your main switch off.

458
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:00,540
 Yeah.

459
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:02,340
 Then you can put your pennies in.

460
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,340
 What?

461
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:05,140
 Now try to get over there as soon as I can.

462
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:05,940
 So long.

463
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,140
 But wait.

464
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:09,540
 I-- I also want to ask you--

465
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:13,040
 if I left an old briefcase when I was down there.

466
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,440
 Hello?

467
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,440
 Hello?

468
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,440
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

469
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:34,440
 Here's Chicky Chicky. Nice Chicky Chicky. Uncle Homer's not gonna hurt you.

470
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:42,440
 Chicky, won't you please come Uncle Homer. Now listen, Chicky, come down off that roof

471
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,440
 for all ring your darn little neck.

472
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:53,840
 But operator I've been calling Swanson supermarket for over an hour.

473
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,140
 How could it be busy that long?

474
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:57,240
 I'm sorry sir, the line is busy.

475
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,040
 Operator is terribly important that I get in touch with him.

476
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,140
 Can't you do something?

477
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:07,640
 Hello, hello, are you still there?

478
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:12,240
 Mrs. Ferguson, believe me, your order went out of here two hours ago.

479
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,940
 I wish I knew, but here's what I'm doing. I've taken two of my regular men off the

480
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:21,360
 checkout counter and they're making the orders up all over again. Yes, you should

481
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,820
 have your order within the hour. Good-bye.

482
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:26,760
 Mrs. Swanson, are you going to check me out or orange?

483
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:31,500
 All right, all right, I'm coming. Hello Swanson's your order will be there inside

484
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:35,460
 of an hour. Mrs. Swanson, Mrs. Jones is raising a fuss over at the meat counter.

485
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:37,080
 She says you promised to save her a chicken.

486
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,440
 For the butcher tell her our delivery was three hours late.

487
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,440
 Yes, but Mrs. Jones...

488
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,440
 Mr. Swanson, look at that mob at the checkout counter.

489
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,440
 They're going crazy.

490
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,440
 Oh, good grief. Let's get over there.

491
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,440
 Let's get going. I got it in the mail.

492
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,440
 All right, we'll take care of everybody. Just be patient.

493
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:57,440
 Now, let's see, Mrs. Mead. Two cans of baked beans.

494
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,440
 Excuse me. You'll have to wait your turn in line.

495
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:03,440
 Oh, I'm not shopping. I'm the electrician. Where's your fuse box?

496
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,440
 Listen, I can't be bothered with that now.

497
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,440
 All right, all right. We're doing our best.

498
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,720
 The fuse box is in the cellar.

499
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,720
 Okay.

500
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,560
 Now where was I, Mrs. Mead?

501
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,920
 Oh yes, two cans of baked beans.

502
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,720
 Now just a minute, Mrs. Swan came.

503
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,720
 Excuse me, Mrs. Mead.

504
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,840
 Swanson's your order will be there soon, goodbye.

505
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:23,480
 Wait, I'd like to order some milk, please.

506
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,880
 Yes, ma'am. How many quarts?

507
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,680
 Just one. And would it be possible to have it delivered?

508
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,680
 Yes, ma'am.

509
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,920
 Swanson's self-service, self-s--

510
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,160
 Oh, come on, Ed.

511
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:33,680
 Wait a minute.

512
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:36,080
 Madam, where would you like that delivered?

513
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:41,240
 Well, that all depends. In what part of the store is Henry Aldrich working now?

514
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,080
 What's that?

515
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:48,380
 Henry Aldrich, I'm his mother and I know this is a lot of trouble for you, but I like the milk delivered to him.

516
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:49,680
 Hello?

517
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,380
 I'm here.

518
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:54,080
 And when you please tell him not to go up the milk?

519
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:59,180
 Yes, ma'am. And when I see him, I'm going to tell him a few other things. Goodbye.

520
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:03,680
 Now let's see Mrs. Mead. Two cans of baked beans.

521
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:07,680
 Mr. Swanson, that's the third time you rang up those beans.

522
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:11,680
 Huh? Oh, Mr. Swanson. Mr. Swanson, come quick.

523
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,680
 What now? There's been an accident. What kind of an accident?

524
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:17,680
 Four shopping wagons crashed at the corner of Oak Meal and Salt Flakes.

525
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:21,680
 Oh, no. And the place looks like it was hit by a blizzard.

526
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:24,680
 Mr. Swanson, Mr. Swanson. You? Where have you been all this time?

527
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:29,680
 Mr. Swanson, I can explain everything you see. Never mind the explanation. What did you do with all those orders?

528
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:32,680
 Well, you see all of it. Oh, gee whiz. What did you do with that briefcase?

529
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:36,720
 I can explain everything you see never mind him. What about those orders? Oh look here, sir

530
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,160
 Will you keep out of this this boy works for me, sir?

531
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:45,280
 What's so happens that he's my son? Oh, he's your son. Well, let me tell you something

532
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,880
 All right, all right, you'll all be

533
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:55,720
 What happened who turned out the lights? I'm not going to let him add my bill in the dog

534
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:58,840
 Now where everybody?

535
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:05,040
 Please don't move around in the dock. You're knocking the merchandise over.

536
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:19,200
 Is that you, Mary?

537
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,440
 Now it's me, mother.

538
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,320
 It's...

539
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,480
 It's father here.

540
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,520
 No, dear.

541
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,320
 And what are you doing home from the store at this hour?

542
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,160
 I'll tell you.

543
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:33,560
 The store closed a little early today.

544
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,840
 Really? Why?

545
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,360
 For repairs.

546
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:42,240
 And I think they'll be closed tomorrow too.

547
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,400
 But when they reopen next week,

548
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,400
 you ought to get down there.

549
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,560
 What for? Mr. Swanson's going to give stuff away.

550
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:54,640
 Free? Practically. For every item you buy,

551
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,600
 you can have two of them just by paying another penny.

552
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,600
 Well, what's he doing that for?

553
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,600
 He said it's the only way he hopes to get back the public's good will.

554
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,600
 Has...

555
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,600
 His father cold at all?

556
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:09,600
 Yes, he said he was going to drive over to Abbott City.

557
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:13,600
 And Henry, I think it was very careless of you to miss place his briefcase.

558
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:19,600
 I know it was, Mother, but the first thing to Maram going over my entire route and try to turn it up.

559
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:23,600
 Well, that's funny. That sounds like your father driving into the garage now.

560
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,600
 Oh, boy.

561
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,600
 Mother, I'm going up to my room for a while.

562
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:29,600
 And if Homer calls, I'll take it on the upstairs phone.

563
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,600
 You're not coming down at all?

564
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,600
 Not for a few days.

565
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:37,600
 And incidentally, if anyone in the Swanson family calls me,

566
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,600
 I've gone away for the duration.

567
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,600
 Oh dear.

568
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,600
 Oh, good evening, Sam.

569
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,600
 My, that was a quick trip to Abbott City.

570
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,600
 I didn't go to Abbott City.

571
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,600
 I thought you said you were.

572
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,600
 I thought you were.

573
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,600
 I thought you were.

574
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,600
 I thought you said you were.

575
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,600
 I started, Alice. I just didn't get there.

576
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,600
 What happened? I'll take your code.

577
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,600
 Thank you.

578
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,600
 Well, as I was driving along Main Street...

579
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,600
 Yes?

580
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,600
 You won't believe this.

581
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,600
 Well, believe what?

582
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,600
 As I was driving along Main Street...

583
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,600
 No, it's too ridiculous.

584
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:17,600
 Sam, for heaven's sake, tell me what happened

585
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,600
 as you were driving along Main Street?

586
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:24,600
 Well, a chicken blew in my window and laid an egg in my lap.

587
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:29,600
 It's unbelievable. What's a chicken doing on Main Street?

588
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:35,600
 Anyway, I hit another car. Oh, nothing serious, but I decided against driving any further.

589
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:39,600
 I'll get that. They're probably calling from Abbot City to find out what happened to me.

590
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:43,600
 I'll get the door.

591
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,600
 Hello? Speaking.

592
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:50,600
 No, I didn't forget, I had an accident on the way over there.

593
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:55,600
 Well, as I was driving along Main Street, it's really nothing that would interest you.

594
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,600
 You want to meet tomorrow instead?

595
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:02,600
 Well, the only trouble is that my briefcase containing the papers has gone astray and I don't know if--

596
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,600
 Wait!

597
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,600
 Oh, just a minute. What is it, Alice?

598
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:09,600
 Look, but some woman just brought over. She said Henry left it at her house this morning.

599
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,600
 My briefcase. Let me have it.

600
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,600
 Sam, don't bend it, it'll break.

601
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,600
 What? What happened to it?

602
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,000
 It seems it's been at her freezer all day.

603
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,920
 Oh, I haven't said so.

604
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:20,720
 Oh, hello.

605
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,480
 Look, I've just found my briefcase.

606
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,480
 How about meeting the day after tomorrow?

607
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,840
 Well, I don't know about tomorrow.

608
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:29,400
 It may not be defrosted by then.

609
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,920
 I'll explain when I see you.

610
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:31,920
 Goodbye.

611
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,360
 Anybody home?

612
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,600
 Is that you, Homer?

613
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,840
 Yes, Mrs. Aldrich.

614
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,920
 I'm afraid you can't see, Henry, now.

615
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,920
 Oh, this isn't a social call.

616
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:42,120
 Mr. Aldrich, I need some legal advice.

617
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,160
 Yes, what kind?

618
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,440
 Two kinds.

619
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:48,760
 In the first place, a store sells you iron glue, but it doesn't glue iron.

620
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,360
 Can I sue them?

621
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,040
 What did you try to glue with it?

622
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,080
 A bumper.

623
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,520
 Yeah.

624
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:57,160
 Well, Homer, don't you think that's a little ridiculous?

625
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,120
 It is.

626
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:00,040
 Send that briefcase is beginning to drip.

627
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:03,400
 Oh, I wonder if we better put it in the refrigerator.

628
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:07,000
 You're gonna put a briefcase in the refrigerator?

629
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,360
 Yes, why?

630
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:11,160
 And trying to glue a bumper is ridiculous?

631
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,760
 What's your other problem over?

632
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:18,500
 Oh, yeah. Well, if I'm nice enough to give another fellow a push,

633
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:22,200
 and then I'm nice enough to help him chase his chickens, can he sue me?

634
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,100
 What's that?

635
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,100
 I'm not making myself clear.

636
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:27,300
 No. Alice, can we eat soon?

637
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:30,500
 Of course, dear. Would you like some nice vegetable cutlets?

638
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:31,600
 Vegetable cutlets.

639
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,000
 The Swanson's didn't deliver my order either.

640
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,200
 What vegetable cutlets?

641
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,000
 Mrs. Aldrich, yes, Homer.

642
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,600
 Could I interest you in some nice chickens?

643
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,200
 Chicken?

644
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:43,440
 Yes, ma'am, I've got them right outside on the porch.

645
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,280
 And the beautiful part of it is, they're half plucked.

646
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:49,440
 (audience applauding)

647
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:59,120
 - Boy, Homer, we certainly went about getting a girl

648
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,960
 for that skating party the hard way.

649
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,280
 - Boy, Henry Alson.

650
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,200
 - And all we actually have to do is go to the telephone

651
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,640
 and call someone just like that.

652
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,480
 - Sure, Henry.

653
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,960
 - So we call, Homer, come on, pal, think.

654
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:13,520
 Think, think, listen Henry, after all we've been through with that word today,

655
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:18,480
 let's just relax and let second nature take its core. You mean good old Gladys and Agnes?

656
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:21,680
 Sure. Sure. Sure, that's a happy ending for our boys,

657
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:25,840
 just the way Jello is always a happy ending for any meal. Because everybody goes for a

658

 gay, colorful Jello. In any of those six delicious flavors, strawberry, raspberry, cherry,

 orange, lemon, and lime, all six have delectable fruit-rich goodness,

 wonderful, fresh-tasting flavor that reminds you of the ripe juicy fruit,

661
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,320
 And there are dozens of glamorous ways to fix jello.

662

 Have it riced or cut into sparkling cubes,
