00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 Thank you for this time, excuse me for men in the armed forces of the United Nations,

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 the special service division of the War Department of the United States

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 presents a re-broadcast of one of America's most popular radio programs,

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 the Aldrich family.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 And we'll be coming, mother.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:53,720
 Next to actually being young again,

8
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:59,520
 There's no better way to recap through that feeling than to know a teenage boy like Henry Olgrich.

9
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,720
 Or he acts just like you used to when you were that age.

10
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,720
 And so his troubles become your father.

11
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,920
 The scene opens at the Olgrich breakfast table.

12
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,520
 And he has led us to you, Sam.

13
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,520
 And another for you.

14
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,520
 Thank you, Alice.

15
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,720
 Henry has won for you.

16
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,120
 For me, mother, for me.

17
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:18,320
 Alice has an advertisement from some of her thoughts, Blimmer Lake.

18
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,120
 Really?

19
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:22,220
 Father, I certainly hope we aren't going away anyplace this summer.

20
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:23,320
 Wait, certainly or not.

21
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,820
 and I agree with both of you.

22
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:26,720
 Oh, you know what I'm gonna do.

23
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,700
 This thing is a matter.

24
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:29,820
 Henry, what's the matter?

25
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:30,660
 Nothing, mother.

26
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:32,460
 I was just reading a sweater.

27
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:33,900
 No, it really did you care.

28
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,260
 Yeah, you were only.

29
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:36,940
 Huh.

30
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:39,600
 Father, what about working at any of the rest of this sweater?

31
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,740
 Could you make out this word right here?

32
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:44,440
 Well, I, um, that's Cindy.

33
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,040
 Oh, yes, of course.

34
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,140
 I thought it was friendly.

35
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:47,980
 Mother!

36
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:48,820
 Yes, Mary.

37
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:49,980
 I'm gonna help her, maybe this morning.

38
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:50,820
 No, dear.

39
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,520
 Oh, oh, you got letter from?

40
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,320
 - Why, it's just hardly anything.

41
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,040
 - Mary, will you please stop trying to read over my shoulder?

42
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,000
 - Every all I was doing was innocently looking to see

43
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 whether you'd open one of mine that is by mistake.

44
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 - Well, I haven't.

45
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,840
 You don't even know who this was from.

46
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,680
 - Hi, Mary.

47
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,000
 Are you a few requests for it?

48
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,440
 - Oh, where did you come from?

49
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,080
 - Johnson, tell me, tell me, tell me.

50
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,080
 - Hi, Mr. O, which one of these are five?

51
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:12,920
 - What, then?

52
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,560
 - Go ahead, it has one next to you.

53
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,840
 - Oh, but when you please take that bag

54
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,680
 from under my nose.

55
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,000
 - Oh, excuse me.

56
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,320
 Oh, I couldn't eat a little.

57
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,920
 Henry, you look me as your egg.

58
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,000
 We have a little piece of flood down the side.

59
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,680
 Mrs. Aller, you may know.

60
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,520
 - Oh.

61
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,520
 - Mother, could I speak with Homer confidently

62
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,520
 out in the hole with (indistinct)

63
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,480
 Do you have any thought of your breakfast?

64
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,960
 Mother, my engine's hot.

65
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:35,440
 Say, I mean, it's not cold enough for me to eat my,

66
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,720
 I'd like to talk to Homer about this,

67
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,080
 about a certain matter.

68
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,480
 And will you be right there?

69
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,040
 Yes, Mother, I'll be out of here in the hole

70
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,560
 for exactly two minutes or not.

71
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,880
 One second long.

72
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,720
 - What is it, Mary?

73
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,040
 - Is it a report card turned?

74
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,160
 - Oh, my hooky.

75
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,000
 - So what?

76
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,840
 - I'm a girl.

77
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,680
 - A whole weekie.

78
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:55,680
 I don't know. What do you mean you don't know? I know if you have the one out of the city.

79
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:01,680
 What do you say? Dear Henry Olga, I suppose you think I am very bold right in your

80
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,680
 boring letter like this, but I'm simply so bored I can't help it.

81
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,680
 Or what's the matter with it? I guess you know your friend Nancy Adams who was visiting here,

82
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,680
 and yesterday he happened to film in her school yearbook, and I said, "Who's that

83
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,940
 Who's that picture?

84
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:18,060
 He said, "Why that's can reality."

85
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,680
 And I said, "It's such a boring day.

86
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,100
 I'm going to write to you."

87
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,860
 And he said, "All right, I dare you."

88
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:25,300
 And I said, "All right, and here I am.

89
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,140
 What's that?"

90
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:28,500
 "All go on probably no way before doing it."

91
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,500
 "Can we let you down?"

92
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,260
 "Oh, will you please take your hands off?"

93
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,660
 All I want to do is read it.

94
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:34,340
 In the first place, Homer,

95
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,900
 some of it is confident leading some more.

96
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,700
 Leading some more.

97
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,740
 He says, "You could certainly be glad, Henry.

98
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:44,020
 You don't live in this boring place.

99
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:49,780
 It's friendly. I mean, I can hardly wait until summer comes, and we've got a beautiful

100
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:53,100
 light cat for two when there is something doing every minute.

101
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,820
 Who are you going to be this summer?

102
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,460
 Yes, mother.

103
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:59,180
 Yes, mother.

104
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:02,980
 Can I be eating the rest of this?

105
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:06,020
 Public property.

106
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,980
 I'm coming right now, mother.

107
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:12,820
 And boy, mother, what do you think your father said a little while ago was a good

108
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:17,420
 idea what he said about blood Henry about ongoing away this summer when did I say

109
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:19,380
 we were going away I thought you said

110
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:25,300
 see father those things are places going boring in the summer sorry I don't do

111
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:28,580
 you like it here mother would see it it's what's

112
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:34,340
 and the summer I think we ought to go the right path but then they passed the

113
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,060
 You never heard of it.

114
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,060
 I'm Homer.

115
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:39,260
 I'm assuming it don't have anything.

116
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:40,660
 I could be looking around.

117
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:41,300
 No.

118
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,700
 Now, Henry Homer is your guest.

119
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:43,940
 You go find him a magazine.

120
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:46,220
 Yes, well, we'll get it for him, either way.

121
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:48,180
 And mother, it's like past the two.

122
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,340
 There's something doing practically every minute.

123
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:52,580
 Well, there's nothing wrong with our whole life here.

124
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:54,980
 Hey Henry, let me see just one more page of it.

125
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:57,260
 OK, Homer, it's just promise not to handle.

126
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:57,900
 Where were we?

127
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,140
 At like past the two.

128
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:00,340
 Oh, yeah.

129
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:01,420
 Here's a good part.

130
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:02,940
 The way this was good.

131
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:05,640
 It is raining out and has been all day.

132
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,040
 The fact it's been raining most of this week.

133
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,740
 Is it raining in Centerville?

134
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,300
 Isn't it seeing this?

135
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,440
 If there's one thing I find boring,

136
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,200
 it's a sit indoors all day with nothing to do when it's raining.

137
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,360
 That's very interesting.

138
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,900
 - Hi, Kathleen Anderson.

139
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,440
 Why don't you want a telephone?

140
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,960
 - Oh, me, Mary.

141
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,320
 Oh, well, hello, I can't talk with her.

142
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,880
 I'm very busy right now.

143
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,720
 - Hold on, Henry.

144
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,840
 Why do you keep stopping?

145
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,680
 - Why?

146
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,680
 - She goes on and says,

147
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,680
 Naturally, I am asking you all about yourself.

148
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,240
 And Nancy tell me your very interesting.

149
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,400
 Do you please promise to write?

150
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,400
 Please, oh, please, oh, please.

151
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,240
 Oh, boy.

152
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,160
 I hope I have not bore you.

153
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:48,760
 As ever-- as ever in this journey, yes?

154
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,640
 Homer, can you make that first name now?

155
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,920
 Let's see.

156
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,000
 I can figure out the last name, OK?

157
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,680
 You can.

158
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,280
 Yeah.

159
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,640
 Three-quarter.

160
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,800
 Three-quarter?

161
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,160
 That's what it looks like to me.

162
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:02,760
 Oh, there are two always in there. Could it be drop water?

163
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:07,260
 Well, I see what that middle letter is in the first name of Steve.

164
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:11,860
 See? Could it be Walter? Walter? Walter drop water.

165
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:13,860
 Why would a girl have that name?

166
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:17,660
 I can't see what it is. It's just as clear as day. It's Myrtle.

167
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:21,660
 Oh. Oh. Myrtle drop water.

168
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:24,960
 Can we turn it frankly? Do you think you want a right to her?

169
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,160
 Oh, no! It's because...

170
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,580
 Just because...

171
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:31,820
 And beside Coma that isn't old in the last name, it's an odd.

172
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:32,320
 Oh, why?

173
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,620
 It's drip water.

174
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:35,620
 Drip, seal or not drop?

175
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:37,620
 No wonder you had the wrong impression of it.

176
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,560
 Drip, drip, and then...

177
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,460
 Yes, mother!

178
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:43,560
 When you feed the last in the kitchen, get your father drink of water...

179
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,000
 A drink of...

180
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,960
 Who was that thing?

181
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:46,460
 Why?

182
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:47,820
 It's Myrtle Drinkwater.

183
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,560
 Isn't that a beautiful name?

184
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:53,560
 [Music]

185
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:57,060
 [Music]

186
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:01,060
 [Music]

187
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:05,060
 Sam, I don't like to bother you, but I do have something I like to talk over with you.

188
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,060
 Yes, but the trouble.

189
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:09,060
 Oh, it's about Henry. He's been so upset ever since he got another letter this morning.

190
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:13,060
 And about a half an hour ago, he asked whether I did anything he could have his allowance in clean.

191
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:14,060
 Come on, guys.

192
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:16,060
 Yes, Mary. Did you know Henry got another letter this morning?

193
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:19,060
 Yes, we know all about it. Mary, turn around.

194
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:22,060
 What's wrong? Here, I think you ought to go down to the hairdresser.

195
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:26,060
 Mother, I'll do it. She said that matter was from some loan company. Mary, what's that?

196
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:26,780
 What's that?

197
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,020
 What did you say with Palm Mary?

198
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,420
 A loan company in Avoc City.

199
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:31,220
 I saw it right up on top of the page.

200
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:33,340
 And then he came to me and asked if he could borrow some money.

201
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:34,340
 And he was all excited.

202
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:35,340
 Yes.

203
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:36,340
 Father.

204
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:37,340
 Then what do you say, does it matter?

205
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:39,300
 Come on, see you along for--

206
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,300
 Oh.

207
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,940
 Oh, hello, Mary.

208
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:42,700
 Hello, Mother.

209
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:43,540
 Hello.

210
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:44,540
 Hello.

211
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:48,540
 Well, this is nice that we can play together.

212
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:50,940
 We really film and get together.

213
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:51,740
 And right.

214
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:52,980
 Yes, Father.

215
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:54,580
 What was it you came in here to say?

216
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:56,880
 Boy, I'm trying to bother.

217
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,240
 Oh, boy, I was in the door.

218
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,520
 I knew that problem isn't--

219
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,260
 No, it isn't, mother.

220
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:01,480
 I think it's someone that's seen me.

221
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:04,200
 I'm sort of a business arrangement.

222
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,320
 Oh, my, how I tried to come in.

223
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,320
 What's the idea?

224
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,200
 What's what I did?

225
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,520
 I'm keeping your door locked.

226
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,240
 How do you expect your friends to come in?

227
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,600
 Wait, my father asked us to keep the rock every morning

228
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,000
 until he goes to the office.

229
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,560
 What's in home?

230
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,080
 I think that's a 35-10.

231
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:17,920
 Yes, dear.

232
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,840
 Now, where's the land?

233
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,240
 Why do you turn it to me?

234
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:20,740
 Oh, no.

235
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,280
 I didn't say I'd let you read it.

236
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,480
 I said, I'd read it to me.

237
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,040
 What did she say? What did she say?

238
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,720
 Don't push me, Loma.

239
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,600
 Because my dear head, oh boy,

240
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,800
 I received your 14-page letter and it was a wiz.

241
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,660
 Oh, I have a mind, Loma.

242
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:37,480
 I hope you'll excuse my losing my father's business,

243
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,600
 stationary, but my newspaper with this

244
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,320
 and every of the wiz hasn't come yet.

245
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,480
 You'll have me to describe myself,

246
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,400
 and I'll do the best I can.

247
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,280
 Although there are some things I can say

248
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:51,280
 because you would think I was terribly confused.

249
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,360
 First of all, I am five feet nine.

250
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,800
 Thomas, about to be nine.

251
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,960
 He was in the only five feet eight.

252
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,920
 I think you're quarter, Homer.

253
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,640
 Besides, I didn't know I had to say it was clear as day.

254
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,040
 Looks like a learning to me.

255
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:04,880
 Scoring.

256
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,680
 I am five feet two and have rather pleasing eyes, I think.

257
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:11,480
 Otherwise, you would at times, my eye lashes weren't quite

258
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:14,840
 so long because they were always somehow getting in my way.

259
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,160
 What did you have to do, Tom?

260
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,600
 And Thomas, that's a roughing.

261
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,360
 After the color of my eye,

262
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,860
 I was here to judge for yourself.

263
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,380
 Some boys say they are gray.

264
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:26,340
 Some boys say they are green.

265
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:27,340
 Let's do that.

266
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:29,300
 We can have your toys.

267
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:32,300
 Homer, lots of things say color and different lights.

268
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,140
 Where was I?

269
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:33,980
 Right here.

270
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,020
 What color were you having?

271
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:36,260
 Oh yes.

272
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:38,180
 As tonight here, which is black,

273
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:40,620
 I have recently had done into a feather cut.

274
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:43,140
 What does a whiz, even if I do say so?

275
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:43,980
 - Henry.

276
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:44,820
 - Yes, mother.

277
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:45,660
 Are you busy?

278
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:46,500
 - White.

279
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,120
 I'm carrying out a little transact

280
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,620
 and you might say with Homer.

281
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,920
 - Well, Mary, I stayed with you right now, mother.

282
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,080
 - Listen, here you have me for your convenience.

283
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:54,920
 - I'll be back.

284
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,960
 This is what you want for 35, friend.

285
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,800
 - Henry?

286
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,640
 - Yes, mother.

287
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,620
 - Dear, I just want you to know that if you really need money

288
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,840
 and would be willing to tell your father what you needed for,

289
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,000
 he might seem to be way greater helping you out.

290
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,840
 - Thanks.

291
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,840
 - Mother, I appreciate your bringing it up,

292
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,960
 but you've got so many things on your mind.

293
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,640
 I'd say you would be better than I just didn't bother you.

294
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,120
 - Well, if you're not, if I'm not gonna point

295
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,880
 with your head yesterday, someday this week,

296
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,880
 no, not at all.

297
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,280
 - You're Henry, pass me an attitude phone you again.

298
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,180
 She's in.

299
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:24,680
 She was our main Senate Bill girl, but just before it.

300
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,520
 - Henry.

301
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,400
 - You're a phone where I'm coming.

302
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,680
 Mary, are you going in the hands of her today?

303
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,560
 Hey, why don't you give a feather cut?

304
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,920
 Boy, that's hard to the wind.

305
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,080
 - A feather cut, Henry.

306
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,040
 I thought I let my hands go this way.

307
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:36,880
 - Henry.

308
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,840
 - I'm coming, Homer.

309
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,680
 Where was I?

310
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,880
 - She just got me a hand pool or something.

311
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,720
 You're crazy.

312
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,080
 You're where I stopped.

313
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:46,680
 But I think your idea of phoning me is a win.

314
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,880
 I'll probably be thrilled when I hear that old telephone ring.

315
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,380
 Your case or a murder drink water?

316
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:54,980
 You know, it's her new really drink water.

317
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:55,980
 Why not?

318
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:56,980
 Why?

319
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:58,780
 You think she could be partying again?

320
00:10:58,780 --> 00:10:59,980
 Now what's from Homer?

321
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:01,980
 What's that at the bottom of the page?

322
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,980
 I think it was I hadn't seen that.

323
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:04,980
 Huh.

324
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,980
 Instead of your phoning me,

325
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:10,380
 why don't I phone you if I never know where I'm going to be next?

326
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,680
 So I'll call you outside and take five of that.

327
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,980
 You need to leave my money and we'll give it back to you.

328
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:16,280
 No, Homer, I will not.

329
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:20,280
 Suppose he called me correct. Don't you think you expect me to be a gentleman?

330
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:23,880
 Well, if I were to keep it, can I be here when we call?

331
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,080
 No, Homer.

332
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,680
 Oh, I just think.

333
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:29,880
 Tomorrow I hear Myrtle's voice from the first time.

334
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:41,680
 - Santa, have you thought anything more about our going away this summer?

335
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,280
 - At least I thought we decided not to go.

336
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,080
 - Mother!

337
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:44,880
 - Yes, Henry!

338
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,320
 What time of a now?

339
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,960
 It's exactly what it very surprised.

340
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,320
 Thank you, Father.

341
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,840
 I'd like to take a cottage someplace for a couple of weeks.

342
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,120
 I'm sure I have no objection.

343
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,320
 Yeah, there's somebody.

344
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,640
 I can't remember who it was.

345
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,720
 They said something about Lake Pastor II being a nice place to go.

346
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,000
 Lake Pastor II?

347
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:01,920
 Somebody named it.

348
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,160
 In the last couple of days, he said it was wonderful.

349
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,720
 Father, are you enjoying your watch this ride?

350
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,600
 I'm positive.

351
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,720
 Would you please tell me why you asked what time it is every 60 seconds?

352
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,640
 The reason, Father, I was just waiting for it to be five o'clock.

353
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,940
 Henry, why do you have your new Bluetooth on?

354
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:19,340
 Well, he wouldn't think I got that on.

355
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,640
 This is a phone phone, oh boy.

356
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,640
 Henry, good luck.

357
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,640
 You was looking back here, dear man.

358
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,140
 Henry.

359
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:26,040
 I'm sorry, Father.

360
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,340
 I'll pick it up when I come back.

361
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:28,540
 Father, just say where you are.

362
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,840
 Please, I beg of you.

363
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,140
 Henry, what's the matter with you?

364
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:32,640
 Nothing, Mother, it's just a...

365
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,340
 Come on, why won't you listen?

366
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:35,140
 What's that?

367
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:36,640
 Who is that you?

368
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,640
 Get off the line, the phone will be a play.

369
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,140
 You're on calling you.

370
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,240
 Have you found yet?

371
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,140
 No, why won't you point your hand off?

372
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:44,740
 I'll say and I'll be right over.

373
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:46,000
 No, you're not to come over.

374
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,480
 I don't want you even around here.

375
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:50,280
 I think I'm going to be talking to her on my 35th day.

376
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,640
 Oh, please, what's the reason?

377
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,720
 Look, if I'll tell you something,

378
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,980
 she said no letter this morning.

379
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,480
 Will you say where you are?

380
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,480
 Is it any good?

381
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,320
 Sure, it isn't.

382
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,220
 So I said it better than any telephone conversation would be.

383
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:04,120
 Well, all right.

384
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,800
 She says you want me to come to a bound map.

385
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,620
 Come on.

386
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,920
 To a what?

387
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,160
 To a bound map.

388
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,760
 That's a map to Ray party.

389
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,260
 I went to have a study.

390
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,860
 - Hey, what do you think it's safe?

391
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,100
 - What do you mean, say?

392
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,420
 - Are you going Henry?

393
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:18,700
 - No, I'm going.

394
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:19,540
 - Henry?

395
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:20,360
 - Yes, mother.

396
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,200
 - Here you have to hang up right this minute.

397
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,040
 - I will.

398
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,640
 Homer, my mother says I have to hang up

399
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,480
 and I guess she's right.

400
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,320
 Goodbye.

401
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,640
 - Henry.

402
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,440
 - Hey, mother, did you save my life?

403
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,960
 - Yeah, I want you to jump on your bicycle

404
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,880
 and go right down to the meat market.

405
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:35,120
 Mr. Phil, as I, as I, hello.

406
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:35,960
 - Number three.

407
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,480
 - Operator, this is Henry, all the guests.

408
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:40,320
 I'm expecting a very important call from Abbott City City.

409
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,720
 When it comes to this little after the picture stop.

410
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,300
 (upbeat music)

411
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:55,960
 Hey Mr. Wilson, Mr. Wilson.

412
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,960
 - Why there, Henry?

413
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,280
 - Now my mother's me, Freddie.

414
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,280
 - It is right here.

415
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,280
 - Good boy, Frank.

416
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,200
 Can the telephone call come for me?

417
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,960
 - No, not 'cause I've been on duty.

418
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,120
 - Yeah, I'm expecting an important call.

419
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,440
 But boy, that feels right now.

420
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,960
 - You better let me ask her, please.

421
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,960
 Well, keep a teller right here, won't you?

422
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,960
 Hello? Henry?

423
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:13,960
 How are you?

424
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,960
 I'm glad I guess I got here just the right time, didn't I?

425
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,960
 How are we just going distance?

426
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,960
 It is not. Henry?

427
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,960
 Well, how about you? What's something that happened to him?

428
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:23,960
 And something happened to who?

429
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:24,960
 He's calling me.

430
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,960
 I am.

431
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:29,960
 As long as you're downtown, I want you to run over to the Haven's drug store and get some cigars for me.

432
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:30,960
 No.

433
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,960
 And hurry home. Goodbye.

434
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,960
 What's wrong with you?

435
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,960
 Hey, boy.

436
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,960
 What's the one who want to all this food call come for me?

437
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,440
 come for me because you could you tell them they can catch me or would you

438
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,800
 haven't dropped store?

439
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,800
 I don't know why I couldn't. What's the name of the party's calling?

440
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,320
 Her name is Myrtle Joyce. Why?

441
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,600
 Well, don't do that for me.

442
00:14:48,600 --> 00:15:00,960
 Alice? Yes, Sam.

443
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,720
 Did you call to Havens and leave that message?

444
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,120
 Yes, I did. But was it you started to say about Lake Pazepu?

445
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:09,680
 Only that I'd heard of someone downtown who owns a couple of parishes up there.

446
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,720
 Oh, that's fine, Sam, because I don't know whether it's just one of my pre-manations or not,

447
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:17,120
 but it seems to me if we forget Henry Awaison this town this summer,

448
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,880
 he might not have quite so many problems.

449
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:19,760
 Yes.

450
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,840
 And goes the telephone again. I'll see you at it.

451
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,360
 It's Henry telling the police, honey.

452
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,120
 Hello?

453
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,560
 Is this Elm, 303?

454
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,120
 It is?

455
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,680
 This is Long Distance. I have a call from out of city, so it's a Henry Aldrich.

456
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,760
 Henry Aldrich isn't here right now.

457
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,480
 May I ask who to call it from?

458
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,780
 Why, it's a party by the name of Drinkwater.

459
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:39,280
 Drinkwater? Oh, thank you.

460
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,580
 And who was it?

461
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,180
 Someone from Abbot City, but the name of...

462
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:44,080
 Alice, I know who that was calling him.

463
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,380
 I know exactly who that was.

464
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:47,080
 Who? A fellow by the name of Drinkwater.

465
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,380
 And he's connected with that lone company over at Abbot City

466
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:50,680
 that him has been getting letters from.

467
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:51,680
 Oh, my goodness!

468
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,440
 Mr. Behaven, are you too busy to wait on me?

469
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,540
 I guess not, Henry.

470
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:09,640
 This person's a phone call coming for me.

471
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,740
 Yes, two of them.

472
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,120
 Two more guests, sir?

473
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,640
 No, they were both from your mother.

474
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,660
 He wants you to get a quart of milk at the grocery

475
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,960
 and then stop at the cleaners and pick up your father's soup.

476
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:18,760
 Oh, keep waiting.

477
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:19,320
 Oh, boy.

478
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:19,880
 Just a minute.

479
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,400
 Now, wrap your father's cigars for you.

480
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:24,120
 I'm expecting your call from a girl

481
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,840
 and it's coming here to your drugstore.

482
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,440
 That's right.

483
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:29,200
 There's a big math grade over in Abbott City tomorrow, and I--

484
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,440
 And either way, I'm going to wear it.

485
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:30,880
 No.

486
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,200
 It can better unfold, you.

487
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,200
 What's that?

488
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,920
 Oh boy, Mr. Heyman, could I have to your phone? It's probably.

489
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:36,920
 What must be?

490
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:39,040
 Hello, is this long distance?

491
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:39,480
 Hello.

492
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,280
 Oh, Marty?

493
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,840
 Hello, could you work up a bottle of paragord right away?

494
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:51,040
 Hello?

495
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,400
 Hello?

496
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,600
 Hello, Addison Market and Loan Company.

497
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,800
 May I speak with Mr. Drinkwater, please?

498
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,320
 I'm sorry, but Mr. Drinkwater is hidden right now.

499
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:02,880
 Well, could you tell me whether my son has been trying to borrow money

500
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,280
 or old you any what's the name and they are already

501
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:10,120
 all well we are allowed to get our confidence in this

502
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:12,360
 I know but he's my son and he's

503
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:15,560
 I'm sorry you're happy to get the drink out of personally

504
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:19,200
 and here's it is I see well thank you bye bye

505
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,600
 - Then how much was Henry old? - He wouldn't tell me.

506
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,700
 She said, "As a matter of fact, I know what I'll do."

507
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,200
 - What, Sam? - Now, when any comes in,

508
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,600
 don't say one word about anything.

509
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,200
 - You don't think he should? - I got to drive over to Abbott City

510
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,000
 on some other business in the next few days, anyhow,

511
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,800
 and I'll drop in and have a talk with drink water.

512
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,600
 - Really?

513
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,200
 - When did an I-your father say Abbott's

514
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,800
 gonna be a very cold for a man race?

515
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,800
 When did you get there?

516
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,200
 - Okay, I wasn't qualified. - Henry, I was simply

517
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,800
 talking about going over to Abbott City sometimes.

518
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,800
 - Oh. - That's all.

519
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,800
 - That's enough time.

520
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,200
 - Father, do you have any ideas of,

521
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,200
 to say when you might be driving over.

522
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,200
 Oh, any time in the next few days?

523
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:56,200
 Well, they have absolutely good movies over there sometimes.

524
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:00,200
 Wouldn't you like to take Mother and go over to Mar and I can have a good time?

525
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,200
 He's out of the night? Yes, you are.

526
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,200
 And I might go along with you.

527
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,200
 Well, we'll see. We'll take it over.

528
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,200
 Oh, there it is.

529
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,200
 That's Henry with you. Please, walk.

530
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,200
 Why don't you want to miss him?

531
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,200
 Well, here's Henry.

532
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,200
 Hey, what's the matter?

533
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,200
 You think Mother, I just went into the telephone table.

534
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,200
 Well, get up off that floor.

535
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,200
 I can talk right down here.

536
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,200
 Hello, Henry. What did you say?

537
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,200
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

538
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:33,200
 I came in and see if you found that costume for me.

539
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,200
 Oh, yes, Henry. Here it is.

540
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,200
 It's Lieutenant uniform.

541
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,200
 Is your last Confederate outfit I have in the place?

542
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,200
 Yes, that's exactly what I wanted.

543
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,200
 That'll be $2.

544
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,200
 $2? Just for 24 hours?

545
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,200
 That's right.

546
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,200
 That's right.

547
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,560
 Couldn't you let me have us play a dollar or a dollar and a half?

548
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,560
 If I bring it back, why should I?

549
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:55,400
 Well, how would you like to go as an 1890 policeman for a dollar-dendly five?

550
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,600
 I don't think it might.

551
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,600
 My girl tried to get me by phone yesterday.

552
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:02,040
 I mean, we couldn't get together and I saw in a hotel room that I'd be there the matter

553
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,040
 of the Confederate phone.

554
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,040
 Yeah.

555
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,040
 She'd like to get as well as a policeman, wouldn't she?

556
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:09,680
 No, I think you can never met, and I don't want to confuse her.

557
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:13,520
 So, Mr. Johnson, do I get a sword with that for two dollars?

558
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:18,520
 I want M787.

559
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,520
 M787.

560
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,520
 Yes, please.

561
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:25,520
 Mr. Johnson, do I understand correctly if 50 cents left without the forward?

562
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,520
 Hello, have a moment, biggie.

563
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:33,520
 Father, I think you said that I had a fan of coat pants and sword, a third piece for two and a half dollars.

564
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,520
 What's that?

565
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,520
 Just for one night.

566
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,520
 Who is it?

567
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,520
 It's your son, Helen.

568
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:42,520
 I have a chance to go to a costume board and I just have General Lee for two and a half dollars.

569
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:48,560
 dollars. When the sword two dollars without good. Only don't try to get

570
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:57,240
 somebody from a stranger. Where will I get it from me? Goodbye. Mr. Johnson I can take it.

571
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:02,280
 Mr. Johnson where are you? Henry how do I look? What's in that card? What are you doing with that

572
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:07,120
 uniform all? I'm gonna rid it. Eddie I've already said that you have not. Eddie give me that.

573
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,920
 Now listen, Henry, you take your hands off that.

574
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,120
 What do you stop listening?

575
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,720
 Now wait boys, what's the idea?

576
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,520
 Mr. Johnson, I want this uniform.

577
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,320
 Mr. Johnson, I said I say it.

578
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,920
 Well, Henry's right, Ed.

579
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:17,920
 Don't give it to me, Ed.

580
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,920
 Henry, for the last time, take your hands off me.

581
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,920
 You bet he's drawing your hair.

582
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,520
 Hey, stop.

583
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,320
 Now listen, Henry.

584
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,920
 Now wait boys, let's not have another war over this.

585
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,920
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

586
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,200
 How you feel, Henry?

587
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,440
 All right.

588
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:41,240
 Here, put this cloth on your other eye.

589
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,040
 Boy, did you take a beating.

590
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,000
 Well, I got the costume, didn't I?

591
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,360
 I mean, that's corny, doesn't look so hot either.

592
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,280
 Where's the costume?

593
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,280
 Let me put it on.

594
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,320
 It's still down at Mr. Johnson.

595
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,240
 After we got for a week that he thought it would look

596
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,640
 a little better if he gave it a brushing and a brushing.

597
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,480
 - Thank you.

598
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,320
 - Yes, mother.

599
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,160
 - Mr. Medical, are you?

600
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,000
 - Oh, for me?

601
00:20:59,000 --> 00:20:59,840
 Yes.

602
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,280
 Are you quite sure you can yellin' up

603
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,760
 to go to that dancing idea?

604
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,480
 Look, I never felt better in my life.

605
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,480
 You know that, Dr. Paul?

606
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,480
 Homer, why?

607
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,080
 This is the front of the fence, bro.

608
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,280
 You're looking right at it.

609
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,480
 Oh, yeah.

610
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:14,580
 You can dial it and reload it to you with your eyes,

611

 feeling the way they do.

612
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:18,480
 Now, Homer, I can read it perfectly all right.

613
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,780
 And dear Henry, as long as I know exactly what you're going to look like,

614
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:25,680
 I think it is only fair that you know what I'm going to wear.

615
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:28,480
 And so I'm enclosing a photograph of me and my costume.

616

 He was home with us.

 No, but...

633
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,480
 Look at that face.

634
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,480
 Can you think that might be a mask that goes with the costume?

 No, homeward's real.

00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,480

00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,480
 Yes, father.

638
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,480
 You better be ready to go over with me.

639
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,480
 I'm leaving in a few minutes.

640
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,980
 to Abbott City?

00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:02,980
 Yes.

642
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:04,980
 Well, he's going for his father.

643
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:07,480
 Frankly, I don't think I'll be going to that day.

644
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,080
 You're not going?

645
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:08,580
 Why not?

646
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:10,780
 He just had some bad news, Mr. Alden.

647
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:12,680
 And you're just saying you aren't going?

648

 Mother Mike, my eyes are sort of tired.

00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:18,280
 I don't think I'd want to go over there and train them.

00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,980
 Well, I'd like to better get your things on.

651
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:22,080
 Then I don't think I want to take that tippy down.

00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:27,280
 Well, you do right on over and taping.
