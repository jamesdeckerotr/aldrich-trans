1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 And now the Jell-O family presents Henry Henry O'Rourke coming out of her.

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,240
 Yes, it's the Ollrich family based on characters originated by Clifford Goldsmith and starring

3
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,420
 Ezra Stone is Henry with Jackie Kelker Stone

4
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,440
 and yes it's the Jell-O family

5
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:38,840
 Oh the big red letter stand for the Jell-O family

6
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:42,600
 Oh the big red letter stand for the Jell-O family

7
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,560
 That's Jell-O yum yum yum

8
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,640
 Jell-O puddings yum yum yum

9
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,680
 Jell-O tap

10
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,040
 Be-Oka pudding

11
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,340
 Jets-O-R-E-E

12
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:54,440
 And now for the Aldridge family

13
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:06,440
 [Music]

14
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:13,440
 When you take a typical American family, plus some friends and neighbors, and then add one teenage boy,

15
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:19,440
 you needn't bother to stir things up. The boy, if he's like Henry Aldrich, will somehow attend to that.

16
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:24,440
 the scene opens in the all-rich living room. The time is late afternoon.

17
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,440
 No Homer, I think you don't have to.

18
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,440
 You do. I don't.

19
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,440
 Definitely not.

20
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:35,440
 Boy, and I hope you're right. I've been saving for two months to get a new band for my wristwatch.

21
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:38,440
 And now if I had to... suppose she expects me to.

22
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,440
 She couldn't.

23
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,440
 How do you know?

24
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:44,440
 How bad Agnes doesn't even know it's the anniversary of your first date with her.

25
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,440
 Do you really think so, him?

26
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,440
 - Sure, who remembers things like that?

27
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,440
 My father never does.

28
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,440
 I'm surprised you even thought of it.

29
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,440
 - Boy, I'll never forget it.

30
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,440
 - Well, okay, Homer, you have a special reason

31
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:58,440
 for remembering your anniversary, but Agnes doesn't, does she?

32
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,440
 - She may be your right, him.

33
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:04,440
 And boy, is that a load off my mind?

34
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,440
 - Sure.

35
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,440
 - Sure.

36
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,440
 Now I can concentrate on my wrist wash.

37
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,440
 - Sure.

38
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,440
 - Do you think I ought to get a brown leather band hand

39
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,440
 for a black one?

40
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,440
 - I thought I heard voices in here.

41
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:20,600
 voices in here. Hi mother. Hi Mrs. Aldrich. Hello boys and congratulations Homer. Thank

42
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:28,560
 you Mrs. Aldrich. What for? Isn't Saturday an anniversary of some kind? Oh your very first

43
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:34,140
 date with Agnes isn't it? Hen. She was mother how did you know? I was out shopping this

44
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:39,760
 morning and I ran into Agnes. Oh so my heartiest congratulations to the both of you Homer

45
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:46,400
 and many happy returns. Thank you Mrs. Orridge. Thank you mother. You're welcome boys. If you want some

46
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:53,200
 fruit, it's in the icebox. Who could eat fruit now? See Henry? So what? So my mother knows. What

47
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:58,720
 is that fruit? It proves Agnes know. Or I'd supposing Agnes does know. What is that fruit? It proves

48
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:05,760
 there goes my watch band. Not necessarily. Alice do you know where? Hello boys. Hi father. Hi father.

49
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,480
 I'm Mr. Ulrich.

50
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:10,920
 Oh, by the way, Homer, I ran into a friend of yours down at the Emporium today.

51
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,480
 He did, Mr. Ulrich.

52
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,320
 Hmm.

53
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,220
 Agnes.

54
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,480
 Oh.

55
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,960
 May I ask him what department?

56
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,760
 I believe it was in Ladies Unmentionables.

57
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,680
 [LAUGHTER]

58
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,040
 Is your mother in the kitchen, Henry?

59
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,040
 I think so, Father.

60
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,320
 See you later, boy.

61
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,840
 Well, that does it.

62
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,400
 Homer, why do you keep jumping at conclusions?

63
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,120
 I'm not jumping at them, and they're jumping in me.

64
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,280
 I still don't see it.

65
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:37,480
 Then what was Agnes doing in Ladies Unmentionables?

66
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,480
 I don't know.

67
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,680
 Maybe she was just looking around.

68
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,280
 Sure, and I know why.

69
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:42,880
 Why?

70
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,880
 To see what she could exchange what I'm gonna give her for.

71
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,280
 Hello?

72
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,880
 Hello, Henry, is Homer there?

73
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,280
 Yeah, he is Agnes.

74
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,280
 Agnes, oh...

75
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,280
 Let me talk to you.

76
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,880
 Okay, here, Homer.

77
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,380
 Oh.

78
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:55,680
 Hello, Agnes.

79
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,080
 Hello, Homer, honey.

80
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,280
 Oh, boy.

81
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:07,280
 [Music]

82
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:12,280
 Agnes, is there any special reason you asked me to come over to your house?

83
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,280
 No, Homer, I was just lonely.

84
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,280
 Oh.

85
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,280
 Isn't it wonderful, Homer? Another wonderful, thrilling year.

86
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,280
 Sure.

87
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:24,280
 And Homer, I just want you to know that I don't expect a thing as an anniversary present.

88
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,280
 You don't?

89
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,280
 Of course not.

90
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,280
 I have you, what more could I ask for?

91
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,280
 Nothing Agnes.

92
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,280
 And nothing here. We're still together.

93
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,280
 That's all any girl needs to make her happy. Her man.

94
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:42,280
 Sure. Don't you think a brown band would go better with my wrist to watch than a black?

95
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:46,280
 And anyway, I don't think it's fair for a girl to expect a boy to spend all his money on her.

96
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:50,280
 Sure. That's what I like about you Agnes. You're so fair.

97
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,280
 Sure. Four or five dollars ought to be plenty.

98
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,280
 No.

99
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,280
 Homer.

100
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,280
 What?

101
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,280
 Give me a hint.

102
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,780
 I can't.

103
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:00,280
 Why?

104
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,280
 Because.

105
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,280
 Because why?

106
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,280
 Just because.

107
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,280
 Homer Brown haven't you decided yet what you're gonna get me?

108
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,280
 Well, sort of.

109
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,280
 Sort of?

110
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,280
 Sort of? What is that mean?

111
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,280
 Henry's supposed to be thinking of something.

112
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,280
 Oh.

113
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,280
 Homer?

114
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,280
 Why?

115
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,280
 Get Henry on the phone and find out what you're gonna get for.

116
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,280
 But Agnes!

117
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,280
 Here, start talking.

118
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,280
 Yes ma'am.

119
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,280
 Hall operator.

120
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,280
 Give me an M431.

121
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,280
 Now remember, Homer, I don't want you to send us sent over for a $5.

122
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,280
 Yes Agnes.

123
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,280
 Yes Agnes. Unless you promise you'll get me something cheaper for my birthday.

124
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,280
 Oh.

125
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:37,280
 Hello, Hen. This is Homer. Did you think of anything yet?

126
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,280
 Uh-huh.

127
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,280
 What?

128
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,280
 What, Hen?

129
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,280
 We are, no, but...

130
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,280
 Uh-huh.

131
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,280
 I suppose so, Hen.

132
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,280
 Yeah.

133
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,280
 By Hen.

134
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,280
 Well, we...

135
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,280
 Oh, we want it to be a surprise, Agnes.

136
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,780
 The surprise, Homer, that's wonderful. I just love surprises.

137
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:58,780
 What is this?

138
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:00,280
 You'll see.

139
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,780
 Is it something I can wear?

140
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:02,780
 Maybe.

141
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:04,780
 I'll bet it's something I can eat.

142
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:05,780
 Is it helmet?

143
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:06,780
 Maybe.

144
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:09,780
 Now it's something I can wear, I'm sure of.

145
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:10,780
 Is it?

146
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:11,780
 Maybe.

147
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:13,780
 Homer, give me your hands, I can.

148
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:14,780
 Why?

149
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:18,280
 Then we said you'd try to force it out of me, so he wouldn't even tell me.

150
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:27,280
 [Music]

151
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,280
 And may couldn't you think of something that'd still leave Homer enough for the watch band?

152
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:36,280
 I tried to, mother, but a watch band would only leave Agnes forty-five cents.

153
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,280
 You can't get much for that.

154
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,280
 No, I imagine not.

155
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,280
 Besides, I think the dozen roses will be very appropriate.

156
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,280
 Poor Homer.

157
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,280
 Yeah, he sure wanted that watch band.

158
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:49,640
 Maybe this will teach him to change girls at least once a year.

159
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:54,340
 Boy, if I only had a little more money, I'd buy him that watch band myself.

160
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:55,780
 I'll tell you what I'll do, Henry.

161
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:59,780
 Since it's Homer's anniversary, I'll match whatever you put up.

162
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,620
 How much do you have in your dime bank?

163
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:02,620
 A dime.

164
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:04,620
 [laughter]

165
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,320
 Well, that gives us 20 cents.

166
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,220
 I'll match what both of you put up.

167
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,020
 No, 40 cents. How much more do we need?

168
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:10,920
 About 60.

169
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,020
 60, eh?

170
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:13,020
 Then your bottles.

171
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,160
 Henry, there are five empty ones on the back porch.

172
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,800
 That's another quarter, only 35 cents more.

173
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,800
 Maybe if we looked under the sofa pillar.

174
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,640
 Sure.

175
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,960
 Henry, my fill for all of them.

176
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,840
 A dime! I found a dime!

177
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,040
 Look, in the corner there, Henry, there's something shiny.

178
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,080
 Another...

179
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,160
 Father, did you lose a suspender button?

180
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,400
 There's a nickel pen ray and two pennies.

181
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,280
 Here's another nickel that's 10, 17, 22.

182
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,320
 13 cents short.

183
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,760
 Wait, I know what?

184
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,080
 What?

185
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,240
 I'll only buy Agnes 11 roses.

186
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,520
 Fine, we've made it.

187
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:43,400
 I'll go right down to the jewelers now and get Homer's watch band.

188
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:43,800
 Good.

189
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:47,960
 You think I would have something engraved on it, something like success?

190
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:51,720
 Henry, this is the anniversary of Homer's winning Agnes, not the Kentucky Derby.

191
00:07:51,720 --> 00:08:03,200
 But Kathleen, I don't know what Homer's getting me. Henry wouldn't tell him.

192
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:08,920
 Henry! He had some silly idea I might try to force it out of Homer, so he's gonna pick out the gift.

193
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,960
 Oh, no wonder!

194
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,960
 No wonder what!

195
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:14,260
 So that's what Henry was doing down there.

196
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,260
 There?

197
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:16,260
 Where?

198
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:17,260
 Where's there?

199
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:18,260
 I saw Henry in a jewelry store.

200
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:19,260
 A jewelry store?

201
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:20,260
 Oh boy!

202
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,260
 What was he buying?

203
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:24,260
 Maybe I shouldn't have brought it off.

204
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:28,060
 Listen, Kathleen, what a homoever do for you.

205
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:30,260
 I'm not saying another word.

206
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,260
 Alright.

207
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:36,860
 How about if I make some guesses and you just shake your head yes or no?

208
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:43,860
 (music)

209
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:44,860
 Hello?

210
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:48,860
 Thank you Homer, thank you, thank you and thank you!

211
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:51,860
 You're welcome. Who is this?

212
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:52,860
 Homer, it's your best girl!

213
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:53,860
 Really?

214
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,860
 Gia doesn't sound at all like your mother.

215
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,860
 It's me, Agnes!

216
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:00,860
 Oh! Oh, Agnes!

217
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:04,860
 Oh, I remember the minute I heard I had that call, you and thank you!

218
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,220
 I've heard what Agnes?

219
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:08,900
 What you're getting me for our anniversary presents.

220
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:09,860
 You know.

221
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:10,860
 Uh-huh.

222
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:14,100
 She was everybody knows what I'm getting you, but me.

223
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,820
 What am I getting?

224
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:20,020
 I don't think I ought to tell you what I'll spoil a surprise.

225
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:22,100
 Listen, Agnes, when I give you a present,

226
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,900
 you're supposed to be surprised, not me.

227
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:25,580
 Oh.

228
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:26,860
 Well, I'll tell you what, Homer.

229
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,100
 You come on over.

230
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,020
 I want to see your face when I tell you.

231
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:32,020
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

232
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:37,020
 (music)

233
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:39,020
 Henry, Henry.

234
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:43,020
 I've got to talk to you, Henry, right now.

235
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:45,020
 What's the matter? What's the matter?

236
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:47,020
 You have a nerve to ask me that?

237
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:49,020
 What happened? What happened?

238
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:52,020
 Homer will never get anywhere if you just keep repeating what I say.

239
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,020
 What you say?

240
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:56,020
 Do you deny you were down into jewelers this afternoon?

241
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:58,020
 Well, don't. Kathleen saw you.

242
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:59,020
 Oh, is that all?

243
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,020
 battle.

244
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:03,580
 Aha! So you admit it? You've ruined me Henry.

245
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:04,580
 I have.

246
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:05,580
 How?

247
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:08,180
 Did you ever buy a ring for Kathleen on your anniversary?

248
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:09,180
 A ring!

249
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,180
 Homer, don't be silly.

250
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:13,780
 Then why did you buy one for me for Agnes on our anniversary?

251
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,580
 A ring? I bought a ring.

252
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:16,580
 Kathleen saw you.

253
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:18,580
 Kathleen saw me buy a ring?

254
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:21,820
 Well, not exactly buy it, but she saw you looking at them.

255
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,820
 RINGS? I didn't buy...

256
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:26,660
 Oh sure, I remember now.

257
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:27,660
 Aha!

258
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:32,160
 I was waiting my turn. I just looked around. Maybe I did glance at some rings.

259
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:37,660
 Glance? Then you didn't buy it. But Kathleen told Agnes she saw it.

260
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:40,660
 See Homer? You got all excited over nothing.

261
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:44,660
 No I didn't, him. But Homer, I didn't buy your rings.

262
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:49,660
 Yes, but Agnes thinks she...I...Henry.

263
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:52,660
 Yeah? I'm engaged.

264
00:10:52,660 --> 00:11:00,660
 [Music]

265
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,660
 Agnes, how did Homer ask you?

266
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,660
 Well, he didn't exactly ask me, Kathleen.

267
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,660
 Yes, but how did you know?

268
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,660
 Well, I figured, honey, wouldn't be buying a ring,

269
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:11,660
 unless Homer said something to him about wanting to be engaged.

270
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:12,660
 See, yes.

271
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,660
 So I sort of helped him along.

272
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:17,660
 Men are always a little afraid to say the actual words.

273
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:19,660
 But what did he say then?

274
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:20,660
 Nothing.

275
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:23,860
 a top and a look on his face if that's what was on his mind.

276
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:25,060
 But how did you know?

277
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:27,860
 Well he didn't have just when I suggested a ditty.

278
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:30,180
 No. So there you are.

279
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,620
 My goodness.

280
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:34,180
 He's the goddess and Henry a thank you card.

281
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:34,820
 I don't know.

282
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:38,900
 But what does being engaged feel like?

283
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:42,340
 All sort of relaxing.

284
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,300
 Relaxing.

285
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:49,780
 You know you don't have to worry about are you going to have a date Saturday night and things like that.

286
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:54,580
 All of a sudden all your problems are ended because you've got your mandolin on.

287
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:57,380
 Oh, it sounds just wonderful.

288
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:58,980
 It is Kathleen.

289
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,580
 It's wonderful.

290
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:02,180
 Just wonderful.

291
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:08,820
 It's terrible Henry.

292
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,020
 Just terrible.

293
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:12,740
 I want to look at it this way Homer.

294
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:15,220
 Engagements have their advantages too.

295
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:16,740
 Yeah, lean on.

296
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:19,740
 Well, they don't know well yet.

297
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,740
 There must be some advantages.

298
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:24,740
 Otherwise, why would so many people do it?

299
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,740
 Name one, just one.

300
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:31,740
 Well, for instance, when you're engaged, you don't have to spend so much money on the girl.

301
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,740
 Oh, yeah? What about the engagement ring?

302
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:36,740
 Not alone, it'll keep me broke for the next two years.

303
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:42,740
 Sure, Homer, but funny part is I never even thought of Agnes as something you'd get engaged to.

304
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:44,740
 [laughter]

305
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:46,740
 And what am I gonna do?

306
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,740
 You can always leave town.

307
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:51,740
 Sure. Sure, that's what I'll do. Leave town right now.

308
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:54,740
 Right now? Well, you got to know what's the difference.

309
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:55,740
 So long, Henry.

310
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,740
 Don't try to stop me. It's the only way.

311
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:00,740
 Homer, put on my folks. I said you could have my new bike.

312
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:04,740
 All you have to do is tighten my new bike.

313
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,740
 And hardly even road it.

314
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:11,740
 Homer, if I didn't want to be engaged to a girl that badly, I'd just call her up and tell her so.

315
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:12,740
 Sure.

316
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:14,740
 Why didn't I think of that?

317
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,740
 I'll tell her straight out.

318
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:19,740
 Operator, give me L-M-891 please.

319
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:20,740
 Oh, oh.

320
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:22,740
 What should I say to her, Hen?

321
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,740
 Just say, uh, look, Agnes.

322
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:29,740
 There's nothing personal in this, but I think we're both too young to know our own mind.

323
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:30,740
 Sure, that's good.

324
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:33,740
 And furthermore, Agnes, the whole thing...

325
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:34,740
 Just be firm, Hen.

326
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:35,740
 I will, Hen.

327
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:36,740
 Hello.

328
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:38,740
 Agnes, this is Homer.

329
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:39,740
 Agnes, I...

330
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:41,740
 What oh?

331
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:44,500
 Miss Lawson oh

332
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,540
 Madam

333
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:49,540
 Agnes I don't know what you mean

334
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:55,120
 Miss Henry's here, but I'm there. What's the matter? She thinks I ought to call her dear. Oh

335
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,420
 Yes, dear

336
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:01,700
 Yes dear

337
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,200
 dear

338
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,200
 Yes dear

339
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:16,940
 Palmer yes dear why didn't you tell her because she she Henry why what's the

340
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:22,720
 fella supposed to get his fiance for her shower what a shower Agnes said

341
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,600
 Kathleen insisted on giving her one yeah I don't know Homer I think you're

342
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:31,560
 supposed to give her tableclaws and old pillowcases and things like that I

343
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:35,800
 suppose so Homer why didn't you tell her about being too young to know your own

344
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,800
 But she sounded so positive about the whole thing.

345
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,800
 Boy, I got the feeling maybe it was illegal or something to call it off.

346
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,800
 She was, maybe it is. You know what, Homer?

347
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:48,800
 Maybe you just ought to stick it out forever, if necessary.

348
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,800
 She's bound to get tired of you sooner or later.

349
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,800
 Isn't an engagement sort of like a contract?

350
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,800
 I guess so.

351
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,800
 What can they do to you if you don't go through with your end of it?

352
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,800
 I don't know.

353
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,800
 Did you write her any letters she could use against you?

354
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,800
 Letters, I don't think... Oh boy.

355
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,000
 You mean you did?

356
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,200
 No, she did.

357
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,000
 Oh.

358
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,800
 Right after the first time she kissed me, it was sort of a thank you letter.

359
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,300
 [laughter]

360
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,800
 Well, you better get home and burn it.

361
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,300
 I did, as soon as I got it.

362
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:18,300
 But what if she kept a carbon copy?

363
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,300
 Oh, boy.

364
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:21,300
 I mean, I don't think my father's gonna like...

365
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,800
 My father!

366
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,300
 Boy, wait till he finds out.

367
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:28,800
 And why did you have to glance at rings in the first place?

368
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,700
 I didn't know Kathleen was going to be snooping around,

369
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:34,300
 and I believe that's the trouble with girls they talk to much.

370
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:44,300
 Next thing you know it'll be all over school. Henry. Why? Mr. Bradley will throw me out of school. See I told you there were advantages to being in gay.

371
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:56,300
 Oh, the Big Red Letter Stanford, and Jell-O Family.

372
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:59,800
 Oh, the Big Red Letter Stanford, and Jell-O Family.

373
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,800
 That's Jell-O, yum, yum, yum.

374
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,300
 Jell-O Pudding, yum, yum, yum.

375
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:08,300
 Jell-O Tap, Be-Oka Pudding, Jas-Sari.

376
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:14,800
 And tonight, the Jell-O Family of Yum Yum Desserts wants to give a special salute to National Restaurant Week, May 2nd, May 8th.

377
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,800
 You know our neighborhood restaurants are an American institution,

378
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:23,540
 famous all over the world for their traditionally high standards of fine food, fine services,

379
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:28,060
 fine friendly atmosphere. So take the family often to your favorite restaurant.

380
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:33,420
 It means a treat for everybody. And another treat you can be sure of finding at any good restaurant

381
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:40,260
 is America's favorite gelatin dessert. Yes, Jello. Jello in those six delicious flavors.

382
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:43,420
 Strawberry, raspberry, cherry, orange, lemon and lime.

383
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:49,420
 So next time you're at your favorite restaurant, have your favorite treat for dessert. Ask for Jell-O.

384
00:16:49,420 --> 00:17:02,420
 And now getting back to the troubles of Henry Olgrey.

385
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:07,420
 Henry's visit to a jewelry store has been misinterpreted by both Homer and Agnes.

386
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:11,420
 She thinks she's getting and he thinks he's getting her an engagement ring.

387
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:15,420
 The scene opens in the Alrich living room. It is the next day.

388
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:19,420
 - What is it there? - Listen to this letter that came in the mail today.

389
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:24,420
 Dear Mr. Alrich, I am a young high school student who suddenly finds himself engaged

390
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:27,420
 to another young high school student, female of course.

391
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:33,420
 - My goodness. - As a lawyer, I would appreciate your advice on whether I can escape.

392
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:40,420
 - Escape? - But that's crossed out and changed to whether I can disentangle myself and if so far.

393
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:42,420
 - How? - Sad who's it from?

394
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:44,420
 Yours truly desperate.

395
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,420
 Oh.

396
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:47,420
 Well, what about the handwriting?

397
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:48,420
 It's printed.

398
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:49,420
 Then there's a P.S.

399
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:56,420
 Kindly attach your answer to the lowest branch of the big maple tree in the empty lot on Olive and Fifth Street.

400
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:59,420
 - Oh, hey! - Then there's a P.S.

401
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:02,420
 Kindly enclose a bill for your fee.

402
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:04,420
 - Well, who do you think? - Just a minute, Alice.

403
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:06,420
 There is also a P.P.P.S.

404
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:14,420
 When naming "fee" kindly bear in mind that the writer is a poor, underlying young, high school student.

405
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:17,420
 Alice, you don't suppose...

406
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:32,420
 I've been giving it a lot of thought, Agnes dear.

407
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:34,420
 So have I, dear?

408
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:35,420
 You have, dear?

409
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:36,420
 Yes, dear.

410
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:38,420
 Well, what do you think, dear?

411
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:40,420
 I agree with you completely, dear.

412
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:41,420
 You do, dear?

413
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:43,420
 Of course, dear.

414
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:44,420
 Sure.

415
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:47,420
 Everybody agrees that long engagements aren't good.

416
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:49,420
 That's absolutely true, dear.

417
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,420
 They're terrible.

418
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:54,420
 And so I think we ought to reconsider the whole thing.

419
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:55,420
 Don't you, dear?

420
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:02,860
 Well, did you tell her?

421
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:03,500
 Yes, him.

422
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,340
 What did you say?

423
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:05,300
 She agreed with me.

424
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,580
 She didn't think long engagements were good either.

425
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:08,540
 No kidding.

426
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:10,660
 See, Homer, I told you talking to a person

427
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:12,260
 a person would get your results.

428
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:13,660
 Certainly did.

429
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:15,340
 Henry, are you busy, June 1?

430
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:16,660
 No, why?

431
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:18,700
 I thought you might like to be my best man.

432
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:21,700
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

433
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:30,660
 An anonymous death head wheel?

434
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:31,160
 Yeah.

435
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,660
 Oh, Homer, stop staring into your soup and stop.

436
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:34,460
 Start eating it.

437
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:35,960
 That's what Sam told me, Elizabeth.

438
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:38,760
 Imagine a high school kid doing a thing like that.

439
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,360
 And Sam didn't know who it was.

440
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,960
 Oh, Homer, stop that.

441
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:44,260
 All he said was the note was sign desperate.

442
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:45,660
 A high school, boy.

443
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:48,260
 You know, Willy, but didn't sound too ridiculous even for him.

444
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:50,660
 I guess it was Sam's own son Henry.

445
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:51,160
 Oh.

446
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:54,260
 Oh, Miss, stop fishing around in your soup with your fingers.

447
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,860
 Take another spoon.

448
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,660
 Well, whoever he is, he's an idiot.

449
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:58,760
 What about his parents?

450
00:19:58,760 --> 00:19:59,800
 There it is too.

451
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:04,400
 Do you suppose he's figuring on moving her in with his folks?

452
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,440
 What else can he do?

453
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,320
 You know what I do if I were that kid's father.

454
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:12,080
 I take him and his idiot bride and shift them right over to her idiot parent's house.

455
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:17,120
 Homer, if you're having that much trouble holding onto your spoon, tie it to your wrist or something.

456
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,280
 He has another spoon here to fish out the other two.

457
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,800
 And it's so him right to have to live with a girl's parents.

458
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,400
 Let him use their pots and pans and utilities.

459
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,640
 Let him eat their food.

460
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:36,640
 Oh, oh! Oh, oh, oh! Oh, oh! Oh, oh! Come back here and clean up this mess! Oh, man! I wonder what got into that boy.

461
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,640
 [Music]

462
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:45,640
 Potting pans in the utility. This should be easy. Come to the young hand, I'm just a kid.

463
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:50,640
 Homer, you're getting hysterical again. Take another drink of water.

464
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:55,640
 Thanks. Henry, what am I going to do? I don't want to live with the lost in these.

465
00:20:55,640 --> 00:21:00,880
 Easy Homer easy boy. There was a letter from my father on the tree today

466
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:06,520
 It was what he said he said if desperate wanted advice to drop in in person

467
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:09,600
 We can't do that Henry. Then we know look I got it all figured out

468
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:15,220
 We can tell him we're friends of desperate and he asked us to represent him sure sure that's what we can do

469
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:20,160
 Come on. Hello father. Oh, I'm Mr. Aldrich father

470
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:25,120
 Do you recall a communication you had from a party who prefers to remain nameless?

471
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,120
 Oh, yes. Desperate, wasn't it?

472
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,120
 That's right, Mr. Oliver.

473
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,120
 Well, he sort of asked us to represent him.

474
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,120
 Oh?

475
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,120
 Sort of the party of the third party, you might say.

476
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:39,120
 I see. You mean you have his power of attorney?

477
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,120
 Well, no, Father. He didn't know was necessary.

478
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:47,120
 Mr. Oliver couldn't we discuss it purely hypothyaratically?

479
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,120
 Why, yes, I suppose so.

480
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:53,120
 Oh, now, what exactly is Desperate's problem?

481
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:58,500
 Well, he sort of found himself engaged against his will, Mr. Aldrich, against his will.

482
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,300
 I see.

483
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:05,460
 So what can he do to get disentangled before he gets all mixed up with pots and pans and utilities?

484
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:06,880
 I see.

485
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,460
 Mmm, now let's see.

486
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:12,220
 This same point came up in the case of Schneider-Coff versus Schneider-Coff.

487
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:14,320
 Who won, Father? Schneider-Coff.

488
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,480
 [laughter]

489
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:19,060
 Oh, is that good or bad for the third party?

490
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:26,060
 Well, in a divided opinion, the Supreme Court decided that in the event of a reversal of sentiment on the part of one of the contractees to an engagement,

491
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:30,060
 the dissenting party was obligated to so inform the said partner to said contract.

492
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:31,060
 Really?

493
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:32,060
 Father?

494
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:34,060
 The exact wording of the decision.

495
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:36,060
 That's very interesting, Mr. Aldrich.

496
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:39,060
 You get any time off of the behavior?

497
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:43,060
 I'm afraid you don't understand, Homer. He was no longer engaged.

498
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:44,060
 What?

499
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:46,060
 But how did he get out of it?

500
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:50,900
 get out of it he called the girl and told her it was off that's all that's all

501
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:54,940
 and Agnes couldn't do anything to him

502
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:57,300
 I'll say

503
00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:01,660
 oh thank you mr. Allridge thank you Homer stop kissing my hand

504
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:13,180
 you should have been here on as it was alright I'm gonna imagine what it

505
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:14,180
 I don't want to say anything about it.

506
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:15,180
 You are in the first place.

507
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:16,180
 He looked thirty years younger.

508
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:19,180
 Then he and Henry began to discuss how to break it to Agnes.

509
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:22,180
 It seems Homer didn't relish the idea of breaking it to a face to face.

510
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:24,180
 So he thought Henry should do it.

511
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:27,940
 Inasmuch as Henry was responsible for his predicament, having been seen in the fatal

512
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,180
 jewelry store at the fatal time.

513
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,180
 Poor Henry.

514
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:31,180
 Oh, he's not doing it.

515
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:33,180
 Henry was as reluctant to face Agnes as Homer was.

516
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:34,180
 Then how?

517
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:37,180
 It was finally decided that Henry would break the news to Kathleen.

518
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:39,180
 Who in turn would break it to Agnes?

519
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:40,180
 My goodness.

520
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:42,180
 When is all this going to happen?

521
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:44,680
 Henry left for Kathleen's about an hour ago.

522
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:47,180
 Homer kept saying, "Honey Henry before my father finds out.

523
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:49,180
 "Honey Henry, my father will kill me."

524
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:51,680
 - Is that you, Henry? - Yes, mother.

525
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,180
 - Did you see Kathleen?

526
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:54,680
 - Sure, I just came from there.

527
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,980
 - Well, how did everything go?

528
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:58,180
 - Well, I said, "Kathleen, I said,

529
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:00,580
 "don't you think Homer and Agnes are a little too young

530
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:02,180
 "to be engaged after all?"

531
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:05,180
 I said, "She may find someone she likes more than Homer."

532
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:06,180
 - It's not bad.

533
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:07,180
 - Why did she say to that?

534
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:08,680
 - Well, she said, "What if she doesn't?"

535
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,680
 - My goodness.

536
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,180
 - And then I said, "Still, Kathleen.

537
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:15,180
 A young girl can have much more fun going out with lots of boys.

538
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:16,180
 Then what happens?

539
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:19,180
 Well then we talked a little more about boys and girls and

540
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:23,180
 the advantages and disadvantages of being engaged and things like that.

541
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:25,180
 I see. And how did it come out?

542
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:28,180
 I think I'm a little bit engaged myself.

543
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:31,180
 What Henry?

544
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:44,180
 (Music)

545
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:46,180
 Hi, homework, congratulations!

546
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:49,180
 And I've got a business proposition for you if you're still in game.

547
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:51,180
 Who said I was, Willie? Who said I was?

548
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:53,180
 She is at a secret, okay? I won't say a word!

549
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:55,180
 Now listen, not a word!

550
00:24:55,180 --> 00:25:00,180
 Only if you're going to wear striped pants and a top hat at your wedding, I can rent you my father's at a discount.

551
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:04,900
 Well, that should be a sight to see, but for a mighty pretty sight any day in the week,

552
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:11,440
 it's, yes, you guessed it, jello, gay shimmering jello in those six delicious flavors, strawberry

553
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,220
 raspberry cherry orange lemon and lime.

554
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:19,180
 For a special treat tomorrow, try raspberry ginger dessert, made with rich red raspberry

555
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:20,340
 jello.

556
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:24,740
 Just as all the package of raspberry jello in one cup of hot water, then add a cup of ginger

557
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:25,740
 ale.

558
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:28,620
 Turn into individual moles and chill until firm.

559
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:33,580
 It's swell, tempting fruit like raspberry jello with tangy ginger ale.

560
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:37,860
 All six delicious jello flavors are rich with locked in goodness.

561
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:42,620
 Flavors seal right in so it can't get out till your first delectable spoonful.

562
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:57,620
 And that's why jello is America's favorite gelatin dessert.

563
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:02,300
 Now here is Mrs. Norman Vincent Peele, wife of the renowned minister, with some important

564
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:03,300
 news.

565
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:07,380
 Good evening, Henry Aldrich, or I should say Ezra Stone.

566
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:11,460
 I'm happy to be here tonight on behalf of National Family Week.

567
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:17,620
 To present to the Aldrich family our annual radio citation for high quality in content

568
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:19,780
 and excellence of production.

569
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:24,260
 This is the third consecutive year that the Aldrich family has won this award, and you

570
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:26,180
 are all to be congratulated.

571
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:31,840
 Thank you, Mrs. Peel. Thank you very much for this very high honor and for your kind appearance here tonight

572
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:51,560
 The Olrich family starring Ezra Stone as Henry with Jackie Calcas Homer is written by Frank Tarlov with music by Jack Miller

573
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:54,340
 Mr. and Mrs. Olrich our house Jamison and

574
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:59,740
 Catherine Roth and this is Dan Seymour in New York saying the old rich family is

575
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:01,740
 brought to you by the Jell-O family.

576
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:06,740
 Oh, the big red letter stand for the Jell-O family.

577
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:09,740
 Oh, the big red letter stand for the Jell-O family.

578
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:10,740
 That's Jell-O.

579
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:11,740
 Yum yum yum.

580
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:13,740
 Jell-O pudding, yum yum yum.

581
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:17,740
 Jell-O tap, the yoke pudding, yes or me.

582
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:24,040
 You as new as an orchid in the Arctic.

583
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:26,240
 Amazing, the only one of its kind.

584
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,440
 That's minute rice.

585
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,040
 Minute rice for magically quick, quick meals.

586
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:32,140
 You've never tasted such delicious rice.

587
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:35,240
 Rice that comes out light, white and fluffy every time.

588
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,840
 And without washing, rinsing, draining, steaming.

589
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,340
 Just drop minute rice in water and bring to a boil.

590
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:42,140
 It's quicker to fix than potatoes.

591
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:44,640
 Wonderful with stews, cream chicken or seafood.

592
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,040
 And so quick, quick.

593
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,240
 Remember the name minute.

594
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,440
 Minute rice in the red, white and blue box.

595
00:27:49,440 --> 00:28:01,940
 [Music]

596
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:05,440
 This is NBC, the National Broadcasting Company.
