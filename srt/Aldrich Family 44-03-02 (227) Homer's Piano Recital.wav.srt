 The scene opens in a neighbor's living room.

 Look out, Henry. Look out. You know how to work it.

 Homer, will you please keep your hands off the storm bank?

00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 -Hinch even with me, Pimpus. -Sure. I'll let you pump it when it's your turn.

 Now just keep your feet out of the way.

 Hey, what?

179
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:52,460
 The Moffet!

180
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,460
 He met Ethel!

181
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:55,460
 Well, whatever it is, it's time to stop it!

182
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:58,460
 Listen, Mary, there's no sense in your trying to teach me.

183
00:06:58,460 --> 00:06:59,460
 Well, we just started!

184
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,460
 I know, but look how long my teacher's been working on me.

185
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,460
 Henry, please call Ethel and tell her I'm sick.

186
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:05,460
 Who I?

187
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:07,460
 She was after fitching this whole date up for you.

188
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:10,460
 Homer, if you don't go over there and play it, you'll just make me look ridiculous!

189
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:12,460
 Well, how do you think you'll look if I do play?

190
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:28,460
 [Music]

191
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:31,460
 Mother, I can't do it. I can't possibly do it.

192
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:33,460
 And Homer plays the piano so beautifully.

193
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:35,460
 No, Ethel, I'm sure you'll understand.

194
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:39,460
 And it'll be very good practice for you to play with someone who really knows music.

195
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,460
 Now, I'll put your violin under your chin and follow me.

196
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:42,460
 What do you mean?

197
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:45,460
 Mother, I can't possibly do it.

198
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:47,460
 But of course you can't do it!

199
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,460
 No great thought in the same talk, Molly, saying.

200
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:52,460
 Ethel, what did you tell Homer you'd play with him?

201
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:55,460
 Because, Mother, I think he's the nicest boy I ever met.

202
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:57,460
 I must have just lost my head.

203
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:59,460
 What, certainly quite a way to lose your head.

204
00:07:59,460 --> 00:07:59,860
 a head.

205
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:13,220
 Would you like to look at the evening paper Sam?

206
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,060
 No thanks Alice.

207
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:16,100
 I have something else to read here.

208
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,180
 Where?

209
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:18,020
 Where's Henry?

210
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:19,660
 He went out a little while ago.

211
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:22,980
 Well Alice, you mind if I bring up an old question once more?

212
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:24,420
 What's the matter Sam?

213
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:27,340
 Do you really feel that Henry gets very much from his association

214
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,340
 with Homer?

215
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:32,740
 Why Sam Aldrich, do you realize how many worthwhile things Homer is really interested in?

216
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:33,940
 Frankly no.

217
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:35,140
 Why he loves music.

218
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:38,640
 And tonight he's going over to call on some girl to like music just as much as he does.

219
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,140
 Yes?

220
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:39,640
 Mother!

221
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,140
 Yes Mary!

222
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:43,240
 You know who it was, Henry was talking to on the phone just before he went out?

223
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,140
 No, I don't, Mary.

224
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:44,840
 Why do you ask?

225
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:49,140
 My mother, he was talking very low and making plans to do something I just know he shouldn't be doing.

226
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:49,840
 What's that Mary?

227
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,840
 Yes, he was, Father.

228
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:54,940
 I heard him say he'd be in somebody's house right across the street from someplace looking out the window.

229
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:59,940
 And if somebody got into some kind of trouble, he was to go to the window and pull down the shade, and Henry would see it and do something.

230
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,940
 Mary, may I ask what it is you're talking about?

231
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:09,940
 No, Sam, the whole thing is perfectly clear. If Henry had gone with Homer instead of where he has gone, you wouldn't be sitting here worrying about what he's going to get into.

232
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:11,940
 (whistling)

233
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,940
 (whistling)

234
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:15,940
 (whistling)

235
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,940
 (whistling)

236
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,940
 (whistling)

237
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:21,940
 (whistling)

238
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:23,940
 (whistling)

239
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,940
 (whistling)

240
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,940
 Good evening, Homer. Would you come in?

241
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:28,940
 Good evening, Mrs. Marco.

242
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:29,940
 We're so glad to see you.

243
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,940
 I don't know where we look forward to anything so much

244
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:33,940
 as we have to. You're coming over tonight.

245
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:34,940
 Have?

246
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:35,940
 Yes. Now, who's taking things off?

247
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:36,940
 White.

248
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,940
 I don't think there's any sense in taking them off.

249
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,700
 You can't say with your coat and gloves on.

250
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,540
 Yeah, let me have this.

251
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,180
 Well, hello there, young man.

252
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:44,540
 Oh, hello, Mr. Ma.

253
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,060
 Why, they tell me you're something pretty special

254
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,100
 on the piano, my boy.

255
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,100
 They do?

256
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:50,340
 Well, gee, I'm not really that good, Mr. Ma.

257
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,900
 Well, come on, let's go in the living room.

258
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,820
 Is Ethel here?

259
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:54,780
 Ethel?

260
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:55,300
 Ethel?

261
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:55,900
 Oh, yes, my goodness.

262
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:56,460
 Where is she?

263
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:57,460
 Ethel!

264
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:58,940
 She had a spitting headache before dinner.

265
00:09:58,940 --> 00:09:59,860
 Oh, Ethel!

266
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:00,980
 Oh, well, look, in that taste.

267
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:02,580
 Don't you think I might just as well go?

268
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:03,060
 I mean--

269
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,380
 What are you here?

270
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:07,380
 I mean, how am I having real idea right here?

271
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:08,220
 Well, she was Ethel.

272
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,220
 I was hoping...

273
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:10,520
 I have the worst news for you, Homer.

274
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,520
 You have?

275
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,520
 What do you think happened?

276
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:16,220
 I just discovered a few minutes ago that every string on my violin is broken.

277
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,220
 It is?

278
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,220
 I mean they are.

279
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,220
 Boy!

280
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,220
 But now, that's all they couldn't be all broken.

281
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,220
 Yes, they are, mother.

282
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,220
 Well, that doesn't make any difference.

283
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:24,220
 Right over there in that table drawer, there are a lot of strings.

284
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:25,220
 Not anymore, Father.

285
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:26,220
 They all got thrown out by accident.

286
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,220
 Well, that's too bad.

287
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:28,220
 Let's go to a movie.

288
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:29,220
 Yeah, young man.

289
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:32,220
 We've heard that we'll play the violin, but we've never heard you play the piano.

290
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:34,220
 Come on, sit down now and give us a treat.

291
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,220
 Yes, dear.

292
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:36,220
 Well, not go on, Homer.

293
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:37,220
 Well...

294
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,220
 She was.

295
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:41,220
 It's something to matter, Homer.

296
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:43,220
 No. No.

297
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:45,220
 Homer, that was very good.

298
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:47,220
 You like that?

299
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:53,220
 Would you excuse me a minute while I pull a window shade down?

300
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,220
 This shade?

301
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:56,220
 What do you have to do that for?

302
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,220
 There's a street light outside of shining in my eyes.

303
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:00,220
 Oh, I didn't realize.

304
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,220
 Of course.

305
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:03,220
 Do I... do I hear anything?

306
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:05,220
 Do you hear anything, Homer? What is it?

307
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,060
 What is it?

308
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,580
 - Right, it's not strange.

309
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:08,980
 I thought I heard the telephone.

310
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:10,140
 - Really?

311
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,260
 - Hey, did you hear the phone?

312
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:12,620
 - No, and I don't believe homework

313
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:13,460
 would have heard it either.

314
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:14,820
 The phone's down a order, all evening.

315
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,940
 - It's out of order, and you mean?

316
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,020
 - Oh boy.

317
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,900
 - Oh, but were you expecting a call?

318
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:22,300
 - Wait, no, just in a way I would.

319
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:24,420
 - Oh, come on Homer, let's hear the blue daddies.

320
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,140
 You didn't need coaxing like this this morning.

321
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:28,500
 My goodness, you just ripped right into that piano.

322
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,100
 - Oh, I don't need coaxing.

323
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:30,940
 It's just--

324
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,620
 - Now young man, all I've heard all day

325
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:34,820
 is that's what telling how you know your music.

326
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,980
 I know but I know.

327
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:38,180
 Right now Homer.

328
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:40,100
 That window shade is hanging crooked.

329
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,020
 I want to let it up and pull it down again.

330
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:46,020
 Oh, did you hit yourself?

331
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:46,980
 I'm all right.

332
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,980
 Steve, get the poor boy out from under that shade.

333
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,820
 I can't get off from under it, Mrs. Moffrey.

334
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,340
 She whizzed.

335
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:54,820
 Homer, what are you waving that hat inside of the window for?

336
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,500
 Oh, am I waving again?

337
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:56,980
 Yes, dear.

338
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:58,820
 And if I were you, I'd put it down before you break it.

339
00:11:58,820 --> 00:11:59,460
 Yes ma'am.

340
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:00,740
 She whizzed.

341
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:04,740
 Well, I guess you want me to play the piano

342
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:05,940
 Don't you think that's right?

343
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:07,440
 Well.

344
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:13,340
 Did I hear something just the piano, dear?

345
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:15,640
 There there it is.

346
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,540
 That's the doorbell.

347
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:17,040
 It is.

348
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:17,940
 It's the doorbell.

349
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:20,240
 Whoever it is, don't answer the door until Homer is played.

350
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,740
 Now that's what we can't do a thing like that.

351
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:22,840
 All right, I'll go to the doorbell.

352
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,240
 But Homer, don't play like it.

353
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,140
 I won't.

354
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:27,640
 Hello, what's the matter with your telephone?

355

 I can't even know the thing room.

358

 Oh, hello, Henry.

359
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,740
 Boy, isn't this a coincidence.

360
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:34,640
 Listen, Homer, I've been trying to get you on the phone.

361
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,140
 You've gotta come out with me right away.

362
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:37,640
 I have, okay, where's my coat?

363
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,840
 Now Henry, homie, sit starting to play.

364
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,240
 You can't have him till he's finished.

365
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,240
 But Homer, you should've been out here long ago.

366
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,940
 Is it something pretty serious, Henry?

367
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,640
 Boy, I'll say. Now get your things on.

368
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,840
 Well, we'll just have to take Ethel's way for it, Homer,

369
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,040
 about how well you can play.

370
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,540
 Or G, Mrs. Moffatt, you don't have to worry about that.

371
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,340
 Boy, when Homer sits down at the piano--

372
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,340
 Come on, Henry.

373
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:57,440
 Do you know how long he studied music, Mrs. Moffatt?

374
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,340
 Ten years.

375
00:12:58,340 --> 00:12:59,040
 Ten years?

376
00:12:59,040 --> 00:12:59,940
 That's right, Mr. Moffatt.

377
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:00,940
 That gives you some idea.

378
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:01,940
 Come on, Henry.

379
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:04,540
 And, jeez, you are here in turn to Pat Aruski's menu at.

380

 - Really? - Henry, will you come on?

381
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:07,540
 - Goodbye, Homer. - Goodbye.

00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:09,940

 The problem committee has been trying to get somebody

386

 for the Women's Club meeting this Friday,

387
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:18,340
 and he's a very person for us to have.

388

 Well, they've got to be one of your children.

389
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:22,340
 We're going to have some readings,

390

 and if Mrs. Hardy's going to give a talk on native flowers,

391
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:28,340

 Now getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldrich and his friend Homer Brown.

471
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:35,800
 Just because Homer led his girl into believing he was musically inclined,

472
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,800
 when he was really operating a neighbor's automatic player piano,

473
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:43,800
 he has now received an invitation to play a solo at a meeting of the local women's club.

474
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:47,800
 The scene opens in Homer's living room. His mother is speaking.

475
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:50,800
 Homer, I don't want to hear this subject even mentioned again.

476
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,800
 Yes, mother. You're going to play it that meeting of the women's club

477
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,800
 and you're going to do a very nice job of it.

478
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,800
 Put 'em on the women and look at it this way.

479
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,800
 Doing a thing like this to me can make me hate music forever.

480
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,960
 Homer, do you realize what this whole thing means to me?

481
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:05,440
 But ten years I've been coaxing you, I've been begging you to keep on with your lessons.

482
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,440
 And now I don't have a clear sky, somebody certainly appreciates you,

483
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,640
 and you ought to say no to them.

484
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:12,400
 But don't you realize Ms. Snyder gave me up as hopeless?

485
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,640
 She said she wouldn't even give me lessons anymore.

486
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,840
 And that's why I want you to go in this concert with your chin out and show Ms. Snyder.

538
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,280
 I don't yet think you can just call me a house or thing like that.

539
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,680
 But home has been planning to do this and getting ready for it,

540
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,080
 ever since you invited him.

541
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:50,280
 Oh, why don't you go down to Robin's music store and ask them to loan you a piano?

542
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,280
 They'd be glad to do it.

543
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:51,880
 They would.

544
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,880
 Now, wait a minute, Mother.

545
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,480
 I mean, how would you get the piano over there?

546
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,480
 Your father can loan you one of his trucks.

547
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,680
 And you can get Henry as every other boy to help you move.

548
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,080
 I know, but now Homer.

549
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,680
 Whether the will is a way, you're going to get that piano

550
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,980
 and you're going to play.

551
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:22,480
 - Sam, will you have some bacon? - No, thank you, Alice.

552
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,980
 Now, the adults sit there and salt

553
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,420
 Just because I want you to go to that concert this afternoon.

554
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:28,080
 Alice, I am not sulky.

555
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,760
 I simply want to point out that you're asking me to sit through a program

556
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,080
 in which I'll hear some readings,

557
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,720
 a talk on native plants and home of brown play the piano.

558
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,080
 But, Margaret, for charity.

559
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,680
 Yes, and I've supported that charity no blip for seven years,

560
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,960
 but this is asking too much.

561
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:40,880
 Hi, Henry.

562
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,180
 She was Homer's at you?

563
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:42,920
 Yes, sure.

564
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:43,760
 Good morning, Homer.

565
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,280
 This must be quite a day for you.

566
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,320
 Boy, I'll say.

567
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,080
 I didn't sleep a wink last night.

568
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,960
 We're all looking forward to that concert.

569
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:50,960
 You are.

570
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,320
 Hello, Mr. Aldrich.

571
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,440
 Good morning.

572
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,200
 Henry, can I use your phone a second?

573
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,600
 Sure, come on out here in the hall.

574
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,880
 - Will you have some breakfast, Helma?

575
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,800
 - No thanks, I couldn't eat a thing.

576
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,400
 Who you gonna call, Emma? Who you gonna call?

577
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:04,240
 - Ethel's mother, there's just one possible chance.

578
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,080
 Hello?

579
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:05,920
 - Number please.

580
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,120
 - Ellam 212.

581
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,480
 - Ellam 212?

582
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,520
 - Henry, come back and finish your breakfast.

583
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,680
 - Yes, mother. Homer, I'll be right back.

584
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,520
 - Hello?

585
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,160
 - Hello, is this you, Ethel? This is Homer.

586
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,200
 - Oh, hello, Homer.

587
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,920
 - Look, could you tell your mother it looks as though

588
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,560
 we can have the piano?

589
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,800
 - Oh my goodness, why not?

590
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,400
 Well, we can't use my father's truck, see?

591
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,200
 It's a pretty new one, see?

592
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,200
 Well, he's afraid the piano would scratch you.

593
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,600
 Homer, what are we gonna do?

594
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,200
 Well, what I was gonna suggest was, why don't you play the violin?

595
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,200
 Oh, I... play the violin!

596
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,600
 Sure, at least you wouldn't have to hold it in the truck.

597
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,000
 And listen, Ethel, would you like to go to the movies tonight?

598
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 To the movie?

599
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 Sure, but I don't think I've got a call for you.

600
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,600
 I'll meet you down at the movie, see?

601
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,600
 Oh, but Homer!

602
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,600
 Bye-bye!

603
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,600
 Hey, Henry!

604
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,600
 Homer, did you get old people?

605
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,200
 I'll say, boy!

606
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,300
 Homer, are you sure you won't have a little breakfast with us?

607
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:58,200
 Wait, as a matter of fact, Mrs. Old, which I think I would enjoy a little.

608
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:01,200
 Whether you take this plate out in the kitchen, you'll find some scrambled eggs.

609
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,000
 And give me some too, Homer. Okay.

610
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,200
 Well, do you know how I suddenly feel? They never felt better in my life.

611
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,200
 What happened to Homer?

612
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,700
 Sam, I think Homer has a right to feel rather pleased with himself today.

613
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:14,200
 Now, Henry, don't you wish you'd gone on with your music as I begged you to do?

614
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:14,700
 Well...

615
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:18,200
 Down at the bottom of your heart, Henry, don't you wish just a bit you were in Homer's shoes?

616
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:21,200
 Well, I... and Sam, it's really your fault as much as it is, Henry.

617
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,020
 My fault.

618
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:24,200
 Yes, dear. If you backed me up five years ago,

619
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,840
 then you'd be hearing Henry instead of Homer

620
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,560
 when you go to that concert this afternoon.

621
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,800
 What do you mean when I go to it?

622
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,640
 I'll answer the phone.

623
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,400
 As a matter of fact, Henry, I think it's a shame

624
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,680
 for you not to try to piano once more.

625
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,520
 Hello?

626
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,720
 Hello? I want to speak to Homer Brown.

627
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,460
 To who?

628
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:38,060
 Palmer?

629
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:38,600
 Yes, sir.

630
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,440
 To Homer.

631
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,440
 Hey, Homer.

632
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,120
 What Henry?

633
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:41,720
 What is it?

634
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,360
 You weren't on the telephone.

635
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,480
 Do you want to just an impulse mother, is it?

636
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,480
 No, it's some man.

637
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,840
 We'll hear Homer eggs.

638
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:48,560
 Hello?

639
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:51,160
 Homer, may I ask just what this is all about?

640
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,660
 What's that? Who is this?

641
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:53,660
 It's your father!

642
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:55,860
 Have you been spreading rumors behind my bag?

643
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:57,160
 Spreading my father?

644
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,560
 When did I ever tell you that I was afraid of piano?

645
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,860
 What scratched my trunk?

646
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:02,660
 Oh, did they say that?

647
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:04,660
 Mrs. Muffin just phoned me here in the house.

648
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:07,860
 And Homer, your mother says you're going to get the boys together

649
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:10,360
 and go down to Robinson's music store and get that piano.

650
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,060
 Understand?

651
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:11,860
 Yes, father.

652
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:13,860
 And you're going to play in that concert?

653
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:14,460
 Goodbye.

654
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:15,760
 Goodbye, father.

00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:16,860
 Here's your eggs, Homer.

00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:18,060

00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:19,460

 In fact, up to now, we've enjoyed our entire program,

00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:40,220
 I'm sure.

00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:41,700
 Before introducing the next number,

663
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:42,860
 however, there will have to be-- I'm

664
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:46,140
 afraid-- a slight inhibition of a half a minute or so.

665
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:48,660
 So if you'll just excuse me, I'll have to step back stage

666
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:50,200
 make sure about something.

667
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,740
 Sam, what are you supposed to trouble is?

668
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:54,340
 Alice, how did we have to sit right down here in the front row?

669
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:56,700
 Because, dear, I thought it would please Homer's mother.

670
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:59,140
 Look, it will brown over there in the next row.

671
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:01,220
 Anyone would think Homer was something wonderful.

672
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:02,580
 Now, Sam, can you blame him?

673
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:05,580
 Perhaps a year from now, you'll feel just as proud as he does.

674
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:06,520
 How do you say that?

675
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,020
 You seem to snider over there.

676
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:09,420
 I just had a talk with this amateur.

677
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:11,020
 She's promised to come over to the house tomorrow

678
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:12,460
 so Henry can start his lessons again.

 Now, there, ladies and gentlemen.

681
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:18,360
 I may as well tell you quite frankly what the trouble was.

682
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:20,440
 The summer isn't a piano we're trying to borrow.

683
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,360
 It was not delivered when it should have been.

684
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:25,760
 However, I'm very pleased to announce that I have some good news for you.

685
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,760
 The boys have arrived with the piano,

686
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,760
 and if you'll bear with us for another half minutes,

687
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,760
 they'll roll it on to the stage.

688
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:35,960
 - Then there's Henry. - I see him. Don't quite, Alice.

689
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:38,360
 After all all he's doing is pushing the piano.

690
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,560
 I know, dear, but he hasn't any next time.

691
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,760
 Alice, why doesn't all my help push the piano?

692
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,760
 Because he's probably saving himself.

693
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,760
 And now, ladies and gentlemen,

694
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:49,760
 I'm sure we're all going to have a great deal of pleasure in listening to one of our
