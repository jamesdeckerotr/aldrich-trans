 Postum presents...

00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 Henry!

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 Henry Oldridge!

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 Coming Mother!

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 Postum presents the Oldridge family written by Clifford Goldsmith.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 The family brought to you by Postam, attempting wholesome drink for all the family.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 Postam.

 [Music]

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 You know friends, one of the things that makes music so enjoyable and relaxing

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 is the perfect harmony of every section of the orchestra with every other section.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,880
 But suppose that just the opposite were true.

14
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,860
 Suppose the brasses played in one key in tempo,

15
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:05,220
 the strings in another, and so on.

16
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:07,960
 (dramatic music)

17
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:14,080
 Well, that would make for anything but harmony, wouldn't it?

18
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,200
 Well, it's much the same idea when your nerves are out of tune.

19
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,360
 Your whole life is out of harmony.

20
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,920
 You ring a definitely discordant note among your friends.

21
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,560
 So why not just ask yourself next time you're edgy and jumpy

22
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:31,080
 if maybe coffee is to blame. It might very well be, you know, for even though many people

23
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:35,840
 can drink coffee without getting nervous, many others cannot. If you think you're one

24
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:41,560
 of those others, switch to post-em by all means. Post-em contains no caffeine or other

25
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:47,520
 stimulant, nothing that can set your nerves on edge. And as a mealtime drink, post-em is

26
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:53,560
 out and out delicious. So start drinking post-em regularly instead of coffee, and then see if

27
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:59,080
 If you don't soon fiend, feel completely in tune again, thanks to your switch to hearty,

28
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:17,420
 delightful post-em.

29
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:22,800
 Give a teenage boy a problem to solve, and you start what always turns out to be a wrestling

00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,720
 match with the boy and the problem alternately throwing each other. Henry

31
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:33,400
 Aldrich however usually ends up victorious but gasping. The scene opens at

32
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,760
 the Aldrich breakfast table.

33
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:37,760
 Could I have the cream please father?

34
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,760
 Here you are Henry.

35
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:43,640
 Thank you. Boy. Here it isn't necessary to eat your breakfast as though you were

36
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:47,400
 going to some kind of a race. But mother I'm in a hurry. I've got a very full

37
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,240
 day. Boy. Henry can't you slow down just a little?

38
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,880
 Alice, I don't like to undermine your discipline, but I happen to know Henry does have a very full day.

39
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,880
 Boy, I'll say.

40
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:00,180
 He's got to empty the ashes in the cellar. He's got to pick up the backyard.

41
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,680
 Father, that is the kind of full day I was thinking of.

42
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,680
 I've got this list.

43
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,080
 See? What list, Henry?

44
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,280
 She was look at it. Just look at it.

45
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:12,780
 One grandfather's plot, one fur coat, man's, one dining room table with chairs, one rose bush.

46
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,880
 Now, wait a minute. What is that you're reading?

47
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,580
 My list. My list.

48
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:20,380
 One pound of butter with muffins, one fireplace, an egg beer, and a cigar.

49
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:21,420
 What's that, Henry?

50
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:23,220
 A cigar mother for Homer.

51
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:23,860
 What's that?

52
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,220
 Homer smoking cigars?

53
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:25,820
 No, father.

54
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:26,740
 He doesn't smoke it.

55
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,260
 He just charges the ramen his pocket

56
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:29,580
 because he's got a lot of money.

57
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,860
 Henry, may I ask what this is all about?

58
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:32,940
 Did I tell your mother?

59
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,420
 It's for the school play.

60
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:36,780
 And I've got to get all that list by tomorrow night.

61
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,060
 How about the ashes?

62
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:39,380
 The ashes, father?

63
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:40,700
 We don't need any ashes.

64
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,540
 Henry, do you mind not asking why?

65
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,540
 If the play is going to be put on tomorrow night,

66
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:47,460
 you hadn't started to get any of these things before now

67
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,180
 because they didn't tell me until yesterday

68
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:52,740
 that I was to be plot man. Jimmy Bartlett was before that and they fired him.

69
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:57,540
 They fired him? Sure. He wasn't good at getting anything at all, so I, so I gave him the lead.

70
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:58,260
 Henry!

71
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,180
 What, Mary?

72
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:02,280
 Now I asked what Mother's egg beater is doing in your lunchbox.

73
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,180
 That's that, Mary?

74
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:06,200
 Oh, and now, the minute, Mother. I was going to tell you about that egg beer.

75
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,060
 Only Mary brought it up too soon.

76
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:10,980
 Hi, kids. Henry, why are you taking my egg beater?

77
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:15,800
 It's for Kathleen. She makes an entrance. She's from the kitchen, and it shows that's where she came from.

78
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,620
 Much, sir?

79
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,860
 Kathleen, Father. Her mother's dead.

80
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:23,540
 Kathleen's mother sure in the play and she's keeping house for her father Homer

81
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:27,900
 She's homers unspoiled daughter

82
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,000
 Kathleen

83
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,900
 Kathleen Anderson is Homer Brown's daughter. What's the wrong with that Mary?

84
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:39,460
 She's only a couple of months older than he is and as a matter of fact as a man he says Homer looks more like an old man than anyone in the school

85
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:44,540
 Henry if I let you take our egg beater. Will you see that it gets back to me? Oh sure mother?

86
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:49,520
 Yeah, I hope you don't think I'd go and leave a perfectly good thing like an egg beater over to school do you well

87
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:54,440
 Then I'll put it back in your spot. Thank you and Mary the next time you go searching through my lunchbox

88
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:57,920
 Please ask for permission and then what are you doing under the table?

89
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:01,480
 I'm just looking at the legs father. I'm just saying it though come off

90
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:06,680
 I take it over and you take it over when you take what over where the dining room table for the play

91
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:11,600
 Henry you are not under any circumstance is going to take this table. I can't have it

92
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,320
 But gee, was what's home we're going to eat off of?

93
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,320
 May I ask what we're going to eat off of?

94
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,420
 Couldn't we be the kitchen father? It's only for three days.

95
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:22,820
 Henry, do you remember last year when we loaned our sofa for the school play?

96
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:26,220
 Yes, father, but that wasn't my fault it fell off the back of the car.

97
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:30,720
 That isn't the point. This dining room table has been in this house for twenty years.

98
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,920
 If there were those in your school who have never seen a dining room table before,

99
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:37,220
 you may bring them over one at a time and let them take a look at it.

100
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:39,120
 But that's as far as I'm willing to go.

101
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,680
 Okay, then how about how about a fur coat?

102
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,600
 Can I borrow one of those a fur coat?

103
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:49,460
 It has to be a man's fur coat. It's for Homer. He's very wealthy seeing the fur has to be on the inside

104
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:52,360
 Yes, well, you've come to the wrong man for a thing like that

105
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:56,800
 It doesn't matter. In fact, I'd like to get a pair of her gloves for him too, and maybe your fur hat

106
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,520
 Exactly where is the scene laid in his dining room? Oh

107
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:07,080
 Homer comes into his dining room wearing a fur coat a fur hat and fur gloves and sits down to dinner

108
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:12,460
 Sure, I see he can't get in the cold. He can't do you think all to get some or what?

109
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:18,360
 Hi, Henry already for school. I'll be right in one second Homer. Good morning Homer

110
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:24,260
 What's that you have in your mouth a piece of bubble gum Alice? What was that? That was me mr.

111
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,840
 All rich good morning

112
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:32,140
 Homer I wouldn't snap my gum in here if I were you oh sure excuse me come on home while I get my things on okay

113
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:34,140
 Don't run, dear. I'm not running.

114
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:36,140
 Listen, Henry, I had an idea last night.

115
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:41,140
 You know that place in the play where I take a thousand dollars out of my pocket and give it to Jimmy Bartlett?

116
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:45,140
 Yeah? Well, gee, I wouldn't have a whole thousand just losing my pocket, would I?

117
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:48,140
 Why not? I'd be afraid to carry it around, Henry.

118
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:51,140
 Why don't they have a cash register that I take it out of?

119
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:54,140
 A cash register? Right in your dining room?

120
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:56,140
 Why can't I afford one I'm rich?

121
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:59,140
 I know, but rich people have things like saves.

122
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:01,140
 A safe? Well, I'd settle for a safe.

123
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:06,100
 safe. As a matter of fact, that's a very good idea. Sure, Homer. Henry, you forgot

124
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:10,500
 something in here. Oh, gee whiz. I know what it is. It's my darn list. And that

125
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:14,260
 Henry is one reason why I don't want you to borrow this dining room table. Father,

126
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:17,620
 I agree with you. I agree with you entirely. I've driven the dining room

127
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:21,540
 table right out of my head. Good. Now, if you could only get me a safe, I'd be

128
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:25,940
 perfectly happy. A what, dear? A safe mother. There's a very important place

129
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:30,020
 where Homer has to have, has to have. Henry, do you realize how much a safe

130
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:34,180
 ways. Well I don't mean a big safe father like in a bank. I mean something about

131
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:38,980
 about. Yeah well you can just drive the safe out of your head doom. You mean I

132
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:43,940
 can't have one? Hey Henry we're gonna be late. I'm coming Homer and as a matter of

133
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:49,620
 fact I'm sort of sorry ever took this darn job. Goodbye Henry. Goodbye. Henry goodbye.

134
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:56,260
 I guess he didn't hear you dear. Sam. Well. Do you don't you think we ought to

135
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:59,620
 contribute a little something more than just an egg beater to this play.

136
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,620
 You mean you want to let Henry have this table?

137
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:06,100
 Now dear, I didn't say this table. But don't you think you could at least find him a safe?

138
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,860
 Alice, are you? Are you?

139
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:11,540
 Sam, this is the first time I've ever seen Henry get so wrapped up in anything.

140
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:14,100
 Why, dear, it's the most important thing that has ever happened to him.

141
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,700
 But where am I going to get a safe?

142
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:20,020
 You've a lot of influence, Sam. And if you explain it for a high school play,

143
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:23,940
 my goodness, I should think there'd be lots of people who could fare us safe for three nights.

144
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:36,940
 (Music)

145
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:43,940
 Hello, Santa Villa Press Office. Yes? Have we got a what? Sure we got a safe.

146
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:49,940
 Who's this being? Oh yes, Mr. Albridge. Now could you tell me again what it is you want?

147
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:58,240
 to play with? Oh, you're in a play. Oh, I got you. Well, we got one here. Yes. We're

148
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,940
 three and a half tons. What's that?

 [MUSIC]

150
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:13,940
 Hello, Harriet. Can you hear me?

151
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:17,940
 Yes, Alice. What we need is a nice warm, heavy coat that's lined with fur.

152
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:21,940
 It's for a rather wealthy man that's a widower.

153
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:23,940
 How about my Persian lamb?

154
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:26,940
 If you're a Persian lamb, Harriet, it has to be a man's coat.

155
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:30,940
 Alice, where would I ever get a man's coat, especially a furline man?

156
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:33,940
 Well, I just thought you might possibly know of someone that has one.

157
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:37,940
 Just a minute, Harriet. Henry, are you home from school already?

158
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:40,940
 Yes, Mother. Where's Mary? I think I've got a little job for her.

159
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:44,940
 Dear, I'm talking with your aunt Harriet about a fur coat for you. You are old boy.

160
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:46,940
 Alice, I have another idea.

161
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:47,940
 Really?

162
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:50,440
 Often one of my colleges is a leather windbreaker.

163
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:53,940
 It's mine, but it's tough like a man's and it's lined with rabbit.

164
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:54,940
 With rabbit?

165
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:55,940
 It's hip blank, Dallas.

166
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:56,940
 Just a minute, Harriet.

167
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:59,940
 Henry would wrap it down to the hips, be alright.

168
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:00,940
 Just to the hips, mother.

169
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:02,940
 And have Homer's late show.

 Hello, Santa Feel Colin Fiend!

172
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:21,940
 Oh, hello, my dear Aldrich!

173
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:23,940
 What's that, a saint?

174
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:27,940
 Mr. Aldrich, I'm sorry, but I'm afraid I didn't hear you.

175
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:29,940
 Did you say you were looking for a saint?

176
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:30,940
 For your son?

177
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:37,260
 Oh, oh now I understand you. Oh yes indeed we have a very small safe. It's only about

178
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:44,940
 18 years high. Far away? You mean take it away? But Mr. Orridge it's cemented right into the wall.

00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:58,940
 Mary!

181
00:10:58,940 --> 00:10:59,940
 Mary!

182
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:02,540
 Henry, what are you dragging that dead bush into the house for?

183
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:04,620
 Well, that's just what I started to tell you.

184
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:07,260
 You know that hat you have, Mary, with the roses on it?

185
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:08,260
 Yes.

186
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:12,300
 Well, look, I'm not asking to let me do it myself because I might damage it, but I'm

187
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,140
 perfectly willing to let you do it.

188
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:16,420
 And I'll even give you a line of credit on the program.

189
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:17,420
 If I do what?

190
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,260
 Haven't I made it clear?

191
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:22,780
 All you have to do is very carefully take the roses off your hat and sort of tie them

192
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:23,780
 on this boy.

193
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:26,380
 Why, Henry, all the joy won't do any such thing.

194
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:32,760
 Which part is it you object to do you think I'd feel when the curtain goes up and there's my hat spread all over a bush Henry

195
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:37,980
 You want it on the telephone? I am mother. Oh boy is this a day? I bet that's about the oysters

196
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:44,620
 The what the oysters I've been having some trouble digging up some oysters for the second act. Hello. Hello. Is this a senator?

197
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:49,360
 Don't fish market. What's that? Is this Henry? Oh, she was is that you Kathleen?

198
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:54,580
 I told my mother about our dining room table and she wants to ask you a couple questions. Sure, Kathleen

199
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,580
 I'd be glad to answer anything.

200
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:57,580
 Hello Henry.

201
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:59,580
 Oh, hello Mrs. Anderson.

202
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:02,580
 Now tell me dear, just how did you plan to use our table?

203
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:07,580
 Well, look Mrs. Anderson, this phone that's going to eat off it, his father helped settle the West.

204
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:08,580
 See? The West.

205
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:10,580
 The West. The West.

206
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:11,580
 Yeah?

207
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:13,580
 And his portrait hangs right over Homer's sideboard.

208
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:16,580
 I got the sideboard all right from Mrs. Lawson and...

209
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:18,580
 Oh boy, it completely slipped my list.

210
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:19,580
 What's the matter Henry?

211
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:21,580
 Do you have a mirror with Cupids?

212
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:22,580
 What's that?

213
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:25,180
 A mirror with Cupids aren't the hangover a mantle.

214
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:27,480
 No, no I don't, Henry.

215
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,180
 Wouldn't just a plain mirror do.

216
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:32,780
 Oh no, Jimmy Bartlett has to stand in front of it and kiss Kathleen.

217
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:33,980
 Kathleen?

218
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,880
 Every boss that kisses Kathleen?

219
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,980
 Yes ma'am.

220
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:40,080
 Frankly I'm not any too much in favor of that part myself.

221
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,880
 But a play calls for a mirror with Cupids to be kissed under.

222
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,180
 And what can I do? My hands are tied.

223
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:47,380
 Henry, I just happened to remember.

224
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:49,580
 Would a mirror with a deer head help?

225
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:50,880
 With a wad?

226
00:12:50,880 --> 00:13:02,180
 We have one with a heel, deer headcogs at the top, but no cupids. She the only thing is, "Tell me frankly, Mrs. Anderson. When you stand off at a distance, could you mistake the deer for a cupid?"

227
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:07,880
 What's that? It has horns, Peasant. Yes. Well, don't the horns spread out a little like wings?

 [Music]

229
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,880
 Sam!

230
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,880
 Yeah? Well, hello there Alice.

231
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:27,880
 Sam, I'm sorry to bother you down here at the office, but I simply got to have your help.

232
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,880
 That's alright, I'm glad you dropped in.

233
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,880
 Alice, I think I have an idea that's going to solve the whole business.

234
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,880
 Well, what is it, dear?

235
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:37,600
 I rent a safe that has to be hauled all the way up to the high school auditorium

236
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,120
 when they have steel lockers right in their own gymnasium.

237
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,120
 Steel lockers.

238
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,200
 All they have to do is move one of them on stage and have somebody in the art department

239
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,840
 paint a combination dial on it.

240
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,960
 Now Sam, a gymnasium locker.

241
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,440
 Why when the students see it they'll simply howl?

242
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:53,040
 But Alice, you realize I haven't touched one bit of work all day.

243
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,400
 The only thing I've done is call people about sapes.

244
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:58,040
 Dear, that isn't any more than Henry's done.

245
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:02,200
 And Sam, where am I going to find a gold-plated chandelier with old-fashioned gas lights on

246
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,200
 it?

247
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:06,300
 Here we must know someone in this town who owns a thing like that.

248
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:11,200
 Alice, I'll do what I can to find a safe, but I put my foot down on a go-fated gas-like chandelier.

249
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:27,100
 Now listen, Henry, for the last time and listen to eat them.

250
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:30,100
 Homer, don't you realize that this is for the junior class play?

251
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,000
 What if it is?

252
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,900
 I'm not asking to eat the oysters for me.

253
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:36,900
 I'm asking you to eat them for the junior class and I'm still not gonna eat them.

254
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:41,900
 If I knew the thing like this was gonna happen in a fruit a couple of courses and popped into the sophomore class.

255
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:48,900
 Homer, you don't have to eat the whole dozen oysters. Not even a half a dozen oysters. You just nibble at two or three.

256
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,900
 You're rich, you can afford to throw some away.

257
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:54,900
 Well, nobody will ever know I'm rich. Not if they see the dining room table you got me.

258
00:14:54,900 --> 00:15:00,900
 Homer, nobody's going to see it's made of saw horses. I got a tablecloth purposely that comes right down to the floor.

259
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:05,180
 sure sure and it looks like a bed now tell you one more thing in the I'm not

260
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:09,100
 going to wear a Prussian land it isn't pushing land or red Persian land and

261
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:12,260
 that's a beautiful coat my aunt hurt paid a lot of money for what's the

262
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:15,780
 difference I come under the stage wearing a woman's Persian land coat and a

263
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:17,820
 muff for a half

264
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:22,620
 it's just out of the sawhorse and start to eat oysters that I can't stand what kind

265
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:26,580
 of a millionaire do you think I am all right Homer all right I know what I'm

266
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:30,620
 gonna do I'm gonna sit down right a lot of resignation to the junior class and

267
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:34,880
 you're gonna quit before you even get me some catch-up for my oysters or a save

268
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:39,020
 for me to keep my thousand dollars in all right Homer so far as I'm concerned

269
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:44,400
 you can keep your money in your pocket I got it all fixed for you what's that

270
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:50,420
 Mary is that a rose bush of course it is now listen Mary those are nothing but

271
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:53,540
 ordinary sweet peas sure they are sure they are

272
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:58,420
 I'm gonna notice from the last row from the last row who's gonna sit there I am

273
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:02,420
 Oh, I can say it, Marie. That's the last row. That's the last row.

274
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:06,420
 So, Henry, I'm not going to tear apart my very best hat with roses on it.

275
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:09,420
 Would you be any more pleased if I got out that old hat with cherries on it?

276
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:13,420
 Cherries. Are they canned? What's that? I like canned cherries.

277
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:17,420
 Homer, will you please tell me what place there is in the play where you eat cherries?

278
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:19,420
 I could eat them instead of oysters.

279
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:23,420
 Off my hat? What's that? You've got a hat with oysters on this?

280
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:26,420
 Well, so far, guys, I'm concerned. I'm not even interested.

281
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:28,420
 I hope nobody thinks I'm interested.

282
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,420
 I'm going to resign.

283
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:33,420
 Well, isn't anybody going to answer the phone?

284
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,420
 Why should I answer the phone?

285
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:38,420
 As far as I'm concerned, a junior class can...

286
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:41,420
 Well, gee, what kind of a house is this?

287
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:42,420
 Hello?

288
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:44,420
 Is this Mr. Olrich's residence?

289
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,420
 Yes, sir, Mr. Olrich is in here right now.

290
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:49,420
 Well, about that safety inquired about just what kind is it he wants.

291
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:50,420
 That's safe?

292
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:53,420
 Wait, just a nice, good size.

293
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:56,020
 Well, you know, what kind of you got?

294
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:58,220
 You want a single or a double door?

295
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:00,060
 She wish you got one with a double door?

296
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,180
 That would be good.

297
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:02,220
 How big is it?

298
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:04,260
 And so big, five feet high, maybe?

299
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:05,740
 Gee, that's saying swell.

300
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:07,380
 It's got to be hauled up there, you know?

301
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,620
 Sure, but we've got to have it.

302
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:10,380
 It's for a very rich man.

303
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,860
 Yeah, well, then I guess he won't mind the carnage, will he?

304
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:13,660
 Oh, no.

305
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:15,980
 She wish he's got $1,000 in this pocket.

306
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,500
 He's got to do something with it.

307
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,500
 OK, I'll get a crew on it right away.

310
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:33,940
 Sam, I think the least you can do is go up to the high school and see that play tonight.

311
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:36,940
 Alice, do you realize in six weeks my income tax will be due?

312
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:39,940
 And this is one of the few evenings I'm going to have free to get it straightened out.

313
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:44,940
 Just the same year it seems to be needed when your own son is practically putting on a play single-handed.

314
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:48,940
 Alice, where's the inkwell that's supposed to be on this desk?

315
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:53,140
 The inkwell, Henry took it over to the auditorium home I had to find a check.

316
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,740
 Well that's a fine thing.

317
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:55,740
 Just when I...

318
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:56,740
 Mother?

319
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:59,340
 Oh, Mary, did you get the rose bush finish before Henry left?

320
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:00,340
 Yes, Mother.

321
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:03,140
 I made a lot of little rose buds and tied them on with pitcher wire.

322
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:04,140
 Really?

323
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:05,140
 You took them off your hair?

324
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:06,140
 Oh, no, Mother.

325
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:07,140
 I just wired on radishes.

326
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:08,140
 They look beautiful.

327
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:11,540
 Alice, did you notice what I did with my income tax papers?

328
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:12,540
 Your tax papers?

329
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:13,540
 Where'd you put them?

330
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:15,540
 I thought I put them out here on this desk.

331
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:16,540
 At least I started you.

332
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:18,540
 Did you take them out of your briefcase, Father?

333
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:20,540
 No, as a matter of fact, I didn't.

334
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:22,540
 Oh, my goodness. Sam Henry took your briefcase.

335
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:24,540
 He took it. My briefcase.

336
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:26,540
 Dear, you told him the other day he could borrow it.

337
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:30,540
 Don't you remember? There's a place in the play where Homer has to take a will out and read it.

338
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:32,540
 And he's gonna read my income tax right after the audio?

339
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:35,540
 Well, Sam, if you hurry, you may be able to catch him over to Anderson.

340
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:37,540
 He's gonna stop there and pick up a mirror with a deer.

341
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:39,540
 Oh, what? What? Alice, you phone the Anderson.

342
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:42,540
 And if Henry's there, tell him to hold him. I'll be right over.

343
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:43,540
 [barking]

344
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:47,540
 [music playing]

345
00:18:47,540 --> 00:19:03,020
 Or can't you just see Mr. Aldrich taking it literally on the run to recover those income

346
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:04,020
 tax papers?

347
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:08,540
 What I'd like to see though is some of you making fast tracks to your groceries tomorrow

348
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:10,660
 morning for a post-em.

349
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:15,980
 Because that grand mealtime drink is really something special, the aroma alone would make

350
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:22,060
 that evident, it's such a grand aroma. It says so plainly, "Come and get a swell drink,

351
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:27,900
 folks." And when you taste post-em, you find it actually exceeds your expectations and delicious

352
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:33,540
 goodness. It's not only lusty and rich and full-bodied, but definitely distinctive as

353
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:38,660
 well. That means you mustn't expect post-em to taste like coffee, any more than you'd expect

354
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:44,700
 coffee to taste like tea. Post-em is an entirely different drink that will quickly have all

355
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:50,020
 those numerous taste buds of yours fairly jumping with delight. So if you're not already

356
00:19:50,020 --> 00:20:02,900
 acquainted, get acquainted with Postam.

357
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:08,020
 Now getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldrich. Mr. Aldrich has just discovered that

358
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:14,020
 Henry, without realizing it, has taken his briefcase containing income tax papers for

359
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:16,540
 The Homer deals in the school play.

360
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:21,020
 As the scene opens, Mr. Alrich is ringing the Anderson front doorbell.

361
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:29,020
 Hello there, Mr. Alrich.

362
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,020
 Good evening, Mr. Anderson.

363
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,020
 Is Henry here?

364
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,020
 I want to speak to him.

365
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:33,020
 No, I'm awfully sorry.

366
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:35,020
 Henry left here nearly ten minutes ago.

367
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:39,020
 He picked up a mirror and he was going over to pick up something at the Lawson.

368
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:40,020
 At the Lawson's?

369
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:41,020
 Thank you very much.

370
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:42,020
 Is there anything I can do for you?

371
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:43,020
 No thanks.

372
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:46,020
 - Who was it, Mother? - Just Mr. Albridge, dear.

373
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:48,020
 - Really? What was it he wanted? - He didn't say.

374
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:52,020
 Everything he's trying to catch up with Henry so he can help him carry some of those things.

375
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:54,020
 - Shall I tell Father we're almost ready to start?

376
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:57,020
 The play begins at 8.30, and I have to be there early.

377
00:20:57,020 --> 00:21:00,020
 I'm sorry, Kathleen, but your father isn't going to the play.

378
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:03,020
 - He isn't? - In fact, your father isn't even speaking to me, dear.

379
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:05,020
 - Why not? - He must know the truth, Kathleen.

380
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:07,020
 He presents. I was giving up his deer head.

381
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:10,020
 - His why? - That's near what Henry took with the deer head on us.

382
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:13,260
 on it. Oh that awful thing he gave you on your 10th anniversary.

383
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:15,660
 Mrs. Anderson, something are here.

384
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:17,020
 Yes, honey, what's the matter?

385
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:18,220
 I need a briefcase here.

386
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:19,820
 Briefcase? Oh my goodness.

387
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,860
 Oh here it is, right at the hall table, Henry.

388
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:23,220
 She was out of close shape.

389
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:25,860
 I was just leaving the lawsuit when I discovered I had lost it.

390
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,700
 Oh, thank you very much, Mrs. Anderson.

391
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:30,700
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

392
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:38,220
 Ladies and gentlemen.

393
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:41,220
 [Applause]

394
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:47,220
 Ladies and gentlemen, we regret very much that there will be a slight delay in starting the play tonight.

395
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:55,220
 But through the fact that a safe has gotten stuck between the second and third four windows, there will be a slight delay.

396
00:21:55,220 --> 00:22:03,220
 And I've been asked to assure you by Ms. Eggleston, our faculty advisor, that we'll begin as soon as the men have figured out what the matter is. Thank you.

397
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:07,220
 [Applause]

398
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:09,220
 I saw the whole thing.

399
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:12,220
 Homer, will you please step back and let me get into the wings here.

400
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:16,220
 I saw the whole thing in you way. You way. You saw what a whole thing.

401
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:19,220
 What you had printed on the program. Look right here.

402
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:24,220
 The oysters that are eaten by Homer Brown and that too are by courtesy of the Cinnaville Fish Market.

403
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:26,220
 Homer, we had to give them some credit, didn't we?

404
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:29,220
 Well Cinnaville Fish Market and no Cinnaville Fish Market. I'm not gonna eat them.

405
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:32,220
 Homer, will you please stand back? Your audience can see your costume.

406
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:35,220
 And that's another thing. The Star and Buffalo Road.

407
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:37,820
 I'm fine, Buffalo, old robe, that you found your attic.

408
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:40,820
 You're going to wear your father's wink coat over it, aren't you?

409
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:42,980
 That Buffalo just looks like a very good one.

410
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:45,520
 Can I suppose you think I didn't notice the roses?

411
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,020
 Radishes.

412
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:50,520
 Here I am, a millionaire and I'm ashamed to walk into my own dining room.

413
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,120
 Okay, I'm all okay.

414
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,420
 Then you go ahead and run the show yourself from here off.

415
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:55,920
 You mean you're gonna resign again?

416
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,420
 I might.

417
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:57,020
 I might.

418
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:58,320
 I might very easily resign.

419
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,120
 But Henry...

420
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,520
 Oh my, what's the matter with Henry?

421
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:03,420
 Kathleen, I was just standing here talking to him about...

422
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:06,300
 about he's so darn sensitive.

423
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:09,020
 And listen Kathleen, is my mustache on straight?

424
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:10,660
 - It's on straight, but couldn't have gotten

425
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:11,740
 a better one, Homer.

426
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:12,580
 - What's the matter with it?

427
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:13,820
 I paid a dime for it.

428
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:16,460
 - My goodness, they had the knife ones for 15 cents.

429
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:18,980
 - 15 cents, do you think I'm a millionaire?

430
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:21,380
 What's that you've got in your hand?

431
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:22,460
 - My egg beater.

432
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:24,100
 - Oh boy, where's my briefcase?

433
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,580
 Where's my briefcase?

434
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:26,420
 Oh, here it is.

435
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:27,740
 - You have to use that?

436
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,580
 - Sure, don't you know where I take my will out

437
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:31,500
 and stand there looking at it for a minute

438
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,260
 Then get mad and tear it up.

439
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:34,460
 Oh yeah.

440
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:36,300
 And that reminds me, where's my will?

441
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:37,300
 Where's my will?

442
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,940
 Is there anything in the briefcase?

443
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:41,260
 Oh sure, here's some papers.

444
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:43,660
 Well, I've got to give Henry credit for that.

445
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:46,060
 Remember to get one thing right for me.

446
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:49,060
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

447
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:59,340
 Hello?

448
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:00,620
 Hello, is this Harriet Breyer?

449
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:01,140
 Yeah.

450
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:03,140
 Harriet, this is Sam Olrich. Is Henry there?

451
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:06,340
 Henry? Oh, why what here happened an hour ago?

452
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:08,260
 He barred 12 oyster forks.

453
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:10,020
 Where was he going from there to the school?

454
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:12,740
 No, to the center-built fish market and then to the school.

455
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:14,340
 That's all I wanted to know. Goodbye.

456
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:29,300
 How's it going, Henry? How's it going?

457
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:32,700
 You were fine tackling, but boy, Homer. Homer.

458
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,060
 But the audience is liking.

459
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:35,500
 That isn't Homer's fault though.

460
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,540
 He's forgotten his lines four times.

461
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:40,060
 And when he took his coat off, he forgot the buffalo robe

462
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:41,700
 and it stayed pin around his neck.

463
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,460
 My goodness, look at him out there.

464
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:44,620
 He looks like a bear.

465
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:46,860
 Henry. Henry.

466
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:49,140
 She was father. Are you allowed to come backstage?

467
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:50,140
 It was my briefcase.

468
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:52,100
 I haven't forgotten it, father. And boy,

469
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:54,500
 if you notice while I miss Homer's making up things,

470
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,460
 he keeps calling it a ratty, boy.

471
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:57,980
 Henry, where is the briefcase?

472
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:58,740
 We've got it, father.

473
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:02,900
 There's nothing to worry about and you know what Homer did with the oysters instead of eating them

474
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,900
 He slipped them in his pocket

475
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:10,020
 And Ray where's the briefcase right out there on the stage Homer's got it with my income tax papers

476
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:12,060
 Oh, gee whiz is that your income?

477
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:14,900
 Pass he's reading Henry when does he bring them off bring them off?

478
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:20,520
 He doesn't he tears them up throws them in the fireplace and we walk out there on the stage and get those papers

479
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:25,580
 Why oh no, Bob in front of all those people and we for the last time I have to have those papers

480
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:28,140
 Well, look, Father, I'll thread a whistle to him.

481
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:30,220
 - The ring part is a thing.

482
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:32,460
 - Oh, gee, I'm so excited I can't even whistle.

483
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:33,300
 - Look out.

484
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,140
 - Father, where are you going?

485
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:35,940
 - The idea's time going, I'm gonna get them.

486
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:39,060
 - And now I am going to destroy this will

487
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:41,580
 and cut my daughter off for life.

488
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:42,580
 - Oh, my God.

489
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:43,980
 - She was Mr. Oldman.

490
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:45,620
 (audience laughs)

491
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:46,620
 - Oh, but give me no paper.

492
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:49,420
 - Show me, I've got a tear then there my will.

493
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:50,820
 (audience laughs)

494
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:51,660
 - Give him some--

495
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:53,220
 - But Mr. Oldman, this is my big queen.

496
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,060
 - Let's go on this.

497
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:56,060
 I think it's wrong, it's wait a minute.

498
00:25:56,060 --> 00:26:01,060
 I think we're there for the giant DM era.

499
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:20,060
 Will you have some bacon Sam?

500
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:21,060
 No thank you.

501
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:23,060
 You certainly haven't eaten much breakfast do you?

502
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:25,660
 I've eaten all the breakfast I care to, thank you.

503
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:29,860
 Now Sam, you can't go through life being upset over a little thing like last night.

504
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:31,060
 I am not upset.

505
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:37,060
 I'm just wondering how it would be if I gave up my practice here in town and opened an office in Abbott City.

506
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:39,460
 Now Sam, I'm sure nobody even noticed you.

507
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:40,460
 No!

508
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:41,460
 Yes, Mary?

509
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:43,460
 Mother, I've been thinking.

510
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:48,060
 And don't you suppose we could move to Abbott City or someplace where people don't know Father?

511
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:49,060
 Mary!

512
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:51,460
 You go out in the kitchen and make me some more toast.

513
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:52,460
 Oh, excuse me.

514
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:53,460
 Yes, it's good.

515
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:57,140
 Father Henry, I don't think your father wants to talk to you right now.

516
00:26:57,140 --> 00:27:01,100
 Mother, the man at Hall of the Safer Father just called and said that due to the fact it

517
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:04,740
 was easier to get it down and up, the return trip will only be $22.

518
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:05,740
 What's that?

519
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:06,740
 I'll answer the phone.

520
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:07,740
 Sam, here's a review.

521
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:08,740
 A review?

522
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:11,060
 Of the play in the morning paper.

523
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:15,740
 Listen, one of the most hilarious evenings this town has ever enjoyed took place in the

524
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:18,860
 Centerville High School Auditorium last evening.

525
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:23,900
 The highlight was the guest performance of Samuel Olrich's prominent local attorney,

526
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:29,180
 who made his entrance in what was erroneously listed on the program as a wealthy gentleman's

527
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:30,700
 signing room.

528
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:36,940
 The scene was actually on the western plains, and when Mr. Olrich caught the buffalo single-handed,

529
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:41,740
 wrestled with it and threw it into the cave with the double doors the audience went wild.

530
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:43,740
 Watch that. Now wait a minute.

531
00:27:43,740 --> 00:28:05,140
 Remember friends, Postam comes in two forms.

532
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:09,140
 For those of you who like your drink made instantly, there's instant Postam,

533
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:12,540
 which you make right in your cup by just adding boiling water.

534
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:15,900
 And for those who like to use pot percolator or drip maker,

535
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,300
 there's post-em.

536
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:20,900
 Both forms have the same enticing post-em flavor.

537
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:24,300
 So no matter which you choose, you'll enjoy one of America's

538
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:26,460
 great mealtime drinks.

539
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:27,460
 Post-em.

541
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:36,580
 Homer, do you think this letter is clear enough?

542
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:37,460
 What letter, Henry?

543
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:38,220
 What letter?

544
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:41,680
 I'm sending a copy to each one of the seven people that loaned us one other table leave.

545
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,180
 Oh.

546
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:47,520
 It says, "Dear Mrs. So-and-so, this is to thank you for loaning us your leaf.

547
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:52,240
 But due to a slight mix-up, will you please have your husband come to the school auditorium

548
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:57,560
 Monday morning with either a leaf that matches or some part of your dining room table so that

549
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,560
 we can eliminate this little confusion?"

550

 [Music]

551
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:17,560
 Listen again next week, same time, same station for another sparkling half-hour with your favorite youngster, his family and his pals.

552
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:20,680
 The Aldrich family is written by Clifford Goldsmith.

553
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:24,600
 The original musical score is conducted by Jack Miller.

554
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:29,600
 And this is Dan Seymour saying, "Your host tonight is Postam."

555
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:34,100
 And Postam is one of America's great mealtime drinks.

556
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:36,600
 It's good drinking. Good night.
