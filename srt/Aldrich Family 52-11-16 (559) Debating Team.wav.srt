2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,360
 Thursday, meet the new Plymouth.

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,560
 Thursday, enter the big Plymouth contest.

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:16,360
 But right now, Plymouth presents Henry--

5
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:17,760
 Henry Oldridge.

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:18,640
 Coming, mother.

7
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:24,880
 [APPLAUSE]

8
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,200
 Yes, it's the Oldridge family.

9
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,520
 Written by Clifford Goldsmith, transcribed

10
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,920
 brought to your family by Plymouth.

11
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,720
 Get set for a new kind of low priced car.

12
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:39,240
 Go to your nearby Plymouth showroom Thursday.

13
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,440
 Meet the new Plymouth.

14
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:48,640
 Yes, the 1953 Plymouth is a new kind of car.

15
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,400
 First truly balanced car in the low priced field.

16
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,720
 And what a difference Plymouth's true balance makes.

17
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,680
 A beautiful new look, a remarkable new ride.

18
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:00,000
 And Thursdays the day, the day your Plymouth dealer says,

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,480
 "Come on in and meet the new Plymouth."

20
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,760
 There's going to be a big Plymouth contest too, starting Thursday.

21
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,760
 Your chance to win yourself a beautiful new Plymouth free,

22
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,720
 or one of hundreds of cash prizes.

23
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,800
 Full details from your nearby Plymouth dealer on Thursday

24
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:17,120
 when you go in to meet the new 53 Plymouth.

25
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:20,480
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

26
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:30,080
 Families today are pretty much the same as families

27
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,200
 yesterday.

28
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,960
 Fathers and mothers and children never change very much

29
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,040
 from one generation to another.

30
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,400
 And the ever-present spark plug is always

31
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,200
 a typical teenage boy like Henry Aldridge.

32
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,000
 The scene is the Aldridge dining room.

33
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 The time is morning.

34
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,760
 Could you please pass the toast, Mary?

35
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,160
 Another piece, Henry.

36
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,360
 Yes, please. And father?

37
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:50,920
 Well...

38
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,920
 I please have another egg.

39
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,800
 Yeah, that'll make three eggs.

40
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,640
 Yes, mother.

41
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,200
 Henry, your normal appetite is rather frightening,

42
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,520
 but now you're eating like a man with a purpose.

43
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,320
 She is? I do have a purpose, father.

44
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,080
 I'm building myself up.

45
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,280
 I'm on the debating team.

46
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,560
 You're on the debating team, dear?

47
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,000
 Well, I'm not exactly on it, mother.

48
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,720
 I'm really just trying out for it.

49
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,520
 They're having the trials this afternoon.

50
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,200
 How did you happen to go out for debating, Henry?

51
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,800
 Well, it's just sort of the kind of thing that appeals to me.

52
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,120
 Mother, wouldn't be too much trouble going to Canisardines.

53
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,200
 Sardines for breakfast?

54
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,360
 Well, everyone says the fish is brain food.

55
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,800
 Isn't that so, Father?

56
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,560
 Oh, I don't know.

57
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,040
 I didn't keep them from getting caught.

58
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,040
 Aren't you going to finish your toast, Mary?

59
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,760
 Here you can have it.

60
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,120
 Thanks.

61
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,760
 And will you please pass them arm aloud?

62
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,920
 How much do you have to weigh to make the debating team?

63
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,600
 I don't have to weigh anything.

64
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,160
 But I don't see any point in going to a thing half-heartedly.

65
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:47,080
 Well, there if you do make the team, I hope Aunt Harriet will come to hear you speak.

66
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,960
 She just won't believe her ears.

67
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,860
 Well, she was. Why should everybody be so amazed?

68
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:53,360
 Just because I'm anxious to improve my mind.

69
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,960
 I think everybody ought to improve their mind.

70
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,860
 No sense in overdoing it, though.

71
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,860
 Well, I won't go overboard, Father.

72
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:02,360
 Oh, which side of the debate are you speaking?

73
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,460
 On which side?

74
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:05,360
 You have two sides, haven't you?

75
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,760
 Father, they don't even have a team yet.

76
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,960
 Do you really think you can make the team, dear?

77
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,860
 Well, I hope so, Mother.

78
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:13,060
 I hate to be doing all this eating for nothing.

79
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:15,560
 - Oh, I don't think it'll be entirely wasted.

80
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,640
 - Oh, would you excuse me, please?

81
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,440
 Well, I run upstairs and get some notes I've got to use.

82
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,700
 - Yes, dear.

83
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,600
 Sam, I'm simply delighted.

84
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,940
 - I wouldn't be a bit surprised

85
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:24,900
 if Henry made a good debater.

86
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,100
 He sort of a chip off the old block.

87
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,560
 He has a quick mind.

88
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,740
 Thanks fast on his feet.

89
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,260
 (phone ringing)

90
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:33,180
 - Who do you suppose that is, mother?

91
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,940
 - Don't bother to come to the door, anybody.

92
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:35,900
 Is Henry for waiting?

93
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:36,740
 - Oh, hello, Willy.

94
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:38,220
 Henry'll be down in just a minute.

95
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,940
 - How does he feel this morning, Mrs. Allrich?

96
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:41,020
 Is he a little nervous?

97
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,260
 - Why should he be nervous?

98
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:45,020
 Well, you know, trying out for the debating team.

99
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,540
 It can be pretty nerve-wracking.

100
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:48,420
 Henry didn't act like he was nervous.

101
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:50,220
 He didn't eat like it either.

102
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,900
 Are you going to try out for the team, Willie?

103
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,820
 Oh, no, I'm on it.

104
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:57,060
 How many eggs do you eat a day?

105
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:57,900
 Eggs?

106
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:00,740
 Yes, to keep yourself in good condition for debating.

107
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,820
 Oh, I'm not on the talking end of the team.

108
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,860
 On which end are you?

109
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:07,180
 I'm the manager.

110
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,620
 What I really went out for was the track team,

111
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:11,300
 but my legs went back on me.

112
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,700
 What are the duties of a manager?

113
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,900
 Well, for one thing, I correspond.

114
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,300
 You correspond with who?

115
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,300
 With all the other managers.

116
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,300
 We get together and correspond.

117
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,300
 Sort of write letters, you know.

118
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,300
 Oh, yeah. That's quite an accomplishment.

119
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,300
 I'm sure you do it very well, Willie.

120
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,300
 Yes, ma'am. I worry about it quite a lot.

121
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:31,300
 And you persuaded Henry to go out for the debating team?

122
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,300
 Oh, no, sir. That was on account of Ellen.

123
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,300
 Ellen? Yes, sir. Ellen Stanish.

124
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,300
 What does she have to do with it?

125
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,300
 She's very pretty.

126
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,300
 And she's also on the team.

127
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:44,500
 I know who she is! Mother, she's that girl that can talk your head off!

128
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,640
 That's the one!

129
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,840
 Ellen, Sandy?

130
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:47,980
 She's very pretty, though.

131
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:49,720
 But she is the one that talks a lot.

132
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,220
 Sure. To everyone except Henry.

133
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:55,480
 And he figured that if he could get on the team, she'd talk to him.

134
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:59,220
 Well, that explains Henry's sudden craving for the finer thing.

135
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:02,260
 Yes, sir. What she's pretty, Mr. Alrich.

136
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,760
 It's been a great pleasure for me, just a manager.

137
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:18,140
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

138
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:19,000
 Ellen.

139
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,040
 Ellen Standish.

140
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,480
 Well?

141
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:24,280
 I just finished my tryout for the debating team.

142
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,280
 Oh, did you?

143
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,400
 Sure.

144
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,560
 I thought perhaps you'd be glad to know I may be on the team

145
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,680
 with you.

146
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,120
 Are you going down the hallways?

147
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,320
 I'm going into the library here.

148
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:33,680
 Oh.

149
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,960
 Say Henry, is that you?

150
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:35,840
 What is it Homer?

151
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,680
 Hello, Ellen.

152
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,200
 I just finished my tryout.

153
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,400
 Are you going out for the team too?

154
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:40,900
 Sure.

155
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,320
 We'll all be together.

156
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,520
 Oh.

157
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,360
 Goodbye.

158
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,000
 Goodbye.

159
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,520
 Goodbye, Ellen.

160
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,320
 Ellen?

161
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,520
 Henry, they said you and I should

162
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,000
 wait in the classroom across the hall

163
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,560
 until the tryouts are all over.

164
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,560
 OK, let's go in.

165
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,120
 Boy, I sure hope I make the team.

166
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,800
 Oh, what subject did you talk about?

167
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,840
 Let me talk about how I helped my mother grow tomatoes last

168
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,560
 summer.

169
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,240
 Henry, it isn't pronounced tomato.

170
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:01,760
 It isn't?

171
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,500
 No.

172
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,740
 In parliamentary procedure, it's tomato.

173
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,420
 Tomato?

174
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:09,980
 Well, who do you know that calls it tomato?

175
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:12,380
 Do you ever hear anybody talk about French fried potatoes?

176
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:14,900
 [LAUGHTER]

177
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,580
 That isn't the point, Henry.

178
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,380
 Common people call it tomato.

179
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:20,380
 But when you're trying to make the debating team,

180
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,460
 it's tomato.

181
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:23,780
 Hey, fathers, I got some great news for you.

182
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:25,100
 You have Willie, did we make the team?

183
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,220
 The faculty is in conference right now.

184
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,900
 I'll let you know as soon as they tell me.

185
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,180
 Hey, Willie, Willie.

186
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:31,660
 What were you going to ask him, Henry?

187
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:34,300
 I could give part of my speech over.

188
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,380
 As a matter of fact, Homer, I know a lot of people

189
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:38,140
 who aren't common who say tomato.

190
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:40,660
 Well, Henry, all I know is that if I had to stand up

191
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:42,260
 before three members of the faculty,

192
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:44,820
 I'd be mighty sure I said tomato.

193
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,020
 Boy.

194
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,340
 The part that makes me mad, Homer,

195
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,100
 is I could have just as well said asparagus

196
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,860
 and been unsafe ground.

197
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:52,580
 Hey, fellas, the meaning's over.

198
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,540
 What did they decide, Willie?

199
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:54,340
 Yeah, what?

200
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:56,900
 Well, what are you guys just going to be awfully disappointed?

201
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,100
 We are?

202
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,540
 Tell us which one it is.

203
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:01,540
 Now, listen, Henry, I'm the manager

204
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:03,980
 and I'll make the announcement when I'm good and ready.

205
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:06,860
 Besides, it shouldn't make any difference to you how they decided.

206
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:07,820
 You mean I didn't make it?

207
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:08,620
 No.

208
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:10,180
 They liked Homer's voice better.

209
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,340
 They did?

210
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,020
 No kidding.

211
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:12,540
 Sure.

212
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:13,860
 It carries farther.

213
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:17,300
 They say they can hear your voice even in the last role of the balcony.

214
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,060
 Lucy Adams also made the team.

215
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:22,420
 Well, I got to go back and attend to some correspondence.

216
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:24,460
 Gee, Henry, I'm sorry.

217
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:27,540
 Oh, she has nothing to be sorry about Homer.

218
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:30,060
 If you want to know the truth, I'm glad I didn't make it.

219
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:32,220
 Lucy Adams on it and everything.

220
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:35,220
 Ellen Standish is on it.

221
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:38,940
 You know Homer, we've been friends for a long time, haven't we?

222
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:39,740
 Sure.

223
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:41,300
 Well, I was just thinking.

224
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,500
 You've done a lot of nice things for me,

225
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,740
 so I'm going to do you a favor.

226
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:46,300
 You are?

227
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,100
 Sure.

228
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,900
 I'm willing to take your place on the team, just out

229
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,700
 of friendship, and I won't charge you a cent.

230
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,020
 Why?

231
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:54,460
 Well, don't you want to get off the team?

232
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:56,100
 When did I say that?

233
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,060
 Well, I shouldn't think you'd want to be on it.

234
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,540
 Hey, Henry, what are you--

235
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:00,380
 - And what, Willie?

236
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,540
 - You made the team.

237
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:02,380
 - And I didn't?

238
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:03,860
 - No, you're on it too, Homer.

239
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:04,900
 - I am?

240
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,700
 Henry, that kid's rid of Lucy Adams.

241
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:07,540
 - No, it doesn't.

242
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,220
 She's on the team too.

243
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:10,460
 - Whose place do I take?

244
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:12,140
 - Ellen Stanishes.

245
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:13,260
 - Ellen's?

246
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,100
 - Ellen's?

247
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,940
 - Yes, she just resigned.

248
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:17,780
 - There, Homer, not even see what you've done.

249
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:19,140
 - It isn't Homer's fault.

250
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:21,820
 - Ellen says she's entirely too nervous to debate.

251
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,900
 - Hello, Henry, congratulations.

252
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,020
 - Oh, hello, Lucy.

253
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,460
 - Isn't it wonderful?

254
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:27,780
 - Henry, I'm going home.

255
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,420
 - But Homer, haven't you heard?

256
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:32,020
 Lucy, you don't think debating is gonna make you nervous, do you?

257
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,980
 Oh, no, I feel wonderful.

258
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,520
 I think I'll resign.

259
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:39,820
 Henry, you aren't gonna resign just as we've got our first debate scheduled, are you?

260
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:40,820
 For when, Willie?

261
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,220
 Didn't you know? For a week from next Friday night.

262
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:45,620
 I've been corresponding about it since last August.

263
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:46,820
 Who are we debating with?

264
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,020
 Middletown High School.

265
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:54,420
 The subject has resolved that the steam engine has contributed more to the progress of civilization than the horse.

266
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:55,820
 Well, on which side are we?

267
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:56,620
 The horses.

268
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,420
 We take the negative?

269
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:01,060
 Sure, we're not believing steam engines.

270
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:11,940
 Henry, don't you think the horse has done more than the steam engine?

271
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:12,980
 I don't know, Lucy.

272
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:14,820
 Henry, you don't seem interested.

273
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,300
 Lucy, I just don't think I'm gonna be any good at this.

274
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:20,740
 If I can't convince myself, how am I gonna convince a whole auditorium full of people?

275
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,660
 But that's the way I felt at first.

276
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:24,420
 Here we have a cookie in my mother's bag.

277
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:25,300
 And no, thank you.

278
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,580
 They have fudge fillings.

279
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:28,020
 Fudge fillings?

280
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:30,020
 Well, I'll try just half of one.

281
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:34,020
 Here. Think of what the horse has done for agriculture, Henry.

282
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:37,020
 Sixty percent of the farms in this country still use horses.

283
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:41,020
 Now, Ryan, may I have the other half of that cookie?

284
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:46,020
 Sure, here. And Henry, how did the covered wagons cross the plains?

285
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:48,020
 - Why horse? - By horse.

286
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:50,020
 Our forefathers didn't know what a steam engine was.

287
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:52,020
 Well, that's true, Lucy.

288
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:54,020
 - And you always have cookies like this? - Of course.

289
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:56,020
 See how interesting it is?

290
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:58,020
 Let's begin to show some possibilities.

291
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:00,020
 Excuse me for reaching in front of you.

292
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:03,020
 When you get through with those cookies, Henry, there are some more in the kitchen.

293
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:06,020
 Oh my goodness, I wonder whether that's Willy phone.

294
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:07,020
 Willy?

295
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:08,020
 Hello?

296
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,020
 Hello Lucy.

297
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:11,020
 Oh, is that you Homer?

298
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,020
 Yes, is Henry there?

299
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:13,020
 Henry.

300
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:15,020
 She was what his Homer won?

301
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:16,020
 Here.

302
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,020
 Oh, Homer.

303
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:18,020
 Can't you get away from her Henry?

304
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:19,020
 No, exactly.

305
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:21,020
 Boy, do I pity you.

306
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:23,020
 Do you know when I dug up in the library this afternoon?

307
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:24,020
 What?

308
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:24,860
 What?

309
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:26,380
 All about the eo-hippus.

310
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:28,260
 The what of us?

311
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,780
 The eo-hippus.

312
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:33,820
 It was a prehistoric horse, and it stood less than two feet high.

313
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,260
 What was it used for?

314
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,460
 I don't think it was used for anything.

315
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:38,980
 But I think we ought to mention it, Henry.

316
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,660
 It'll show we dug into it.

317
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,420
 They had four toes.

318
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,340
 Four?

319
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,260
 Imagine.

320
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,500
 Henry, we have another cookie?

321
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,540
 Sure, thanks, Lucy.

322
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:47,460
 Cookie?

323
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,460
 And Homer, did you ever think of this?

324
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:51,180
 How do they speak of a steam engine?

325
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:51,620
 How?

326
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:52,980
 By its horsepower.

327
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:53,820
 Sure.

328
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,620
 Boy, Henry, that's wonderful.

329
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:56,620
 Write it down, Lucy.

330
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:58,020
 And I'll write down about the U-H-E-F.

331
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,020
 Sure!

332
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:02,020
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

333
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:14,260
 Mr. Chairman, honorable judges, were the opponents.

334
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:18,260
 The subject we've been asked to discuss this evening is resale.

335
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,980
 Enra, do you have to wave your arms?

336
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,620
 Was I waving my arms, Father?

337
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:29,620
 When we are through ladies and gentlemen, it will be clearly seen that the horse is one animal that cannot be replaced.

338
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:31,620
 What time does the debate begin this evening?

339
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:35,620
 An eight fifteen and boy father were a cinch to win. Where was I?

340
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:38,620
 The horse is an animal that cannot be replaced.

341
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:42,620
 Oh yeah. What are steam engines made of ladies and gentlemen?

342
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:48,620
 Steel and iron and steel and coal. And how do they first get them out of the mines?

343
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:55,400
 the mines. I'll tell you how it'll be a pleasure. Buy a horse. Father don't you

344
00:11:55,400 --> 00:12:02,180
 think that's gonna knock him for a loop? I'm afraid it will. I prepared this whole

345
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:08,800
 thing in a week and what makes pulleys go round? Belts? And what are belts made

346
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:14,880
 of? From horses hides. And what was the first machine ever made? A cart. And what

347
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,880
 Pull the cart, a horse.

348
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,760
 Then how about Paul Revere?

349
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,480
 It's common gossip, known by every school child,

350
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,000
 how he saved America with a horse.

351
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,360
 And then father, I go on and they end up

352
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,680
 with a long speech about the Eohippus.

353
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,840
 Eohippus?

354
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,680
 Yes, sir.

355
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,680
 It was a prehistoric horse that hardly came up to my knees.

356
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,160
 Don't you think it's pretty good?

357
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:40,080
 Well, it has one or two weak points, Henry.

358
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,760
 If it, father, what you heard is only one third of our argument.

359
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,800
 We've divided it into three parts.

360
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,440
 I cover the horse as a historical contribution.

361
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,920
 The Homer covers it during the present,

362
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,520
 and Lucy covers it from the female point of view.

363
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,560
 Henry, I've just pressed your blue-seared suit for you.

364
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,400
 Thank you, Mother.

365
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,920
 And when you get up on the platform,

366
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,840
 don't turn your back to the audience.

367
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,680
 Why not, Mother?

368
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,000
 The seat is shiny.

369
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,680
 (audience laughing)

370
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:05,600
 Henry, do you mind if I raise one or two questions?

371
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,400
 I mean, there's something about my speech that puzzles you?

372
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,600
 Well, in the first place, iron is not whole out of mines

373
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,320
 by horses, but by mules.

374
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,520
 Well, Father, I don't like to argue,

375
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,180
 but when you get right down to it,

376
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:19,640
 a mule is sort of a horse.

377
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,280
 A mule is a mule.

378
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:24,560
 I could show you a book that says a mule is a horse.

379
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,960
 I'd like to see it.

380
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,440
 Well, anyway, I don't think that's the point, Father.

381
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,720
 The question is, which is done more for civilization?

382
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,320
 Well, supposing you're worthy of opponents

383
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,320
 remind your audience that the first cart

384
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:38,480
 was not pulled by a horse, but by a man.

385
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,040
 No horse? No horse.

386
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,400
 Not even a neo-hippus?

387
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,560
 No, sir.

388
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:48,360
 And supposing I mentioned the fact that very good driving belts are made not only from horse hide, but from cow hide.

389
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:53,360
 And with Bob you keep evading the issue. What I'm talking about is horses.

390
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,360
 Alright then let's talk about them.

391
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,760
 In what way did Paul Revere's horse help promote progress?

392
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:04,160
 Well it stands the reason. If he hadn't had a horse he wouldn't have been able to spread the alarm before the enemy came.

393
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,960
 Supposing he had to wait around until the steam engine was invented.

394
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,760
 And by what means was the enemy approaching?

395
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,560
 On horseback.

396
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,360
 In other words, it was a case of one horse trying to get away from a number of other horses.

397
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:18,060
 Therefore, the horses all cancel each other out and have nothing to do with the case.

398
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:21,060
 Did you say that again, Father?

399
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:24,060
 Make it a little clearer?

400
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:26,560
 I'm a lawyer. I don't have to be clear.

401
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,760
 Henry?

402
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,560
 Yes, Mother?

403
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,360
 It's time for you to go upstairs and watch.

404
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:31,960
 Already?

405
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,560
 Yes, dear, dinner's on the table.

406
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,260
 Dinner?

407
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:37,060
 Well, she, Mother, it's a funny thing, but...

408
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:39,360
 All of a sudden, something happened to my stomach.

409
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,960
 What's the matter, dear, if you lost your confidence?

410
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,660
 I just wish I hadn't got mixed up in this darn debate.

411
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:47,520
 Now, dear, you go upstairs and get washed. You'll feel better.

412
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,000
 Yes, mother.

413
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,860
 You and Father are going to sit down in front, are you?

414
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:51,460
 We are.

415
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:54,260
 Well, don't do that, Father. Every time I see your face, I'll forget all about horses.

416
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:56,160
 Henry, please go upstairs.

417
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,060
 Yes, mother.

418
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:59,360
 I feel just as though I was sitting on the gillow thing.

419
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,760
 Sam, did I overhear you criticizing Henry's talk?

420
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:06,960
 I was simply pointing out one or two of his weak spots. There's nothing wrong with that.

421
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,220
 My goodness, Sam, now you're just rude about it.

422
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:10,660
 You know how Henry is.

423
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:13,560
 I'll answer the phone, maybe the face being called off.

424
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:16,800
 There, Sam is a very good example of how you've unnerved him.

425
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,040
 Alice, I give you my word.

426
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,680
 I was simply trying to help the boy.

427
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,280
 Well, I'm quite sure that if I had to stand up

428
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,240
 before an audience of several hundred people,

429
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,480
 I wouldn't want my father to upset me just before I went on.

430
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,120
 Henry!

431
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:28,720
 Yes, Father?

432
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,160
 When you threw on the phone, come in here.

433
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,120
 Yes, sir.

434
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,320
 Sam, you're going to wear your best suit, aren't you?

435
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,760
 Just to go over to the high school.

436
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,000
 Well, dear, I bought a new hat.

437
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,360
 But after all, we don't want to be a disgrace to Henry.

438
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,600
 And I do want Henry to win, if only because of that Ellen's stand-ish.

439
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,600
 What is he done?

440
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,000
 Well, Mary heard that Ellen got off the team just because Henry was on it.

441
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,360
 She was as Lucy Nervous, poor kid.

442
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,480
 Well, don't you be nervous, Henry?

443
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:54,400
 Your father and I are trying not to be.

444
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,800
 What a loosely call you about.

445
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,600
 Just to say she's so scared she can't eat her dinner.

446
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,880
 Well, you should have told her to have a cup of tea.

447
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,400
 That's all I'm going to have.

448
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,400
 [LAUGHTER]

449
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,400
 Henry.

450
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,400
 I'm going up and finish washing.

451
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,900
 Before you go up...

452
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,200
 There's something more wrong with my speech.

453
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:11,200
 Well, I'd like to explain that the only reason I criticized your talk was to...

454
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,600
 find out how much you believed in it.

455
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,200
 Oh!

456
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:17,100
 You see, if you don't believe with all your heart and soul

457
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:20,800
 that the horse has been more important than the judges won't believe you.

458
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,800
 Oh, but I do believe it, Father.

459
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,000
 I suppose I'm a little sentimental about it,

460
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,900
 but it isn't just for my second for yours that I want to win.

461
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,900
 It's really for all horses in general.

462
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:32,400
 [phone ringing]

463
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,400
 Henry, could I speak to you for a minute?

464
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,900
 What did you come from, Willie?

465
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:38,400
 I just met the middle town debating team at the station.

466
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,900
 And boy, have they made a mess of things.

467
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:43,900
 Oh, well, we're taking a negative of the argument, aren't we?

468
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,900
 Yeah. Well, so are they.

469
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,900
 You mean they've taken our side?

470
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:50,400
 Yes. Can you imagine our dirty trick like that?

471
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,900
 I could have thing like that have happened.

472
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:56,900
 Well, something seems to have gone wrong with the correspondence.

473
00:16:56,900 --> 00:17:00,400
 Willie, you mean it was really your fault?

474
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:04,400
 Henry, I'd like you to see all the correspondence I've handled on this.

475
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,600
 I bet you'd make one or two minor mistakes yourself.

476
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,900
 What are you going to do about it?

477
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:11,900
 Well, Mr. Bradley, our principal says our team has to take the other side.

478
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,400
 The other side?

479
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,400
 Willie, you mean I have to be a traitor to the horse?

480
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:29,900
 We'll return to the Aldrich family in just a moment.

481
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,420
 [POPPING]

482
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:33,260
 What's new?

483
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:36,620
 The '53 Plymouth, it's news.

484
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:39,540
 The '53 Plymouth, the low-price field,

485
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:41,540
 has a brand new star.

486
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:46,340
 The truly balanced Plymouth, a new kind of car, a new kind of car.

487
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:47,780
 New kind of car is right.

488
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:49,900
 The '53 Plymouth is new from the wheels up,

489
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,980
 a whole new concept of car design.

490
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:54,100
 New styling, new beauty, inside and out.

491
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,580
 A wonderful new ride.

492
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:57,740
 Plymouth announcement day is this coming Thursday.

493
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:01,340
 So plan now to make tracks to your nearby Plymouth Dealers Thursday.

494
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:07,440
 You'll be thrilled when you see the new Plymouth, delighted when you get behind the wheel and handle the controls.

495
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,640
 And here's a tip, pay particular attention to the new features of the Plymouth,

496
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:18,640
 75 new features in all, because there's a big Plymouth contest this year with $25,000 in prizes,

497
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,940
 just for telling what you like most about this great new beauty.

498
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:25,040
 First prize, a sleek, racy, 53 Plymouth convertible,

499
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,240
 win it and be the envy of the neighborhood.

500
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:31,640
 Next five winners get new Plymouth sedans and there are hundreds of cash prizes.

501
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:35,440
 It's fun, easy to enter and you get full details from your Plymouth dealer.

502
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:39,640
 See him Thursday for your entry blank and meet the new 53 Plymouth.

503
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:51,240
 And now getting back to the troubles of Henry Allridge.

504
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:54,240
 Well after working on a debate for ten days,

505
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,240
 Henry has just learned that his team has been preparing the wrong side.

506
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,240
 The scene opens in the High School Principal's office.

507
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,240
 The time is that same evening.

508
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:06,240
 But Mr. Bradley, it isn't fair to the team. It isn't fair to the audience.

509
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:12,240
 Henry, the mistake was made by our manager. The least we can do is take the affirmative and go ahead with the debate.

510
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,240
 But in the meantime, how about the horse?

511
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,240
 I think the horse will understand.

512
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:21,240
 But Mr. Bradley, we memorized our speeches word for word. I've even learned a whole eulogy to the horse.

513
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:25,000
 I can't just give the whole thing and insert the word steam engine instead of horse, can I?

514
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,040
 Enray, why do we have debates?

515
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:30,440
 Well, in order to develop our faculties for thinking and reasoning.

516
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:33,440
 Don't you see Mr. Bradley? I'm no good at a thing like that. I can't argue.

517
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,440
 You're doing a pretty good job of it right now.

518
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,440
 But I'm losing.

519
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,440
 Yes.

520
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,840
 [audience laughter]

521
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,840
 How'd you develop it in your faculties?

522
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:41,840
 Come in.

523
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,640
 Mr. Bradley, is Henry in here?

524
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,640
 Yes, Lucy.

525
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,640
 Well, look, Henry.

526
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,440
 Could we ask Mr. Bradley to do this?

527
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,440
 To do what?

528
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,640
 Why do both teams agree?

529
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:52,940
 Right at the start, the horse has made the greatest contribution to civilization,

530
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:56,280
 and then let the judges decide which team is the most sincere.

531
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:59,080
 Sure, Mr. Bradley, that would be interesting.

532
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:02,220
 No. The Middletown team are our guests,

533
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:04,780
 and the least we can do is have a difference of opinion with them.

534
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:05,780
 [knocking on door]

535
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:06,780
 Yes?

536
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:09,120
 Mr. Bradley, is the school nurse here?

537
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,320
 What's the matter, Homer?

538
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,720
 Well, it's a funny thing, but I have chills and a headache.

539
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,120
 Chills and a headache?

540
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,120
 Yes, sir. And my jaws hurt.

541
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,960
 I think I'm coming down with the mumps.

542
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,960
 Didn't you have the month's last fall, Homer?

543
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,960
 But, Mr. Bradley, I've just been talking with the Middletown team.

544
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:26,960
 They don't feel half as keen about the horses we do.

545
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,960
 Why don't we be generous and give them the steam engine?

546
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,960
 Henry and Homer, you have exactly 30 minutes in which to prepare your arguments.

547
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,960
 Middletown will take the negative.

548
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,960
 And if Centerville is half the high school, I think it is, we shall take the affirmative.

549
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,920
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

550
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:54,560
 What is more, ladies and gentlemen, members of the faculty?

551
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,960
 Since the center of ill team has just

552
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,520
 learned at the last moment that it must change sides,

553
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:04,240
 it will, so to speak, be swapping horses

554
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,720
 in the middle of the stream in favor of the steam engine.

555
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:10,720
 [laughter]

556
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:22,720
 And I suppose that the picture of water that rests on this stand is for the affirmative to make steam with and for the negative to give to their horses.

557
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:27,720
 [laughter]

558
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:32,720
 And the first speaker for the negative by meaning the affirmative.

559
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:37,720
 I mean, yes, the affirmative is Homer Brown.

560
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:41,400
 (audience applauding)

561
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,420
 - The question we have been asked to discuss was,

562
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:47,940
 oh boy, I mean, ladies and gentlemen,

563
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,400
 and honorable judges.

564
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,400
 (audience laughing)

565
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:58,400
 Speaking of man's best friend, the horse,

566
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,400
 the steam engine,

567
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:06,400
 Instead of boring you for my full six minutes, I believe I can prove my point in practically less than a minute.

568
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:11,200
 [MUSIC]

569
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:18,040
 And what is more, ladies and gentlemen, when a lady who lives in Chicago sees a hat that she wants in New York, how do they get it to him?

570
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,040
 By horseback? No!

571
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:24,280
 [MUSIC]

572
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:29,240
 The next point I wish to bring to your attention is that little run of a beast, the E.O. Hepace.

573
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,240
 That was never good for anything at all.

574
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,240
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

575
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:38,240
 [APPLAUSE]

576
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:45,640
 Ladies and gentlemen, you have heard both sides

577
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:49,000
 of the argument and the rebuttal for the negative.

578
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,280
 The center of L-Team did not utilize

579
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,040
 all of its original time, and I do not

580
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,800
 know whether any of its members would care

581
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,720
 to take part of the rebuttal.

582
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:01,160
 If so, we will now hear from Henry Eldridge.

583
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:04,160
 [APPLAUSE]

584
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:07,320
 Mr. Chairman, Senator Bill High School has several things

585
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:07,820
 to say.

586
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:13,440
 My worthy opponents have tried to impress on you

587
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,880
 that if it weren't for the horse, we wouldn't have any steel

588
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:19,120
 or iron with which to build steam engines.

589
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,480
 May I ask, will they ever got any such idea as that?

590
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,680
 Horses aren't used in mines.

591
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:27,760
 Mules are the next point.

592
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:34,680
 My worthy opponent says that the first cart was pulled by a horse.

593
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:38,000
 For his information, a man pulled the first cart.

594
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,160
 And now they're glad to ride in steam engines and relax.

595
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,080
 Then out of the middle-town jean getter this evening

596
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,640
 by another steam engine.

597
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,840
 [APPLAUSE]

598
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:49,640
 And another point.

599
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:57,240
 My opponents would have you believe that if it hadn't been for Paul Revere's horse,

600
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:00,440
 we wouldn't be here in this happy, carefree land.

601
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:03,440
 But what was Paul Revere's horse trying to get away from?

602
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,640
 More horses.

603
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:09,800
 It was horses, ladies and gentlemen, that was causing all the trouble.

604
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:13,480
 And I ask you, is that what you could call progress?

605
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,480
 No.

606
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,760
 No, a thousand times no.

607
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,760
 The affirmative rest.

608
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:22,160
 [APPLAUSE]

609
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:25,560
 Ladies and gentlemen, while the judges

610
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,720
 retire to try to reach their decision,

611
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:30,320
 a very difficult decision, I'm sure.

612
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,280
 The orchestra will entertain us with the number

613
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:36,040
 which they had rehearsed before they discovered

614
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,200
 their own team was to take the affirmative.

615
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:41,520
 It is called light cavalry overture.

616
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,520
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

617
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:51,520
 [Music]

618
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,520
 Sam, haven't the judges reached the decision yet?

619
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,520
 I think they're coming on stage right now.

620
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,520
 Do you think Henry won?

621
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,520
 I don't know, Alice.

622
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:03,520
 Well, I thought he talked beautifully, and he certainly looked better than any of the boys on the middle town team.

623
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,520
 Ladies and gentlemen, I doubt it's Mr. Badis going to announce the decision.

624
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:13,520
 After careful consideration, the judges have voted unanimously in favor of the negative.

625
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:20,000
 negative. Which side is the negative side? Middle time. You mean Henry Laws? He did.

626
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 I sure would like to congratulate not only the winners but our team as well in

627
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,500
 spite of the fact that we lost. Never have I heard final examples of

628
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:34,400
 extemporaneous speaking. If I hadn't known to the contrary I would have said

629
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:39,360
 that the last speaker Henry Aldrich had prepared his rebuttal in advance. Mr.

630
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,400
 chairman yes mister uh...

631
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,800
 i have to be one of the judges of may i ask

632
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,640
 was the negative middle town

633
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,400
 uh...

634
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,640
 the negative

635
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,080
 was middle town

636
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,200
 well uh... the manager who gave us our slip to paper to mark the verdict on

637
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,080
 apparently got things twisted

638
00:25:55,080 --> 00:26:00,080
 regardless of which side they had a decision went to centerville

639
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,520
 everyone

640
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,080
 shake his head

641
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:06,320
 i don't wish that i understand issues mother could have been here tonight

642
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,920
 Hello, Mother, how are you?

643
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,320
 Let me take your hands.

644
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,720
 It was because of you, Father, that we got the decision.

645
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:14,520
 Well, I was worried for a few minutes, though.

646
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,400
 I was afraid Middletown would mention the fact

647
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,720
 that most of the British troops were not on horseback,

648
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,840
 but on foot.

649
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,240
 You mean they weren't on horseback?

650
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:25,160
 Not so far as I know.

651
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,400
 Well, she was.

654
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,900
 Sam, have you seen the morning paper?

655
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:39,900
 No Alice, watch the news.

656
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:40,900
 Listen to this.

657
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:43,900
 Before a capacity audience last night,

658
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:46,900
 Centerville High School defended the negative side of a heated battle,

659
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:50,900
 in which they were particularly effective in arguing for the affirmative.

660
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:55,900
 Henry Aldridge kept the visiting opponents completely baffled to the very end

661
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:58,900
 as to whether he favored the colonists or the British.

662
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:01,900
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

663
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:13,900
 Henry, is that you in the kitchen?

664
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:14,700
 Yes, Father.

665
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,660
 Henry, are you eating more cookies

666
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:19,300
 after cleaning out the cookie jar at Lucy's house?

667
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:20,580
 Well, gosh, Father.

668
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:23,060
 I felt like it's hungry all over again after walking home.

669
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:24,220
 Nah, Henry.

670
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:25,580
 No wonder I'm always hungry.

671
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:27,140
 All I ever do is walk.

672
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:28,380
 Walk here, walk there.

673
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:34,180
 If there's a hidden meaning to this walkie-talkie conversation, please bring it out in the open, because I'm going to bed.

674
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:35,340
 Hidden meaning, Father?

675
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:42,580
 I think the last time you acquainted me with your walking expeditions, it ended with a sales talk to buy you a car.

676
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:45,280
 Oh, you won't have to buy this one, Father. It's free.

677
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:48,980
 Now, Plymouth convertible, first prize in the big Plymouth contest.

678
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:52,980
 If I wasn't too young, I'd enter myself. But I figured with my help, you'd be a sic-to-win.

679
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:55,180
 Oh, please, Henry, not tonight. I'm a bit tired.

680
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:58,180
 Not tonight, Father. The contest doesn't start till Thursday.

681
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:59,780
 That's when the new Plymouth comes out.

682
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:02,980
 All right. Remind me Thursday and we'll go down and see the new Plymouth.

683
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:04,380
 Now would you get up to bed?

684
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:06,880
 Yes, Father. Just as soon as I finish these cookies.

685
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,180
 Boy. A new Plymouth convertible.

686
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:20,180
 The Aldrich family is transcribed as written by Clifford Goldsmith.

687
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:23,980
 Henry is played by Bobby Ellis and Homer by Jack Grimes.
