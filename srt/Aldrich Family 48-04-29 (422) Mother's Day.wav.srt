00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 Come on, Zhi! Come in, mother!

00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000

00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:36,140
 The Aldrich family starring as Restone, written by Clifford Goldsmith, brought to you by the

6
00:00:36,140 --> 00:01:02,020
 The puddings that are tops entaste, jello pudding.

7
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:06,020
 They say the happiest years of your life are the teens.

8
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:11,020
 But I know one person who has his doubts about that, Henry Aldrich.

9
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:15,020
 Henry has all the troubles and growing pains that most boys go through under high school

10
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:16,020
 days.

11
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:20,020
 For Henry is a typical American boy.

12
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:25,020
 Tonight out in Centerville, the Aldrichs are just having dinner, and are seen open in the

13
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:27,020
 dining room of the Aldrich Hope.

14
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,020
 Have another lamb chop, Alan?

15
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:31,520
 No, thank you.

16
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,020
 You already think anything.

17
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:36,020
 Sam, I'm so tired of planning meals and cooking meals.

18
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:37,520
 I don't know what to do.

19
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,020
 Chops are awfully good, Mother.

20
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:40,020
 Yes, Mary.

21
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:43,020
 Say, say, who do you think I was just talking to on the phone?

22
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,020
 Oh, Henry.

23
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,020
 Kathleen.

24
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:47,020
 The folks want me to come over for dinner Saturday night.

25
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:48,020
 Tomorrow night?

26
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:50,020
 Sure. Isn't that a break for you, Mother?

27
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:51,020
 Why for me?

28
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:54,020
 Well, if I'm not here, you can just have any old thing for dinner.

29
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:57,020
 What do you mean, she can't?

30
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:59,020
 I've got to go out in the kitchen and whip some cream.

31
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:03,660
 I'll be clearing the table mother boy can you imagine we're not here the rest of us

32
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:09,340
 invited Henry she didn't mention any of you couldn't tell the Anderson's been here

33
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:14,020
 off me no Mary is that very kind but father gets inviting Henry's hardly

34
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:18,740
 any way to pay off a social debt Henry would you be disappointed if you didn't

35
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:23,700
 go to Kathleen's not go have you forgotten what they Sunday is Sunday

36
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,100
 Mm-hmm.

37
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,300
 Sunday.

38
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,020
 It's Mother's Day.

39
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:31,380
 Oh, but Father, I'm just going for dinner Saturday night.

40
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:34,140
 Well, I'd plan to take your mother and you and Mary

41
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:36,900
 out to dinner Saturday as her Mother's Day celebration.

42
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:37,780
 You had, Father?

43
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:40,340
 No, it's up to you as to where you'd rather go.

44
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:43,740
 Oh, see, I don't want to offend Mother, but I--

45
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:45,300
 You'd rather go to Kathleen?

46
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:48,500
 Well, I don't know.

47
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,500
 The hard thing to decide.

48
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,420
 There's never a day that mothers have a day.

49
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:56,420
 You're coming this way when you bring your play?

50
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:58,420
 I'm not coming that way, Mary.

51
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:01,420
 What would you like to do?

52
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:03,420
 Well, I'm phone-cathling.

53
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,420
 Yeah, sure, I'd love to go with you.

54
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:08,420
 Well, I guess I ought to get Mother something nice, don't you think?

55
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:09,420
 Splendid.

56
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:12,420
 Would you care to contribute anything toward it?

57
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,420
 I'd say.

58
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:16,420
 I'd say you'd like.

59
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:19,420
 Let it be a present from the entire family.

60
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:21,420
 It seems to me, son, you should have saved up for this occasion.

61
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:28,220
 I have father. I have I've earned nearly five dollars only I hate to see it all go at once

62
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:34,540
 I'm not through with my plate Mary. I have your glass. I'm not through with that either

63
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:39,980
 You may take my plate Mary. Thank you father. I'm glad somebody in this house cooperate father

64
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:45,300
 Father, how do you think mother would like to have me get her a new dress address sure?

65
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,300
 I don't see what would be so difficult about it

66
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:52,380
 All I have to do is get mother down to the store and just happen to take her by the dress department.

67
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:53,380
 And what?

68
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:59,380
 And as we go by, I say, "Gee, mother, look!" and she'll say, "Oh, isn't that one swell?"

69
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:00,380
 And I've got it all picked out.

70
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:03,380
 But supposing she picks one of the more expensive dresses.

71
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:07,380
 Well, I wouldn't mind the sacrifice. I just assume spend the whole $5.

72
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:14,380
 I think I ought to do something for mother. She puts up with an awful lot from us.

73
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:15,380
 from us.

74
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:18,820
 Henry, mother wants to know what you drank and he milked this afternoon.

75
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:19,820
 Just one glass, Mary.

76
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:22,140
 Well, what you drank was cream.

77
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:23,140
 Cream?

78
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,140
 Cream?

79
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:27,340
 I thought that was awful rich when I drank it.

80
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:30,100
 There is more stuff out there to whip.

81
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:34,380
 She was, well, tell her on Sunday, I'll make up for everything.

82
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:35,820
 Excuse me while I take this.

83
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,340
 I'm not through with that plate.

84
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:40,020
 There isn't anything left on at Henry.

85
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:42,060
 I've got my chop in my hand.

86
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,060
 May I have your bread and butter plate?

87
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:46,060
 But you're not to come any closer than that.

88
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:49,060
 And Henry, will you please eat your choppers you should.

89
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:52,060
 But Father, I waste so much when I eat it politely.

90
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:57,060
 Mary, you wouldn't like to go in on something real nice for Mother's Day, would you?

91
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:00,060
 I'd plan to get Mother something alone, Henry.

92
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,060
 What?

93
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,060
 A blouse?

94
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:03,060
 A blouse, Mary?

95
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,060
 A blouse?

96
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:05,060
 Mm-hmm.

97
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,060
 No skirt?

98
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:10,060
 Oh my goodness, I'm going to pay nearly 395 for it as it is.

99
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,060
 What is it?

100
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,060
 Well, how much would one come to?

101
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:15,060
 The very cheapest would be $2.95.

102
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:16,060
 What?

103
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,060
 Yes.

104
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:20,060
 I wonder whether Mother wouldn't like to go to the movies instead.

105
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:22,060
 Mother, is it time coming Mother?

106
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:25,060
 Father, there's an awfully good movie this week.

107
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,060
 What is it?

108
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:28,060
 The cowboy returns.

109
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,060
 Yes.

110
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:31,060
 I'd even be willing to blow the whole family to her.

111
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:36,060
 First, don't you think you'd better make sure the cowboy returns is what your mother wants to see?

112
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,060
 Oh, I would have her choice.

113
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:42,980
 You know Father, if we didn't go to an expensive place, I could almost take the whole family to dinner too.

114
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,860
 I think the movies will be sufficient.

115
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:47,700
 Oh no Father, I know of a place where it's very reasonable.

116
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,720
 I'd be glad to take all of you. How about it?

117
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,700
 Hannah, can you make room for this dessert?

118
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,860
 Mary Mother can't hear me out there, can she?

119
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:56,040
 Mother's mean speaking to you.

120
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,440
 She isn't Mary?

121
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,900
 She will.

122
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,700
 How would you like to go to the movies Mother's Day Eve?

123
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:02,800
 What's that, Hannah?

124
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,160
 Saturday night. I mean it.

125
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,920
 We're all going to the movies and to dinner as my guest.

126
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,600
 Really?

127
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,400
 - His father. - He's right, Mary.

128
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:13,360
 That's wonderful, because I was gonna take Mother down to get that blouse,

129
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,520
 and now we can meet you right afterwards.

130
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,200
 Boy, there isn't anything Mother likes more than a party.

131
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,720
 Here's your dessert, Sam.

132
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,080
 If you want any cream, as can we for it.

133
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,920
 When Mother back cream, I drank was in a picture.

134
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,760
 Look, of course it was in a picture.

135
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:31,080
 What do you mind if I change the subject of cream just a second?

136
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,240
 Mm, to what?

137
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,240
 What are you doing Saturday night?

138
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,280
 - Dear, I'm probably cooking dinner. - You are?

139
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,840
 We're all going to meet downtown for something.

140
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,640
 For what?

141
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,080
 Don't tell her Mary.

142
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,160
 Where should we meet?

143
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,120
 At the Employee and Department store at uh...

144
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,400
 $4.45.

145
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,160
 It's all set. $4.45.

146
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,440
 And that's going to make it terribly late for me to get home and cook dinner.

147
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,360
 Don't worry about cooking dinner, mother.

148
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,640
 But what are we going to do?

149
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,560
 Gee, was you wait. You're going to have one of the

150
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,560
 swillest times you ever had in your life.

151
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:18,560
 [Music]

152
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,560
 Oh, pardon me, sir.

153
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,560
 What is it, lady?

154
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,560
 Have you seen anyone waiting here at the entrance to the Emporium?

155
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,560
 No ma'am, not recently.

156
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,560
 Oh, thank you very much.

157
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:33,600
 Here it is 12 minutes after five. I don't mind waiting so much. I just keep wondering if they haven't been in an accident

158
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,600
 Yes, man.

159
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,600
 It's the perfect way it is.

160
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,600
 You might buy some flowers, ladies.

161
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,600
 No, thank you.

162
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,600
 Wouldn't you like to buy some carnations for mothers there?

163
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,600
 No, thank you.

164
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:56,880
 Well, you ought to remember your mother. That's what Lisa-

165
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,520
 One foot seat is the family near.

166
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,340
 There's nobody in this town.

167
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:01,800
 Then I will need the paper.

168
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,200
 Next race face, sir.

169
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,200
 Next race.

170
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,200
 Alice.

171
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,000
 Alice, why have you been waiting here at this entrance?

172
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,760
 Sam, where on earth do you think I've waited?

173
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,520
 Well, I've been standing around the corner.

174
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,240
 That's not the main entrance, Sam.

175
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,640
 Well, Alice, that is certainly the main entrance on that street.

176
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,960
 Well, at least you'll say that's something.

177
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,840
 The thing for us to worry about is my car.

178
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:19,840
 What's happened to that?

179
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,080
 I left it 30 minutes ago in a 15-minute parking space.

180
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,720
 But that still isn't as important as Henry and Mary.

181
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:28,720
 They're probably at the entrance all the way around on Market Street.

182
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,220
 Well go around and look for him.

183
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:31,020
 Where will you be?

184
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:33,720
 I'll wait right here. I won't move one foot.

185
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,920
 Ready like to buy a box of candy from others, eh?

186
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:36,720
 No thank you.

187
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,420
 Their hand-bipped and cherry filled.

188
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:39,420
 No thank you.

189
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:40,520
 Like some hazelnuts.

190
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,920
 No thank you.

191
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:44,920
 Fresh chocolate with cherries for your mother.

192
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:47,220
 She wears your mother where have you been?

193
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:49,320
 Right here where I was supposed to be, Henry.

194
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,320
 Imagine that.

195
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,120
 Where have you been?

196
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,520
 Just inside the door.

197
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,520
 Why, dear, did you wait in there?

198
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:58,760
 But mother, I think the inside of a door would be the only logical place to wait for someone.

199
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,680
 Couldn't you have at least looked outside?

200
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,520
 I finally did marry a word.

201
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,360
 Where's Mary?

202
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,860
 I have no idea which.

203
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:06,920
 Where's Father?

204
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:10,360
 Your father's gone down to the market street entrance to see where you are.

205
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:10,860
 I?

206
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,200
 Why would he look for me there?

207
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,200
 Well, then you certainly weren't here were you?

208
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,600
 Mother, I was here.

209
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,800
 Oh, I don't mean to argue with you, but...

210
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,200
 But all that's been separating us is that door.

211
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:21,960
 Yes, Henry.

212
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:26,540
 Now, supposing you take this nickel and go inside and telephone and see where the meringue

213
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:27,540
 left the house here.

214
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:28,540
 Yes, mother.

215
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:30,540
 Tell her the store closes at five-thirty.

216
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:31,540
 Yes.

217
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:34,540
 Extra space for young guy, I'll fix the fear.

218
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:35,540
 Sorry, sorry.

219
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:37,300
 What am I currently laying here?

220
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,300
 Have you been married?

221
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,900
 You're gray and dropped in just as I was leading.

222
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,900
 I thought he never was gone.

223
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,540
 She'll go in and do our shopping.

224
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,900
 Well, not until Henry and your father get back.

225
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:47,900
 Where are they?

226
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:51,300
 Henry's phoning you and your father's waiting for you around the market street.

227
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,300
 Isn't that ridiculous mother?

228
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,300
 It certainly is.

229
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,300
 What have we got to do now?

230
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,300
 Wait for them until I get back?

231
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,300
 I'm afraid we have, dear.

232
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,300
 Now at least one other's better.

233
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:04,300
 You stay right here while I go around and get your father.

234
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,300
 Can you find me?

235
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,300
 Of course I can find him.

236
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,300
 Now don't move until I get back.

237
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,300
 No mother.

238
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,300
 Pardon me, sir.

239
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,300
 What do you have, lady?

240
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:15,300
 On what? It would take me more than three minutes to run in and get one.

241
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,300
 That's a round I couldn't say.

242
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,300
 Dear, I wonder where...

243
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:20,300
 Mary.

244
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,660
 Mary, where is your mother?

245
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,460
 Father, where did you come from?

246
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:24,700
 Where do you think I came from?

247
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,780
 Well, Mother just went around after you.

248
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:28,100
 Now, why did she do that for?

249
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,900
 So we wouldn't have to wait so long.

250
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:30,600
 Where's Henry?

251
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,100
 He didn't start phoning me.

252
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,300
 What's that?

253
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,300
 Don't you think I ought to go in and tell him I'm here?

254
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,000
 You wait where you are. I'll go in.

255
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,300
 He is, Father.

256
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,200
 Flowers.

257
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,000
 Flowers from Mother's Bay.

258
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,800
 Fresh connish, son.

259
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,300
 Mother, I'm going to meet another n--

260
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,300
 She, whiz Mary.

261
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,200
 Where's Mother?

262
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,700
 She's gone after Father.

263
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,100
 Where's father?

264
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,500
 She thought you were phone me!

265
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,300
 Yeah, but Mary, I couldn't get you.

266
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,100
 Course you couldn't!

267
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,200
 How about get father?

268
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,600
 How long will he be gone?

269
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,900
 Two minutes.

270
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:02,200
 And, oh, Kathleen, phone you at the house!

271
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,700
 What did she want?

272
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:06,100
 Henry, did you tell her you couldn't come to dinner?

273
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,000
 Sure I did. I left the message with the maid.

274
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,700
 Well, Kathleen, it's nothing new!

275
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,100
 She wished she couldn't be...

276
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,500
 She's Harry, if they'll, Candice, or Mother's Day.

277
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,900
 Listen, Mr. You're gonna be here for a few minutes.

278
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:16,800
 Uh, yeah.

279
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,200
 Well, could you deliver a message for me?

280
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:25,180
 If you see a lady or a man or my sister looking for a phone, a brown suit like this,

281
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:28,380
 could you tell him I just stopped into phone a second?

282
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:48,260
 Well, now friends, while Henry is reflecting on his latest predicament,

283
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:53,360
 I'd like to bring you a news item about something that happened the other night in one of Pentaville's finest fans.

284
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:58,360
 They headline reads, "Permanent local man trapped in raid."

285
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:07,060
 And the article goes on to read, "Last night, about 1130, one of Pentaville's leading citizens was surprised by his wife,

286
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:13,760
 just as he had tiptoeed to the kitchen, raided the refrigerator, and finished eating a dish of pudding.

287
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,160
 Jello butterscotch pudding that had been left over from dinner.

288
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:23,160
 His wife was desolated as she had been planning to eat the Jello butterscotch pudding today for lunch.

289
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,660
 But the culprit showed no remorse.

290
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,960
 When questioned, he merely kept repeating.

291
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,160
 I'm glad I did it.

292
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,760
 Yes, and I do it again.

293
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:34,160
 I simply can't resist Jello butterscotch pudding.

294
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:44,060
 Well friends, seriously, that is just another way of saying that Jello butterscotch pudding is a dish that people won't be denied.

295
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:48,980
 I probably it has something to do with the grand buttery brown sugar flavor of this

296
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:53,300
 swelled dessert and the fact that Jello butter scotch pudding is as smooth as rich

297
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:58,380
 golden cream undoubtedly plays a big part in its appeal. At any rate this

298
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:01,940
 mellow treat is a mealtime favorite in thousands of homes the country over and

299
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:07,220
 I'm sure you'll find it's your favorite too. So try some real soon. You've

300
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:13,420
 honestly never tasted a more luscious dessert than Jello butter scotch pudding.

 Henry has just learned that although he's going out with his family, Kathleen is expecting him for dinner.

 Hello?

308
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,420
 Is that you, Kathleen?

309
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:46,920
 Yes Henry, did Mary tell you we're having dinner at 7 and 7 at 6.30?

310
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:50,720
 Yes, didn't your maid tell you? I'm going out for dinner with my mother.

311
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,720
 Henry!

312
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,420
 If you think you'll understand, Kathleen?

313
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:56,420
 Do you have to go with your mother?

314
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,920
 I'm taking her. I'm a host.

315
00:13:58,920 --> 00:13:59,920
 Oh.

316
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:05,920
 I'll tell you what I might try. Perhaps I could eat with her real fastly and then come up to your house.

317
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,420
 Well, wouldn't that make you late?

318
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:10,920
 What's the latest I could get there and still eat?

319
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:16,920
 Well, well, well, well, well, well, I guess when you stop to think of a Kathleen, maybe that would be time to do too much.

320
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,920
 Kathleen, who are you talking?

321
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:24,920
 Mother, can we overline? Mother, can we can't come mix that a day night?

322
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:28,920
 Oh, no. He's having dinner with his mother. Why don't you have photos of him come?

323
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,920
 Are you sure next Saturday night will be all alone?

324
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:31,920
 Yes, of course.

325
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:32,920
 Hello, Henry!

326
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:33,920
 Yes.

327
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,920
 Can we, my mother says to bring your mother too.

328
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:40,920
 Kathleen, what do I do with my father and Mary?

329
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,920
 What? Well, who overlines it the second, Henry?

330
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,920
 Mother, yes. Could we ask Mr. O'Rigin Mary to?

331
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,920
 Well, as a matter of fact, I think we should have them.

332
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:50,920
 Hello, Henry!

333
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,920
 Well, Mother thinks you bring the whole family.

334
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,920
 Oh, Kathleen, I don't think you should go to all that trouble.

335
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,920
 No, really, Henry. Mother, be very much offended if you didn't.

336
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:05,920
 Well, they're awaiting at the department store for me, I think.

337
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,520
 If you don't hear from me, you'll know we're coming.

338
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,520
 Alright.

339
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,520
 You understand about the time, Henry?

340
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,520
 Oh, sure.

341
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,520
 Seven o'clock.

00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,520
 [Music]

350
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,520
 [Music]

351
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,520
 [Music]

352
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,520
 Mother's was time.

353
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,520
 [Music]

354
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,520
 Exactly.

355
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,520
 20 minutes past six.

356
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:30,720
 To that man say how long it would be before Henry got back.

357
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,720
 No, dear.

358
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:35,120
 And when Father go, your father went down the street to get the car.

359
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,200
 That was 35 minutes ago.

360
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,160
 Would you like to have me get down and find him?

361
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:39,760
 No, dear.

362
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:42,560
 We're not going to beat this family up again.

363
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:47,800
 Well, I'm also sorry to start close before I could get your blouse.

364
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,480
 That's all right, dear.

365
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:52,000
 Just as long as we all finally get back together.

366
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,160
 He's starting to rain.

367
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,040
 Goodness.

368
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,400
 Yes, it's a good thing we didn't buy any new clothes, Miss Dio.

369
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:04,200
 Though, please remember, I still have on the best I own.

370
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:08,160
 - Come on, we'll step out into this entrance before you're down.

371
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,280
 Well, we said one consolation.

372
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,160
 Well, I'm glad you can see one.

373
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,160
 The rest of it we're going to after the movie

374
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,600
 says, "Well, oh."

375
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,680
 (buzzer)

376
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,640
 Look, look, see him in here, you're a major father.

377
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,360
 Let's run out and get in the car.

378
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,480
 - Are you okay, fellas?

379
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,280
 - Open the door, Sam.

380
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,400
 Get in, mother.

381
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,240
 - Now, wait, Henry.

382
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,240
 - We don't know, Sam.

383
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,080
 - We'll get in and out.

384
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,040
 - We can't go off and leave him.

385
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,560
 - No, you're getting over there.

386
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,560
 Everybody can get something.

387
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,060
 - Turkey can't talk here, that is.

388
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:37,020
 - Well, then what if you and Father

389
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:38,760
 are heading off Bayview?

390
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,960
 - No, Mary, you get in and I'll say.

391
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,640
 - Both of you get in.

392
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,280
 - Father, can't you come up close

393
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,240
 to the person outside?

394
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,580
 Father, go on.

395
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:47,840
 - This is a narrow street, Mary.

396
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,680
 The only way that Father can get around me

397
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,880
 is to go up on the sidewalk.

398
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:51,720
 - Oh, get in.

399
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,880
 Come on, Mary.

400
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:53,720
 - Hold the door.

401
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,040
 - Yes, Sam.

402
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,520
 So what do we do now?

403
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,020
 - We've got to get out of here.

404
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:59,920
 (motor whirring)

405
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:00,760
 Hey!

406
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,080
 Get moving there!

407
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,080
 Oh, not at all.

408
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:06,080
 What is the problem?

409
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:09,080
 Mary, must you just sit and ask questions.

410
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:11,080
 Mary, no chocolate, sir.

411
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:14,080
 No, no, I do not want to make any chocolate.

412
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:16,080
 Okay, okay.

413
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:18,080
 You better call your father.

414
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:21,080
 Is that all, Sam?

415
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,080
 No, Sam, please.

416
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,080
 Don't say I haven't been moving.

417
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:27,080
 Oh, Sam, stop!

418
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,080
 Now what's the matter?

419
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:31,680
 - Mother, you said stop! - Now what's the matter?

420
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,880
 - Please, Henry! - Yeah!

421
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,880
 - Is this newspaper? - What?

422
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,580
 - For...

423
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:39,380
 - Wait for me! - Stop, Sam!

424
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:41,380
 - I can't stop here! - Come on!

425
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:44,380
 - Come on! - Come on, Henry!

426
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:47,380
 - Come on! - No, here's the place I can pull in.

427
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:49,380
 - Henry! - Wait for me!

428
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:50,380
 Wait for me!

429
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:51,380
 I tell you the good news.

430
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:53,380
 - No time for good news. Get in the car.

431
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:55,380
 - Could you move over, Mary?

432
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:58,380
 - Henry, why didn't you leave that wet newspaper outside?

433
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:01,780
 I found two ways. Wait until I tell you the news.

434
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:04,380
 Henry, older, you simply spoke to the skin.

435
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:07,380
 Mother, this is gonna be a swell Mother's day yet.

436
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:10,180
 We've all got an invitation to go to Kathleen's for dinner.

437
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,080
 Really, Henry?

438
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:11,580
 Sure.

439
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:12,880
 You're living the older to be couldn't have.

440
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,380
 The Mother I just got through talking with Kathleen.

441
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:17,680
 Trevor, you're drinking water all over me.

442
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,380
 Well, I can't help where it runs, Mary.

443
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:24,380
 The only thing I can do was sit still and let it go where it wants.

444
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:25,880
 How about it, Mom?

445
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:30,980
 They couldn't have asked us for tonight mother Kathleen stood there by the phone and begged us to come tonight

446
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:36,280
 What do you think Sam? Don't leave it up to him mother. This is your party up to now

447
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:39,980
 You haven't had a good time at all, but this way you can have a wonderful evening

448
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:44,840
 What are you gonna do with all the money you save Henry? I'm not going to save a cent Mary

449
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:48,680
 I've got it all figured out and getting mother addressed with my money

450
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:53,880
 Well, Sam pull up some place and I'll tell a phone and make sure mother if you're phone or you'll only be wasting your

451
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,320
 Well are we are aren't we going?

452
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,920
 What do you think Sam?

453
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,120
 It's up to you Alice.

454
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,880
 My parents have awfully good food at the end.

455
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,880
 Of course they do.

456
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,320
 They are love to go there.

457
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,320
 And there you are.

458
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,560
 I'll make up your mind Alice.

459
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,560
 Sam I don't like mother.

460
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,720
 How many mothers days are there in a year?

461
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,720
 One.

462
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,720
 One.

463
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,720
 Yes Officer.

464
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,720
 We're just making up our minds.

465
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,720
 No I'd like to tell Sam.

466
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,720
 You will learn to go on.

467
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,720
 And I guess off the third we are.

468
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:24,120
 Hello Father, we're going to the Aniston!

469
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,020
 And boy am I hungry!

470
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:28,020
 You're not any hungry as I am!

471
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:45,520
 Mother!

472
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,020
 Mother!

473
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,120
 Yes, Captain?

474
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,920
 Can I help you with the dishes?

475
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:53,320
 Oh no, no, thank you. They're all wiped and put away.

476
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,920
 Anybody seen the evening papers?

477
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,920
 It's in a big chair, Father.

478
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:01,920
 Ah, I've been looking forward to just sitting around the night.

479
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,920
 Robert, do you want Kathleen to go out and get your slippers?

480
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,920
 Oh dear, I got them on.

481
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,920
 Where did I put my necktie?

482
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:09,920
 Oh, in the land.

483
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,920
 No, yes, yes.

484
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,920
 I always did like this chair.

485
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,920
 Now, Kathleen, I want you to go out and do your homework.

486
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,920
 Oh, my goodness.

487
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:24,920
 Oh, would you look at the dust on this keyboard?

488
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:31,920
 You know, Robert, I'm glad we let that made go.

489
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:37,920
 Oh, Robert?

490
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:38,920
 Hello?

491
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:41,920
 I look here when the overtures come next Saturday.

492
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,920
 Let's have everything just as nice as we know how.

493
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:47,920
 - Yeah, do it up brown.

494
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,920
 (sighs)

495
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:52,920
 Isn't it nice that I've won a year of home?

496
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:53,920
 - Mm-hmm.

497
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:54,920
 - Mm-hmm.

498
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,920
 - Mm-hmm.

499
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,920
 - Mm-hmm.

500
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,920
 - See, the Dodgers won today.

501
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,920
 (laughing)

502
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,920
 - Did I hear the doorbell ring?

503
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,920
 - Now, who in the world is supposed to have it?

504
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,920
 - Well, it's probably Daniel.

505
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,920
 - Well, I'm not gonna answer the doorbell.

506
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:09,920
 - Well, I'm going to run up there.

507
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,920
 - Now listen, Harvey.

508
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:13,920
 Daniel isn't going to notice those curlers.

509
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:23,920
 Oh, all right, I'll go to the door. - I know, you stop him. - Well, now, where's my other slipper? - It's way there underneath your chair.

510
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:32,920
 - Oh, come in. Come in, the door's unlocked. - Let him in and find you slipper later. - Oh, look at the ashes all over my face.

511
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:42,920
 - Hello there, Mr. Anderson. - Hello, Bob. - Well, well, hello. - Is there a way for us to drop in?

512
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,920
 No, no, no, not at all.

513
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,920
 So where is it?

514
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,920
 The Oracles.

515
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:52,920
 Oh, well, why don't you welcome to come in?

516
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,920
 They are in.

517
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,920
 Oh, no, they're Dorothy.

518
00:21:56,920 --> 00:22:00,920
 Well, Alice and Sam and everyone.

519
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,920
 How do you do, Mr. Anderson?

520
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:07,920
 Oh, look, you might as well put your things down and let's all go into the living room.

521
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:08,920
 Living room?

522
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:11,920
 Goodness, Alice, I was just going upstairs to take these curlers.

523
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,920
 Dorothy you look lovely.

524
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,920
 No, here we are.

525
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:16,920
 Thank you, Grandma.

526
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:17,920
 We didn't go to the movie.

527
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,920
 Yes indeed.

528
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,920
 Sit down, everyone.

529
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,920
 No mind if I do.

530
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,920
 No luck.

531
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,920
 How's business?

532
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,920
 Oh, pretty good.

533
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,920
 How's yours?

534
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,920
 Fair.

535
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,920
 Well, not fair.

536
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:39,920
 I'm sorry.

537
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,240
 Okay. Did I interrupt you Sam?

538
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,920
 No, no, no. I interrupted you.

539
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,160
 Oh, no. You didn't.

540
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,920
 What were you going to say?

541
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:50,320
 Well, the fact is that I don't remember what I was going to say.

542
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:54,120
 Well, I was going to ask Alice what movie she was going to see.

543
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,120
 "Stog for love."

544
00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:00,120
 Oh. Oh, my dear, they tell me that's the most beautiful picture.

545
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,120
 Is that the view?

546
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,120
 Yes.

547
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:06,120
 [laughter]

548
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:10,720
 Mr. Dan, is Kathleen out in the kitchen sort of helping you?

549
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,520
 No, no, she's upstairs, studying.

550
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,520
 - Oh, is that fine? - Yes.

551
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:19,520
 - Uh, have a cigar, same? - Oh, no.

552
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,520
 No, thank you. Not just before...

553
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:27,520
 - No, dear. - No, dear.

554
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,920
 It's eye-cathling. - Oh, the day, baby!

555
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,120
 I'll be right back.

556
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:35,120
 Robert, would you mind opening the window just in age or two?

557
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:39,080
 You see we had steak and onions, but then I'm said the whole for little be the same

558
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:42,440
 Steak and onions

559
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:46,600
 Do you like some Henry oh boy do I

560
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:50,200
 Mother's very fond of them too

561
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:56,240
 Alice I want to show you something this box Kathleen gave me for mother's name. Isn't that lovely?

562
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,840
 Why is it mrs. Handich? I have no idea, Maris

563
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:01,440
 Looks like candy to me

564
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:06,040
 Well, if it is, I should never promise Kathleen I wouldn't open it till tomorrow.

565
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,040
 You did promise her?

566
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:11,640
 Mother, did you come upstairs and help me in the day?

567
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,640
 Alice, would you excuse me, of course.

568
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:20,440
 Well, if you pardon me, I'll go out to the kitchen and see whether we have any titties or any unfurled.

569
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:23,440
 Oh, Bob, don't bother. We just had dinner.

570
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,440
 Oh, sir, Mary, supposing I could hear you.

571
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,940
 Well, Henry, so we invited you up for dinner.

572
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:31,940
 Some place there's been a very serious mistake.

573
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:32,940
 [laughter]

574
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,940
 That will be putting it mildly.

575
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:37,940
 And this is the most embarrassing moment I've ever had.

576
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:39,940
 Thank for us the terrific get out of here.

577
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:41,940
 Well I think we should stay long enough to be polite.

578
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,940
 Stay mother as hungry as I am.

579
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:46,940
 You're not any hungrier than the rest of us, Henry.

580
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:48,940
 Oh I had belonged to the cup of tea.

581
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:50,940
 And I didn't have anything.

582
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:53,940
 Supposing Alice we run on before they discover the mistake we've made.

583
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:56,940
 Father, Father, do you mind if I make a suggestion?

584
00:24:56,940 --> 00:25:03,940
 I do. Alice will tell him this holiday but we're going to run on to the movies and as soon as we get away we'll go get some dinner.

585
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:07,940
 And have a sort of apology to make you folks an afraid.

586
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:08,940
 Oh, what's the trouble, Bond?

587
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:12,940
 Well, here's the ginger ale. Everybody don't have any ice.

588
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:17,940
 No, no, listen, Baba, I give you my word, not one of us could drink a thing.

589
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:19,940
 And besides, we're going to have to know...

590
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:20,940
 Great idea, indeed.

591
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:29,300
 They thought there's a lot of fear. Tomorrow, the Mother's Day, we told Alice we were coming here, but we're really taking her to the movie.

592
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:31,420
 Well, well, isn't that love?

593
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:32,420
 Yeah.

594
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:34,860
 Bob, why don't you and I get on, I think, go mother?

595
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,420
 [LAUGHTER]

596
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:37,260
 Good idea.

597
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:39,180
 And then they get a new thing together.

598
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:41,700
 But Mrs. Anderson, let me explain something.

599
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:42,220
 Can't agree?

600
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:44,020
 But Mother, it's Henry!

601
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:45,740
 Yes, Mother.

602
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:48,780
 Mrs. Anderson, we'd be very glad to have you come along.

603
00:25:48,780 --> 00:26:04,780
 [Music]

604
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:08,780
 Oh, Martin, that's the best picture of the episode of "Holly Life."

605
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:13,280
 Yes, Dorothy, and it's been the best Mother's Day party I ever had in my life.

606
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,280
 Would you like another hamburger, Mother?

607
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,280
 No, thank you.

608
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,280
 Three is all I could possibly

 father

610
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:26,360
 Just to learn my idea of yours that we drop into this little hamburger thing

611
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:33,080
 Thank you, mr. Anderson. I haven't been in one of these places in years. I love them Sam and I used to drop in all the time

612
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:39,440
 Oh, mr. May I have the check please? Oh now Henry. I don't pay the check the movies were on you

613
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,480
 But mr. Anderson this whole evening has been on me

614
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,320
 Yes, and they it's certainly

616
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:04,320
 Henry Orbeach will be back in just a moment.

617
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:08,320
 If there's the next time that you want to give a party, there's no need to send out invitations.

618
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:13,320
 You just drop the word here and there that you're planning to make some jello pudding with.

619
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:17,320
 And before you can say come in, you have a house full of smiling guests.

620
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:20,320
 Yes, this well-re deserved is certainly become a big favor,

621
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,320
 and there's every reason why it's yours,

622
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:27,320
 because jello pudding whip is wonderfully good and downright easy to make.

623
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:30,320
 You just take one package of jello, any flavor,

624
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,320
 and one package of jello vanilla pudding,

625
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,320
 and make them up as you usually do.

626
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:38,320
 Then chill the jello, and whip it as directed on the box.

627
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,320
 Next, you chill the jello vanilla pudding,

628
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:45,360
 of vanilla pudding and add it to the fruit jello, beating constantly until it's blended.

629
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:52,160
 Then mold. And there you have a grand, inexpensive treat, serving 10 to 12 people and simply ideal

630
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:57,120
 for parties and special occasions. So be sure to try this new and intriguing combination

631
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:01,120
 of delicious jello and rich, creamy, jello vanilla pudding.

 - Well, I'm delighted to hear you say that.

642

 - What?

646
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,520
 - A party on Father's Day.

647
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,480
