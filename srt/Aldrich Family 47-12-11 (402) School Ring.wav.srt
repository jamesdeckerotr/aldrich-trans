00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 [Music]

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
 Jello Pudding's present.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 Henry! Henry O'Brien!

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 Coming, Mother.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 [Applause]

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 The O'Brien family, based on character originated by Clifford Goldsmith,

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 and starring as the stone that's Henry with Jackie Calcuss-Homer,

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 Brought to you by Jello Pudding.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 Just a taste of Jello Pudding's and believe me you will know

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 They are made by famous J-E-L-L-4

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 Yes, Jello Pudding's those old time, all time favorites you've always known and loved.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 All three so rich and distinctive, so creamy smooth with an old-fashioned homemade goodness.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 There's Jello chocolate pudding rich, dark and luscious.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 There's buttery brown sugar butterscotch and creamy rich vanilla, a trio of treats.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 They're made with milk and nourishing.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 They cook to perfection in just about five minutes.

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 And all three jello puddings are so gloriously good,

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 you'll say you never tasted anything better.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 And now for the Aldrich family.

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 There's something about a teenage boy that makes all of us laugh

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 And remember and live again the days of our yours.

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 And if he's a typical teenager like Henry Aldrich,

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 it's always a pleasure to join him in the joys and misadventures

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 that were ours when we were young.

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 It's evening. The scene is the Aldrich living room.

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 Father me, I just point out one thing.

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 What? It's only 750.

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 And do you realize how much a new suit of clothes would cause?

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 You want a new suit of clothes?

30
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 No, sir. I'd rather have a school ring.

31
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 Henry, for the last time, I'm not buying you a school ring.

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 I'd like to read my paper.

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 But father, everybody in school is getting one.

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 All the kids I know just went home and asked for money, and their father said, "Sure,

35
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 Gee whiz, you're welcome to it," and just walked over.

36
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 I see.

37
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 But I appreciate you being economical, father.

38
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 Gee, if you didn't pinch pennies around here, you wouldn't have any bank account at all.

39
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 Well, I'm glad you realized that.

40
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 You've built up quite a nice bank account that way, haven't you, father?

41
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 I have.

42
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 So you really wouldn't miss 750, would you?

43
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,280
 Henry, if you think I'm going to hand over 750 for a ring that you wind up giving to some girl.

44
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,680
 Father, whatever gave you an idea like that.

45
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:31,540
 See, the rings are solid gold with our school crest on them, and two colors.

46
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:33,760
 Why would I give a thing like that to a girl?

47
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,500
 I don't know, son, but we all do.

48
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,220
 You mean you once gave a ring to a girl?

49
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:41,600
 Henry, I'm trying to read my paper.

50
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:45,120
 Ah, but Father, I haven't told you why I really need it.

51
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,840
 You haven't?

52
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,000
 You see, the teachers all feel that we need something to keep up our morale.

53
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,040
 Just imagine you're sitting in history class and your board's stiff.

54
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:57,480
 And you just happen to glance down at your ring.

55
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,100
 And it's got your good old school crest on it.

56
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,320
 And boy, you want to stand up and cheer.

57
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,960
 That's very interesting, go on.

58
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,600
 And then you think of how much central high means to you.

59
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,280
 And it all comes back that you're there to get an education.

60
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:09,780
 Yes.

61
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:14,280
 So you pile into your history like a ton of bricks and you wind up first in your class.

62
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,880
 Everybody winds up first?

63
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,680
 No sir, just me.

64
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,680
 Oh.

65
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,780
 So can I please have a school ring?

66
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:22,280
 No.

67
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,780
 Father, have you thought of this?

68
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:24,780
 Henry, have you thought of this?

69
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:27,880
 If I bought you that ring, you wouldn't have it a week before it would be lost.

70
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,080
 Lost father? Lost?

71
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,880
 How could I lose it when it's on my finger?

72
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,880
 What about that fountain pen I bought you last month?

73
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,480
 You wanted to know how you could lose that when it was clipped to your jacket?

74
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,880
 Well, I didn't lose that pen, Father.

75
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:37,380
 No.

76
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:38,680
 I just lost the jacket.

77
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:41,080
 I see.

78
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,680
 And I couldn't very well lose my finger.

79
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,680
 Henry, I'm not going to argue. The point is, until your memory improves, I'm not buying you another thing.

80
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:52,080
 Oh, my memory, Father. Is that all that's worrying you?

81
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,180
 Is that all? Henry, do you realize how important memory is?

82
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:58,380
 Sure, Father. And from now on, you're going to see a big change in me.

83
00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:58,880
 Good.

84
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:02,680
 Boy, I'm going to remember every single thing I can lay my mind on.

85
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,980
 For instance, do you know what year the Battle of Waterloo was for?

86
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:06,680
 What year?

87
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,980
 I'll go and look it up.

88
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:08,880
 [audience laughter]

89
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:09,880
 You wait there, Father.

90
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,180
 Henry, look at how...

91
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:12,680
 Gee, I'm sorry, Mother.

92
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,680
 Did I knock you over?

93
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,680
 Not quite.

94
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,680
 My goodness, Sam.

95
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,680
 What are you so excited about?

96
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,780
 Alice, I'm supposed to be a good lawyer, but I'd hate to come up against Henry and

97
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:21,780
 Court.

98
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:23,280
 He does have a way with him, doesn't he?

99
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,280
 He does indeed.

100
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,280
 It's about that school ring.

101
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,320
 Sam, why don't you get it for him?

102
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,880
 I am going to get it for him for a Christmas present.

103
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,680
 Oh, but I'm not sure I'll be able to hold up that long.

104
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,260
 (upbeat music)

105
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:46,600
 - May I have the toast please, mother?

106
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,600
 - Yes, dear.

107
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,700
 - Some more coffee, Sam?

108
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,240
 - That's half a cup, please.

109
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,600
 Why isn't Henry down for breakfast?

110
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,960
 - You'd be right down.

111
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,160
 My isn't this a lovely morning.

112
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,920
 - Mother, is there anything we can do

113
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,520
 about Henry this evening?

114
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,640
 - How do you mean, dear?

115
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,720
 - Well, with Joe Graham coming and everything,

116
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,080
 I don't want Henry coaxing for that ring all through dinner.

117
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,680
 I think we haven't got a cent.

118
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,880
 Well, if Joe's interested only in your money,

119
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,380
 you might as well find it out right now.

120
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:11,680
 Oh, Father, anyway, Mary, about that ring.

121
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,680
 Your father's decided--

122
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,480
 Alice!

123
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:13,980
 What do you--

124
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,980
 Mary, will you, uh, please run out to the kitchen

125
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:17,080
 and fry me another egg?

126
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,480
 All right, Father.

127
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,280
 Sam, what's the matter?

128
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,680
 I don't want Mary to know.

129
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,380
 I'm getting Henry that ring.

130
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:25,080
 She's sure to let the cat out of the bag.

131
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:25,680
 Oh, yes, dear.

132
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,080
 Perhaps you're right.

133
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:30,280
 My-- I can't wait to see Henry's face on Christmas morning.

134
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,080
 The only thing is--

135
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,680
 Have you any idea how we can get his finger signed?

136
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,480
 Sam, I thought you were going to measure his finger last night when he was asleep.

137
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,080
 I did, but something went wrong.

138
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,180
 What happened here?

139
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:43,380
 Well, I got the string nicely knotted around his finger,

140
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:45,380
 and just as I went to cut it, he rolled over.

141
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:46,580
 On the scissors?

142
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:47,980
 No, Alice, on the string.

143
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:50,280
 His hand disappeared under his chest someplace,

144
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,680
 and every time I tried to get it, he just giggled.

145
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,780
 Sam.

146
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:55,480
 Here he comes.

147
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,780
 Alice, this was a grand breakfast.

148
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:58,680
 Good morning, Mom.

149
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,580
 Good morning, dear.

150
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:00,480
 Good morning, Father.

151
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,480
 Good morning, Henry.

152
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,380
 Well, goodbye.

153
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,080
 Henry, what do you mean goodbye?

154
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,180
 What about your breakfast?

155
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,780
 I don't feel like any breakfast mother.

156
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:08,680
 - Edward, don't be silly.

157
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,780
 - I could need a bit, father.

158
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:11,480
 I honest, I'm too.

159
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,680
 I'm not hungry.

160
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,680
 - Hey Henry.

161
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,880
 - I'm coming Homer.

162
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,880
 - Henry, you can't go to school without eating.

163
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,580
 - I'll eat an apple on the way.

164
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:22,480
 - Why Henry, you don't eat an apple right in front of me?

165
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,480
 - Come on.

166
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,080
 Boy, am I worried.

167
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,680
 - Well, don't worry about it.

168
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,080
 If you haven't got two apples,

169
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,680
 see y'all understand.

170
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:35,080
 Homer, do you remember me saying anything about something my father asked me to do?

171
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:35,880
 Why?

172
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,280
 You see the string tied on my finger?

173
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:43,080
 Well, I woke up this morning and there it was and I can't remember what I tied it on there for.

174
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,980
 So that's easy, Henry. You wish to remind you to do something?

175
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,480
 Sure it was.

176
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,580

 I'm getting Henry a school ring for a Christmas present.

223

 I want to make sure I get it before they're all gone.

224
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,500
 Yes, but here's the catch. It has to be picked up in person at the school,

225
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,500
 and I don't want Henry or any of his friends to see me down there. They might suspect something.

 Well, I understand, Mr. Eldridge.

00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,320
 Oh, say, I think I have just the thing for you.

354
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,200
 It's a little Cape Cod, stone and clabbard, and it's a beauty.

355
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,120
 Oh goodness, it sounds perfectly wonderful.

356
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,120
 Just a moment, Mary. I'll do the talking.

357
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,360
 And Mr. Crawford, it sounds as though it might be satisfactory.

358
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,360
 Oh, how about the price?

359
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,800
 Oh, it's dirt cheap, Mrs. Aldrich.

360
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,800
 They're giving it away for 17,000.

361
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,200
 17,000 dollars?

362
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,840
 Mr. Crawford, that's ridiculous.

363
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,720
 Come along, Mary.

364
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,480
 Mrs. Aldrich, you haven't even seen the house.

365
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,680
 Thank you very much for your trouble, but please forget the whole thing.

366
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,320
 But wait, you're--

367
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,560
 We were really just looking anyway, Mr. Crawford.

368
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,200
 He hasn't even asked me, yes!

369
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:16,200
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

370
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:25,480
 I'm glad you dropped into the office, Will.

371
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,720
 I can't seem to keep my mind on work somehow.

372
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,920
 I can understand that.

373
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,560
 It'll take a while to get used to it.

374
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,720
 Mary seems so young.

375
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,480
 I just can't picture getting married.

376
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,440
 Boy, that wedding will set you back something.

377
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,000
 Well, I know mine that so much.

378
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,440
 I've been watching the pennies for a while.

379
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,600
 Will I manage to build up a nice little bank account?

380
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,100
 Yeah.

381
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,000
 Besides, I'm sure Mary will be sensible about it.

382
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,200
 I wouldn't count on it.

383
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,500
 They all want a big splash.

384
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,500
 Oh, I don't know, Will.

385
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,500
 Well, that's one consolation about Homer.

386
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,800
 When he gets married, someone else can worry about the build.

387
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,000
 Excuse me.

388
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:53,800
 Hello.

389
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,200
 Hello, is that Mr. Samuel Aldrich?

390
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:55,700
 Yes?

391
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:56,800
 This is Mr. Crawford.

392
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,400
 Oh?

393
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,000
 Mr. Crawford, the real estate office?

394
00:13:59,000 --> 00:13:59,300
 Yeah?

395
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,500
 I thought perhaps I'd better talk his thing over with you.

396
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,200
 What thing?

397
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,300
 About the house.

398
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,800
 Your wife apparently isn't aware that prices have gone up.

399
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,700
 And if you want a house--

400
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,300
 I don't want to have to have.

401
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:11,300
 But Mr. Orridge, your wife was in my office only yesterday.

402
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:14,540
 She was definitely interested in looking in a small house with about five rooms.

403
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:15,100
 What?

404
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,700
 And I found a little jewel for only 12,000.

405
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:20,900
 Oh, look, Mr. Crawford, suppose I got in touch with you.

406
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:21,600
 You'll do that?

407
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,300
 Yes.

408
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,300
 One way or the other.

409
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,300
 All right, sir.

410
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,600
 Well, Sam, what's happened?

411
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,900
 Is it bad news?

412
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,500
 Alice is out looking at houses.

413
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,300
 What for?

414
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:33,600
 But she's been saying she didn't think she could stand our old house without Mary.

415
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,600
 But I didn't think she meant it literally.

416
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,280
 Well, you just said you have a nice bank account.

417
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,200
 Not that night.

418
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:51,560
 Famous favorites for years.

419
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:54,800
 And no wonder, because you never tasted anything better.

420
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,400
 That's jello puddings.

421
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,920
 Jello chocolate, butterscotch, and vanilla pudding,

422
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,320
 with that old-fashioned homemade goodness.

423
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:05,560
 Yes, a trio of treats, smooth as cream, rich and distinctive,

424
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:08,640
 with a full-bodied flavor that's luscious and satisfying.

425
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:11,120
 Treat the folks to Jello Vanilla Pudding tomorrow.

426
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,480
 Dress it up with sparkling maraschino cherries,

427
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,360
 a combination to tempt both the eye and the appetite.

428
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:19,800
 Jello Vanilla Pudding, with this enticing rich vanilla delicacy,

429
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,880
 always calls for second helpings.

430
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,800
 And there's Jello Butterscotch Pudding.

431
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,920
 How the kids go for that smacking good buttery brown sugar

433
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,800
 chocolatey flavor.

434
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,440
 All three Jello Puddings are nourishing, made with milk,

435
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:37,520
 and they cooked to creamy perfection in just about five minutes.

 So asked for jello puddings, chocolate, butterscotch, and vanilla.

437

00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:55,600
 And now getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldrich.

440
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,160
 Hoping to get a school ring, Henry is desperately trying

441
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,640
 to remember something his father asking to do.

442
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:03,040
 Mr. Aldrich, however, has already sent Joe Graham down

443
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,280
 of the school to get the ring as a Christmas present for Henry.

444
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:10,120
 And Mary believes Joe is buying her an engagement ring.

445
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:14,520
 It's the next day in the scene opens in the Aldrich backyard.

446
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:17,320
 Henry, where are you?

447
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,040
 I'm in the backyard, Homer.

448
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,240
 Where did you disappear to?

449
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,400
 I've been around in front resting on the porch.

450
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:22,960
 Resting?

451
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:23,640
 Sure.

452
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:27,280
 Don't you think I get tired watching you do all this work?

453
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,800
 Well, and you better go away again, Homer,

454
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,840
 because I'm going to finish beating these rugs.

455
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:34,280
 If you ask me, Henry, you're gonna kill yourself doing all this work.

456
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,480
 But don't you get it, Homer?

457
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:39,720
 If I do all the things my parents usually ask me to do, I'm sure to do it.

 For him, yeah, I've got some news for you.

00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:51,560
 Yeah.

00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:54,840

 And he gave William a check from your father.

 He did?

00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:06,840
 Well, well, see, what's wrong with that?

473
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,680
 Joe used to go to Central High, didn't he?

474
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,680
 Well, sure.

475
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:12,140
 Well, see, that's only natural.

 Joe's going to be a part of the family.

477
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,320
 My father has a perfect right to buy in the school room.

478
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:17,960
 Instead of buying one for you?

479
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:18,800
 Sure.

 No thank you I was wondering if you carried pear trees.

00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:08,420
 Oh yes indeed. The Emporium carries everything and if we don't we can get it for you.

 Oh well that's fine. Can you send six pear trees up to my home right away?

 Well, I thought this was as good a time as any to get them in.

 Of course they will.

 Although you know that pear trees are quite expensive.

 They cost considerably less than $12,000.

 Oh, yes, considerably.

00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:11,320
 Thank you.

531
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,320
 One of them needs mending.

532
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:16,320
 I'll just throw in a needle and some thread.

533
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,320
 Might as well get used to doing my own mending.

534
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,320
 Henry, why run away now?

535
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,320
 Why not at least wait till after Christmas?

536
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,320
 No, Homer, my mind's made up.

537
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,320
 I'm leaving just as soon as I have dinner.

538
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:30,320
 Henry, have you any idea how tough it is on the road?

539
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,320
 I won't be begging, Homer.

540
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,320
 I'll be working my way.

541
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,320
 Working?

542
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,320
 What I?

543
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,320
 I'll find something.

544
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,320
 At least I have an education.

545
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,720
 Yeah, and I'm not a child, you know.

546
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:44,120
 Your suitcase is getting pretty full.

547
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,120
 That's what I was thinking.

548
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:50,320
 I guess I'll have to throw out my rock collection.

549
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:54,320
 You're throwing your rocks away?

550
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,820
 Hope you don't think I'm gonna leave 'em around for Joe Graham.

551
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:00,020
 Henry, did I tell you that I'm pretty interested in rocks?

552
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:00,820
 You are?

553
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:03,320
 Well, that is, if you're running away.

554
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,120
 In that case, Homer, here.

555
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,320
 They are yours.

556
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,520
 Gee, Henry.

557
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,020
 You're giving them to me?

558
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:10,620
 Gee, you shouldn't.

559
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:12,020
 Nothing of her.

560
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:14,020
 Can you reach up on the wall there, please, Homer,

561
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:16,020
 and hand me Kathleen's picture?

562
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:17,580
 Look at her, Henry.

563
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,500
 Look at her smiling at you.

564
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,020
 Just hand it to me, Homer.

565
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,780
 Look what she's written on it.

566
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:26,660
 To Henry, yours truly, Kathleen Anderson.

567
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:29,300
 Just think of how she's gonna feel.

568
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:31,020
 Think of the spring prom, Henry.

569
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,460
 Now listen, Homer.

570
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:33,340
 Is that our door, Bill?

571
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:34,180
 Sure.

572
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:36,020
 But why should you worry about it?

573
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:37,380
 I guess I'll answer it, though.

574
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:40,180
 At least I can do for my family on my last night.

575
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:42,820
 Can I start taking my rocks out of your suitcase?

576
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:44,460
 Sure. Help yourself.

577
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:50,100
 Oh, hi, Henry.

578
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,500
 She was Joe. I haven't even left yet.

579
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,580
 I beg your pardon?

580
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,820
 Well, come on in.

581
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:57,540
 Thanks.

582
00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:02,340
 And I just want to say, Joe, no hard feelings about what?

583
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:04,460
 You know, everything.

584
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:05,500
 Oh.

585
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,300
 Well, no hard feelings here, either.

586
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:11,620
 naturally. Is your father around? I think I heard him come in a little while ago.

587
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:14,260
 Go, Brian! That you? Hello, Mr. Eldritch.

588
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:18,180
 Well, well, it's nice to see you. I'll just go on back up, Steve.

589
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:21,540
 Here, have to take your coat, Joe. Thank you, sir. Mr. Eldritch, I, uh,

590
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:26,420
 I thought I'd drop over with Henry's ring. Oh, good. Thank you. I guess you'll be buying one or

591
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:30,900
 two more before long, eh? What's that? Eh, suppose we go into the living room and have a little chat.

592
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:36,460
 All right. Well, well, sit down, son.

593
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:43,100
 Thank you, sir. Well, well, well, well, Joe.

594
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,700
 [audience laughter]

595
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:47,840
 Yes, Mr. Aldrich? Oh, just call me.

596
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,340
 Well, no, there's no point in rushing things, I guess.

597
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:52,980
 No, no, there isn't.

598
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,260
 Rushing what, sir?

599
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,580
 Let me put it this way.

600
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:58,900
 Mary's a fine girl, Joe, a fine girl.

601
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:01,220
 Oh, yes, I like her very much.

602
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:02,220
 Naturally.

603
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:05,520
 Well, I guess I'll be running along now.

604
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,720
 Oh, nonsense, Joe. We'll be having dinner in a few minutes.

605
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,920
 You're just in time. But I was here for dinner two nights ago.

606
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:13,320
 Well, things are a little different now. Aren't they, son?

607
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,520
 They are?

608
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:17,720
 Now, let me give you a word of advice, Joe.

609
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:21,720
 You and Mary will get along fine as long as you remember a few simple rules.

610
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,820
 We get along, all right?

611
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:25,620
 Yes, but wait until you see how she ironed your shirts.

612
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:26,220
 What's that?

613
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:29,320
 It runs in the family, Joe. They just can't iron shirts.

614
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,920
 Now you take my advice and send them out to the laundry.

615
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:34,320
 But my mother irons my shirts.

616
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,620
 Oh and that's another thing.

617
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,320
 Don't ever mention your mother.

618
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,020
 No?

619
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:39,920
 Your mother can't do a thing, remember that.

620
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,720
 She can't cook, she can't mend.

621
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,220
 And above all she can't keep up.

622
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:45,620
 Mr. Roaldrich, my mother's a fine woman.

623
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:47,520
 Well yes, Joe and so is mine.

624
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,520
 But you'll have to choose between them.

625
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,220
 I will?

626
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:52,020
 Uh-uh.

627
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:54,220
 And not about covered it.

628
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:55,120
 Oh.

629
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,320
 But I just like to say, Joe, I'm not losing a daughter.

630
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:58,820
 Mother!

631
00:22:58,820 --> 00:22:59,820
 Oh yes, Mary.

632
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:00,820
 What is this dinner is all my...

633
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:01,820
 Oh.

634
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:02,820
 Hello, Mary.

635
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:03,820
 Wait.

636
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:04,820
 Hi, Joe.

637
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:05,820
 Hello, Joe.

638
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:06,820
 Hi, goodness.

639
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:07,820
 Yes, Mary?

640
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:12,820
 Joe, I want you to know that I'm starting cooking school on Monday, and I'm also very

641
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:13,820
 good at dining socks.

642
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:14,820
 You are?

643
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:15,820
 Yes, indeed.

644
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:18,820
 You'll never have to worry about your socks in the future.

645
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:20,820
 You mean Mary's going to dorm them?

646
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:21,820
 Of course, Joe.

647
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:23,820
 But my goodness, here I am doing all the talking.

648
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:26,820
 Oh, before you forget, Joe, where's the reading?

649
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:27,820
 Oh, here it is, Mr. Olga.

650
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:32,620
 Oh, thank you, Joe. I really didn't want you to know about it, Mary, but now that you and Joe,

651
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:36,420
 well, it's a Christmas present for Henry. Don't you think you like it?

652
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:41,720
 Let's go run. Joe, is that what you and Father were talking about the other night?

653
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,820
 Well, sure. Oh, oh my goodness.

654
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:46,020
 Is something wrong, Mary?

655
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,820
 No, I still got hurt you in here.

656
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:49,620
 Oh, good evening, Mrs. Oldich, how are you?

657
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:52,620
 I'm fine, thank you. And isn't it nice having you?

658
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:53,220
 Joe, come on.

659
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:53,620
 Where?

660
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:54,820
 Anyway, just come on!

661
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:57,220
 Mary, have you been saying anything about my mother?

662
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:59,860
 (audience laughing)

663
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:03,300
 - Alice, does it strike you, Mary's acting very strangely?

664
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,740
 - I hadn't noticed.

665
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:07,300
 What I'm wondering about is that phone call.

666
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,140
 - What phone call?

667
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:10,540
 - From the Emporium, a man phoned a while ago

668
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:13,180
 and asked if I wanted the rugs delivered tomorrow.

669
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:16,460
 - Oh, Alice, I've been meaning to speak to you about that.

670
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:18,700
 I ordered those new rugs you've been wanting

671
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,340
 for the living room in front hall.

672
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:21,420
 - You what?

673
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:23,500
 - Also six pear trees and enough paint

674
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,260
 to do the whole house inside and out.

675
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:26,100
 - What's that?

676
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,700
 I thought we might redecorate the upstairs the way you wanted.

677
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,060
 Sam, you darling.

678
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:31,060
 You're pleased, Alice.

679
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:31,860
 Please.

680
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:35,020
 I've never been so surprised and happy in my whole life.

681
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:37,460
 You mean you'll reconsider about the new house?

682
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:38,940
 What new house?

683
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:40,340
 By the one you've been looking at.

684
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:42,580
 Here, I never wanted a new house.

685
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:43,100
 What?

686
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:43,900
 Well, now look.

687
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:46,020
 And excuse me, I want to call the Emporium

688
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:47,460
 and tell him to send those rubs.

689
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,220
 Alice, wait.

690
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:48,820
 Well, of course.

691
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:49,660
 I'm sorry, Henry.

692
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:50,740
 Did I knock you over?

693
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:52,660
 Not entirely.

694
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:54,260
 Listen, father.

695
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:58,660
 I started thinking about the spring prom and a few things and then I smelled the

696
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:02,920
 stew mother's cooking for supper and I'd like to make you a proposition father.

697
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:03,920
 A proposition?

698
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:04,920
 Yes sir.

699
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:08,940
 From today on I'll polish the car twice a week and I'll get up at six o'clock every morning

700
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:09,940
 to stoke the furnace.

701
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:10,940
 You know what?

702
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:13,860
 And besides I'll shovel all the walks and carry out the ashes.

703
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:15,380
 What would you think of that?

704
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:17,380
 I think I was dreaming.

705
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:19,380
 Well it's a deal father, shake.

706
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:20,380
 Shake.

707
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:21,380
 Shake.

708
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:24,980
 Henry, while this was supposed to be a Christmas present,

709
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:28,380
 under the circumstances, I think I'd like you to have it now.

710
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:31,880
 Father, my school rings.

711
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,380
 You like it, son?

712
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:35,380
 Like it! Boy!

713
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:38,880
 And Father, I finally remembered what you wanted me to do, I think.

714
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,380
 I wanted you to do something?

715
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:42,880
 Sure, you wanted me to burn that pile of bushes in the backyard.

716
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:43,380
 What?

717
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:44,880
 And it's all taken care of.

718
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,880
 Henry, my pear tree!

719
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:56,880
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

720
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,600
 Mr. Wiest, Mr. Wiest, do you want to know something?

721
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,640
 Well, sure.

722
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,040
 Well, I'd like to tell you about my favorite brunette.

723
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,200
 Ah, one of those true glamour girls,

724
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:09,640
 I'll bet, with rich, dark tresses and glorious dark eyes.

725
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,520
 No, no.

726
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,340
 I'm talking about my favorite brunette dessert,

727
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:17,280
 that rich dark jello chocolate pudding.

728
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:19,500
 Why, of course, jello chocolate pudding.

729
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,420
 You never tasted anything better

730
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:23,720
 with that marvelous true chocolate flavor,

731
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:26,900
 especially made by the famous Walter Baker chocolate people.

732
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:29,260
 All three jello puddings, chocolate, vanilla,

733
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:31,780
 and butterscotch are rich and distinctive,

734
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:34,700
 with real old-fashioned homemade goodness.

735
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,900
 Jello vanilla pudding, smooth the cream,

736
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,780
 with that tempting vanilla delicacy.

737
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:41,420
 Jello butterscotch pudding, with that buttery brown sugar

738
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:43,660
 taste, and say all three jello puddings

739
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:47,460
 cooked to perfection in just about five minutes and they're nourishing made with

740
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:48,100
 milk

741
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:52,300

742
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:53,700
