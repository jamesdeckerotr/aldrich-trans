00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
 Now it's the Aldrich family on NBC. But first this is Bob McKenzie, beginning Monday over most of these stations, two of your favorite NBC friends will be coming to you at a new time.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 The first will be Bob Hope and his quips and comments, and by the way Bob's guest editor this coming week will be Screenstar and Baxter.

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 The second will be that master of the easy style Dave Garaway.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,100
 Now a lot of us have gotten into the habit of tuning in the boys, so check your

5
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:31,220
 newspaper for broadcast times and listen at the New Time Monday for two of the

6
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:37,260
 most entertaining 15 minutes in radio with Bob Hope and Dave Garaway. Now it's

7
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:41,460
 the Aldrich family on NBC.

8
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:50,260
 Henry! Henry Aldrich!

9
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:51,260
 Coming Mother!

10
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:59,860
 Yes, it's the Audrey family, it's time.

11
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:02,060
 Written by Pippa Goldsmith.

12
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:20,960
 The everyday existence of an average teenage boy like Henry Aldrich

13
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,600
 is always a very complicated affair.

14
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,200
 Life is one crisis after another.

15
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,460
 And if the normal run of problems isn't baffling enough,

16
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:33,560
 there are always adults around to make things even more difficult.

17
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:38,120
 The scene opens in the Aldrich Breakfast Nook, and the time is morning.

18
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:41,800
 Well, Stan, it's good to have you downstairs again.

19
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,800
 Thank you, Alice.

20
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,800
 Good morning, everybody.

21
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,840
 Can we don't you know you shouldn't whistle?

22
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,840
 Well, not Mary.

23
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:54,000
 Don't you realize Father's just recovering from a virus attack?

24
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,480
 Oh. Did it disturb you, Father?

25
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,800
 Well, I did feel a slight draft.

26
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,480
 Sam, I just happened to remember.

27
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,680
 What have you got in your hand?

28
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,080
 I forgot to take your temperature before you came down.

29
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:07,200
 Alice, you're not going to take my temperature at the breakfast table.

30
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,880
 But, dear, I really think we should.

31
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,600
 I haven't had any temperature for three days.

32
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,240
 Father, is there anything I can do for you?

33
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,240
 No, thank you, Mary.

34
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,240
 [whistling]

35
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,240
 Henry!

36
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,240
 Oh, she was, I forgot.

37
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:22,240
 Sam, take this scarf and pull your bathrobe collar up.

38
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:25,240
 Alice, I don't need anything more around my neck.

39
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,240
 Can I get you anything, Father?

40
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,240
 No, thank you.

41
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,240
 I just wish you'd all stop acting so I would die.

42
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,240
 After all, I'm out of bed.

43
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:37,240
 Back the doctor says I can stay downstairs two hours today.

44
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,240
 May I have the hotcakes and sausage, please?

45
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,240
 Nia, dear.

46
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,240
 Why can't I have hotcakes and sausage?

47
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,640
 because milk toast is better for you.

48
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,240
 That's all I've had for five days.

49
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,040
 Well, there if you continue to improve

50
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,640
 how would you like a boiled potato for dinner?

51
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:56,440
 That is certainly something to look forward to.

52
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,240
 If I eat my milk toast this morning,

53
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,440
 I may have a boiled potato tonight.

54
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:03,640
 Harry!

55
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,840
 Oh, I'm sorry, Mary.

56
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,640
 Can't you see that father's already irritable?

57
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,040
 What do you mean I'm irritable?

58
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,240
 Oh, by the way, Mary, when you come home this afternoon,

59
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,640
 Will you be sure to put the vegetables on in time for dinner?

60
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:16,840
 Oh, but Mother, I've got to run over to the hospital this afternoon.

61
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,740
 The hospital, Mary?

62
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:18,740
 Yes, Henry.

63
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,240
 Any reason why Joe Graham can't come over here?

64
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,640
 Father, he's an intern.

65
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:27,640
 He only has two hours off, and I told him I'd meet him there instead of his coming all the way over here.

66
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:31,240
 Well, and Henry, you'll have to get the vegetables ready when you get home from school.

67
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,040
 Yes, Mother.

68
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,640
 Must Henry get the vegetables ready?

69
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,240
 Oh, my goodness, Sam.

70
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:39,340
 I don't know why you can't peel a few potatoes and drop them in a pod.

71
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:42,340
 After all, I promised to work at the Red Cross today.

72
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:45,340
 I'm going to be left alone all day.

73
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:48,340
 Henry, didn't Mary ask you not to hear so?

74
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:51,340
 Oh, yes, Mother. I just can't get that tune out of my head.

75
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,340
 And Father, don't you worry about a single thing.

76
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:57,340
 I'll be home the minute school is out and do anything I can to make you feel better.

77
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:58,340
 That's fine, dear.

78
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:59,340
 I'll take you temperature.

79
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,340
 Henry, I don't have a temperature.

80
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:03,340
 Well, then I'll keep you bundled up.

81
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:05,340
 I don't want to be bundled up.

82
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,340
 She was, and I'll just peel the potatoes.

83
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:09,340
 - That was splendid.

84
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:11,760
 (jazz music)

85
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:22,300
 - Hey, hold on a second, call me on.

86
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,600
 - Hey, Henry, wait a minute, I'll walk down the hall with you.

87
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,260
 - Well, hurry up, we'll be late for biology.

88
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,820
 - You done your assignment for the day?

89
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:29,300
 - Well, I sorta glanced through it, Homer,

90
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,140
 but that's all right, I don't have to know it.

91
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:32,980
 - Well, you mean you don't have to know it.

92
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:35,660
 - Oh my god, Ms. Walker's system all figured out.

93
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:36,940
 They haven't you ever noticed what she does?

94
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:41,940
 Sure. What? Well, she always calls in this alphabetically. That's a fact.

95
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:44,440
 And last time she stopped way down in the K's.

96
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,940
 Oh no, Henry, you're wrong. She stopped with W.

97
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:49,940
 And there's only one other person after that before she comes to Aarbridge.

98
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:51,440
 Are you sure about that, Homer?

99
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,440
 Sure, I'm sure. That's why I studied last night.

100
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,940
 Today she's a synced to calling the A's and the B's.

101
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,940
 Well, she whiz, let me start studying this.

102
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:02,440
 Well, you haven't time to cram now, Henry. The bell's gonna ring any minute.

103
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:06,440
 But once, Homer, once back, last November, she got up to W and then started going backwards.

104
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,440
 So how do you know she's gonna do it again?

105
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,240
 She might, Homer. She just might.

106
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,640
 Boy, I pity you if she doesn't though, Henry.

107
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:16,240
 This is the last period of the day, and she'll make you stay after school.

108
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,640
 But Homer just can't stay after school today.

109
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,440
 Why not?

110
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,240
 We have to go right home and pee on my father.

111
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:24,040
 What? I mean, the potatoes.

112
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,240
 Well, why do you have to pee on potatoes for?

113
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,040
 Because we're going to eat them.

114
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:28,640
 Oh.

115
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,440
 Come on, cut it out!

116
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,440
 Homer, you know what I think I better do, maybe?

117
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:35,440
 Why? Get an excuse to go home and just skip biology.

118
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,040
 Well, you tell Mr. Bradley.

119
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,840
 Well, just tell him frankly that I've got to put the potatoes on.

120
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,600
 But Henry--

121
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,640
 Homer, you go on to class.

122
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,440
 I'm going to go into Mr. Bradley's office here.

123
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,940
 Henry, will they take potatoes for an excuse?

124
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,040
 I don't know why they wouldn't.

125
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,640
 They're perfectly legal.

126
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,240
 Well, so long.

127
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,200
 So long.

128
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,040
 Was there someone you wanted to see, Henry?

129
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,440
 Yes, Mr. Bradley.

130
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,440
 If you haven't got anything on your mind--

131
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,440
 Yes.

132
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,240
 Come here, Adam.

133
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,140
 Yes, sir.

134
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:06,940
 Mr. Bradley, I'd like to be excused from biology today.

135
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:09,140
 You were? What for?

136
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:11,440
 Well, I've got to help my mother get some vegetables ready.

137
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,940
 I see. You feel vegetables are more important than biology?

138
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:17,440
 Well...

139
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,240
 But I've also promised to get home and take care of my father.

140
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,140
 Your father's ill?

141
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:21,940
 Yes, sir.

142
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:23,740
 How serious is his illness?

143
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:25,740
 Well, he was running a temperature of 103.

144
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:26,740
 103?

145
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:27,740
 Yes, sir.

146
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:30,840
 That was about four days ago, and nobody knew what it was when I left this morning.

147
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,140
 The doctor wouldn't say it.

148
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:34,780
 My father wouldn't even let anybody near him with a thermometer.

149
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:37,100
 Well, I'm sorry to hear that about your father.

150
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,140
 Yes, sir.

151
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:42,140
 Henry, is there any reason why your mother couldn't prepare the vegetables?

152
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:45,140
 Well, no, Mr. Bradley. Not under ordinary circumstances.

153
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:47,140
 But she can today, though. She's out working.

154
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,640
 Working? Your mother's out working, Henry?

155
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:53,140
 Yes, Mr. Bradley. She feels that at a time like this, it's the least she can do.

156
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:56,140
 Oh, I didn't know about that.

157
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:59,140
 Your sister, Mary, isn't working, though, is she?

158
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:00,140
 No, sir.

159
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:01,140
 Couldn't she help at home?

160
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:04,740
 Well, the only trouble is she had to go to the hospital this afternoon.

161
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:05,740
 To the hospital?

162
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:07,540
 Yes, sir. To the general hospital.

163
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:10,740
 Well, I guess there's only one thing we can do under those circumstances.

164
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,640
 I'll write out an excuse for you.

165
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,140
 Well, thank you, Mr. Bradley.

166
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:17,340
 This all puts quite a responsibility on you, doesn't it, Henry?

167
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:20,840
 Well, I don't mind, Mr. Bradley, and I'm sure my entire family will appreciate this.

168
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:24,540
 Well, did I remember your father wasn't present at the luncheon club Monday.

169
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:25,640
 No, no, Mr. Bradley.

170
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:28,640
 Come to think of it, I don't believe he was present last week either, was he?

171
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,640
 No, sir. It was just a week ago today he began to go under.

172
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:34,640
 And how's your mother holding up?

173
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:39,340
 Well, you know, Mother. Father keeps saying I wish she wouldn't try to be two places at once.

174
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:41,640
 She'll exhaust herself. And him too.

175
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,640
 Here's your excuse, my boy.

176
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,140
 Well, thanks again, Mr. Bradley.

177
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:48,640
 And Henry, don't you worry too much about your schoolwork during this.

178
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:51,640
 No, sir, Mr. Bradley. I'll try not to.

179
00:07:51,640 --> 00:08:01,640
 (music)

180
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,640
 Can I get you anything else, Father?

181
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,640
 No, thank you. I have my book here.

182
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,640
 Is your pillow all right?

183
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,640
 Yes, thank you.

184
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,640
 Here, I'll throw one more blanket over you.

185
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,640
 Henry, I don't want any more blankets.

186
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,640
 Now, please let me read.

187
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:17,640
 Well, just in case you do want anything, I'll be right here.

188
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,640
 Now, where'd I leave my knife?

189
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:22,640
 What are you doing peeling potatoes right here next to my bed?

190
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:25,640
 I spread a newspaper on the floor father.

191
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,640
 You know what father?

192
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:34,640
 I saw somebody once would take the whole skin off a potato in one long strip.

193
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,640
 Father?

194
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,640
 Mmm.

195
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,640
 Who was it?

196
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,640
 The sailor in the news reel.

197
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,640
 He had a cat too.

198
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,640
 A cat?

199
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,640
 Oh, who has a cat?

200
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:57,360
 a cat. But say hello. Henry I'm trying to read. Oh excuse me. You know Mr. Bradley's

201
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:02,120
 a pretty nice guy isn't he? He said he missed you at the luncheon club. Did he? Yes sir.

202
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:07,800
 He said he hoped we'd all bear up under this. Bear up under one. Well you and bad and meet

203
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:14,520
 peeling. Father do you like that intern at the hospital Mary's going over to see this

204
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:19,560
 afternoon I do appreciate your helping but I would like very much to finish this

205
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:25,320
 book in peace and quiet she was I keep forgetting boy there's the telephone

206
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:28,360
 that's your mother phoning from the Red Cross tell it to stop and get some

207
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,320
 negative

208
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:35,720
 hello yes Homer can you come over to my house and work on to bargain no no

209
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:39,840
 Homer not this afternoon why not because I've got my father on my hands

210
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:43,640
 For Henry, if we don't finish out to bother him this month, we'll miss all a good sledding.

211
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,640
 Well, wait a minute, Homer, hold the line.

212
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,040
 Father...

213
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:47,540
 Well...

214
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:51,040
 Father, would you mind if Homer came over very quietly for a little while?

215
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,840
 I'll be delighted if you stay downstairs.

216
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,340
 See, thanks, Father.

217
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:57,040
 Homer, you can come over here.

218
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:57,840
 Okay.

219
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,440
 George Johnson is here with me. I'll bring him along to help.

220
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,040
 And also, Toby Smith.

221
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,240
 Oh...

222
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,640
 Well...

223
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,940
 Alright, Homer.

224
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:06,840
 And Henry.

225
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,940
 What do you think happened in biology today?

226
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:09,540
 What?

227
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:12,300
 Miss Walker didn't even show up. She got the flu.

228
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:15,180
 - He didn't have any class? - No. Goodbye.

229
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:18,100
 Well, imagine that. She whiz.

230
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:28,700
 Hello? Hello?

231
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,460
 - Hello? - Is that you, Johnson?

232
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:32,900
 Yes. This is Bradley up at the high school.

233
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:35,900
 - Hi, Bradley. - You're on my committee at the Luncheon Club, aren't you?

234
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,900
 - You're a committee. - The sick committee.

235
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:38,700
 Oh, yes!

236
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,700
 Johnson, I got some bad news this morning.

237
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:41,400
 Oh, is it?

238
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,300
 Sam Aldrich.

239
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,200
 He's laid up.

240
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,100
 Sam Aldrich is.

241
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:47,300
 And just between ourselves, Johnson, it's apparently rather serious.

242
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:47,800
 No!

243
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,900
 Oh, yes.

244
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,500
 In bed with a high temperature.

245
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,800
 And his wife's out working?

246
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,000
 His daughter's in the hospital.

247
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,200
 Well, she don't say so.

248
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,900
 Yes.

249
00:10:55,900 --> 00:11:00,300
 Evidently from what his son said, the family's been having a hard time just making ends meet.

250
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:03,200
 But, uh, badly, I just thought Sam Aldrich was pretty well sex.

251
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,300
 So did I.

252
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:08,620
 probably everything's been piling up until this is what you might call a knockout blow

253
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:09,980
 well

254
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:11,160
 and here's what i suggest

255
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:14,320
 why don't we send flowers to sam and to his daughter too

256
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,100
 good idea

257
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:18,100
 as she's at the general hospital i believe Henry said

258
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:20,980
 and would you take care of that johnson i certainly will

259
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:24,780
 uh... only i have a better suggestion if you don't mind it is instead of sending

260
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:28,020
 flowers to sam why don't we send something for the whole family say uh...

261
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,500
 basket of canned goods

262
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,860
 you don't think you might hope we don't have to say what came from doing

263
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,620
 Good idea. Take care of it, will you?

264
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:36,320
 Well, you're by Johnson.

265
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,560
 Come in.

266
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,360
 Are you busy, Mr. Bradley?

267
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,960
 You wish to see me in his rumpoon?

268
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,960
 Mr. Bradley, is there any reason why,

269
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,360
 when the Board of Education buys window shades,

270
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,360
 they can't buy good window shades?

271
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,960
 I beg your pardon?

272
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:55,360
 I'm speaking of the shades in the school cafeteria.

273
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,160
 Those that are up won't come down,

274
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,860
 and those that are down won't go up.

275
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:05,860
 Miss Rumford, please sit down a moment.

276
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:07,860
 Yes, Mr. Bradley.

277
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:10,860
 That is all you have on your mind.

278
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:14,860
 But Mr. Bradley, there are fourteen windows in the cafeteria.

279
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:18,860
 I'm afraid Miss Rumford, some of us don't know what trouble really is.

280
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:21,860
 But you have Venetian blinds, Mr. Bradley.

281
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,860
 That is not what I'm referring to.

282
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:27,860
 Miss Rumford, let me tell you about a student in this school.

283
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:32,420
 His father, we all suppose, was one of the most successful practicing lawyers in town.

284
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:35,420
 It now appears, however, that the man is in desperate straits.

285
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:36,620
 What's the matter with him?

286
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:40,980
 Alas, I heard he had a temperature of 103 that was still rising, and there was a daughter

287
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:46,180
 in the general hospital, and his mother works out, and the boy himself has to do all the

288
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:49,900
 cooking for the entire family.

289
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:53,900
 And yet some of the members of the faculty here have been jumping on the boy for not

290
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:56,340
 being able to keep his mind on his studies.

291
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,340
 Is that right?

292
00:12:57,340 --> 00:13:01,900
 While the rest of us go around complaining, because a window shade that's down won't go up.

293
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:05,340
 Hello, Bradley's office.

294
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:07,580
 Oh, this is Johnson again. I just had another idea.

295
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:08,540
 Yes, Johnson?

296
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:11,020
 I've been talking with the rest of the committee.

297
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:15,020
 Oh, why don't I pick you up, Milgo over and call on Sam Aldrich this afternoon in person?

298
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:17,500
 Good idea. He's probably all alone.

299
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,300
 Sure.

300
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,420
 Good cheer him up a little.

301
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:19,820
 Right.

302
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:20,460
 And Bradley?

303
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:21,260
 Yes, Johnson?

304
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:24,540
 Why don't I try rounding up our barbershop quartet?

305
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:34,540
 [Music]

306
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:37,540
 We'll return to the Aldrich family in just a moment.

307
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:41,540
 Fight communism by joining the Crusade for Freedom,

308
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:44,540
 the independent movement of the American people,

309
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:47,540
 which supports Radio Free Europe and Radio Free Asia.

310
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:50,540
 These two freedom networks are shattering the isolation

311
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:53,540
 which the Kremlin has imposed on its slave states.

312
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:59,640
 As a private enterprise, radio free Europe and radio free Asia can hit hard.

313
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:04,960
 Exiles speak to their own countrymen, weakening the Red's morale and authority.

314
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:10,300
 They identify informers, denounce brutality, ridicule and expose the falseness of the

315
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,840
 communist line.

316
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:16,360
 They spike the hate and lie campaign of the Soviets against the free world, and spread

317
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:19,840
 news the communist would try to suppress.

318
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:25,120
 and educational programs meet the spiritual and intellectual needs of its listeners.

 [Music]

323
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,960
 And now getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldrich.

324
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:57,960
 Because his mother is helping at the Red Cross, and Mary is visiting at the hospital,

325
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:02,960
 Henry is asked to be excused from school early in order to go home and take care of his father,

326
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,960
 who is recovering from a cold.

327
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:09,380
 explanations however have been inadvertently misleading

328
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:12,400
 the scene opens in mister all rages

329
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,200
 father would you like some toast in another cup of tea

330
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,440
 no thank you

331
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:21,000
 you sure you don't want any i do not want another cup of tea

332
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,840
 you have been very helpful henry all afternoon

333
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:29,120
 suppose now you take up your potatoes and your pans and your pairing night

334
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,880
 the these two things in that cake in this picture of lemonade

335
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,080
 go downstairs and let me have a little sleep

336
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,680
 and leave you all alone i won't mind one bit

337
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,160
 or g father i don't think mother would want to go to sleep without someone

338
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,680
 right here to take the responsibility

339
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:45,040
 i won't mention it to your mother

340
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,680
 i'll tell you what i'll do i'll find something you can thump on the floor

341
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,840
 with just in case you need me

342
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,680
 i wonder if there's anything here in this cause

343
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,360
 and then it please just forget i'm even up here

344
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:57,520
 here father which would you rather have this umbrella or this baseball bat i

345
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,920
 don't care either one

346
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,440
 go ahead tell me after all you're the one that's gonna have to do the

347
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,040
 I said either one.

348
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,440
 Well, I guess the bat would make the most noise.

349
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,440
 Alright, then, give me the bat.

350
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,440
 Oh, here, I'll give you both and you can make your own choice.

351
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,440
 (Laughter)

352
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,440
 Now I'll just take this tree down.

353
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,440
 (Loud clattering)

354
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,440
 What was that?

355
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,440
 The top of the butter dish.

356
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,440
 Oh, well, I'll get it. It's right here by your bed.

357
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,440
 Just leave it there.

358
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,440
 Yes, sir.

359
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,440
 (Loud clattering)

360
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,440
 Right now.

361
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,440
 Whoops!

362
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,440
 So, I'll come back to that one, too.

363
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:31,440
 You needn't come back for it, just leave.

364
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,440
 And if you don't gotcha gonna drop another--

365
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,440
 I got it.

366
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,440
 You don't have to worry about a thing, father.

367
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:43,440
 Henry!

368
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,440
 Henry! Henry!

369
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,440
 Henry, old rich!

370
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:53,440
 That's the fine thing.

371
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,440
 Henry!

372
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,440
 What are you calling our thoughts?

373
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,440
 I was.

374
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,440
 Please answer the telephone.

375
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,440
 Oh, yes sir.

376
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,440
 Then pick up what's left of this letter dish.

377
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,440
 Yes sir.

378
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,440
 Hello?

379
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,440
 Hello?

380
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,440
 Who is it?

381
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,440
 What number did you call please?

382
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,440
 Father, what number did you call?

383
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,440
 I didn't call any number.

384
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,440
 Well, I guess you called the wrong one.

385
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:16,440
 I didn't call any number.

386
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,360
 I didn't call it a number.

387
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,920
 Well, I guess you called it wrong one.

388
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,480
 Operator, it's our mistake.

389
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,360
 Well, isn't that strange?

390
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,960
 Listen, father, why do you think I found downstairs?

391
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:28,680
 What?

392
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,840
 Well, just as I went down, I had to see somebody running off

393
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,640
 the front porch.

394
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,280
 So I opened the door.

395
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,040
 There was a great big basket of groceries.

396
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,200
 Why did the boy leave them at the front door?

397
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,440
 Well, I don't know.

398
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,280
 It's canned goods and oranges, and there's two chickens.

399
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:42,780
 Good.

400
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:43,960
 Apparently your mother's planning

401
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:46,560
 to have a real dinner for me for a change.

402
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,760
 And right on top of this basket, there was a card.

403
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,360
 What did it say?

404
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:54,080
 Head up, chin up, chest up, grin.

405
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:57,800
 Step up, fuck up, step up, grin.

406
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:01,320
 Why would the grocery leave a message like that?

407
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:05,520
 Probably the price of chicken is going up again.

408
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,240
 Will you please pick up that broken dish?

409
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,520
 Oh, yes, Father.

410
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,720
 Ouch!

411
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:10,440
 Well, imagine that.

412
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,160
 What's the matter?

413
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:11,720
 Oh, it's all right.

414
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,200
 I just cut my finger on a piece of the dish.

415
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,200
 Let me see it. It isn't anything.

416
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,200
 If it's as deep as it looks, you'd better put something on it.

417
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,200
 Well, I get something in the bathroom. Don't worry about it, Father.

418
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:28,200
 Henry! Henry! Henry!

419
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:32,200
 Henry, where are my slippers?

420
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,200
 Hello?

421
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,200
 May I speak with Mrs. Orrich please?

422
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,200
 Mrs. Orrich isn't here.

423
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,200
 Is this Mr. Orrich?

424
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,200
 It is.

425
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,200
 Well, this is Miss Runford.

426
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,600
 The cafeteria manager up at the high school.

427
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,300
 Yes?

428
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:50,900
 Mr. Arbridge, the use of pose Mrs. Arbridge would like a part-time position in our lunch room.

429
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,900
 [laughter]

430
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:55,500
 - I beg your pardon? - It wouldn't be a great deal of course,

431
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:59,000
 but she'd get her lunch free, and after all, that would help.

432
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,200
 - Would you say that again very slowly, please?

433
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:05,800
 - Father, you see the eye alone anyplace? - Henry, I'm talking on the telephone.

434
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:09,000
 - What was that, Mr. Arbridge? - I'm sorry, but my son is just hurt.

435
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,400
 - Oh, you're some fat too bad.

436
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:15,400
 My goodness, troubles never come soon, did you, they?

437
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,400
 What was that?

438
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,400
 Why don't I call when Mrs. Aldridge comes in from work and talk to her then?

439
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,400
 That would probably be best.

440
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,400
 Yes, goodbye.

441
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,400
 Goodbye.

442
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,400
 Did you realize you're out of bed?

443
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,400
 Did you find the eye out on it?

444
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,400
 No, sir.

445
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,400
 Come into the bathroom with me.

446
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,400
 Why, just look, Father.

447
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,400
 Come with me.

448
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,400
 Who do you suppose that could be at the front door?

449
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,400
 I have no idea.

450
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,400
 Go, I'll go down.

451
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,400
 Hey, Henry.

452
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,400
 Is that you downstairs, Homer?

453
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,400
 Yes, come on down.

454
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,400
 Again, she had a huff in the shot to bother.

455
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,400
 I'm not a bargain!

456
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,400
 I am a bargain!

457
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,400
 No, wait a minute!

458
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:58,400
 Boy, Toby, you don't know a darn thing about fixing tobogans.

459
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,400
 I sure do, Homer. When you sand the bottom, you gotta hold a sander like this.

460
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,400
 Oh, wait a minute, fellas.

461
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:06,400
 Look, if we're gonna make any noise, we shouldn't stay here in the living room.

462
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,400
 But Henry, we stopped hammering on the tobogans, didn't we?

463
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,000
 Well, should we, George, only I think my father can still hear us.

464
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,400
 Why don't we go down on the basement?

465
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,300
 Because Homer, I have to be here when my father calls for help.

466
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,600
 Come on, George, why don't we finish the Santa? We're all through.

467
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,600
 Okay, Toby.

468
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:25,900
 Oh, she wins.

469
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:28,400
 I'm sorry, father!

470
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:35,700
 Now, keep it quiet, fellas.

471
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,900
 Toss the football here, Toby.

472
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,900
 Now to me Homer.

473
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:42,900
 Nice catch George, back to me.

474
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,900
 Here I am Toby.

475
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,900
 Boy, what a pass.

476
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:47,900
 Here you are Homer.

477
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,900
 Wait, Henry, I'm trying my shoes.

478
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:52,900
 Oh, she whizzed.

479
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:57,900
 I'm sorry, Father.

480
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:04,900
 Here's the rest of the string beans, Henry.

481
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:05,900
 Chief, I'm sure.

482
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,400
 Can we all throw here in the kitchen?

483
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,580
 Sure, Homer, the potatoes are peeled, the lettuce is washed,

484
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:11,000
 and the string beans are strong.

485
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 Well, we put 'em.

486
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,900
 Oh, yeah.

487
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:16,500
 I told me, would you reach up in that cupboard and get that big pot?

488
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,400
 Well, I'll get it, Hen.

489
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,400
 No, you two sure are Homer.

490
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,100
 Let's hold it!

491
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:24,100
 Oh, gee whiz.

492
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:28,800
 We're sorry, Mr. Hollerish!

493
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,600
 Father!

494
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:35,100
 Father, did you know you knocked some plaster out of the ceiling?

495
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:38,900
 What's that? Goodbye, dear, all of it!

496
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:54,500
 Hello there, Henry.

497
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,380
 She wears Mr. Bradley.

498
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:57,620
 Howdy, son.

499
00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:00,900
 How do you do, Mr. Johnson?

500
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:05,660
 You don't suppose we could step upstairs and say hello to your father, could we?

501
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:07,660
 Why? Why?

502
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:08,660
 See, you sleep.

503
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,660
 Henry!

504
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:12,660
 No, I guess he isn't.

505
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:13,660
 No, he is.

506
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:15,660
 We go right up these stairs here.

507
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:16,660
 Yes, sir. We're right up there.

508
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:18,660
 Now don't you overdo, Henry.

509
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:21,660
 You've got quite a load there these days and those shoulders of yours.

510
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:22,660
 Aye.

511
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:25,660
 Sam's place is certainly run down.

512
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:27,660
 Did you see that broken window?

513
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:30,660
 I know. And plaster all over the floor.

514
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:32,660
 And now tell you the Sam Lord boy's home.

515
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:34,660
 It's only us, Sam.

516
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:37,060
 Oh, a committee from the luncheon club.

517
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:38,500
 Whoa, a junction!

518
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,660
 Hello, Bradley, how do you happen to come over?

519
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:43,660
 Just thought we'd drop in and see how you are.

520
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:47,660
 Well, I must have stepped on a plate here on the floor.

521
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:49,660
 Didn't Henry pick that up?

522
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,660
 Oh, that's all right, Sam.

523
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:52,660
 Sleeping dogs lie, eh?

524
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:53,660
 Well, sit down, sit down.

525
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:55,660
 Oh, we can't stay but a minute, Sam.

526
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:57,660
 Hey, don't step on that piece of code.

527
00:22:57,660 --> 00:23:00,660
 Yes, thanks for the warning.

528
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:03,660
 You know, Sam, I can say it sincerely.

529
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:05,660
 You never looked so well on your life.

530
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:07,660
 - And I feel well, I feel fine.

531
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:09,660
 - Oh, I was keeping up the old spirits.

532
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:11,660
 - You're not worried, are you?

533
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:12,660
 - Who I worried?

534
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:15,660
 - You tried to round out the barbershop quartet for you.

535
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,660
 - Well, I never felt better than the barbershop quartet.

536
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:20,660
 - Sam, why didn't you let us know about all this?

537
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:23,660
 - Well, I figured it was one of those things.

538
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:25,660
 I'd better grin and bear it alone.

539
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:26,660
 - It's not like them raffy.

540
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:27,660
 The same old Sam.

541
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:30,660
 Sam, they say it never rains, but it pours.

542
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:31,660
 But remember this?

543
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,960
 That always shines afterwards.

544
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,360
 Yeah.

545
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:39,360
 Well...

546
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,360
 I suppose we'd better be going.

547
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:45,360
 Yes, Bradley. We probably tired him as it is.

548
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,760
 - You've tired me. - Goodbye, Sam.

549
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,660
 Take care of yourself.

550
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:51,760
 Well, I certainly appreciate your coming over.

551
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,360
 - And don't worry, Sam. - I never worry. Goodbye.

552
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:57,760
 There, Johnson is a man of courage.

553
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,660
 He's still a young, Bradley.

554
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:04,220
 Bigorous you can start all over say let's go back to this room for a minute

555
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:07,000
 What for no reason why I can't throw a little business as way as there

556
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,860
 Sam oh did you leave something?

557
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:15,020
 As soon as you get on your feet old man drop into my office. I'd like to have a little talk with you

558
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:17,020
 Oh certainly I'd be glad to give you any help I can

559
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:22,460
 Bradley

560
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:28,100
 Well, Mrs. Allridge you're looking well and how is Sam feeling have a nice quiet day dear

561
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:35,480
 Quiet isn't the word or you're not used to being alone Sam. How do you like my new coat? Oh you bought that coat today?

562
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:42,320
 Yes, dear. I worked so hard. I had to do something to cheer myself up. Well, Mrs. All read you it's very good looking

563
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,860
 Yes, it certainly is Alice. Where'd you get enough money to pay for it?

564
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:51,100
 I charged it but looking for I brought you Sam to make up for it. What is it some travel folders?

565
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:57,300
 I think it'd do you a world of good dear if you took a trip to South America South America South America South America

566
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:04,660
 Yes, how could I possibly afford a trip to South America?

567
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:05,660
 I go with you.

568
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:06,660
 Oh, it's not like a brat.

569
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:09,660
 No matter how things look, she's always the one to joke about it.

570
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:10,660
 Hello, Father.

571
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:12,660
 How do you do, Mr. Johnson?

572
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:13,660
 Mr. Bratter.

573
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:14,660
 How do you do, Mary?

574
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:17,660
 Father, look at the lovely flowers that were sent to me at the hospital.

575
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:18,660
 Do you?

576
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:19,660
 Yes.

577
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:23,660
 And it's the strangest thing all the cards said was to a brave little girl.

578
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:26,660
 Probably Joe Graham sent them to use a joke.

579
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:29,440
 Mary, are you home from the hospital for good?

580
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,260
 For good?

581
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:31,700
 How long were you there?

582
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,700
 About three-quarters of an hour.

583
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:36,340
 Well, isn't that fine?

584
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:39,540
 Why don't we all sit down? I confess I'm a little tired.

585
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:40,740
 Have a hard day, Alex.

586
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:43,880
 I wouldn't work this hard for anyone but the Red Cross.

587
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:46,280
 Mrs. Orrich, did you say the Red Cross?

588
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:49,320
 Yes, with a war in Korea, it's the least anyone can do.

589
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:52,420
 Yes, you've been working at the Red Cross.

590
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:54,260
 He and I certainly have.

591
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:56,060
 Yeah, yeah.

592
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:58,460
 Well, isn't that pie?

593
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:00,300
 Bradley, I think maybe we better be going.

594
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:00,800
 Yeah.

595
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:04,460
 Mother, did you order that big basket of groceries down in the kitchen?

596
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:05,360
 What basket?

597
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,900
 I'm sure the store must have sent them by mistake.

598
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:12,700
 Mary, supposing you give us that basket and let us return it to the store for you.

599
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:16,300
 Oh, would you mind Mr. Bradley? Somebody must have gotten things confused.

600
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:18,340
 Yeah, somebody must have.

601
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:19,540
 Well, goodbye Sam.

602
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:20,060
 Goodbye.

603
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:21,060
 Goodbye.

604
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:21,560
 Goodbye.

605
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:25,420
 Alice, I don't know what the make of all this.

606
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:26,620
 Make a what's happened?

607
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:29,140
 Mother, father, what do you think's just been delivered?

608
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:29,740
 What?

609
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:30,980
 A ton of coal.

610
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:34,300
 And there's another poem with it.

611
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:36,340
 I didn't order any coal.

612
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:38,340
 It's from the Centerville Luncheon Club.

613
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:40,900
 Sam, will you please tell me what's going on here?

614
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:44,980
 Will someone please tell me why those two men acted as though I'm dying?

615
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:45,740
 That's what I say.

616
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:49,220
 This afternoon when I went into Mr. Bradley's office, you didn't even know you'd been sick.

617
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:52,460
 Henry, when you went in there, what did you say to Mr. Bradley?

618
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:54,500
 Nothing. I just told him I had appealed to potatoes.

619
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:57,800
 Mother, Ms. Rumford just arrived to help us get dinner.

620
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,600
 Get dinner? Our dinner?

621
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,800
 Yes, she said father told her on the phone that Henry was hurt.

622
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:05,500
 Sam, what did you say to Ms. Rumford?

623
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:10,100
 Call us before this goes any further. Get me some aspirin and an ice bag.

624
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:23,800
 In these days of world crisis, when our nation and its citizen needs spiritual strength and guidance,

625
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:27,800
 All of us should think about what religion means to us and to our country.

626
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:30,800
 More than anything else, it is religious faith

627
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:34,800
 that makes our way of life possible and worthwhile.

628
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:40,800
 During this month of November, people of many faiths are joining in a great religion in American life campaign.

629
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:46,800
 Wherever you are, whatever your faith may be, you're asked to join in this campaign.

630
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:50,800
 Take your problems to church this week. Millions lead them there.

631
00:27:50,800 --> 00:28:06,880
 Henry, you peeled the potatoes very well. Thank you, Mother. Now, who could that be?

632
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:12,320
 Gagrocy father. You're tired, aren't you, Sam? That is an understatement. It's been

633
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:17,280
 a hard day, Alice. All I want now is a little quiet. Well, you can go to bed right after

634
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:22,160
