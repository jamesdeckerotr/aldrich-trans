00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:22,440
 Henry, Henry Aldrich, coming mother.

00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:27,560
 The Aldrich family written by Clifford Goldsmith and starring Ezra Stone.

00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:30,640
 Entertainment for All the Family brought to you by Postam,

00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,640

 [MUSIC PLAYING]

7
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:56,080
 Friends, before we join the Aldrich family, listen.

8
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:59,260
 Does that mean anything to you?

9
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:03,200
 Doesn't that sound just like your bedroom clock when it's dark and late at night and

10
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,340
 you're lying there unable to sleep?

11
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:09,740
 Well if it does, if you know how the seconds drag when you're kept awake, just think of

12
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:10,740
 this.

13
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,940
 Coffee may be robbing you of sleep.

14
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:15,540
 Perhaps you'd sleep better if you drank post them instead.

15
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:20,660
 Yes, even though many folks can drink coffee and sleep, many others, perhaps you among them,

16
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:21,660
 cannot.

17
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:23,140
 So do as millions have done.

18
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:28,120
 If you think coffee keeps you awake, switch to post them because it's stimulant free.

19
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:32,840
 Because post them unlike coffee contains nothing that could cause sleeplessness.

20
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:36,420
 Just drink fragrant flavorful post them instead of coffee.

21
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:41,500
 And after a fair trial of say two short weeks, see if you aren't enjoying good sound sleep

22
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,100
 again and lots of it.

23
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:46,300
 See if you don't say thank goodness for post them.

 Huck Finn, Tom Sawyer, Penrod Scofield.

26
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:13,900
 They're more than boys in books because the things they say and do are things real boys say and do.

27
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:19,100
 And now Henry Aldrich joins the ranks of these typical American youngsters.

28
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:22,700
 A boy from your town, perhaps from your own home.

29
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,300
 Now it is evening.

30
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:28,300
 We find Henry in the Aldrich living room with his father and mother.

31
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:31,100
 Father, could I bother you for just a second?

32
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:31,900
 What about?

33
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:34,300
 All I want to ask is to do something for me.

34
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:34,900
 What is it?

35
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:37,100
 Well first, are you sure you're comfortable?

36
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:37,900
 Comfortable?

37
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,700
 Yes, sir. Can I get you anything first?

38
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,500
 You may. You may get me my pipe.

39
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,100
 Yes, Father. I'd be very glad to.

40
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:47,600
 to wear it. It's apparently upstairs. Tell me what it is you want. Oh no father. I'd rather

41
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,900
 you have everything you want before I bring up what I'm going to.

42
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:54,680
 Sam, did the Johnson say definitely they're coming over? They did Alice. And I suppose

43
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,980
 of course they'll want to play bridge. They certainly will. Sometimes I wonder whether

44
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:01,820
 the Johnson's ever do anything but play bridge. Well you can't blame them much. There's just

45
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:05,560
 the two of them. Sometimes I wonder if they realize what they've missed by not having any

46
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:10,540
 children. Here's your pipe father and your tobacco. Oh thank you. And all I want to ask

47
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:15,940
 you for is only 25 cents. Henry. Yes, mother. I thought I said you were not to have that

48
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:21,060
 25 cents. Not even from father? Not even from anyone, dear. Alice, are there any matches

49
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:25,620
 out in the kitchen? Yes, son. But, mother, this is the first time I've ever taken Loretta

50
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:30,140
 out and it's going to be a swell dance. You don't want me to be embarrassed, do you? I

51
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:35,020
 thought you had the ticket. I have. But how am I going to buy her a hot dog afterwards?

52
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:38,980
 I'm sorry, but I don't know. Well, look, mother, would you be willing to tell me why

53
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:40,740
 Why you won't advance it?

54
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:42,740
 Henry, I have nothing more to say.

55
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:44,140
 Nothing, whatever.

56
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:47,260
 You won't even give me a hand as to why you won't.

57
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:51,860
 Mother, is it because you don't believe in letting me have money in advance,

58
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:54,460
 or because you don't think the hot dog would be good for me?

59
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:57,300
 [LAUGHTER]

60
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,660
 Mother.

61
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:00,020
 It happens to be both.

62
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:02,580
 All right, I've got an answer for both.

63
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:05,740
 Henry, dear, if you don't care enough to do anything for me,

64
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:08,380
 I certainly can't be expected to do anything for you.

65
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:10,780
 Mother, I don't even know what you're talking about.

66
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:12,020
 I'm not surprised.

67
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:15,220
 Well, is it something you asked me to do and I forgot

68
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:18,080
 or something I shouldn't have done and you found out I did?

69
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,220
 Never mind.

70
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:26,160
 Because it isn't as though I were asking you for 50 cents or 35 cents or even 30.

71
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,300
 All I'm asking is enough to buy a hot dog for each of us

72
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,660
 and a root beer for Loretta.

73
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:37,180
 I'd rather eat mine dry than ask you for one cent more.

74
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:39,260
 How are you going to get Loretta to the dance?

75
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:41,340
 I think there'll be room in Jimmy's car, mother.

76
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:44,020
 All I have to do is keep trying until his phone answers.

77
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:46,700
 Well, don't you think it's time you made some death-knit arrangements?

78
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,780
 You don't suppose father would...

79
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:49,860
 You don't suppose...

80
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,660
 You don't suppose I'd what?

81
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,540
 Nothing, father.

82
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:54,940
 Mother, will you tell me this?

83
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:57,820
 Is it because I forgot to hang up my pajamas?

84
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:00,740
 Henry, if you're going to take Loretta to the dance,

85
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:04,060
 the thing for you to do is call Jimmy and see whether he has room for you.

86
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:06,860
 Yes, mother. I'm going to write out to the phone now.

87
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:10,460
 I'm only sorry I didn't do whatever it is you want me to do for you.

88
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:12,160
 Alice what was it he didn't do?

89
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,560
 Never mind Sam it's completely unimportant.

90
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,060
 Is the only deck of cards we have?

91
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:18,960
 No dear there's another deck right here on the table.

92
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,460
 I asked him to stink there.

93
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:25,660
 It was the last thing I asked him to do before he let the house and he came right back from the store without it.

94
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:26,360
 But that was?

95
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,860
 Never mind.

96
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:28,760
 But what was it?

97
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,260
 The ginger ale.

98
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:30,860
 What a knife.

99
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:35,060
 Yes Sam I asked him to stink there to get six bottles of ginger ale.

100
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:37,060
 And of course that was the one thing he didn't bring.

101
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:39,160
 Well now Alice don't let it upset you like that.

102
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,960
 You know that Johnson's once they start playing bridge they'll forget their thirsting.

103
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,660
 Sam, it isn't just the ginger ale.

104
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:49,060
 It's the fact that Henry can be so wrapped up in himself that he never even thinks of anything else.

105
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:50,660
 Well, I'll give him a little talking to.

106
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:52,560
 Now Sam, you're not even to mention it.

107
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,060
 Let him find out for himself how thoughtless he's been.

108
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,060
 Where's the scorepad?

109
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:58,060
 Oh, right there in that stand draw.

110
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:02,160
 As a matter of fact, I'd even plan to ask you to drive him and Loretta to the dance tonight.

111
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,760
 Well, it's a good thing you didn't.

112
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,200
 I'm settled here for the evening.

113
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,400
 I'm simply going to make this a lesson for him.

114
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,600
 Mother, why do you suppose Jimmy Bartlett does an answer?

115
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,440
 I'm afraid, dear. That's your problem.

116
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,080
 Yes, Mother. I'll find somebody that'll take us.

117
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:19,040
 And, Mother, before I forget it, when I came home, the icebox was full.

118
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:19,960
 I beg your pardon.

119
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,480
 So I left it outside the back door in the snowbank.

120
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,680
 You left what out there?

121
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,040
 Don't you remember? You're Ginger Ale.

122
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,560
 The Ginger Ale?

123
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,080
 You got the Ginger Ale?

124
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,040
 Yeah, sure, didn't you want it?

125
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,480
 Well, Henry, that's fine.

126
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:36,480
 I wonder whether Homer Brown would have room for us in his car.

127
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:40,780
 Henry, Sam, do you have 25 cents in change?

128
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:43,980
 25 cents? I have three times.

129
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,480
 Well, dear, give them to Henry.

130
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,280
 To I, mother? 30 cents?

131
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,480
 Henry, Henry, if you and Loretta are going to dance all evening,

132
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,480
 the least you'll want afterwards is something to eat.

133
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,480
 But, mother, wouldn't you like to tell me first what it is I did

134
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,280
 that you didn't want to give it to me for?

135
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,980
 Henry, as I said before, let's forget the whole thing.

136
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:04,380
 Sam, is there any reason why you couldn't drive Henry to the dance?

137
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:05,680
 - What, sir? - Drive me?

138
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,180
 - Yes. - Drive Henry?

139
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:08,780
 Yes, dear, it won't take you 20 minutes.

140
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:10,280
 But, Alice, the Johnson's are coming.

141
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:14,680
 My goodness, all you have to do is drive Henry over and pick up Loretta and drop them at the country club.

142
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,580
 But, Alice, don't you realize the roads are banked with snow?

143
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,680
 The plows have opened everything up, Father.

144
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,780
 Pretty nearly.

145
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,480
 Of course they have.

146
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,880
 Of course they have.

147
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,580
 Now, Sam--

148
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:27,880
 - Henry, get your things on. - Yes, Father.

149
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:31,560
 Well, gee, was boy, I wanted to take Loretta in our car all the time.

150
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,280
 It's twice as good as George Bigelow.

151
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,080
 Now, they suppose that Johnson's get here before I get back.

152
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,120
 What harm will it do if the bridge game has to wait five minutes?

153
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,200
 As a matter of fact, if they had a boy of their own, they'd understand.

154
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,040
 Where are my gloves?

155
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,000
 They're right here on the radiator, Father.

156
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,880
 No, I'll answer the phone. You two get started.

157
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,160
 Goodbye, Mother.

158
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,960
 And thanks very much.

159
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,080
 Come on, Henry. Don't slip on the port.

160
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,400
 Goodbye. Have a good time, and thank you for getting the ginger ale.

161
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,400
 Hello?

162
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,400
 Hello?

163
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,400
 Is this L303?

164
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,400
 Yes?

165
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,400
 Who is this?

166
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,400
 This is Mrs. Aldridge.

167
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,400
 Oh, hello Mrs. Aldridge.

168
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,400
 Hello, who is this?

169
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,400
 Hi, this is Loretta.

170
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,400
 Can I speak with Henry?

171
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,400
 Henry?

172
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,400
 Oh, will you wait just a minute, please?

173
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:19,400
 Loretta, I just looked out the window there.

174
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,400
 Henry and his father just this minute pulled away.

175
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,400
 Oh, he's on his way over to get me?

176
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,400
 Well, maybe I should have called earlier.

177
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,400
 What's up?

178
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,400
 I'm way out here.

179
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,400
 Where?

180
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,400
 Oh, that's all right.

181
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,400
 My folks will tell him when he gets there.

182
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,400
 Well, there, where are you?

183
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,400
 I'm at my ads.

184
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:36,400
 It's only six miles out in the middle town road, though.

00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,400
 Six miles?

00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,400
 Yes.

00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,400
 Then can we have chains?

188
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,400
 I don't think he does.

189
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,400
 Are the roads quite bad?

190
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,400
 Oh, no.

191
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,400
 They're not bad.

192
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,400

 Yes, Agnes.

197
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,400
 I was just wondering where the young daughter for the dance, yet.

 But Loretta, aren't you going with George?

00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,400
 Oh, no, not tonight, I'm not.

 Well, my goodness.

00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,400
 Oh, I don't have any crush on Henry.

205
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,400
 I just thought it was time I went out with somebody else.

206
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,400
 Why?

207
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:23,400
 Well, I just decided I would put Georgie in his place for a change.

210
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,400
 Have I ever seen it?

211
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,400
 No.

212
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:31,400
 Oh, I've got to hang up Agnes or Henry, Megal right by.

213
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:42,400
 Father, is this the country club?

214
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,400
 I don't know. Open the window so I can see.

 No, I guess this isn't it yet.

216
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,800
 Yes. We made pretty good time, Mr. Roebidge.

217
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,000
 Even if you have only been able to go 10 miles an hour.

218
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,400
 Yes. Henry, is that a car out ahead of us?

219
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,800
 No, how could it be?

220

 Yes! Yes, Gee, wait!

 It's lucky you skithered or we would have gone right by it.

229
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:17,740
 You mean we're here?

230
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:18,240
 Sure.

00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,600
 Well, I certainly want to thank you, Mr. Olrich.

 I never had such an exciting ride.

 And I hope, Father, you won't be too late getting back to the house.

234
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:27,480
 That's all right. Just get out of the car.

00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,480
 Yes, sir.

236
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,380
 Don't slip, Loretta.

237
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,180
 Henry, just look.

00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:33,020
 What's the matter?

00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:34,820
 I guess you look at everybody going in.

240
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:35,820
 What's the matter with them?

241
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,420
 Oh, the girls are wearing long dresses.

242
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:39,520
 Henry and you told me it was informal.

243
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,420
 It is informal.

244
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:41,760
 But it couldn't be, Henry.

245
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,920
 It just couldn't be if they were wearing long dresses.

246
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:44,920
 Are you out yet?

247
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,520
 Mr. Aldrich, I can't get out.

248
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,020
 Why not?

249
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,020
 I'm not dressed!

250
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:48,820
 What's that?

251
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:55,420
 Well, look Loretta, why don't we just stick our heads inside and see whether there aren't some others in formal?

252
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:57,520
 Henry, I'd die if I went in there.

253
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,720
 George Bigelow, everyone is going to be in there.

254
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,020
 I'd simply die.

255
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:03,920
 Why would you die? Go ahead and dance. Have a good time.

256
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:08,320
 But Mr. Aldrich, Henry told me he told me distinctly I wouldn't have to dress.

257
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,920
 But Loretta, Homer Brown told me distinctly it was informal.

258
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,420
 He said, "Don't let your girl dress shall only be conspicuous."

 Well, that's what I don't know.

262

 Look, Loretta, couldn't we...

263
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,920
 Couldn't we sort of...

264
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:25,920
 Sort of what?

265
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,920
 Henry, I have guests back at the house that are waiting to play bridge.

266
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,420
 What are you going to do?

267
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:34,620
 Well, Mr. O, Richard, isn't as though you'd have to drive me all the way back to my aunt.

268
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:36,220
 Why, even you closed about my own?

269
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:37,920
 That's hardly three miles from here.

270
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,120
 Loretta, why don't you just walk in with your head up

271
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,520
 and show the whole town you don't care what they think.

272
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,820
 But I do care, Mr. Aldrich.

273
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,920
 Alright, why don't you and Henry go to a movie?

274
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,220
 But father, look, I've got the tickets for the dance.

275
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:53,420
 Henry, the Johnsons can't even play one hand of bridge until I get better.

276
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:55,920
 It's been an hour and ten minutes since I left the house.

277
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,520
 But couldn't they be playing some other game, Mr. Aldrich?

278
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,620
 Sir, Johnsons, don't play any other game.

279
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:03,720
 Well, look, father, could you step out of the car for a second?

280
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,920
 Well, I speak to you confidentially.

281
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,120
 Loretta, would you mind closing the door?

282
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,020
 You aren't going to leave me here, are you?

283
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,300
 Hello, Retta, close the door.

284
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,620
 Yes, Mr. Aldrich.

285
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:15,740
 Now, then, Henry, as long as we're alone, may I say one thing?

286
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:19,380
 Father, all I want to ask is to loan me enough money to hire a tax.

287
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:19,880
 Why?

288
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,620
 To take her home while she changes.

289
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:23,460
 Henry, I don't even have my wallet with me.

290
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:24,660
 Don't you have any change at all?

291
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,460
 I do not.

292
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:28,340
 Father, this is the first time I've ever taken her out.

293
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:30,260
 She's really George Biglow's girl.

294
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:33,300
 You don't want me to give her the wrong impression of our family, do you?

295
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,060
 Henry, if you'd listened to Homer more carefully,

296
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,380
 you wouldn't be in this predicament.

297
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,900
 But, Father, I'm sure he said it was to be informal.

298
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:42,740
 He couldn't have, son. I just saw Homer go into the clubhouse one minute ago with his own girl.

299
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:43,780
 Was she in a long dress?

300
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:44,700
 Of course she was.

301
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:47,380
 She was. I don't know what made me think he did say it.

302
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:51,900
 Because, son, you don't pay attention. You're like your mother. You separate jumping conclusions.

303
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:55,220
 But, father, couldn't you make an exception just this once?

304
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:58,220
 If I promise to listen very carefully in the future...

305
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:00,180
 Henry, I cannot. This is your fault.

306
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,380
 Hey, Henry.

307
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:04,380
 Who's that?

308
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:08,420
 It's Homer Brown. I just want to tell you I'm sorry I gave you that form of steer.

309
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,340
 I thought it was gonna be informal.

310
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:13,800
 Homer, did you tell Henry it was going to be informal?

311
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,140
 Yeah, and boy, I bet his girl hates me.

312
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:18,520
 She hates you. She whiz, Homer.

313
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,760
 Henry just forget the whole thing.

314
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,120
 I'm only telling him how I feel, father.

315
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,420
 Get in the car, hurry up.

316
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:25,220
 Where are we going?

317
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:27,620

 You mean Mr. Aldrich is finally back?

 No. Whoever it is is getting out and going in next door.

 Well, I suppose you have to expect these things when you have children.

 Well, I'm almost positive Sam will be driving in any minute.

 Is that the front door?

334
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,120
 It's the telepone he's probably calling to say he'll be right here.

 I have no idea we've been waiting here for him all evening.

00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,120
 It was formal and Loretta wasn't.

345
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,120
 What's that?

346
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:32,120
 She had to make a change, mother, in the road to Radder Icy.

347
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:35,120
 But when he got us back here to the dance, he started right for home.

348
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,120
 How long ago?

349
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,120
 A minute ago.

350
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,120
 An hour ago.

351
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,120
 Well, maybe it was a half an hour ago.

352
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:43,120
 Well, even so dear, he should certainly be here by now.

353
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,120
 Mother, I wouldn't be worried.

354
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:47,120
 The front wheel doesn't interfere with his driving very much.

355
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,120
 The front wheel?

356
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,120
 The right one.

357
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:53,120
 And the reason I called Mother when Father left here,

358
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,120
 home of Brown said he'd take the red at me home.

359
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,620
 Well, I'm glad to hear that and be sure to tell Homer to drive carefully.

360
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:01,620
 What mother, the trouble is, since then I've had a fight with Homer.

361
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:02,620
 You have?

362
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:05,120
 And the letters had a fight with Homer's girl.

363
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,120
 Well, Henry, was that necessary?

364
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:12,620
 It was really on account of father-mother, so don't you think he'd be willing to come and get us when the dance is over?

365
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:15,120
 Henry, your fat father can't possibly go out again.

366
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,620
 Wouldn't the chances enjoy coming over with him?

367
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:21,120
 You just ask around and find someone there at the dance that can take you home.

368
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,120
 But suppose I can't.

369
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:25,120
 Henry, the thing for us to worry about right now is your father.

370
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:25,620
 Oh.

371
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:28,620
 Please go back and ask some of the boys whether they can't help you.

372
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:29,220
 Yes, Mother.

373
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,620
 And if we don't hear from you again, we'll know you found someone.

374
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:32,420
 Yes, Mother.

375
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:33,120
 I'll try.

376
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:33,620
 Goodbye.

377
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:34,620
 Goodbye.

378
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:35,620
 Where?

379
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:37,120
 John is worried.

380
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,120
 I'm sorry to say that wasn't Sam.

381
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:39,620
 No.

382
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:41,620
 Well, you aren't worried, are you, my dear?

383
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:42,620
 Oh, no.

384
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:46,620
 Mr. Johnson, do you have change on your car?

385
00:15:46,620 --> 00:16:02,120
 [Music]

386
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:05,920
 Well, for once it isn't Henry who's missing but his father.

387
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:10,820
 And since he's so badly needed at the bridge table, we can only hope that he'll turn up soon.

388
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:13,820
 Meanwhile, let me ask you something about your dining table.

389
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:18,020
 Do you think that Postam should have a place on it only if coffee keeps you awake?

390
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:20,820
 Well, if you do, I can only say you're missing something.

391
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:24,520
 You're missing a meal-time drink that, for downright enjoyment alone,

392
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:27,620
 is one of the grandest things you and your family ever tasted.

393
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:30,120
 You'll say so yourself once you try Postam.

394
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:34,520
 For a good hot cup of Postam gives you a fragrance and flavor that have made it

395
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:38,320
 the favorite meal-time drink in millions of American homes.

396
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,420
 And mind you, it doesn't taste like coffee or like tea.

397
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:43,620
 Postam's flavor is distinctive.

398
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:46,900
 and it's every bit as delicious as it is different economical.

399
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:50,720
 Still selling at its usual low cost of less than one half cent a cup,

400
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,960
 Postum is one drink your whole family can enjoy,

401
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,740
 and at the same time ease the household budget.

402
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:58,980
 So for enjoyment and economy,

403
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:02,780
 serve steaming delicious Postum to grown-ups and children alike,

404
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:07,680
 and find out why no drink is quite so good as Postum for all the family.

405
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:16,440
 [Music]

406
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:19,280
 But getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldrich,

407
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,980
 Mrs. Aldrich worried and embarrassed over the

408
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:25,680
 Tardy return of her husband who has driven Henry to the country club dance

409
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:28,380
 continues to wait without any news from him.

410
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:32,080
 Meanwhile, Henry is having his own troubles.

411
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,680
 As the scene opens we find him dancing with his girl.

412
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:40,240
 Oh, you're a wonderful dancer, Henry.

413
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,440
 I am.

414
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,080
 Why do you keep looking over your shoulder all the time?

415
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:44,640
 No reason.

416
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,520
 I just want to see who's here.

417
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,560
 What's the matter, Henry?

418
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,720
 The matter?

419
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,320
 What do you mean?

420
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,960
 You've obviously said 10 words during this old dad.

421
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,240
 Well, the fact is I'm worried.

422
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,080
 What about?

423
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,400
 Do you suppose if we phoned your father, he'd come after us?

424
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,760
 Hey, you can hold tonight.

425
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:03,160
 Oh, well, then that's out.

426
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,960
 Can't you, all father, come after us?

427
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:09,220
 Oh yes, he'd be glad to. I've just been asking a couple of fellas in case.

428
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:13,600
 You know, my father wanted to play a little bridge. He was helping too.

429
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,260
 Oh. You know, I like your father, Henry.

430
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:17,860
 You do?

431
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:25,260
 Uh-huh. When he first looks at you think, "My goodness, he's mad at me," but then it turns out he's just apparently thinking of something else.

432
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:27,060
 All in all, he's pretty good.

433
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:29,360
 Doesn't he ever really get mad?

434
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,460
 Well, don't misunderstand me. He can lose his temper.

435
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:43,060
 You know, if he's planning to use his tools and he doesn't know I put them away carefully someplace else where he doesn't happen to know where it is, and boy, then does he tear around?

436
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:43,560
 Really?

437
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:46,560
 For the whole next hour you want to keep out of his way.

438
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,560
 Really?

439
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:51,060
 Sure, but he never gets what you could really call "man".

440
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:54,560
 I sort of wish I could find someone to take us home.

441
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:58,760
 Henry, I have an idea. Why couldn't George Bigelow drive us home?

442
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,560
 George Bigelow?

443
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,060
 Yeah.

444
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:02,560
 George Bigelow? Why should we ask him?

445
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:05,960
 Why not? He's here all alone, Henry, and he's got his car.

446
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:08,760
 Sure. I noticed he was here all alone.

447
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,560
 I noticed. Now, Henry, don't be silly.

448
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:14,560
 There he is right over there. George! Oh, George!

449
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:17,760
 Listen, Loretta, if you call him, he'll only want to dance with you again.

450
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,560
 Oh, he hasn't dashed with me so much.

451
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,760
 She was, he's cut in on almost every dance.

452
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,260
 Well, I didn't ask him to, Henry.

453
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:24,760
 Hey, Loretta! Yes, George!

454
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,960
 Come on out of the voice. I want to show you something.

455
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,360
 George, you wouldn't mind driving us home, would you?

456
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,960
 No, Loretta. It won't be necessary.

457
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,960
 No, I wouldn't mind. I wouldn't mind at all.

458
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,760
 I said it wouldn't be necessary.

459
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:37,960
 And anyway, Loretta's staying way out of the ranch tonight.

460
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:38,860
 What of it?

461
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:41,660
 All I have to do is drop you first and then I'll take Loretta home.

462
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:42,460
 What's that?

463
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:46,660
 Listen, I brought Loretta here and I'm going to take her home.

464
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:47,360
 Of course, Charm.

465
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,360
 That's going to help you.

466
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,660
 No, you're not. I'm going to take her home myself.

467
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:51,760
 Now, boys, wait.

468
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,860
 Now listen, old Rhett.

469
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:54,460
 Now listen yourself.

 [Music]

471
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:03,460
 Sam, is that you?

472
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:04,460
 It is.

473
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:06,460
 Oh my goodness, Sam, where have you been?

474
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:08,460
 Where have I been? Where haven't I been?

475
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:09,460
 Well dear, are you alright?

476
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:10,460
 Of course I am, why shouldn't I be?

477
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,460
 Well, what have you been doing all this time?

478
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:15,460
 I'll tell you all about it later. Let's go in and start playing bridge. I'll just wash my hands.

479
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:17,460
 Start playing bridge. Where's Mr. Johnson?

480
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:19,460
 What do you mean, where is he?

481
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:20,460
 Sam, he drove out to get you.

482
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:21,460
 What did you do that for?

483
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:25,460
 that for because mrs. Johnson and I were worried about you well now Alice why did

484
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:29,980
 you do a thing like that anything happened to Frank no dear of course nothing

485
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:33,820
 has Sam you must have seen him he took the road right out to the country club

486
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:37,460
 well I took the shortcut over Kendall Hill that's what I had the trouble what

487
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:42,340
 trouble I couldn't get over it you mean it you mean it's that slippery out it is

488
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:45,060
 and you don't think you ought to do anything about it do anything what could

489
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:48,740
 I do well Sam I think if he went out for you the least you can do is go out for

490
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:53,300
 him. Alice you should never have sent him. But I thought something happened to you.

491
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:57,080
 You were simply jumping a conclusion. You weren't able to get over Kendall Hill

492
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:02,220
 were you? No but all I did was slide down it backwards. Well that's all the more

493
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:05,620
 reason you ought to go out and get him. Alice. To tell you the truth Mr. Olich I

494
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:10,660
 am worried. Why did I put my coat? Right here on the banister and say I'm

495
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:13,580
 drive carefully because I'm going to worry about you every minute you're gone.

496
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:16,780
 Well as far as I'm concerned I just as soon put the car up tonight and not get

497
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:21,540
 out all winter or just a minute hello hello is this you father it is

498
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:25,180
 well this is Henry father you'll have to come out here and get me when the dance

499
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:29,380
 is over what's that I'm sorry father but it's an emergency my whole reputation

500
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:33,660
 of that faith what about I'm just not gonna let him get away with it that's

501
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:39,580
 all right I'll explain everything when I see you goodbye but Henry Henry Henry

502
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:52,580
 (music)

503
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:54,580
 Goodnight, Joe! Goodnight, Ruth!

 So long!

505
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:58,580
 What are you waiting for, Henry? Aren't you going home?

506
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:00,580
 Sure, Homer. I'm waiting for Loretta.

507
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:03,580
 Where is she? She's upstairs in the powder room, getting her things on.

508
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:08,580
 Oh. That's funny, because if I remember correctly, I heard George Bigelow say something about

509
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:10,140
 something about taking Loretta home.

510
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:11,180
 - You're crazy, Homer.

511
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:13,700
 There you are jumping at conclusions again.

512
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,860
 Loretta's up there mending a hem on her skirt.

513
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:18,580
 - Well, George was talking about it, Henry.

514
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:20,660
 - Incidentally, I wonder where Agnes is.

515
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:22,180
 - I hope she's ditched you.

516
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,140
 - Well, gee,

517
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:25,100
 - Dining everybody else has gone home.

518
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,420
 - Have I kept you waiting, Homer?

519
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:27,260
 - Yes.

520
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:28,220
 So long, Henry.

521
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:30,340
 You can still come home with us if you want to.

522
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:31,260
 - That's all right, Homer.

523
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:33,300
 My father will be here in a minute.

524
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,820
 Agnes, did you happen to notice

525
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,540
 whether Loretta is almost ready?

526
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:37,460
 - Loretta?

527
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:38,420
 I don't know, Henry.

528
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:39,660
 I didn't see her upstairs.

529
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:40,460
 You didn't?

530
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:41,860
 Well, she's up there, all right, Agnes.

531
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,140
 She's mending her hem.

532
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:45,660
 Remember what I heard George say, Henry.

533
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:46,820
 You're crazy.

534
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:47,820
 So on, then.

535
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:48,900
 Good night.

536
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:49,740
 Good night.

537
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:56,180
 Young man, would you mind stepping over to one side

538
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:58,460
 while I sweep up here?

539
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,860
 Oh, excuse me.

540
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:01,980
 Do you all have a nice dance tonight?

541
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,580
 Well, pretty good.

542
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:05,340
 Everybody seems to.

543
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:07,020
 Why don't you go home?

544
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:11,180
 Well, I'm going to just as soon as my father gets here.

545
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:13,540
 Would you mind not standing in front of this piano?

546
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:14,820
 I want to close it up.

547
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:16,300
 Oh, excuse me.

548
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:20,300
 Oh my, look at those ashes.

549
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:22,660
 Have you seen anyone up in the powder room?

550
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:23,940
 Oh, your father?

551
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,460
 No, my girl.

552
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:27,060
 Loretta Taylor, do you know her?

553
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:31,100
 I don't know, but she ain't up there.

554
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,020
 Are you sure?

555
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:34,300
 I certainly didn't see anybody.

556
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:37,460
 and I just came down from there 10 seconds ago.

557
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:38,820
 You didn't see anyone at all?

558
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,220
 No, sir.

559
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:41,060
 Oh.

560
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:43,320
 (squeaking)

561
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:48,740
 Now, young man, if you'll stand over to the other side,

562
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:51,780
 unless you want to get your feet wet, I'll stop mopin'.

563
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:53,340
 Sure.

564
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:56,220
 There isn't more than one pot of room up there, is there?

565
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:57,620
 There never has been.

566
00:23:57,620 --> 00:24:03,020
 Say, I don't suppose I should ask yet,

567
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:06,260
 But I ain't gonna be long cleaning up here.

568
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:09,380
 You couldn't give me a lift home, could you?

569
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:11,740
 - Well, as a matter of fact,

570
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:14,180
 I don't think I'll wait any longer myself.

571
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:15,540
 - Oh.

572
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:17,300
 - Your girl did she?

573
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:19,060
 - Oh no, no.

574
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:22,100
 I guess she didn't wanna bother my father.

575
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:24,300
 So she just went home.

576
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:27,140
 Incidentally, in case my father comes here after I've left,

577
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:28,740
 will you tell him I'm walking home?

578
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:30,300
 - Sure.

579
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,060
 I'd phone him only.

580
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:33,620
 She was, I spent all my nickels

581
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:35,460
 phoning home as it is.

582
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:38,040
 (lively music)

583
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:47,540
 - Now then Mr. Johnson, I guess you're waiting for me.

584
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:49,280
 - Yes sir, it's your turn.

585
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,080
 - And on its sea.

586
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:53,480
 - No, I can't do it that way.

587
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,480
 - You stuck?

588
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,720
 - No, I'll figure this out.

589
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,320
 You certainly got me in a jam here.

590
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,280
 - Well, I was only following your lead.

591
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:03,280
 Yes. Well, let me try it this way.

592
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:07,280
 I'll put my car in reverse and you see if you can push me.

593
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,280
 I don't think that will work.

594
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,280
 Excuse me, Mr. But could you give me a lift?

595
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,280
 What's that? She was father, is that you?

596
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,280
 Henry, where did you come from?

597
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:18,280
 I'm walking home, so you won't have to go all the way out to the clubhouse and get me.

598
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,280
 Well, that's very thoughtful of you.

599
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,280
 Are both of your cars stuck here?

600
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:24,280
 Henry, stand back. We're going to try it once more.

601
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:29,280
 Easy, easy, easy. That isn't going to do it.

602
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,880
 No, I guess it isn't.

603
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,680
 Father, wait a second. Here comes a car.

604
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,480
 Wait, I'll flag.

605
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:38,280
 Let me. Hey! Hey, can you give us a hand?

606
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,480
 What is it you want?

607
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,680
 Is that you, Homer?

608
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,780
 Of course it is.

609
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:44,880
 Well, can you help pull either one of these cars out of here?

610
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:45,380
 How?

611
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:47,080
 There's nothing to it. All you have to do is...

612
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,780
 Now, wait a minute, Henry. Let me tell him.

613
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:51,980
 Just back up behind Mr. Johnson's car real slowly.

614
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:54,080
 Is there room for me to get in there?

615
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,080
 Is there?

616
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,480
 Henry is there?

617
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,080
 What, Homer?

618
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:01,880
 Hey Homer, what'd you do that for?

619
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,480
 I thought I had room.

620
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:06,280
 That's it, jumping it some more conclusion.

621
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:17,680
 Sam, do you want me to turn out the light?

622
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,180
 I'll turn it out, you in bed?

623
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:20,180
 Yes.

624
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:21,280
 Am I tired?

625
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,680
 Well, I should think you'd be dead.

626
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,480
 What?

627
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,280
 The Johnson say when they went home.

628
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,580
 Not a thing, they simply put on their coats and left.

629
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:29,380
 without even looking at a bridge deck?

630
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:32,380
 You know, Sam, it's really a pity that Johnson's have no family.

631
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:36,060
 Then they'd understand how easy and natural it is to make sacrifices for them.

632
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:37,900
 Yes, I suppose you're right.

633
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:40,180
 Did Henry say anything to you about Loretta?

634
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:41,500
 He didn't mention it to me.

635
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:44,860
 Well, I'm afraid Sam, he was terribly hurt this evening.

636
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:45,940
 Father?

637
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:47,380
 Yes, Henry?

638
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:51,060
 Could I just thank you once more for all you've done for me tonight?

639
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:52,580
 You're very welcome, son.

640
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:53,740
 Now, please go to bed.

641
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:54,900
 Yes, Father.

642
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:57,860
 Wasn't it lucky that wrecking car got us out so quick?

643
00:26:57,860 --> 00:27:00,820
 Yes, dear. Now, please go to bed your father's time.

644
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:02,940
 Yes, mother. Is that the telephone?

645
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:04,900
 Yes, turn on the light so I can find it.

646
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:07,900
 I've got it, Father. It's right here. Hello?

647
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,780
 Hello. Is Henry Orange there?

648
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:11,420
 Yes. Well, this is Loretta.

649
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:14,740
 Loretta? Yes. And I just want to say, Henry Orange,

650
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:18,500
 I think you're the greatest, most hard person I've ever known in my life.

651
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:21,660
 What have I done? Well, I'm sorry. I didn't go home with George Bigelow.

652
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:24,220
 Who did he go home with? I didn't go home with anyone.

653
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:25,220
 I'm still here!

654
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:26,220
 That's a clubhouse?

655
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:27,220
 I can't, I am!

656
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:30,220
 And I've just simply got to get home, Henry!

657
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:32,220
 Well, just a minute.

658
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:35,220
 Father, have you gone entirely to sleep yet?

659
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:50,220
 And we all wish we'll be back in just a moment.

660
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:52,220
 In the meantime, if coffee keeps you awake,

661
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:55,060
 if you don't sleep better drinking post-em instead.

662
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:58,500
 You'll enjoy Post-em's grand taste, you and your whole family.

663
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:02,400
 And as an all-family drink, you'll find Post-em most economical,

664
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:06,220
 still selling at its usual low cost of less than one half cent a cup.

665
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:09,220
 So ask your grocer for Post-em tomorrow.

666

667
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:16,140
 Father, I just got a note from Loretta.

668
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:16,620
 Did you?

669
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:18,940
 It's about our going back for the other night.

670
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:19,440
 Yes.

671
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:23,000
 She says, "Words will never express my appreciation,

672
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,600
 especially of the behavior of your father.

673
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,560
 Not once did he complain.

674
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:31,480
 Not once did he embarrass me by so much as looking in my direction.

675
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,760
 Not once did he even say a word.

676
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:38,720
 Henry, your father must be a very wonderful, silent man."

677
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,960
 Listen again next week to the Aldrich family,

678
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:44,160
 same time, same station, for another sparkling half hour

679
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:47,360
 with your favorite youngster, his family, and his pals.

680
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:51,960
 The Aldrich family starring Ezra Stone is written by Clifford Goldsmith.

681
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:55,640
 Original music is composed and conducted by Jack Miller.

682
00:28:55,640 --> 00:29:00,360
 This is Dan Seymour saying, "You will enjoy fragrant, flavorful postum."

683
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:03,760
 And remember, postum contains no stimulants.

684
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,600
 It cannot keep you awake.

685
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,160
 Good night.
