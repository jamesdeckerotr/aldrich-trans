00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
 [Music]

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 Henry Henry Aldrich!

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 Coming, Mother!

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 [Applause]

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 The Aldrich family based on characters who inherited my Clifford Goldsmith

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 and starring as bestowments every Jackie Calcett former.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 And now for the Aldrich family.

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,500
 Everyone knows that as we grow older, the years begin to travel more swiftly.

9
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:01,400
 But when you're a teenage boy like Henry Aldrich, every year is a lifetime.

10
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,900
 For each minute is packed full of fun and adventurous.

11
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:07,800
 The teen opens in the Aldrich living room.

12
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,600
 Mary, I can hardly believe my ears.

13
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:14,400
 My goodness, Henry, all I did was ask you a perfectly civil question.

14
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,900
 I'm sure I don't know what you're so excited about.

15
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,000
 You don't.

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,800
 Mary, I was sitting here mining my own business.

17
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,800
 And you walked up to me and said a thing like that.

18
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:27,340
 All I said was that Joe Graham is coming over for dinner tonight.

19
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:28,340
 Sure.

20
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:31,900
 And then you asked me what time I was getting out of the house.

21
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:35,640
 Well, that's all I want to know, Henry. What time are you getting out?

22
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,240
 But, Mary, I've been looking forward to that roast duck all day.

23
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,540
 Henry, you can't do a thing like this to me.

24
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:42,640
 I can't do why.

25
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,140
 You can't possibly intend to sit there at the table and have dinner with us.

26
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,740
 Gee whiz, why not?

27
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,980
 Joe and I get along swell.

28
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:53,780
 Henry, do you remember what happened the last time Joe was here for dinner?

29
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,280
 Have you said it once? You said it a hundred times.

30
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,680
 Joe was the only boyfriend I had.

31
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,680
 Mary, you just don't understand men.

32
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,680
 That makes a man feel good.

33
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,080
 If he hasn't any competition, what's he got to worry about?

34
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,780
 Oh, what's the youth mother?

35
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:11,380
 Now listen, Mary, don't go dragging mother into this.

36
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:13,380
 Oh, right, then I'll give you one more chance.

37
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,180
 Are you going to get out of on to?

38
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:17,180
 Mary, where can I go?

39
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:20,040
 My own family doesn't want me who else would

40
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:26,360
 But I've been trying to tell you is that I found Homer a little while ago and asked if you could have dinner with him

41
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:29,680
 You mean you'd force me down Mrs. Brown's throat?

42
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:35,520
 Oh, it says he sure his mother would be delighted and he's working on a right now. Oh, no, Mary. Oh, no

43
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:39,800
 Oh, no, why I'm not going to impose myself on anybody that has to be

44
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:46,760
 Worked on very well Henry. You've had your chance mother. Okay, Mary. Go ahead. Go ahead and sour

45
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:52,100
 I know my right mother. Where are you? I'm in the kitchen. Mary based in the duck

46
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:58,160
 Sam a hold it take your hands off those olives, but I'm hungry Alice, but I have just one mother

47
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:02,160
 I could just die all right, Sam. You may have one, but that's all ah

48
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:08,600
 Sam what's the matter not the one on top of the salad? It took me 15 minutes to cut it to look like a rose

49
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,840
 Is that what it looks like

50
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,520
 He's one out of the deep mother. I don't mean to criticize

51
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:21,300
 But what's more important to you and all of that looks like a rose or my future happiness now now dear

52
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:24,680
 What's the matter? Do you know what Henry's gonna do to me? Do you know what he's going to do?

53
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:29,560
 Why he's going to have dinner with us tonight. Well, that seems natural he lives here

54
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:35,480
 Of course Mary and he's perfectly entitled I have dinner with us if he wants

55
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:40,760
 Tonight don't you remember what happened the last time Joe Graham was here for dinner

56
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,340
 You mean when you spilled the gravy in Joe's lab?

57
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:49,260
 Father that was because Henry had me so upset by the things he was saying. I was positively trembling

58
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:56,080
 In a way Sam I can see Mary's point of view after all Joe is practically the only boyfriend she has

59
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,840
 Mother

60
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,400
 Mary will you just tell me one thing. You mean you changed your mind. She was no

61
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,460
 But look what it fixed things up if I told Joe you had a different boyfriend here every night

62
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:13,240
 You see mother you see that sounds feasible to me sure Mary you just don't understand men

63
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:19,200
 They like to feel they have lots of competition father all I asked is that I be allowed to live my own life

64
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,300
 Well gee whiz Mary go ahead who's stopping you?

65
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:28,760
 Mother what am I to do Mary at the moment? I'm much more concerned with this duck than Joe Graham. I wash my hands with a hula

66
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:35,580
 Here we're out here in the kitchen Homer

67
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:38,580
 The kitchen's all boy.

68
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:39,580
 Sam, hide those olives.

69
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:40,580
 Right.

70
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,580
 Boy, does this house smell good.

71
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:43,580
 Hello, everybody.

72
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:45,580
 Hi, homerovel timer.

73
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:47,580
 Well, I'm here.

74
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:48,580
 So I see.

75
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:52,580
 Boy, are we having that duck for dinner?

76
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:54,580
 No, we are.

77
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:55,580
 We are?

78
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:56,580
 Oh boy.

79
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:57,580
 No, wait a minute, Homer.

80
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:59,580
 What exactly are you doing over here?

81
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:02,580
 Jean, Mrs. Aldrich, I was invited over for dinner.

82
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,580
 Bob, who invited you?

83
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:09,960
 I did. Don't you remember Mary? I said my mother would be delighted to have me come.

84
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:15,360
 Homer! Well, she was. You misunderstood me entirely. I didn't invite you over here.

85
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,200
 You didn't. Alice, if it would help matters any, I'd be glad to have dinner out.

86
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:25,520
 Now, family couldn't do that. Who called the duck? Homer, it isn't that we wouldn't love to have you.

87
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:30,960
 You would, boy. But not tonight, dear. And I'm afraid you'll just have to go home.

88
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,960
 But Mrs. Aldrich, I can.

89
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,960
 Why not?

90
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:37,500
 Well, when I told my mother I was going out, she said this was her chance to have some

91
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,500
 people in for dinner.

92
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:42,960
 Oh my goodness, and she doesn't want to see me again till 11 o'clock tonight.

93
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:56,960
 Boy, Homer, you know we should have done this more often.

94
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:57,960
 I'll say.

95
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:01,460
 Listen, are you sure you've still got all the money?

96
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:02,460
 Sure, I'm sure.

97
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:06,260
 It's all tied in my handkerchief, right where my mother put it.

98
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:09,960
 Gee, there's nothing like two old friends going out to dinner together.

99
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:10,960
 Obviously.

100
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,960
 Oh, how much have we got again?

101
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,060
 We have a dollar and a quarter each, Homer.

102
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:18,060
 I've told you a million times.

103
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:20,560
 I know, but I still can't believe it.

104
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,960
 Whenever my mother kicks me out of the house, all I get is 35 cents.

105
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,460
 Homer, I hope you don't think my mother kicked us out.

106
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:28,860
 Oh, that's alright, Hannah.

107
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,460
 The old timer I understand.

108
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:32,460
 She can't hurt my feelings.

109
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,460
 Anyway, we wouldn't have enjoyed ourselves.

110
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:42,460
 Whenever Mary has a boyfriend up for dinner, all my mother talks about is what a good cook Mary is, and how she makes all her own clothes.

111
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:44,460
 She didn't marry cook that dinner?

112
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:47,460
 No, but she peeled the radishes, though.

113
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:50,460
 I didn't know you peeled radishes.

114
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:52,460
 Mary does.

115
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:55,460
 She doesn't know how to clean them.

116
00:06:56,460 --> 00:07:00,220
 Boy, and I know where let's go. Let's go to the candy kitchen.

117
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:03,260
 The candy kitchen at home or all you can get there is dessert.

118
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:06,860
 Sure. Think of all the desserts we could get for a dollar and a quarter.

119
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:09,660
 Now let's go to the mansion house.

120
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:13,260
 Hand me, they charge millions of dollars at the mansion house.

121
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:17,060
 They do not. You can get a real swell dinner for a dollar and a quarter.

122
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:20,860
 Yeah, and you could put it all on a piece of bread and make a sandwich out of it.

123
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:24,060
 Listen, Homer, one of this has to be sensible.

124
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:28,060
 For anybody who'd eat a dollar and a quarter's worth of desserts.

125
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:29,560
 Okay.

126
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,060
 What do you mean by that?

127
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,860
 Okay, that's all.

128
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,760
 It's your money.

129
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,260
 I'm only the guest.

130
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:39,860
 Homer, I haven't hurt your feelings, have I?

131
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:43,160
 I'm gonna think of it. I wasn't even invited in the first place.

132
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,060
 Now Homer...

133
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:47,160
 That's all right, Henry. Don't bother trying to explain.

134
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,060
 We'll go to the mansion house.

135
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:51,060
 Well, gee whiz, if you're gonna SALK.

136
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:51,960
 Who's SALKING?

137
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,680
 If that's your attitude, let's go to the candy kitchen.

138
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,800
 Oh no, I wouldn't think of going to the candy kitchen.

139
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,400
 We'll go to the mansion house.

140
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,680
 Oh no, we won't.

141
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:04,600
 Listen, you couldn't drag me into the candy kitchen with a team of wild horses.

142
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,480
 Well, I'm darned a boss that put in the mansion house.

143
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,680
 Now listen, Henry.

144
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,280
 Now listen, Homer.

145
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:21,720
 Mother, I just can't stand it.

146
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,720
 Now Mary, don't go all the pieces.

147
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:27,220
 Look, when Joe gets here, why don't I just take him out someplace for dinner?

148
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:28,820
 You'll do no such thing.

149
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:31,520
 Frankly, I'm getting a little tired of this whole business.

150
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,720
 Now, where are the boys?

151
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:37,620
 Henry's up in his room, eating jelly beans from last Easter.

152
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:38,720
 Jelly beans?

153
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,320
 My goodness, he'll make himself sick.

154
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,920
 He says he hopes he does.

155
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:44,420
 And Homer's sitting in the whole closet.

156
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:45,420
 Where?

157
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,220
 The whole closet, mother.

158
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:51,220
 He says Henry gave him permission to sit there and soak if he wants to.

159
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:54,500
 Well, you go and tell them both to stop this foolishness at once.

160
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,060
 Tell them I'll expect to see them at dinner in 15 minutes.

161
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,660
 You mean at our dinner table?

162
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:00,100
 What mother, what about Joe?

163
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:03,620
 Mary, if you mention Joe just once more, I'll go out for dinner myself.

164
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:04,660
 Now, do as your toes.

165
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:05,700
 My goodness.

166
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,100
 Sam, I'll just get away from those radishes.

167
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,540
 You mean these white things?

168
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:10,660
 I thought they were on you.

169
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:11,860
 Homer!

170
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:14,100
 Are you still in the closet?

171
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:14,980
 Who's that?

172
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,340
 It's Mary.

173
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:18,180
 Okay, you can come in.

174
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:21,300
 How are you coming out of that closet, your mother to death?

175
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,580
 I hope I do.

176
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:24,660
 My mother says you're to have dinner with her.

177
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:25,860
 She does?

178
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:26,860
 Oh.

179
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,580
 Is Henry gonna be there?

180
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:30,660
 Certainly is. He lives here, doesn't he?

181
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,820
 Then I'll just stay right here.

182
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:36,340
 Tell your mother thanks just the same, but I'd rather starve.

183
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:37,460
 Well, my goodness.

184
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:39,620
 And please close the door after you.

185
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,780
 All right then. All right.

186
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:42,900
 Henry!

187
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,820
 I'm here in my room.

188
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,900
 If anybody's interested.

189
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,900
 Henry, old, did you listen to me?

190
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,900
 How do you do?

191
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:53,400
 Mother sent me up here to invite you to dinner.

192
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,400
 And I hope you're satisfied.

193
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,900
 Would you care for a jelly bean?

194
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,400
 Henry, did you hear me?

195
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:04,400
 Mary, please convey my regrets and tell Mother I wouldn't think of imposing on my own family for a meal.

196
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,400
 Now, look, are you talking too?

197
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,400
 Of course I'm not sulking!

198
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,400
 I know what I'm not wanted.

199
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,400
 Well, my goodness, Mother!

200
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:41,400
 Oh my goodness. Hello, Mary. Joe, it's you. Aren't you expecting me? Yes, yes, of course, Joe. It's just that I'm so upset. Well, come on in. Thank you. Did you just come in? No, I'm going out. Just for a few minutes, Joe.

201
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,800
 I have to see somebody about my brother.

202
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,400
 - Oh, is he going to be here for dinner?

203
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,400
 - Not if I can help it.

204
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:49,400
 That is, I'll be back in a few minutes, Joe.

205
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,400
 Goodbye.

206
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,400
 - But, Murray, is that you, Joe?

207
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,400
 - Yes, it is, Mr. Olridge.

208
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,400
 - Just hang your coat up in the hall closet

209
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,400
 and come on in the living room.

210
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,400
 - All right, sir.

211
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:01,400
 Oh, excuse me, I thought this was the closet.

212
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,400
 - It is.

213
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,400
 (audience laughing)

214
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,400
 - It is.

215
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:10,400
 Well, are you, uh, are you looking for something?

216
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:16,600
 for something? No. Oh. Here, give me your coat. I'll hang it up for you. But I don't

217
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:21,840
 want to. No, that's all right. I'd be glad of something to do. Oh, well thanks. And would

218
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:29,040
 you please close the door after you? Close it? Oh, sure. Sure. You coming in the living

219
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:33,380
 room, Joe? Yes, Mr. Aldrich. I'm going. I mean, I'm coming. I'm sorry. I couldn't

220
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:37,120
 come to the door. I'm trying to get a little fire going here. Mr. Aldrich, I... What's

221
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,040
 What about a joke? You look pale.

222
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,560
 Have you been working pretty hard?

223
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,400
 Working?

224
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,400
 Yeah, yeah, that's probably it.

225
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,760
 I've just been working too hard.

226
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,160
 The only thing is...

227
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,040
 Yes, Joe.

228
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,640
 Mr. Aldrich, have you noticed anything unusual

229
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,480
 about your hall closet?

230
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,880
 Oh, you mean all that junk?

231
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,720
 Junk? That's been accumulating for years.

232
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,320
 Anytime this family wants to get rid of anything,

233
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,560
 they just stuff it in the hall closet.

234
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:12,360
 They do. Gee. Ever so often we clean it out and throw everything away, but it always manages to come back.

235
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:19,360
 Is that right? It's gotten to be a sort of family skeleton. Skeleton. Gee, I could have sworn it.

236
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:26,360
 What, Joe? Nothing. Oh, will you excuse me, Joe, when I answer the phone? Sure, Mr. Aldrich. I'll just lie down for a minute.

237
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:30,360
 Hello. Hello, what's that do with the roll?

238
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,360
 Yes?

239
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,360
 It's a pinebean.

240
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,360
 Who?

241
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,040
 string bean, string bean, kitten, juke.

242
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,240
 Oh, hello, string bean.

243
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,280
 Listen, I just met Mary on the street,

244
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,840
 and that's Henry and Homer got a dinner invitation here.

245
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,040
 Why, no, they haven't.

246
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,520
 Oh boy, then I'm not too late.

247
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:48,200
 Gee, I ran out of the first bubble that I came to.

248
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,520
 This is called a day to come to my house for dinner.

249
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,040
 Why, I should think they'd be delighted, string bean.

250
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,720
 Oh boy, imagine two men in both of them at once.

251
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,680
 What's that?

252
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,000
 Comes to come over and a half an hour in the storage.

253
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,280
 Don't take me that long in the corner,

254
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,800
 the kinks out of my hands.

255
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,800
 Come on!

256
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,800
 You're marching, Bean.

257
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,800
 Well, it's...

258
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,800
 Sam, what's going wrong now?

259
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,800
 Nothing's gone wrong, dear.

260
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,800
 I've just fixed Henry and Homer up with a dinner invitation.

261
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,800
 Well, thank goodness.

262
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,800
 Was that Mrs. Anderson or Kathleen who called?

263
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,800
 The Anderson?

264
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,800
 Alice, the boys have been invited to the kitten juice.

265
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,800
 And you accepted?

266
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,800
 Certainly.

267
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,800
 If they won't eat at home, they have to eat some, please.

268
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,800
 But Sam, Mary's gone to ask Mrs. Anderson if they can have dinner over there.

269
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,800
 What's that?

270
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,800
 So do you have to get the car out and try to catch her?

271
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,800
 But Alice, what about Joe?

272
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,280
 - Please Sam oldrich, I don't care what...

273
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,800
 - Oh goodness, what's he doing?

274
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,120
 - Oh, dear, those olives are for dinner!

275
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,700
 (upbeat music)

276
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:55,460
 (audience applauding)

277
00:13:55,460 --> 00:14:00,700

287
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,500

288
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,080

305

 [Music]

306
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:51,380
 And now getting back to the troubles of Henry Orton.

307
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:54,380
 When Marion invited Joe Graham up to the house for dinner,

308
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:57,380
 she made the mistake of trying to get rid of Henry.

309
00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:00,380
 At the moment Joe is sitting in the living room reading travel magazines

310
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:03,380
 The family is having a meeting in Henry's bedroom.

311
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:05,380
 Alice, they've got to have dinner at the Kittenges.

312
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:08,380
 Do you realize Frank Kittenger is one of my best clients?

313
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:10,380
 I can't afford to offend him.

314
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:13,380
 But then, how can I phone Mrs. Anderson and say they aren't coming?

315
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,380
 You can have Maryponer.

316
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,380
 What?

317
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:19,380
 After deliberately sending her over to ask for the invitation.

318
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:21,380
 Father, could I voice an opinion?

319
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,380
 You may not. You've voiced too many already.

320
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:25,380
 Henry, stop eating those jelly beans.

321
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:27,380
 You'll need your appetite at the Anderson.

322
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:33,920
 At the kitten's, but mother I'd rather just stay here in my room than have to go out any place with Homer

323
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,300
 You'll go out with Homer to like it. Yes, sir

324
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:41,080
 Sam, I don't understand why you weren't able to catch up with Mary before she got to the end

325
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,840
 Uh, no Alice, uh, that's a long story

326
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,980
 Father, Father, Ghost Cora has been stolen

327
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:49,000
 Mary, he says he left it in the drive line

328
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,040
 And just now when he looked out the window it was gone

329
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,680
 Well, uh, tell him not to worry about it

330
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,040
 Not to worry.

331
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:59,060
 Gee, whiz father, that car course show $150.

332
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:03,860
 Well, anyway, he says that people get an awful surprise when he goes to push the cigarette lighter.

333
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:05,260
 What are you supposed to happen?

334
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:05,760
 What?

335
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,460
 The whole roof falls on top of you.

336
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:08,300
 [laughter]

337
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,100
 Father!

338
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:09,920
 Damn old-

339
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,660
 Now, if I had to take it, it was blocking the driveway.

340
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:17,540
 And Mary tell Joey can pick his car up at the garage tomorrow, and it'll have two new fenders.

341
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:19,840
 Then, Sam, this whole thing was your fault.

342
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:23,660
 And I want you to hone Mr. Kittenger and say the boys won't be over for dinner.

343
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:25,500
 Alice, Mr. Kitten just wanted my best part.

344
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:30,020
 I think you suppose you and Father could argue in the living room so we could teach you how it attains.

345
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:32,060
 Henry, please go and answer that.

346
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:34,100
 Sound stairs? Where Homer is?

347
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,540
 Just pick it up here in my room.

348
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:36,340
 Yes, sure.

349
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:39,460
 Nossy here, Mary. Don't you know how to entertain the girls right now?

350
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:40,960
 Hello?

351
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,460
 Hello? Hello?

352
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:43,660
 Homer, where are you?

353
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:46,320
 I'm right downstairs in your whole closet.

354
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,780
 Would you mind kindly getting lost the line?

355
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,780
 Hello, Homer. This is Frank being technical.

356
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:55,780
 Homer, may I ask who gave you permission to take our phone into the hall closet?

357
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:56,780
 Just ignore him, stringy.

358
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:58,780
 How are you anyway?

359
00:17:58,780 --> 00:17:59,780
 I'm fine.

360
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:00,780
 That's good.

361
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,780
 Now listen, Henry.

362
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:03,780
 How are you, Henry?

363
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:04,780
 I'm fine.

364
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:07,780
 That's good. I mean, can we get off the line?

365
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:12,780
 Oh, I could just die. You know that dinner invitation was dinner invitation.

366
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:16,780
 Oh, it's good to even know. I invited you and Henry over here for dinner.

367
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:19,280
 You did? Oh, boy.

368
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:23,580
 Homer, my mother says we have to go to Kathleen Anderson's for dinner.

369
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,780
 Are you going to the Anderson's?

370
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:26,780
 Sure.

371
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:29,380
 Stringing, what time do you want me to come over?

372
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:30,980
 That's why I took time.

373
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:35,080
 When I got home, I found enough for my mother sitting on those cat important beans.

374
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,780
 They've been invited out for dinner.

375
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,980
 Well, darn it all anyway.

376
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:41,280
 Homer, do you like cotton beans?

377
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,080
 No.

378
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,280
 Neither do I.

379
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,380
 Gee, I love them.

380
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:46,380
 Listen, Henry, get off the line.

381
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:47,780
 I'm gonna hold my lips on.

382
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:50,580
 My mother left the phone on the house for having dinner last.

383
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,980
 And I'm gonna phone up to get myself provided.

384
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,880
 Yeah, but what about me?

385
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,880
 That's it.

386
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,680
 I'm just telling my friend of mine is starving to death.

387
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,880
 Don't they know that duty and citizen?

388
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,940
 Mrs. All the rich, is anybody gonna answer this phone?

389
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:21,160
 Oh, Gee Whiz.

390
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,520
 Hello.

391
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,700
 Hello, is that you Homer?

392
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:25,360
 Yes.

393
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,180
 Have you, uh, have you had your dinner yet?

394
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:29,040
 What?

395
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,280
 No.

396
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:33,540
 Then, dear, would you like to come over here for dinner?

397
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:36,380
 Well, Gee Whiz, who is this?

398
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:37,820
 This is your mother!

399
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:40,380
 My mother?

400
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,940
 And you're inviting me over for dinner?

401
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:48,080
 Yes, the kids in truth are here. You remember the kids, Jude.

402
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,380
 And their daughters, ring B? Yes, I got it on the phone.

403
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:54,380
 Oh, baby. She and you'd really like to have me?

404
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:59,880
 Why, I think yes. I don't know why. I didn't think of it before.

405
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,880
 Well, thank you very much. I'd be delighted.

406
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,880
 You're sure you haven't had your dinner?

407
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,880
 I'm positive.

408
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,880
 Oh, well, come on then.

409
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,880
 Oh, I'll be right over.

410
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:15,680
 Take your time. Goodbye dear.

411
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,880
 Goodbye and thank you.

412
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,880
 Oh Joe, Joe was that?

413
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,880
 Oh, it's you.

414
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,880
 Would you kindly mind stepping out of my way? I'm leaving.

415
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,880
 You're leaving? I'd be delighted.

416
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:31,880
 And would you mind sending me back my stuffed rattlesnake at your convenience?

417
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,880
 I'll get it for you right now.

418
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,880
 I'm sorry but I can't wait.

419
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:40,880
 It happens I've been invited out for dinner and my friends are very anxious for me to get there.

420
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,380
 Well, you better get going. Yeah

421
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:48,980
 Well, it's been nice knowing you. Bye.

422
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:52,240
 Bye

423
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,000
 Well

424
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,600
 Well, I have to answer the phone well

425
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,960
 Bye

426
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,960
 Bye

427
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:11,360
 Hello, hello, is that you and me sure Kathleen? How are you?

428
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:16,880
 Yeah

429
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:23,440
 You mean she doesn't want me

430
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:30,280
 She does well gee that suits me right down to the ground

431
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:36,600
 The only thing is could I ask you one question

432
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:43,600
 - No, I don't have any. - All I want to know is, well, exactly what has your mother

433
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,600
 got against Homer?

434
00:21:45,600 --> 00:22:00,600
 Homer! Homer, your mother wants to know if you finish matching the potatoes yet.

435
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,600
 I'm mashing them. I'm mashing them.

436
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:06,200
 Boy, does that Henry Aldrich make me sore?

437
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,200
 Me too.

438
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,700
 Nobody in this whole family knows what they're doing.

439
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:12,700
 And by Joba for dinner and where do you wind up?

440
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:15,200
 In the whole closet with a bunch of gosh's.

441
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:20,300
 And imagine Henry eavesdropping on our telephone conversation like that.

442
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,800
 Yeah, imagine.

443
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:25,700
 Oh, it was his phone.

444
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:29,100
 I know, but it was you I wanted to talk to, not him.

445
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:35,100
 Sure, but just the same. He has a right to use his own phone if he wants to.

446
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,100
 Oh, but he's so bossy.

447
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,100
 Oh, I don't know.

448
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,100
 Why don't the brownies always tell me what to do?

449
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:44,100
 Yeah. Well, maybe I like being told what to do.

450
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,100
 Well, my goodness.

451
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:49,100
 And I'll thank you to stop making insulting remarks about my best friend.

452
00:22:49,100 --> 00:23:05,900
 friend. Mr. Dehaven. Yes, Henry. I guess I'll have another hamburger. Another one?

453
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:11,140
 They didn't you have any dinner tonight? Well, as a matter of fact, I didn't. I was

454
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:17,420
 invited out for dinner, but see, I don't know. You take women. No, you take men.

455
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:18,420
 What's that?

456
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:20,420
 Yeah, you take men.

457
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:25,020
 You can talk to them for years and boy you always got lots to talk about.

458
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:30,820
 But you talk to a woman for five minutes and see all she can talk about is men.

459
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:33,060
 Well you don't say.

460
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:34,060
 Sure.

461
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:37,060
 All she can do is criticize your friends.

462
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:44,580
 Homer, well that is, my friends might have big appetites but boy you never get bored

463
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:45,580
 with him.

464
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:52,580
 of them. Well, say, of course here. Oh, ow.

465
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:55,580
 Mr. Behave, and have you done anything decent to eat?

466
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:59,580
 Sure thing, Homer. You get up on that stool and I'll fix you some hamburgers.

467
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:02,580
 This stool? This stool right here?

468
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:04,580
 Yeah, I'll have them for you in a minute.

469
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:09,580
 Oh. Hi. Hi.

470
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:12,580
 Is this stool taken?

471
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:14,580
 No, Gee, no.

472
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:15,580
 So, then.

473
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:16,580
 Thanks.

474
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,580
 Did you all that?

475
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:19,580
 Huh?

476
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:22,580
 I said, "Isn't it cold out?"

477
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:24,580
 I'll say.

478
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:27,580
 Well, Gee, how are you, anyway?

479
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:28,580
 I'm fine, Homer.

480
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:30,580
 Just fine.

481
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:32,580
 How are you?

482
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:34,580
 I'm swell.

483
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:35,580
 And...

484
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:37,580
 Well, Gee, Homer.

485
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:39,580
 Old timer.

486
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:42,420
 Listen, I still got a dollar fifty.

487
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:46,060
 Why don't you say we go over to the candy kitchen and get a whole lot of dessert?

488
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:48,220
 I wouldn't mind going to the mansion now.

489
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:50,300
 No sir, I'm Henry.

490
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:52,380
 Listen Homer, I got a better idea.

491
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:53,380
 Why?

492
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:54,380
 Let's just stay here.

493
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:55,380
 Swell.

494
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:56,380
 Here are your hamburgers, Homer.

495
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:59,060
 Oh boy, do they look good.

496
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:00,820
 They are, Homer.

497
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:01,820
 Hear him.

498
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:03,420
 Have one of mine.

499
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:04,420
 Thanks.

500
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:06,260
 Gee whiz, is that Joe Graham?

501
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:07,260
 Hi, Henry.

502
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:08,260
 What are you doing here?

503
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:10,260
 I'm having a mind dinner.

504
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:11,760
 See, are those hamburgers?

505
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,260
 That's just what I'm looking for.

506
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:14,760
 Well, come on, sit down.

507
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:17,760
 But Joe, didn't you just have a duck dinner over at my house?

508
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,260
 Well, I started to.

509
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:21,260
 Yeah, I bet the whole thing never would have happened

510
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,760
 if the duck hadn't got burned.

511
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:23,760
 It did?

512
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,760
 Yes, your mother and father were so busy talking upstairs

513
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,260
 they never would have noticed it if I hadn't smelled the smoke.

514
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,760
 See, what do you mean you couldn't eat it?

515
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,260
 Well, we started to, but then your father began telling me

516
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:33,760
 how Mary does all the cooking.

517
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,260
 And the first thing your mother knew,

518
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:36,760
 Mary had dumped the gravy in her lap.

519
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,360
 She, what did she do?

520
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,360
 She went to bed.

521
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:39,860
 Mary?

522
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:40,860
 No, your mother.

523
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:42,360
 Mary went for the doctor.

524
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,160
 My mother needed a doctor?

525
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,960
 No, the doctor was for your father.

526
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,360
 You see, he was carrying a tray up to your mother

527
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:51,360
 and he slid on some jelly beans and put it his ankle.

528
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,060
 Oh, I wish I'd been there.

529
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:56,060
 Listen, Homer, if we'd been there,

530
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:59,060
 they'd only have blamed the whole thing on us.

531
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:01,860
 Here, Joe, would you like a hamburger?

532
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,560
 Yeah, thanks.

533
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:06,660
 Certainly, two bad things had to go wrong.

534
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:09,660
 You're the only boyfriend Mary has.

535
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:12,660
 Well, somebody passed the catch-up.

 Father, is it time to put another calm press on your ankle?

 Don't bother Mary, it feels fine.

576
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,500
 Just the same, I'd better follow the doctor's orders.

 Yes, dear.

 I'll get the ice bag for your head just as soon as I'm through.

 Well, thank you, Mary. The Sam, isn't she efficient?

 She certainly is. The next time Joe comes for dinner,
