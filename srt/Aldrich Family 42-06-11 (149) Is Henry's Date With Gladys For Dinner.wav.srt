00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 To a teenage boy each new day is a new world.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,100
 Filled with all sorts of discoveries and excitement and even mishaps, which drop a

00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:23,900
 Always empty.

00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,900
 Or it is with every opening.

00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:29,200
 The scene opens at the telephone and calls it front hall.

00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,200
 It is Saturday morning.

8
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,200
 Hello?

9
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,200
 Hello?

10
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,200
 Oh, how are you, Gladys?

11
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,700
 Fine, can you hear us?

12
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:36,700
 Fine.

13
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:38,200
 Do you, well, hear your voice?

14
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,200
 Thank you.

15
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,200
 You're a student.

16
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,200
 It is?

17
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,200
 I can see you.

18
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,200
 Oh, it's a little bit more.

19
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,200
 Oh, Henry.

20
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,200
 Henry.

21
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,200
 Henry, all of you?

22
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,200
 Yeah.

23
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,200
 Oh, oh.

24
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,200
 Oh, oh.

25
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,200
 Oh, oh.

26
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,200
 Oh, oh.

27
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,040
 Henry.

28
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,040
 Oh, just a minute, Gladys.

29
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,040
 Yes, Mother.

30
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,680
 Me, tell me to birth the...

31
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,600
 Sure, Mother.

32
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,280
 Just as soon as I find out one thing from Gladys.

33
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,480
 One thing, Henry.

34
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,840
 Oh, I...

35
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,360
 Do you remember last Thursday, Gladys?

36
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,680
 I think I do.

37
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,960
 You mean you don't remember making a date with me?

38
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,040
 Of course I do.

39
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,600
 How could I forget that?

40
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,600
 When we get bored?

41
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,880
 Oh, tonight.

42
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,760
 And the reason I call, Gladys,

43
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,040
 about what time do you want me to come over?

44
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:18,880
 What time?

45
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,720
 Yeah.

46
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:24,720
 I wasn't sure whether you wanted me to come in time for

47
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,720
 for what?

48
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:29,720
 I mean I certainly wouldn't want to barge in right in the middle of your

49
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,720
 your

50
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,720
 how does five thirty sound?

51
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,720
 Five thirty?

52
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,720
 Isn't that a little bit of a challenge?

53
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,720
 It is?

54
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,720
 It isn't?

55
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,720
 Well how about six?

56
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,720
 Is that two early?

57
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,720
 One or maybe six thirty?

58
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,720
 Six thirty?

59
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,720
 Not a dash.

60
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,720
 You're at 630 is a nice round number.

61
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,720
 Is that before?

62
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,720
 Well, that is, was that the answer?

63
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,720
 No.

64
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,720
 Henry!

65
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,720
 Well, 630 is fine, Gladys.

66
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,720
 I'll be there.

67
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,720
 You can go by.

68
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,720
 I'm coming, Mother.

69
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,720
 Your breakfast is getting cold.

70
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,720
 Now, can you reach the cream, please?

71
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,720
 There you are, dear.

72
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,720
 Thank you.

73
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,720
 Father.

74
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,720
 Yes, Henry.

75
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:10,720
 Father, you've had quite a bit of experience eating.

76
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,720
 I beg your pardon?

77
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,720
 Fantastic.

78
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,720
 Great.

79
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,720
 So, down to Henry.

80
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,120
 People sometimes invite you over to their house for dinner, don't they?

81
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,760
 That happened occasionally.

82
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,760
 Why do you ask?

83
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,760
 Well, Father, when someone invites you over to their house at 6.30, does that mean it's

84
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,760
 for dinner or just social?

85
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,760
 What's that?

86
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,840
 Henry, please eat your grapefruit.

87
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,840
 When I've got something on my mind?

88
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,760
 The other best way to get something off your mind is to put something in your stomach.

89
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,760
 Now start on your grapefruit.

90
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,760
 Yes, Mother.

91
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,760
 Oh, Henry.

92
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,680
 Did I get you, Father?

93
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,680
 You did.

94
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,680
 Do you see how upset I am, mother?

95
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,180
 Alice, let him ask me whatever he's going to.

96
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,680
 The sand must simply stay up until he does.

97
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,180
 Now, who's invited you to dinner?

98
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:53,680
 That's it, I don't know.

99
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,680
 What?

100
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,680
 I mean, I know who it is. Sure, but I'm not sure they are.

101
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,680
 Oh, what? Sure.

102
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,680
 Alice.

103
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,680
 Yes, ma'am.

104
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,680
 Alice is your son. Translation, please.

105
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,680
 Don't you understand, Father?

106
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,680
 No.

107
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,680
 It's perfectly simple. I've got a date tonight with Gladys Krennis,

108
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,680
 and I'm not sure whether eating goes with it or not.

109
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,580
 Oh, that seems simple to me. Did she invite you?

110
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:18,480
 Well, she told me to be sure and be there no later than 630.

111
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,780
 630? Yes, mother. I got the idea. That was the absolute deadline.

112
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,980
 Well, it certainly sounds like dinner.

113
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:28,180
 Oh, this is sounds like nothing of the sort. It might easily be after dinner.

114
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:31,880
 Now, Sam Mabel Prentice was a cabinol before she was married, wasn't she?

115
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,880
 Well, that got to deal with it.

116
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,780
 Well, her father was a railroad engineer.

117
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:38,780
 And, Ray, she's your mother. Transplacement, please.

118
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:41,780
 They live right across the street from us and I know.

119
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:46,780
 Mr. Kavanaugh's train got in at 6.50 and they never ate before 6.50.

120
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:49,780
 Oh boy, you mean I'm really invited?

121
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:51,780
 No, Henry, let's not see Hasty.

122
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:55,780
 What you heard with Mother said, they always eat at 6.30. It's in their blood.

123
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:58,780
 It's a very simple way to find out if you're invited to dinner.

124
00:03:58,780 --> 00:03:59,780
 There is how?

125
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:00,780
 Phone Gladys and Asker.

126
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,780
 Asker? Right out?

127
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:03,780
 Why not?

128
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:08,580
 I couldn't see if he wasn't expecting me to think I wanted an invitation.

129
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:09,880
 Well, don't you?

130
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,680
 Sam.

131
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,380
 No, look, suppose I do this.

132
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:14,780
 Toby Smith lives next door to Gladys.

133
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:18,380
 Maybe he could tell me whether they eat before or after 630.

134
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,680
 Finish a great suit first.

135
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,180
 But Mother, don't you think I should find out?

136
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,280
 I'm going to do it, your mother said.

137
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,180
 But, Father, I'm right.

138
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:23,980
 Yes, sir.

139
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:25,380
 I'm sorry, Dee.

140
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:28,480
 What's in there, Dee Whizmother?

141
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,380
 Did I get you in the eye too?

142
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:31,880
 Now see here.

143
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,880
 The fans are heaven's sake, letting go make his phone call.

144
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:45,880
 But, Mark, you want to tell me what you saw?

145
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,880
 I think you're not quite in those dishes very well, good.

146
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,880
 Oh, Mark, it was time to...

147
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:55,880
 And if you're lending our best sign of the ass-mable for her engagement party tonight, we certainly want to send them over, please.

148
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,880
 But doesn't it sound like you're so happy, Mark, when I say to you, Mark?

149
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,720
 - Hey, Mom.

150
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,540
 - Well, thank you.

151
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,280
 I think you may be doubting the conclusion.

152
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,160
 But why would you want to come over so early

153
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,840
 if you didn't take me out to dinner?

154
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,360
 - I'm glad it's a wise thing for you to do

155
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,480
 with falling in red,

156
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,840
 trying to out definitely just funny as you might.

157
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,440
 - Oh, my God, I just couldn't.

158
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,280
 - Why not?

159
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,360
 - Because if you haven't had taken me to dinner,

160
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,800
 my goodness, I just died in the dark, no.

161
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,640
 - How's it going?

162
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,480
 - I'm good.

163
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,320
 - But I went out there and I said,

164
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,680
 well, what if you sit,

165
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,520
 (scoffs)

166
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,360
 my goodness.

167
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,360
 - You couldn't break the place, did you?

168
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,200
 - Yeah.

169
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,080
 I could warn I saw somebody up in that big M3.

170
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,680
 That's all I got, y'all.

171
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,680
 You did.

172
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,880
 Another, you know, it looked like me.

173
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,200
 Oh, but it couldn't be.

174
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,880
 What would Henry all be to doing up in all M3?

 [MUSIC PLAYING]

176
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:48,200
 Son?

177
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,720
 I just found the brown.

178
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,520
 They'll join us?

179
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,200
 Yes, dear.

180
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,960
 And Elizabeth had the same reaction I did, imagine going out

181
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,120
 to dinner for no reason whatsoever.

182
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:57,800
 Why not?

183
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,480
 Henry's having dinner at the furnaces.

184
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,560
 You deserve a day off.

185
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,160
 Why not?

186
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,200
 Yes, the same thing.

187
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,600
 I can't help being thrilled.

188
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,120
 What time do you tell the ground to me, to--

189
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,120
 Seven.

190
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,520
 And do you think you should call the mansion house

191
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,440
 for a reservation?

192
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,560
 No, well, we necessary.

193
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,600
 But suppose it's crowded.

194
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,320
 How if I'm positive it won't be?

195
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,920
 Besides, the head waiter knows me very well.

196
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,240
 I can always get a table.

197
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,000
 Boy, mother, look at my blue skirt suit.

198
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,520
 Mary, hunger, and gourish sweater right next to it.

199
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:26,800
 I'm sure we can clean it up clean it up. Well, could you do it now, mother?

200
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,720
 It's only five more hours until six thirty and I can't go looking like a bowl weevil

201
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:38,480
 Henry I don't like to seem over cautious, but I just like to have one more

202
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:42,280
 Are you absolutely searching you're invited to dinner at the fantasy?

203
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:45,400
 And he said he was positive. He's been positive before

204
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:50,800
 I told you what I saw with my own eyes when I just happened to be up in their own tree this morning

205
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,960
 She was with they be getting out their best kind of just things with each other

206
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,800
 I'll be right there Homer

207
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:06,840
 Lucky dog and they're lucky. Do you are why?

208
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:10,880
 It's that right here

209
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:16,800
 My folks are going out with your folks for dinner and they gave me a dollar and a half to blow in an any turn of dinner

210
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:22,520
 I was now kidding a whole dollar and a hand together with the corner. I guess they now be able to

211
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:29,480
 myself six. Oh, I am running a lucky joy. Well, mama, what do I tell you about me?

212
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:33,320
 And why don't you get some money from your parents and little stuff ourselves together?

213
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:38,880
 I'm just in home. I'm sort of invited out to dinner tonight. You're where?

214
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:44,840
 The Gladys Prennis is. No kidding. Sure. That's funny. I just delivered something here from the

215
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,840
 We're glad I see the link a little for the boxy little room.

216
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,840
 Homer, you think this blue-haired suit?

217
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:54,840
 Yeah, I'm even cleaning Mary's Angora off it. That's how sure I am.

218
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,840
 Yeah, you are a rucking dog.

219
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,840
 I don't think you better wear your blue-haired suit.

220
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,840
 Why not?

221
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,840
 Because the fur had your limit with all your hair.

222
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,840
 Evening, yeah?

223
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:05,840
 Sure.

224
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,840
 They told the truth, they had to have it for today.

225
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,840
 Tonight?

226
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,840
 Oh, boy.

227
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:11,840
 Hey, what's the matter?

228
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,840
 Oh, boy.

229
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,280
 Homer, you don't suppose that dinner is formal, do you?

230
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,320
 Little Pacito.

231
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,520
 Sure.

232
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,560
 And boy, my father didn't even think

233
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,760
 I was important not for good China.

 [MUSIC PLAYING]

235
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:33,680
 Dennis, would you let me up the back, please?

236
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,200
 Yes, mother.

237
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,040
 And look, why don't I do this?

238
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,960
 Why don't I call all the restaurants in town

239
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,200
 and see us heading with me to reservation?

240
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,360
 Here, that's very foolish.

241
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,160
 and I get all the way.

242
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:47,120
 Well, could we hold this a little bit more, Mother?

243
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,640
 You know, I think that cleanness grunks this gown.

244
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,160
 Mother, why don't we admire you down over that labor?

245
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,860
 I'm much too boned here.

246
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:56,200
 Oh, which reminds me?

247
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,280
 Your daughter and I've been discussing that evening,

248
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:02,200
 down Gladys, and, well, we think it might be wise

249
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,440
 to sew on a little lace around the shoulders.

250
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,200
 Mother, I'm not calling you.

251
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,400
 We realize that.

252
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,400
 (audience laughing)

253
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,000
 That's why we thought some lace would add a great deal.

254
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,400
 - But in my family, you know how easily you can't go.

255
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,760
 In a year or two, when you build up your resistance,

256
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:19,680
 we can take the light off and answer the phone.

257
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,240
 - Yes, ma'am.

258
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,240
 - Hello?

259
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,240
 - Oh, hi, glad I'm hearing you.

260
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,400
 - Hello, honey.

261
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,240
 - Lucky.

262
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,080
 - I have to say that sign here,

263
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,600
 not asking about sign up.

264
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,520
 - Bye, bye.

265
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,360
 - Hello?

266
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,200
 - Hello?

267
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,520
 - How are you?

268
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,080
 - Fine, how are you?

269
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,000
 - Fine.

270
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,600
 I'll see what's exciting, hold on.

271
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,160
 - You're asking you a 632, wanna?

272
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:47,280
 Oh, I'm glad it's yes, I just wanted to know I never look forward to a new move. I can't I could you hold on?

273
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:50,480
 Are you sure?

274
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:59,040
 Oh

275
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,040
 You know.

276
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,040
 And I am better.

277
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,040
 Of course you did.

278
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,040
 I mean, I'm so glad you called.

279
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,040
 You are?

280
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,040
 Well, the...

281
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,040
 The rule of glad is I'm sorry.

282
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,040
 Well, what you might call a problem about dinner tonight.

283
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,040
 Problem?

284
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:15,040
 I mean, nothing's going wrong with you, am I?

285
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,040
 No, things you're fine and I am.

286
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,040
 That's fine.

287
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,040
 How are they at yours?

288
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,040
 Fine.

289
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,040
 I mean, would you mind very much if I wore a maroon tie?

290
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,040
 I'm a maroon tie?

291
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:30,600
 in my tuxedo. She was somehow my black when things who have disappeared come point like

292
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,560
 tuxedo? You were a tuxedo tonight?

293
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,600
 Then you want me to?

294
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,400
 Well, yes, that's a good idea.

295
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:37,560
 Well...

296
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:41,240
 I'm gonna have to hurry and hang up, Mom. I think it's just say goodbye.

297
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,040
 Come on.

298
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:46,200
 Mother! Mother, you have to go on that late on my evening down right away!

 Let's cross over.

00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,600
 Glad it's lived on this block.

302
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:05,000
 Homer, in a formal dinner, which sport do you use first?

303
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,520
 They have a more than one.

304
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,800
 Of course.

305
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,400
 Well, I start at the end and work hard my place.

306
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,400
 And that makes sense.

307
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,000
 And hey, Lisa, if you were moving,

308
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 Did you get the business name special at the main sector in order to table the holder,

309
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 hamburger paradise?

310
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 Well, where would you want?

311
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 Well, I was concerned that it would be about like a good, solid bowl of soup.

312
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 But, in this, the rest would be heard.

313
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 I don't know.

314
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 Oh, and here I am with a dollar 7.05 and I'd only have to eat it up.

315
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 Can you make this out?

316
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 What is it?

317
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 A menu I picked up from the purple goo.

318
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 Does this at the bottom say all new foods are salad and potatoes or salad or potatoes?

319

 Why aren't they?

 Oh, we haven't got time to fool around here.

 Gladys is half along.

 Yeah, so is that our moonlit going over in South Abby's?

 Our moonlit?

 Wait a minute, here I go after I build up my resistance.

 So am I. Well, here's my hat.

339
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,880

 You don't think I should?

 You're... Boy, I sure am hungry.

 - Yeah. - Mmm, what's that I smell?

00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:50,080
 - Smells so good. - Smells so good.

 Mmm, sure smells good.

 About dinner, I mean.

 Why, why don't we have a start and eat yet, but they just serve the tomato juice.

 Staying in?

399
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:38,340
 I was real, this is the first room I've ever had

400
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:41,260
 a formal dinner with any born in private.

00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:45,540
 - I'm practically honest, this is the first time

403
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:47,500
 I've ever been invited out to dinner.

404
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,700
 - Is that a thought?

405
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,140

406
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,140
 Invited out.

407

 - Tell me what's wrong.

408
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,940
 - Why you thought you had to dinner, didn't you?

409
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:55,780
 - Why, yeah.

410
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:57,620
 You are.

411
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,380
 - Oh, I thought I might have missed anything.

412
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:07,380
 Goodness, this is going to be a night I'll never forget it will. I have a feeling it's gonna be one I'll never forget

413
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:21,780
 I'm getting back to the troubles of Henry Olmer. They carved his date with Gladys Kretz began at 6 30

414
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:28,180
 Henry jumped at the conclusion that he'd been invited to dinner. After a quick tomato juice cocktail however

415
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:32,180
 He learns that planet is expected to be taken out to dinner.

416
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:35,180
 The scene opens in the lobby of the Manchin house restaurant.

417
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:36,180
 It is dinner time.

418
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:37,180
 Now, take here.

419
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:38,180
 Sister Aldridge, you're raising your voice.

420
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:40,180
 I'm not raising it. Besides, I have ever right to.

421
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:43,180
 I've been coming here to the Manchin house regularly for 15 years now,

422
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:46,180
 and it is no time to tell me to have no cable.

423
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:49,180
 Naturally, I'm very sorry, sir, but you should have phoned for reservation.

424
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:51,180
 That's beside the voice. Let me speak to the headwaiter.

425
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:54,180
 I'm the headwaiter. I mean, the headwaiter was of all hands.

426
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:57,180
 He left six months ago. He couldn't have. But he did.

427
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:58,000
 But he did.

428
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,340
 Now, you're the one who's raising yours on.

429
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:01,700
 I'm sorry.

430
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,260
 You're all that I'm willing to give you a table.

431
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:04,700
 I'm anxious to.

432
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,300
 But it'll have to be one on the side of the room.

433
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,100
 But I can't sit behind those palms.

434
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,380
 I'm allergic to them.

435
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:11,500
 To palm, the last time we sat behind them,

436
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,860
 I sneeze from the fruit cup right through the strawberry

438
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:17,260
 You said they have to give us a table in the middle of the room.

439
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:18,460
 Very well, Mr. Olgich.

440
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:19,220
 Very well.

441
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:20,940
 But you'll have to wait at least 40 minutes.

442
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:21,780
 40 minutes?

443
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:22,340
 At least.

444
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:23,380
 Now, just a moment.

445
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:25,060
 The browns will be here any second,

446
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,140
 and they're counting on us.

447
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:27,060
 So it may be arranged.

448
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:28,060
 I'm sorry.

449
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,060
 Sorry.

450
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:32,060
 After we've been coming here for 50 years, all you can say is you're sorry.

451
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:33,060
 Alex, please.

 Hey, we're not really going to have dinner here in the morning.

00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:48,060
 We might.

456
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:53,060
 I mean, that depends on whether you happen to see my mother and father in the dining room.

457

 Good evening, sir.

 Just you.

459
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:56,060
 Could I speak to the head waiter?

460
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:59,840
 I'm afraid not he went home about an hour ago with a very severe headache

461
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:03,680
 Well, glad if you mind if I talk to the waiter for one second

 No, excuse me look waiter. Do you happen to know my mother and father?

 I'm not sure I've had a pleasure well

 They're eating here tonight. See I thought under the circumstance as they might like to have a join them and put everything on one

00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,740
 Oh, okay.

538
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,220
 Suppose I do this.

539
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:37,780
 I'll be a part of my money.

540
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:39,500
 Say 75 says.

541
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,340
 That's all?

542
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,740
 That's all I can afford.

543
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:44,100
 Stand back while I get out of my pocket.

544
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,900
 It's all in case.

545
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:46,740
 Here.

546
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:47,580
 $25.

547
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:48,580
 You can make it an even dollar.

548
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:49,580
 No.

549
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:50,420
 Just eat.

550
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:53,180
 But even their Swiss piece sandwiches started $45.

551
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:54,180
 I'm sorry.

00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:55,020
 I'm sorry.

 Oh, my thing.

555
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,580
 I'm going to stop grabbing.

 Look what you've done.

 What do you mean your money went down this grape?

 Every last day.

563
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:09,340
 Well, we better go down there again.

564
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:11,780
 In my cup of tea, though.

565

 That young man, the young lady, want us to know it.

566
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:15,860
 and I'm sorry for the all-out.

567
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:16,700
 Well, I'll tell you.

568
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,200
 What about my little?

569
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:21,700
 Well, look, Mr. Could you tell me where this grave leads to?

 The celeravirus.

 Homer, if I go down here and get your money,

572
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,100
 could I have a dollar?

573
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,580
 Hello, Mrs. Blackman.

574
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:29,180
 I'm afraid you can't go down there, young man.

575
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:30,220
 Why not?

576
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:32,140
 The cellar window's been bricked up for years.

577
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:32,940
 Why?

578
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,580

 - Now let's see.

582
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:49,220
 Wait up, I think I'll have Brussels sprouts with my gaff.

583
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:51,980
 - Yes, my Brussels sprouts so alive.

584

 Now wait a minute, huh?

585
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:56,020
 Let me run over that order again.

 Before you do that, waiter,

587
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:59,740
 could I have a little private talk with my friend?

588
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:00,620
 - Again, honey?

589
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:02,780
 - Well, guess the second, come on, Homer.

590
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:04,380
 - I'll take what I lay little with me.

591
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:05,740
 - Honey, I'm starving!

592
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:09,140
 Why don't you have a roll while we're waiting?

593
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:12,340
 Listen Homer, won't you please go home?

594
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:16,140
 No, you lost my dollar seven or five and the least you can do is see.

595
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:19,140
 But I told you I don't have a cent.

596
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:19,940
 So why?

597
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:21,740
 As long as you're not going to be able to pay.

00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:22,740
 What do you think is the making?

 Well, okay.

603
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,740
 Suppose I just have a Swiss T-cell.

 With whiskey

 I mean, but oh look Homer what whiskey just a lot of holes

 It's a bread that's really nourishing so they give you all the bread you want for nothing

 I want more than red to my dollar seven five sure you do Homer sure you do and you can have all that

 Except up and mustard in the morning. I thought this was my lucky day

 I already ordered for you, huh?

 That's dinner for three.

 I think I'd better have another little talk with you.
