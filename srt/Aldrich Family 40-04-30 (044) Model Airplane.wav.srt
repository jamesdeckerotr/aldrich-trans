 To the gallery of typical American boys such as Penrod, Tom Sawyer,

10
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:16,060
 Pec's bad boy. We have the name of Henry Aldrich.

11
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:19,100
 But now let's go out to the little town of Centerville.

12
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:22,460
 Our scene opens on the hillside on the outskirts of town.

13
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:26,460
 The model airplane race Henry and his father worked for weeks to win

14
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:30,940
 has just finished. Henry is talking to Mr. Collins, the reparee.

15
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:35,900
 Yes, but Mr. Collins, my plane was flying against the very strong headwind.

16
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,900
 But I made allowance for the headwind.

17
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,340
 You did? Yes, Henry.

18
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:43,500
 Mr. Collins, what kind of a watch did you time Henry's plane laugh?

19
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,100
 With their stopwatch.

20
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,300
 Is it a pretty good one?

21
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,420
 It is.

22
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:51,100
 Billy Walker's model covered the course in one half of the second lesson, Henry's.

23
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:53,140
 Now, buy my watch, Mr. Collins.

24
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:55,060
 Is yours a stopwatch, Dizzy?

25
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:58,220
 No, but it used to belong to my grandfather.

26
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:00,460
 Is your grandfather an official for this race?

27
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:05,500
 No, but he carried this watch for 35 years and nothing ever happened.

28
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,660
 Hey, she was look at us.

29
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,260
 Did it break, Dizzy?

30
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:11,260
 Henry, you're standing on the main spring.

31
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,260
 Oh, yeah.

32
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:13,060
 Excuse me.

33
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:15,460
 Here's the stand, too.

34
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:16,980
 Well, where did Mr. Collins go?

35
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,140
 He walked away.

36
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:19,900
 That's a swell thing for him to do.

37
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,500
 How do you want to make him pay for this watch?

38
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,620
 Mr. Collins, hey, Mr. Collins.

39
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:24,580
 Oh, wait a minute.

40
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:26,380
 I just went over and got these figures.

41
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,380
 What are they?

42
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:28,940
 Henry, when your plane was flying,

43
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:31,460
 the wind was blowing at 11 and 1/2 miles an hour.

44
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:32,820
 When Billy Walker's was flying,

45
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,860
 the wind was 4 and 1/2 miles an hour.

46
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,300
 So I naturally made an allowance of 6 miles an hour

47
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,340
 in Henry's favor.

48
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:41,600
 Well, Henry, does that sound right to you?

49
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:47,080
 As a matter of fact, isn't four and a half from 11 and a half seven?

50
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,480
 No sir.

51
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,320
 No, no, I guess six is right.

52
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,600
 Of course it is.

53
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,200
 Only it certainly looks like seven.

54
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,040
 And I could swear Henry's playing one faster.

55
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,320
 Some place there's been a big mistake.

56
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,320
 Well, it seems to be the trouble, Henry.

57
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:04,640
 Father, you and I lose the race by just half a second.

58
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,200
 And a half a second is a half a second.

59
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,200
 I know Mr. Collins, but that's all it is.

60
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,200
 Henry, may I speak with you?

61
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,200
 Where, Father?

62
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,200
 Right over here.

63
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,200
 You want to speak to me too, Miss Orange?

64
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,200
 No, thank you.

65
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,200
 What is it, Father?

66
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:22,200
 Henry, don't you think that as long as we lost the race, it would be better if we said nothing more about it?

67
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:26,200
 But Father, Disney's watch didn't register 16.5 seconds.

68
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,200
 Does his watch have half seconds on it?

69
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:32,200
 No, but up until a few minutes ago it always kept perfect time.

70
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:37,600
 Henry, I happened to be doing some business with Billy Walker's father, and it might be

71
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,240
 just as well if you didn't say anything more about it.

72
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:43,440
 But Dad, look at all the time we spent building that plane.

73
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,280
 After all, we did finish second.

74
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,280
 Sure.

75
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,080
 Henry, I want to tell you when your father's something.

76
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,440
 Sorry it is here, but I'd better go back to the office.

77
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,840
 But you'd be very much interested, Mr. Orange.

78
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,840
 Tell Henry.

79
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:57,480
 Henry, I knew all the time there was something, Fony.

80
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:01,520
 Henry wasn't every plane that was supposed to go in the race, be made by a father and

81
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,120
 The sun is your.

82
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,120
 Well, I'll bet you anything Billy walk on his father didn't make the yes.

83
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,320
 Well, where do you think they got it?

84
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,520
 I know where.

85
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,320
 I was just overlooking at it.

86
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:15,720
 And I remember seeing the very same thing down in Jones's Sporting Goods store.

87
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,720
 Oh, you're sure it is.

88
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,120
 There's only one thing about it that's different.

89
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,720
 Billy's is blowing the one up the store was red.

90
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,220
 Then it can't be the same plane, kind of.

91
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:25,920
 Now that's what you think.

92
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,720
 I scratched the little of the blue paint often.

93
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,720
 Right underneath was the red paint.

94
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,220
 Yeah, Henry, if you win it means a trip to the capital.

95
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,920
 Well, gee whiz, I don't care what my father says.

96
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,720
 I'm going down to Mr. Walker's office.

97
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,720
 Now, wait a second.

98
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,120
 Don't go rushing into this.

99
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,120
 Why not?

100
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,320
 I've got a book at home that'll tell you exactly what to do in a case like this.

101
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,320
 Well, what should we do?

102
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,520
 Well, before we come right out on the queue is anybody, we've got to get proof.

103
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,120
 That's the important thing, Henry.

104
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,120
 Naturally, Dizzy.

105
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,420
 Anybody knows that.

106
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:59,320
 Because you accuse somebody, doesn't mean he's guilty.

107
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,560
 You've got to get proof.

108
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,520
 I hope you don't think I didn't know that.

109
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,560
 Yeah, but you don't know as much about those things as I do, Henry.

110
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,200
 No, well, I know where I'm going.

111
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,240
 Well, follow me.

112
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,160
 When we bust this case open, it'll shock everybody.

113
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:12,720
 Sure.

114
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,120
 Especially my father.

115
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:18,120
 Yes, sir, when he hears of it, he'll be speechless.

116
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:29,720
 [Music]

117
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:33,160
 Henry, where are we going? Where are we going? Wait until I show you.

118
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:36,120
 Wouldn't it funny, Dizzy, when we were talking with Mr. Collins,

119
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,560
 I could have sworn four and a half from eleven and a half would leave seven.

120
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:45,240
 Same here. But I guess you've got to put it down on paper before you can believe it.

121
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:48,500
 Yeah, it must have been the fractions that threw us off.

122
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,380
 Didn't I tell you Henry, look in the window.

123
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:54,380
 Look, well, you mean here in Jones's Sporting Goods?

124
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:55,220
 Yeah.

125
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:58,020
 Well, that's the same identical plane the walkers had.

126
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:00,940
 Come on, now wait a second Henry, let's do this carefully.

127
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:02,700
 We're going to, we aren't going to rush into it.

128
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:05,620
 We'll just be casual.

129
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:06,940
 That's it.

130
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:10,060
 And all we'll do is make out, we want to buy something,

131
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,980
 and then we'll gradually lead up to the plane.

132
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:12,480
 Right.

133
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,480
 Come on then.

134
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,980
 (phone ringing)

135
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:17,580
 Well where is Mr. Jones?

136
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:18,860
 I guess he must be in the back.

137
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:20,300
 (phone ringing)

138
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,700
 When he comes out, don't mention why we're here.

139
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:23,900
 - Are you boys what?

140
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:24,740
 - Why you?

141
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:25,580
 - Why you?

142
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:28,180
 - We are, just the hope we'd look around Mr. Jones.

143
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,780
 - Had airplanes, is he?

144
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:32,300
 (audience laughing)

145
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,980
 - Did I say airplanes?

146
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:36,540
 What I meant was, that's the only thing

147
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:37,820
 we aren't interested in.

148
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:38,660
 - I say.

149
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:43,260
 - Mr. Jones, do you carry baseball bats?

150
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:45,020
 You're looking right at baseball bats.

151
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:47,220
 Am I? Oh yeah.

152
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:49,620
 Oh, maybe that's why I mentioned them.

153
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,500
 How much are they, Mr. Jones?

154
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,700
 Fifty cents up.

155
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:53,820
 Oh, yeah.

156
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:54,620
 Um...

157
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:56,500
 Well, how much are your tennis rackets?

158
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,860
 Dollar 95, huh?

159
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:59,780
 Oh, yeah. Well...

160
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,420
 How much are fish and tackle?

161
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,220
 Twenty-five dollars down.

162
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:04,900
 [Laughter]

163
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,180
 Oh, does he look at the airplane models?

164
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:08,260
 Oh, sure enough.

165
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:10,060
 I haven't seen those before.

166
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:10,940
 Which kind?

167
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,940
 I have a kind Mr. Walker board.

168
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:13,740
 I mean...

169
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,240
 That kind did he buy?

170
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,740
 Oh, did he buy one?

171
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:18,740
 Who?

172
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:21,440
 I thought you said Mr. Walker bought one.

173
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,440
 When did I make that statement?

174
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,540
 No, Dizzy, you misunderstood. What, Mr. Jones?

175
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,540
 No, just what did you boys come in here for?

176
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:33,340
 Well, Mr. Jones, would you mind if we should ask you something confidentially?

177
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:34,240
 What?

178
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,340
 Did Mr. Walker buy one of those planes you have in the window?

179
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,240
 Buy one?

180
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,540
 Not here, he didn't.

181
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:42,080
 I only stopped up at five and they're all right there.

182
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,940
 Are you sure you couldn't have miscounted them?

183
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,040
 Yes, sir.

184
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,080
 Why?

185
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,440
 Oh, nothing.

186
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,640
 Nothing.

187
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:51,880
 We were just asking out of sheer curiosity.

188
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,340
 - Visually. - Whoa.

189
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,140
 Look who's coming across the street.

190
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:58,240
 Well, she was busy. It's Mr. Walker.

191
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,840
 Well, Mr. Jones, I guess we better be going.

192
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,240
 [phone ringing]

193
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,440
 - Good afternoon, Jones. - Oh, hi, Walker.

194
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,740
 Hello, Mr. Walker.

195
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:08,440
 Sorry, my boy and I had to meet you today.

196
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:11,800
 Oh, we were glad to have you when I think I'll be going to see.

197
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,360
 I think I might as well, too.

198
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,880
 Oh, Walker, maybe you can answer a question for these boys.

199
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:19,240
 Oh, that's all right, Mr. Jones. Don't bother him about it.

200
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,040
 What was the question?

201
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:25,040
 Well, I can assure you, Mr. Jones, I don't know how the question even came up.

202
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:29,440
 No, Walker. Henry and his buddy thought you bought an airplane here.

203
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,560
 You mean the plane Billy and I won the race with?

204
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,120
 Oh, no, Mr. Walker.

205
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,880
 Well, what plane did you mean?

206
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,880
 Well, not any Mr. Walker. Henry's just confused.

207
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,880
 Oh, well, I'm relieved to hear that.

208
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,880
 I'll be seeing Henry's father down at his office in just a few minutes.

209
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,880
 Hello, Henry.

210
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,880
 Hi, your fellas.

211
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,880
 I just saw your father, Henry.

212
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,880
 You did?

213
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,880
 Mr. Collins was talking to him.

214
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:54,880
 Well, Mr. Collins was quite mad about something.

215
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,880
 About what?

216
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:56,880
 I'm leaving, Dizzy.

217
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,880
 Oh, well, so am I.

218
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,880
 Goodbye, Mr. Walker.

219
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,880
 Goodbye.

220
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,880
 She was dizzy now, look at what you've done.

221
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,980
 Well, I at least tried, didn't I?

222
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:08,780
 Didn't I tell you my father doesn't want to upset Mr. Walker?

223
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:09,880
 You never mentioned that.

224
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,380
 Well, you should have known anyhow.

225
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:14,280
 All we did was practically accuse him of cheating.

226
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,380
 That's Henry.

227
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:16,080
 What?

228
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,280
 Never mind about your father. Here comes mine.

229
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,180
 I told you.

230
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:19,680
 Good.

231
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,880
 I hope the first thing he asks is where your watch is.

232
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,080
 That's friendship.

233
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,580
 I try to help you win the race and what thanks do I get?

234
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:29,180
 Family, wait for me!

235
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:30,380
 What is Phyllis want?

236
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:31,880
 What do you think?

237
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:35,580
 I just heard Mr. Jones say to Mr. Walker back in the store.

238
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:36,080
 Why?

239
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,580
 They looked at each other very suspiciously.

240
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:43,380
 And Mr. Walker said, "Where do you suppose those boys got that idea?"

241
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:44,580
 He did, fell asleep.

242
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:45,580
 Yeah.

243
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,180
 Do you see that, Harry?

244
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:48,380
 And now, and now do you see?

245
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:49,380
 I haven't helped you.

246
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,380
 Well, it's a...

247
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:51,380
 I don't know.

248
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:53,380
 Did he say anything else, fell asleep?

249
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:57,880
 Mr. Jones said, "Well, I guess we spiked that."

250
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,380
 Oh, he did, eh?

251
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:00,580
 Is that important?

252
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:03,380
 Is it important to us? Is it important?

253
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:06,180
 Well, I gotta go, Henry. I'll see you later!

254
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:09,080
 See, with Henry, all we gotta do now is to go through with it.

255
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,180
 Don't you think so, dude?

256
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:12,280
 I've got a fingerprint out for it at home,

257
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:15,380
 and I always knew that someday it would come in handy.

258
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:19,480
 We'll find out whether that plane and Billy Walker's did come from the store.

259
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:22,080
 Sure, all we have to do is get Mr. Jones's fingerprint.

260
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,180
 And then Mr. Walker's.

261
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:27,580
 Only maybe we ought to be careful about taking Mr. Walker's.

262
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:29,380
 He won't even know we're doing it.

263
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:34,620
 And listen, Henry, we want to be really systematic and get everybody's print in town.

264
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:35,620
 Everybody?

265
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:37,940
 Do you realize how big this town is?

266
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:39,860
 But, Henry, look what they do in Washington.

267
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:42,100
 They don't get a few, they get millions!

268
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:46,020
 Well, I guess maybe if they can do that in Washington, we can handle this town.

269
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:46,580
 Come on.

270
00:10:46,580 --> 00:11:04,700
 Well, here it is, friends, the sixth week of spring.

271
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:07,780
 Spring, spring, glorious spring.

272
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:13,340
 When a young man's fancy lightly turns to parts of, well, you know the rest of that saying,

273
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:18,580
 But now that we mention it, just how true is that old saying about a young man's fancy?

274
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,580
 Suppose we see if we can't find out.

275
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,660
 Let's ask some young man for his opinion.

276
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:23,660
 Listen.

277
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:25,220
 Yes, the statement is perfectly true.

278
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:29,420
 In the spring my fancy certainly does turn to thoughts of Jell-O vanilla pudding.

279
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,420
 Oh.

280
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:34,140
 In fact, I can guide more Jell-O vanilla pudding in the spring than in any other season of

281
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,140
 the year.

282
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:37,460
 Except of course winter, summer and fall.

283
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:38,460
 Yes.

284
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:43,060
 Well, that, ladies and gentlemen, is an observation that everybody will be glad to echo.

285
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:47,580
 Just about everyone who has ever tasted it agrees that Jello vanilla pudding is a mighty

286
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,380
 swell dessert.

287
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:55,300
 Jello vanilla pudding has a gloriously smooth texture, as smooth as golden rich cream.

288
00:11:55,300 --> 00:12:00,380
 And the flavor of Jello vanilla pudding, well, it's simply irresistible, a grand vanilla

289
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:04,140
 flavor that hits a new high for luscious delicate goodness.

290
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:08,380
 So try this tempting treat just as soon as you can, and find out the truth of another

291
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:11,100
 popular saying which goes like this.

292
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,740
 Then there's Jello the Nilla Pudding for dessert.

293
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:16,500
 The thing you think of first is second.

294
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:30,720
 (

295
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:35,800
 been cheated out of first place in an airplane model contest and is trying his best to prove

296
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,800
 it.

297
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,800
 The time is evening.

298
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,760
 The scene opens in Henry's room.

299
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:45,960
 It's a funny thing, Henry, how my grandfather was able to carry this watch for 35 years

300
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,080
 and I drop it at the end of a week.

301
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,680
 Listen, does he put that away?

302
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,920
 How we got work to do?

303
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,880
 I've got to get it all back together.

304
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,240
 I've got it all back together except for these two wheels and if I don't find out where they

305
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,520
 go, my father will kill me.

306
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,520
 He will, huh?

307
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:02,520
 But we're coming the most crucial part of our job.

308
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,520
 Here we are.

309
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:06,520
 We've got fingerprint powder and fingerprint ink.

310
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:09,520
 Henry, aren't your folks having some guests here tonight?

311
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:13,520
 Well, I don't think we ought to take their fingerprints, does he?

312
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,520
 Listen, I thought you weren't going to show favor, Ted.

313
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,520
 Yeah, I know, Dizzy, but they're dead.

314
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:19,520
 All right, then. We just as well not stop this.

315
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:22,520
 Well, can this fingerprint ink do any damage?

316
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,520
 How could it?

317
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,520
 But supposing it should get on something.

318
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,520
 It comes right out.

319
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,520
 Listen, here are the instructions for washing.

320
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:35,520
 washing. It says, "Easy method for removing. No worry need because by damage.

321
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:41,520
 Merely dip and kerosene rinse and wash with strong abrasive."

322
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,520
 [laughter]

323
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:48,520
 If first results are not satisfactory, add lemon juice and rub harder.

324
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,520
 [laughter]

325
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,520
 Well, gee, there isn't anything to worry about there.

326
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:56,520
 Of course there isn't. The only thing is, is when you shake hands with a person,

327
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:00,000
 person, I should think they'd feel the ink pad in your hand.

328
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,160
 Do you think they would?

329
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,160
 Why not?

330
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,160
 What would they think it was?

331
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,160
 Almost anything.

332
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,160
 For what?

333
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:10,000
 Name me one other thing that feels like a pad of ink.

334
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,760
 Alright, how would this be?

335
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,720
 Look, just rub a little ink on the palms of our hands.

336
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,720
 That might work.

337
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,760
 Sure, look, I've got some on already.

338
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:21,600
 Now watch, when I hold my hand down here at my side, do you notice it?

339
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,600
 No.

340
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,080
 Guys, I think I'll put a little on.

341
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:28,640
 hurry up so he can be downstairs when the guests begin to come. Okay, I'm all fixed.

342
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:33,280
 Now wait a second. Wait a second. Have you got a handkerchief? Or four?

343
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:40,160
 I've got... I've got one. You're your own. My watch has dropped up in it.

344
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,920
 Oh my god! Here. Take mine here.

345
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:48,640
 Never mind. I haven't got that anymore.

346
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,760
 Come on downstairs.

347
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:58,000
 When we go into the living room, you let me shake hands with your mother and father.

348
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,680
 Why can't I have one of them?

349
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,480
 Why should you, their son, step up and shake hands with them?

350
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,320
 Do you want to give the whole thing away?

351
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,240
 Well, I get the first two guests then.

352
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,040
 Yeah.

353
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,720
 And when I get the ink on your mother and father, watch them carefully.

354
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,320
 The minute they touch something,

355
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,880
 Sockle, we've got them.

356
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,640
 You don't think my mother or father brought that plane, do you?

357
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,360
 No, but you never can tell someday they might be wanted for something.

358
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,360
 Henry!

359
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,360
 Yes, mother?

360
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,360
 Are you out in the hole?

361
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,360
 We're just coming into the living room.

362
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,360
 You mustn't stay down here long.

363
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,360
 Oh, we want, Mother.

364
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,360
 How good evening, Mr. Aldridge.

365
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,360
 Good evening.

366
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,360
 Wouldn't you like the shake hands with me?

367
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,360
 Shake hands?

368
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,360
 Weren't you here with us for dinner?

369
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,360
 Yeah, but I just came downstairs again.

370
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:43,360
 I don't think it's necessary to shake hands.

371
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,360
 Henry, could you hand me my pipe, please?

372
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,360
 Oh, hand it to him, Henry.

373
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,360
 Let me hand it to him, dizzy.

374
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,360
 them dizzy.

375
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,600
 Please, Henry, please, damn, I'll hand it to you.

376
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,480
 Aw, thank you, Alice.

377
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,920
 Mrs. Orridge, wouldn't you like to shake hands with me?

378
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,120
 No, thank you, dizzy.

379
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,640
 Well, you boys sit down before one of your knocks

380
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,560
 something over.

381
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,000
 I think I will.

382
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 I guess I will, too.

383
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,400
 Henry, yes, mother.

384
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,320
 I don't like to seem rude, but we are expecting gifts.

385
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,600
 Well, couldn't we stay down here just until they've arrived,

386
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,120
 mother?

387
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,600
 Why do you want to do that?

388
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,000
 Well, don't you think it'd be nice for us to help greet them?

389
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,160
 Henry, I do, as your mother asks.

390
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,760
 Well, in that case, I think I'll be going home.

391
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:19,920
 Oh, must you go?

392
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,660
 I think I will.

393
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:25,660
 Do you like the shake hands now that I'm leaving the door?

394
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:28,100
 I don't think it will be necessary.

395
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:30,940
 I may not be seeing you again right away.

396
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:31,900
 No.

397
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:34,700
 Then the least you can do is shake hands with the boy.

398
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:38,900
 Well, if it'll make him any happier, here is shake hands.

399
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,500
 Goodbye, Mr. Orbridge.

400
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,700
 Goodbye.

401
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,900
 Would you like the shake hands too, Mrs. Orbridge?

402
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:47,200
 I'm sorry, but I've got to go out to the kitchen.

403
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,100
 I'll go to the door with you, dizzy.

404
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,100
 You know, I think I changed my mind, Henry.

405
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:53,340
 I made that call home after all.

406
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:54,740
 Just one minute, boys.

407
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:56,140
 Nothing you wanted, Father.

408
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,300
 Dizzy, what's this I have on my hand?

409
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,140
 Why, uh--

410
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:00,060
 This black ink.

411
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,260
 Why?

412
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:04,660
 Well, how-- how do you suppose that could have gotten there?

413
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:06,580
 May I see your hand?

414
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:08,180
 My left hand?

415
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:10,380
 Your right hand.

416
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:13,140
 Well, what do you know about that?

417
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:15,340
 You suppose I could have gotten that from you?

418
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:19,640
 And then, may I see your hand?

419
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,140
 Were you talking to me, Father?

420
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,740
 May I see it, please?

421
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:26,340
 Well, will you look at that?

422
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:32,340
 If I were you, I would go upstairs and wash my hand.

423
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:34,840
 Yes, Mr. Orr, that's the least we can do.

424
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:37,840
 I agree, and please do not come back down while the guests are here.

425
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,140
 But, Father, we've got to.

426
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:39,740
 What for?

427
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:41,340
 We've got to get there, fingerprint.

428
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:44,140
 You're not going to the wedding such thing!

429
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:46,140
 No, Mr. Alderman?

430
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:48,140
 No. Come on, Dizzy.

431
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:50,140
 Now I've got to go out to the kitchen and wash my hair.

432
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:54,140
 You know, Dizzy, I had a feeling all the time we shouldn't be doing this.

433
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:58,140
 That's only part of the trouble. There's something you don't even know anything about.

434
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,140
 What?

435
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:04,140
 Well, when I came in the front door this evening, I put some ink on the doorknob.

436
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:06,140
 On the outside?

437
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:08,140
 On both sides.

438
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:10,140
 Gee whiz, Dizzy!

439
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:16,680
 I did it so we'd be sure to get everybody. We've got to wipe it off if we do and we won't have Prince of anybody but our own

440
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:23,220
 Yeah, and one minute mother I hope we won't have to tell Disney father and mother when they come

441
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:30,380
 When who comes your mother and father and we we've got a white that door knob off. Give me a handkerchief

442
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:35,500
 Yes, father. We're just going to open the front door. You will please go upstairs

443
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:38,500
 Yes, but father a mistake has been made.

444
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:41,500
 - Please, Mark. - Mr. Orange, can I tell you?

445
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,500
 Both of you go up those stairs.

446
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:46,500
 Yes, father. What do you think we should do in a case like this?

447
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,500
 Well, hello there, Frank Stevens.

448
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,500
 Oh, so you decided to let us in.

449
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,500
 Hello there, Molly. Hello, Alice.

450
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,500
 Well, what do you have there, Frank? Brand new hat?

451
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,500
 Spring has struck the Stevens.

452
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:03,500
 This color is what is known as Dove Grey.

453
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,200
 That suit he has on is new too.

454
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:10,840
 Molly, just because you don't like checks, say,

455
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,840
 how'd that smudge get on my ass?

456
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:13,840
 [LAUGHTER]

457
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,140
 Oh, Frank, even.

458
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:19,040
 You suppose they sold it to me that way?

459
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,940
 I told you all the time the car needed washing.

460
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:24,040
 That isn't off the car.

461
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:27,120
 If those smudges were on your new suit, I wouldn't mind.

462
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,480
 Well, may I take your hat, Frank?

463
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,680
 You may.

464
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:33,120
 Well, well, that seems to be a smudge on the crown, too.

465
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,280
 Yeah, they can under look like a tweed calf.

466
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:41,220
 Put it down, Sam. You probably didn't wash your hands clean.

467
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:43,780
 I washed them perfectly clean, Alice. Look at them.

468
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:45,800
 Yes, look at them.

469
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,100
 They're old.

470
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,900
 Well, I certainly thought I washed.

471
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:51,800
 Frank, let me turn your coat collar down.

472
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,300
 How did that get up?

473
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,360
 My goodness, yes, there.

474
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,680
 Frank, there's a smudge on your collar, too.

475
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,680
 Well, I didn't put it there.

476
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:04,040
 Well, all you just stand back from me.

477
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:11,960
 Until I came into this house, I was the best dressed man in town.

478
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,440
 Molly, maybe you'd better hang this hat up.

479
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:17,160
 I can't take it right now, Sam. I'm going to part of my nose.

480
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,440
 You want a mirror, Molly?

481
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,480
 No, thank you.

482
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,480
 She knows where her nose is.

483
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:26,120
 Don't say Molly, would you mind looking in the mirror?

484
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,560
 What's the matter with me?

485
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,040
 Never mind, just look in the mirror.

486
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,640
 Oh! Oh!

487
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:34,440
 That's where all those smudges have been coming from.

488
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:38,040
 Oh, upstairs and watch. And Sam, you go out in the kitchen.

489
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:41,640
 Uh... do you have one more place?

490
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,640
 Henry!

491
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,640
 Sam, what do you want Henry for?

492
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,640
 Never mind. I'm going upstairs.

493
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,640
 Henry Olrich.

494
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,640
 Yes, Father.

495
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,640
 Will you and Dizzy please come here?

496
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,640
 Has something gone wrong, Father?

497
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,640
 Something else.

498
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:58,640
 Of what nature, Mr. Olrich?

499
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,640
 Did either of you boys put ink around his house?

500
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,640
 On the front door, Nob?

501
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,640
 Yes.

502
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,640
 Well, the fact is, Father...

503
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,640
 What is all this fingerprinting nonsense?

504
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,640
 That's what we tried to tell you. We didn't do it as a joke.

505
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,640
 We're trying to prove Mr. Walker is guilty.

506
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,640
 Didn't I tell you to forget Mr. Walker?

507
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:17,640
 But he wasn't fair. Tell him about what we have in your room, Henry.

508
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:22,640
 Yeah, sure. We've got a cardboard box we found in the Walker trash barrel.

509
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,640
 And it's the box there airplane came in.

510
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,640
 And, Rick, I want you to go straight to bed.

511
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,640
 Yes, father.

512
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,640
 Where do you want me to go, my friend?

513
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:34,640
 (audience laughing)

514
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,640
 - I'm not here. - You did, indeed.

515
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,640
 May go downstairs and take a look at your father's hat.

516
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,640
 - Are there something to Prince, Anna?

517
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,640
 - There are.

518
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,640
 Do I hear Basil's voice over there?

519
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,640
 (audience laughing)

520
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,640
 - I'm coming right down, father.

521
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,640
 - Do you know anything about this?

522
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,640
 Well, I... it's this way. I...

523
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,640
 What's the matter with you?

524
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,640
 I'm going to sleep.

525
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,640
 I'm going to sleep.

526
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,640
 Away from here.

527
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,640
 It's right here.

528
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,640
 I'm... I'm...

529
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,640
 I'm here!

530
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:15,640
 Basil, look at your grandfather's watch.

531
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:18,640
 Father, could I please come down?

532
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,640
 I'll see you at breakfast.

533
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,640
 Sam, quick!

534
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,640
 What's the matter?

535
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,640
 The gift is at the front door!

536
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:37,640
 [Music]

537
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,640
 Henry!

538
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,640
 Yes, Mother?

539
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,640
 Will you please come to your breakfast?

540
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,640
 I'm on the telephone, Mother.

541
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,640
 Hello, Mr. Stevens.

542
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:48,640
 Yeah, I just started to give you the directions.

543
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,640
 Dip your hat and carasines, say.

544
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:57,240
 Yeah, and if that doesn't work, do you have any lemons in the house?

545
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,240
 Yes, sir.

546
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,040
 Just straight lemon juice.

547
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:04,840
 And then I think you'll find everything will come right out of your hat.

548
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:05,840
 Yes, sir.

549
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,960
 How's Dizzy this morning?

550
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,960
 Is that right?

551
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,120
 Is that right?

552
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,120
 [laughter]

553
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,120
 Mm.

554
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:18,600
 I won't be seeing him until the end of the week.

555
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,600
 [laughter]

556
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,600
 Huh!

557
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,600
 [laughter]

558
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,600
 Goodbye, Mr. Stevens.

559
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,600
 Oh, Henry, may I talk with you?

560
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,600
 I haven't eaten my breakfast yet, Father.

561
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:31,600
 I'd like to see you now before I leave for the office.

562
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,600
 Yes, Father.

563
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,600
 Sit down on this over here.

564
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,600
 Yes, Father.

565
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:43,600
 Did I ask you yesterday not to go around trying to prove that Mr. Walker and his son did not honestly win that race?

566
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,600
 Yes, but that was before we knew everything, Father.

567
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:51,300
 Finding an empty cardboard box is hard as efficient evidence to prove someone has been cheating.

568
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:54,600
 But don't you see, you and I are being chipped out of a trip to the Capitol.

569
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:58,800
 The fact still remains. I asked you not to do anything more about it.

570
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,600
 For why, Father? Why?

571
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:04,900
 May cause Henry. Mr. Walker did buy that plane.

572
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,400
 - He did? - Yes.

573
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,700
 I knew all the time he cheated us. Who told you?

574
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:12,700
 Mr. Walker told me, and he came over to my office yesterday.

575
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:16,000
 She was... Then we did get first prize. We can go after all.

576
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:21,600
 Henry. Henry, did you know that some weeks ago Billy Walker was taken ill?

577
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,400
 Yes, but far that was way back in February.

578
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:29,300
 Did you know that Althonon for nearly two months, the boy lay in bed with a high fever?

579
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:34,600
 He wasn't sick the day of the race though. I know he wasn't. I saw him walking around with my own eyes.

580
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:41,400
 That's the point, son. What finally broke Billy's fever was the announcement in the center of their times of that airplane race.

581
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,840
 How could that break it?

582
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:46,780
 From the time he went to bed, it was the first and only thing he took any interest in.

583
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:49,540
 He certainly couldn't have wanted to go into it any more than I did.

584
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:51,140
 Now wait, son, wait.

585
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:57,280
 The doctor told Mr. Walker it was absolutely imperative for Bill to have a plane and go into the race.

586
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,980
 That's the reason.

587
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:02,340
 And that's the only reason Mr. Walker went out and bought the plane.

588
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:05,300
 I know, father, but gee, we'll look at it this way.

589
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:08,300
 I'm going to leave it entirely up to you.

590
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,820
 You may do anything about it you care to.

591
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:14,620
 You mean to say that Billy's going to take that trip to the capital when he knows he cheated?

592
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:16,620
 He doesn't know he cheated.

593
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:23,220
 Aside from you and my son, there are only two people in this town who know that plane wasn't built in Walker's basement.

594
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:24,220
 Who are they?

595
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:27,820
 One is Billy's father and the other is Mr. Jones.

596
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:30,420
 I knew all the time Mr. Jones was lying.

597
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:33,820
 And he humiliated me right in front of Mr. Walker.

598
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:37,220
 Henry, are you in the house there?

599
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:38,820
 Is that you, Dizzy?

600
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:42,260
 Excuse me for coming right in, but I've got some great news for you.

601
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:43,220
 Good morning, Dizzy.

602
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:44,820
 Good morning, Mr. Orange.

603
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:47,460
 I shouldn't be here, but I've got to tell Henry.

604
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:50,340
 Listen, I was lying in bed this morning,

605
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:51,820
 and I got the subtracting.

606
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:53,900
 Subtracting what?

607
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:56,140
 Those figures are Mr. Collins.

608
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:59,180
 When you take four and a half from eleven and a half,

609
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:01,100
 you don't get six.

610
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:01,740
 No?

611
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:03,740
 You get seven.

612
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:05,460
 Billy Walker didn't win that race.

613
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:08,060
 You won it by more than a second.

614
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:11,060
 Yeah? Sure! It's as clear as anything.

615
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:14,060
 The only thing is, Dizzy.

616
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:21,060
 When you subtract 4 1/2 from 11 1/2, you do get sex.

617
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:23,060
 No! Sure you do.

618
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:26,060
 You do? Of course.

619
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:30,060
 Well, I'll be done, Henry. I guess you're right.

620
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:33,060
 Sure. Sure, I couldn't have won the race.

621
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:35,060
 Isn't that right, Father?

622
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:41,060
 or once Henry, your mathematics are absolutely correct.

623
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:43,640
 (lively music)

624
00:26:43,640 --> 00:27:01,740
 Ladies and gentlemen, is there a swell, tasty dessert in the house?

625
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:05,940
 The answer is yes when you've got a package of jello chocolate pudding on the pantry shelf.

626
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:10,860
 There's no doubt about it, with jello chocolate pudding for dessert, you're all fixed for

627
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:12,360
 a feast.

628
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:16,380
 Because this grand pudding has a flavor that's really and truly delicious.

629
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:20,900
 And with the first dip of the spoon, you'll know you're in for a lot of keen enjoyment.

630
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:25,980
 Jello chocolate pudding is full of rich, chocolatey goodness, a pleasing mellow flavor that spells

631
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:26,980
 real satisfaction.

632
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:33,380
 It's a creamy, smooth dessert, unsurpassed for topping off a meal in top-notch style.

633
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:37,960
 And you'll find that Jello Chocolate Pudding is both easy and inexpensive to serve.

634
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:42,640
 So tomorrow night for dinner, delight the family with this tempting chocolate treat.

635
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:47,640
 There's a world of delicious pleasure already in waiting for you in Jello Chocolate Pudding.

638
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:29,640
 Henry, I can't begin to tell you how pleased I was with you this morning.

639
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,640
 Thank you, Father.

640
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,640
 Oh, do we have any steel wool in the house?

641
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,640
 What do you want it for?

642
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,640
 I'm going over and help Dizzy clean his father's hat.

643
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:52,640
 Well, if there is anything left of Mr. Stevens' hat

644
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:56,640
 happens at when Henry and Disney get through with it, I'll eat mine.

645
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,640
 The Aldrich family starring as the stone is written by Clifford Goldsmith.

 Original music is composed and conducted by Jack Miller.

647
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:08,640
 This is Harry Bonsell speaking and wishing you a good night for Jell-O Pudding.
