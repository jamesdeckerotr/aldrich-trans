 [Music]

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,500
 Henry! Henry Oldrich!

3
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,000
 Coming, Mother!

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,500
 The Oldrich family, a special rebroadcast for you soldiers, sailors, and Marines of the United Nations.

 [Music]

6
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:48,500
 And now for the Aldrich family with Dick Jones as Henry and Jackie Kalk as Homer.

7
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:54,500
 No one can ever predict what a teenage boy like Henry Aldrich will do next.

8
00:00:54,500 --> 00:01:01,500
 The best you can do if you're a grown-up is to say that he'll do the sort of things you did when you were young.

9
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:06,500
 The scene opens in the Aldrich living room. The time is Sunday morning.

10
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,500
 Mary! Mary, I want you to run upstairs right this minute.

11
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,500
 Yes, mother. My goodness, what for?

12
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,500
 And get me a clean handkerchief.

13
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,500
 And Henry?

14
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,500
 Yes, mother. I'm already to start.

15
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:18,500
 No, you're not there. You haven't even combed your hair.

16
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:22,500
 Mother, I have combed my hair. I give you my word. I've combed my hair.

17
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:29,500
 Dear, you've combed it only in front. Remember the kilmas are going to be sitting in the pure right behind us, and you know how the kilmas talk.

18
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,500
 About my hair?

19
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,500
 Well, look, Mother. I've got a rubber band right here in my hand.

20
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:39,500
 How about my wearing that on my head until we get about a block from the church and then taking it all?

21
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:44,300
 Now dear, if you can't be honest about combing your hair, especially when it's for church,

22
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:46,300
 then I'd rather you didn't go with me.

23
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:48,060
 Yes, mother, I'll go up and comb it.

24
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:49,460
 Here, mother, here's your handkerchief.

25
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:51,060
 That's what you want me to get, isn't it?

26
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,940
 Thank you, dear. Thank you very much.

27
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:54,100
 And did you bring my gloves?

28
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,700
 Mother, you didn't tell me to.

29
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:58,900
 Well, I certainly took it for granted you knew I'd wear them.

30
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:01,180
 And Mary, look at your shoes.

31
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:03,100
 Here you are, I'm going to wear those, are you?

32
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,100
 Why not?

33
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,100
 To church?

34
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,100
 Shoes like that?

35
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,100
 I wore them last time we went.

36
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:09,220
 Well, I certainly didn't know it.

37
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:13,560
 if I had I wouldn't have been comfortable one minute of the entire service.

38
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,220
 Now please go upstairs and put on a sensible pair of shoes with toes in my mouth.

39
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,220
 Yes mother.

40
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:20,920
 And bring down my gloves and on top of my bureau.

41
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:21,520
 I think.

42
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,820
 They're on your bureau?

43
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:23,820
 Yes dear.

44
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:27,520
 Oh you might look and see if I left them on the foot of my bed as I went by.

45
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,420
 Mother.

46
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:30,520
 Yes Henry is that you calling me?

47
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,720
 Is it all right if I borrow Mary's co-hosts?

48
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,420
 Henry, all this don't you dare use my co-hosts.

49
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:38,420
 Mary is that any attitude to take just before church?

50
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:39,140
 Alice!

51
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:40,060
 Yes, Sam!

52
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,020
 Why isn't everyone ready to go?

53
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:44,780
 We are ready, Sam. We're really just waiting for you.

54
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:45,780
 You're waiting for me?

55
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:46,760
 Well, I'm all ready.

56
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:47,820
 Come on, let's not be late.

57
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:48,860
 Now, Sam.

58
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:49,620
 What's the matter?

59
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,660
 You aren't going to wear that tie, are you?

60
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,920
 This tie? What's the matter with this tie?

61
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,540
 Now, dear, you know very well you're to take up the collection this morning.

62
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:02,900
 I certainly don't want you walking down the aisle with everyone looking at nothing but your necktie and Mary's toes.

63
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:07,100
 Mother, what was it you said I should look for on the foot of somebody's bed?

64
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,180
 And my necktie!

65
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,340
 I mean your father's shoe.

66
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:12,940
 My gloves, dear, and please hurry up.

67
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:14,640
 That is why I worry about your gloves.

68
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,140
 Come on, let's get started.

69
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:19,500
 Sam, I could no more walk into that church and bare hands

70
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,040
 than I could--

71
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,640
 do you think I want to enjoy the service?

72
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,740
 Now, please go change your neck size.

73
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:26,440
 Oh, well.

74
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,840
 I know like my hair, mother.

75
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,140
 Hey, it looks fine.

76
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:32,040
 Now, dear, why can't you comb your hair that way every day

77
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,040
 and not just--

78
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,240
 dear, didn't I ask you to shine your shoes?

79
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,040
 Sure, mother, and I did.

80
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,920
 Look at the shoe polish on this one finger that wouldn't come off.

81
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:44,420
 Well, you may have some on your finger, but you don't have any on your shoes.

82
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:47,380
 And Henry, don't try to shine them on the back of your trouser leg.

83
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:48,920
 But it's a dark, loose suit, Mother.

84
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,620
 And a brand-new suit.

85
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:53,800
 I want you to march right out to the kitchen and finish shining them

86
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,200
 while your father is putting on a respectable tie.

87
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:56,700
 Yes, Mother.

88
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,000
 Only don't do anything in that good coat.

89
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,900
 Hang it on the back of his chair before you go out there.

90
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,800
 Sure, that's a very good idea, Mother.

91
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,760
 - And Mary... - I'm coming, Mother.

92
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,640
 Here's your Bible.

93
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,900
 Who do you think I found it?

94
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,300
 Thank you, dear. Only where are my white gloves?

95
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:12,800
 I can't find them, mother. Do you have to have them?

96
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:18,000
 Now, Mary, I certainly hope you don't think I want to sit through the whole service with my hands on my mind.

97
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,800
 Alice!

98
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,800
 Are you, Sam?

99
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,100
 Have you seen my gray stripe tie?

100
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,500
 Your gray stripe one?

101
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,500
 Or if you can't find it, dear, why don't you wear your black one?

102
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,600
 My black one? A black tie to take off a collection, Ed?

103
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,000
 Did you look on your neck tie, red collar?

104
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,800
 I did. No, I could find there was a pair of ladies' gloves.

105
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,720
 - You're glad, on your tie rack?

106
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,300
 Oh yes, then you'll find your great tie

107
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,280
 on the towel rack in the bathroom.

108
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,480
 - What you doing there?

109
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,000
 - It's hard to explain, Sam.

110
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,680
 Only please hurry, or we'll be late when we walk in

111
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,200
 and everyone will look at us that much more.

112
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,680
 - Hello everybody.

113
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,000
 (audience laughing)

114
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,200
 - Toma Brown, what are you doing over here?

115
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,720
 - My mother made me brush my suit three times

116
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,400
 and I got sick of it.

117
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,920
 - Do you mind if I sit with you in church?

118
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,680
 Oh, we'd love to have you.

119
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:10,600
 Only, wouldn't your mother and father like to have you sit with them?

120
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,260
 My father isn't going.

121
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:15,480
 It's his only chance to work on his income tax.

122
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:18,080
 And doesn't that mean your mother has to sit alone?

123
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,260
 No, that's what I'm explaining to you.

124
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:24,280
 She's sitting with my aunt and uncle and three cousins and my grandmother.

125
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:29,640
 And when you get that many in our pool along with all our coats and hymn books, my feet go to sleep.

126
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,880
 Oh, is that you, Officer?

127
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:35,720
 You're all Henry Henry have you finished polishing your shoes?

128
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:40,720
 Well I was just going to tell you my all I can find is the brown poly

129
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,720
 Oh dear sometimes I get so discouraged Mary go out and help your brother find the black

130
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,600
 Polish yes mother apparently Henry has learned anything unless 12 people have a

131
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,200
 doing

132
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,200
 Now what Sam you have any change

133
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,720
 Handy that I can get Henry and Mary no dear don't you have any

134
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,000
 all I have is some dollar bills you mean to say they'll have to

135
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 That is now Sam

136
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,280
 My goodness with my pocketbook. I don't get excited. It's right there on the piano here. It is mr.

137
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:12,800
 So old which here I'll get it for you Homer. What are you doing here? We're all going to church together, mr.

138
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,520
 Oldrich. Oh

139
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:18,640
 Well, Sam is some change put some up it in Henry's coat pocket

140
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:25,240
 Where are Henry and Mary? I do they keep us waiting like this Henry's helping Mary find a shoe polish mr.

141
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,240
 No, wait a minute.

142
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,240
 What's the matter, Sam?

143
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,240
 What on earth is this garb of stuff in Henry's coat pocket?

144
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:34,240
 Sam! Sam, oldridge, look at your hand!

145
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,240
 Can you make out what it is, Alice?

146
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,240
 Is that a chocolate drop or something?

147
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,240
 Chocolate, Mr. Oldridge? Did you say chocolate?

148
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,240
 Oh, I just keep away.

149
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,240
 Sam, you have to get it out somehow.

150
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,240
 Get it out, Alice. You realize the whole bottom of the pocket is nothing but soft chocolate.

151
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,240
 That doesn't make any difference, Sam.

152
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:55,260
 And if you think I can sit in that church with everyone in town that I know staring at my

153
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:59,620
 son and knowing that I let him come with chocolate all over the inside of him.

154
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:01,780
 Alice, I've got out what I could.

155
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:03,280
 Well, what did you do with it?

156
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,780
 I put it in the ashtray.

157
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:06,580
 At least I thought I did.

158
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:08,580
 That's all right, Mr. O'Hood.

159
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:09,580
 I got it.

160
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:10,580
 It's very good.

161
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:13,980
 You must have had a cherry filling.

162
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:16,180
 Homer, are you eating that?

163
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:17,680
 Oh, excuse me.

164
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,680
 Did you want some?

165
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,680
 I did not.

166
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:26,440
 you eating more. Oh dear. Sam look at me. Look at my glove. Have you got some more

167
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:31,040
 Mrs. Allrich? Alice I told you to keep your hands out of there. And I just finished

168
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:35,480
 washing these gloves. Now let's just let things drop where they are. Come on and

169
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:39,400
 let's get started for church. Sam I am not going to start looking as though I'd

170
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:44,080
 been making fudge with my gloves on. Oh my dear go up to the bathroom please and

171
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,280
 get the bottle of cleaning fluid that's on the top shelf of the medicine closet.

172
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,840
 Yes Mrs. Aldrich, it's a very good idea.

173
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,640
 Boy, look at my suit.

174
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,280
 How did that get on there?

175
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,520
 Don't waste time looking at your suit, Ron!

176
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,200
 Father! Oh, what Mary?

177
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,320
 Have you seen the shoe polish anyplace?

178
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,520
 The shoe polish?

179
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,480
 Alice, do you suppose that's what's in Henry's pocket here?

180
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,320
 I'm not fast.

181
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,600
 Is it Mr. Old?

182
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:11,160
 - It is not. - Shoe polish I've been eating.

183
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,400
 Because if it is, I want to know before I do anything else.

184
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,040
 No, Homer, please get the cleaning fluid.

185
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,880
 Mother, yes, Henry.

186
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:22,040
 Did I get your homework say he found the shoe polish?

187
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:22,960
 No, Henry.

188
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,760
 He thought he'd eaten it.

189
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,920
 The blocks you polished?

190
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,880
 Why'd he do that?

191
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,200
 Henry, will you please tell me what this is in your blue coat

192
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,040
 pocket?

193
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,840
 Well, if it's a letter, Father, I'll tell you.

194
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,320
 I met her last summer, see?

195
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,880
 And why out of a clear sky I got--

196
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,960
 It is not a letter.

197
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,880
 It isn't?

198
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,680
 It's part chocolate and part Mariskino cherry.

199
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:44,520
 For me?

200
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,320
 You mean she sent me a box of chocolate?

201
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,080
 Henry, dear, can't you see your pocket? Can't you see my glove?

202
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,920
 Oh, she wins.

203
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,000
 Oh, yeah.

204
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 Oh, that.

205
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:02,560
 Well, I tell you, Father, do you remember that box of chocolate covered cherries you brought home last week?

206
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,440
 I do.

207
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,640
 Well, I like chocolate, and I didn't know this had cherries in it, see?

208
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,360
 Go on.

209
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:12,680
 Well, last Wednesday afternoon, I happened to walk in there,

210
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:18,840
 And Mr. Carson, the minister, was here and the mother was passing him chocolates and she passed me one and I bit into it.

211
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,840
 Go on.

212
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:24,840
 Well, naturally with the minister here, I didn't want...

213
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:28,840
 Well, there wasn't any place left to print, so I put it in my pocket.

214
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:31,840
 Now, Henry, what's in that pocket? Isn't just one chocolate?

215
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,840
 No, that's what I was going to tell you.

216
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:37,840
 I tried one of them and I thought I'd try a couple more and see if I could hit one without cherries.

217
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,840
 And you apparently didn't hit one.

218
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,840
 So I finally gave up.

219
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,840
 And that was the last I ever thought of it.

220
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,840
 Mrs. Aldrich, here it is. Here's your cleaning fluid.

221
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,840
 Thank you, Homer. Thank you very much.

222
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,840
 Who are you going to start on first?

223
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,840
 Henry or me or Mr. Aldrich?

224
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,840
 What do you mean on me?

225
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,840
 Isn't that chocolate in your hair, Mr. Aldrich?

226
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,840
 In my hair.

227
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,840
 Ben, look in the mirror. How did you get chocolate way up there?

228
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,840
 Father, don't you like chocolate covered cherries either?

229
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,840
 That's a fine thing.

230
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,840
 If you're looking for chocolate these days, you can never find any, but...

231
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,080
 Ah, look at my shirt.

232
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,080
 No, Sam, it's in your hair.

233
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:18,480
 It's also on my shirt, and this is the last clean shirt I have until the laundry comes tomorrow.

234
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,400
 Well, hold still until I get through cleaning out Henry's pocket,

235
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,480
 and then I'll see what I can do with you.

236
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:27,120
 And Henry, the next time you put something in your mouth that you don't happen to like,

237
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,920
 especially if the minister is here, I hope you'll be honorable enough to swallow it.

238
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,400
 You mean it was sort of deceitful of me to put it in my pocket?

239
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,600
 No, there are more than looking at what you're doing.

240
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,600
 You poured that whole can of cleaning fluid into Henry's pocket.

241
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,480
 Yes, here only don't stand there and tell me about it.

242
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,840
 Go get a towel or something so we can soak it up.

243
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,240
 How long are you doing anything?

244
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,400
 You're just sitting around here.

245
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,240
 Go get a towel.

246
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,600
 I'll keep pal married.

247
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,160
 Henry, go over and open that window.

248
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:51,840
 Yes, Father.

249
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,680
 No, Henry.

250
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,520
 Stand still.

251
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,440
 You're leaking.

252
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,880
 Yes, Mother.

253
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,600
 Alice, let me tell you one thing.

254
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,040
 If you think I'm going to church,

255
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:02,040
 covered with chocolate like this, you're crazy.

256
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,440
 Now, Sam, you've got to go.

257
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,320
 I can't go.

258
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,160
 Why can't you?

259
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,080
 Smelling of cleaning fluid.

260
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,400
 Do you think I could sit through that entire service

261
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:13,400
 with a killman and back of me sniffing all right all right you can stay home to

262
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:17,040
 I'll go to the phone and tell mr. Carson that I can't help with the collection

263
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:21,320
 Mary can go and represent the whole family I can't represent it I can't

264
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:25,760
 possibly represent it why not I've got chocolate on my glove now Mary how on

265
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,240
 earth did you get chocolate on you that's what I can't understand I haven't even

266
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:33,640
 been near Henry well it's a funny thing but I haven't got a darn bit on me what

267
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:37,480
 do you mean you haven't got any on you go to that phone and call mr. cost what

268
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:40,480
 - Don't tell him the truth. He'll think we're making it up.

269
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,480
 - What shall I tell him?

270
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:44,480
 - You can think of something. Tell him...

271
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,480
 make something up that sounds believable.

272
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,480
 - Mrs. Aldrich.

273
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,480
 - Don't you have that towel, yes?

274
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:54,480
 - That's why I came down to ask you. Do you want a face towel or a bath towel?

275
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,480
 Or one of those nice little guest towels with cherries on it?

276
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:13,480
 [ Music ]

277
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:20,480
 And I would also like to remind the congregation that due to the fact that next Friday is a holiday,

278
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:27,480
 the meeting of the ladies' Thursday evening reading club which generally takes place on Friday afternoon

279
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:31,480
 will take place instead on Wednesday at 3 o'clock.

280
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:38,480
 Remember the ladies' Thursday evening club next Wednesday instead of Friday.

281
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:47,480
 Also, I am sure the members of the congregation will be pleased to hear that Mrs. Taff is doing much better

282
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:52,480
 and before long she'll be back taking part in the activities of our church.

283
00:12:52,480 --> 00:13:01,720
 On the darker side of the picture, however, as I was leaving my study only a few minutes

284
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:08,880
 ago, the poem rang, and to make a long story short, the son of Mr. and Mrs. Samuel Oldrich,

285
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:15,920
 Henry, as to just what happened to him, no one seems to know, but at any rate Henry is

286
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:22,040
 being confined to his home. And while the immediate members of the family were most anxious to

287
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:27,800
 join us here in this service, they felt that their place at this time was beside their

288
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:34,800
 song. Now, before I get up with an extra announcement, I would like to say that some of these beautiful

289
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:40,320
 flowers that grace our church this morning will be set to Henry immediately following

290
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,320
 Mr.

291
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:56,320
 Mother Earth, have you seen my overcoat anyplace?

292
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,320
 Henry, what is it you want your overcoat for?

293
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,320
 From going out.

294
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,320
 Have you forgotten? I'm invited over to Catlings for Sunday dinner.

295
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:06,320
 Then you are not going out of this house until church is over.

296
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,320
 And Sam?

297
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,920
 Alice, I'm just going out to get some fresh air.

298
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,320
 All I've been breathing this morning is cleaning fluid.

299
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,620
 And do you realize church doesn't get out until 12 o'clock?

300
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:17,720
 All right. It's three minutes to 12.

301
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,020
 Look at my watch right here.

302
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:21,720
 Well, you're going to stay here until at least five after.

303
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,320
 Suppose you met the kilmas on your way down the street.

304
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,820
 You'd never live it down.

305
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:26,820
 Alice, where are you going?

306
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:29,320
 Out of the kitchen, make sure your watch is right.

307
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:44,040
 [Music]

308
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,720
 Oh, hello Mr. Carson.

309
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:50,360
 Hello. I'm sorry I was delayed. I did in my study getting out of my robe.

310
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:53,640
 That was an excellent sermon this morning, Mr. Carson.

311
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,280
 Excellent.

312
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,800
 Hey, Drew. Thank you.

313
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:59,240
 I've just been looking over the contributions here for this morning.

314
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,720
 They seem to be unusually generous.

315
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:04,320
 And by the way, Mr. Kastner, if it'll help any,

316
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,400
 I'd be very glad to take those flowers over to the orgages.

317
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,560
 Thank you, just the same.

318
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,400
 But one of the new members of the church,

319
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,960
 who seems to want to take part in our activities,

320
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,880
 has already offered to take care of that.

321
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,720
 Well, that will be a very nice experience for a new member

322
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,240
 to meet the orgages.

323
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,200
 Yes. Poor Mary Orgridge.

324
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:26,120
 Did you see her alone in her pew this morning?

325
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,320
 Oh, really?

326
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,480
 Did Mary get here?

327
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,980
 She most certainly did, and there she sat just as though nothing had happened.

328
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:36,080
 Yes? Well, well, where's my handkerchief?

329
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,680
 Mm-hmm. You got something on your hand?

330
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:42,480
 I just picked up a numble up with the little chocolate or something on it.

331
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,580
 Yes? Mm. That's good.

332
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:48,580
 I guess some little child is allowed to put that on the plate.

333
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:52,380
 Well, as long as the spirit was there, that's all that's important.

334
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:55,780
 Why is the way, did Mrs. Brown find her son Homer?

335
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,580
 Homer? Has he been lost?

336
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:03,700
 All I know is Mrs. Brown was waiting at the front door for quite a long time after the service and he didn't come out.

337
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:06,620
 She shook hands with me three times.

338
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:08,060
 Well, well...

339
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:09,660
 Something the matter, Mr. Carson?

340
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:13,180
 No, no, I just put my hand in my pocket and...

341
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,620
 How do you suppose that got in there?

342
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:16,700
 What is it?

343
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:17,980
 Oh, I remember.

344
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:22,660
 I was visiting the old riches this last week and Mrs. Oldrich passed some chocolate.

345
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:27,380
 And I liked chocolate covered cherries, but frankly, I'd had quite a hearty lunch.

346
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:29,980
 Well, I didn't want to put the chocolate back in the box.

347
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:32,780
 You know, so I sneaked it into my pocket.

348
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:37,580
 - Did it do much damage? - No, no, I think a little cleaning fluid will take it out, alright?

349
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:41,180
 I guess I better take care of it before I go over and call on Henry,

350
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:44,380
 so I won't feel guilty when I walk into the Aldrich's house.

 Now getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldrich.

418
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:37,800
 Due to the fact that the entire family became covered with chocolate this morning,

419
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,800
 just as they were about to leave the house for church,

420
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,800
 only Mary attended.

421
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:47,200
 Mr. Aldrich, in his attempt to explain the situation to the minister,

422
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,800
 gave the impression that a serious accident had befallen Henry.

423
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:57,300
 The scene opens shortly afternoon of the same day on one of Santa Bill's streets.

424
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:03,800
 Listen, Homer, do you mind walking a little faster, please?

425
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,800
 I'm walking fast, Henry. What do you want me to do, Lunt?

426
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:10,300
 Don't you realize I'm due over Kathleen's for dinner right now?

427
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:15,180
 And all you want do is stop and look at things but Henry why not turn this corner here?

428
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:21,920
 Why do we have to go by the church? Why shouldn't we go by the church? We can cut right across the lawns save almost half a block

429
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:26,240
 Yeah, but remember Henry. We didn't go this morning and a foul over

430
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:32,380
 She wished you want to bump right into that man. That's got his arm full of plan. Oh, excuse me. That's all right young man

431
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:38,020
 I wonder whether you boys could give me a hand for just a minute. Oh sure is there something I'd like to have us do

432
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:42,020
 There are some more flowers here on the steps of the church that I've got to put in my car.

433
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:45,020
 I have to take them to several places and I'm a little behind schedule.

434
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:48,020
 Sure, we'd be glad to help you put them in the car.

435
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:50,020
 The only thing is, how about Kathleen?

436
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:53,020
 He wishes Henry if it's for the church, don't you think we ought to help?

00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:56,020
 Well, are these the plants right here?

438
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:59,020
 Yes, put them on the floor in the back of the car. I'm going into the church and get some more.

439
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:01,020
 Are they for sick people, Mr.?

440
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:06,020
 Yeah, some of them are for Mrs. Cap and some of her young man over on Elm Street, who's had an accident.

00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:12,820
 Probably little killer kid.

445
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:15,700
 He's always falling down or something.

 That doesn't make any difference.

 Mother's terribly upset and you've got to come home and be sick.

00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:49,580
 Come on, Henry. Don't you think we better go back?

470

00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:12,940
 Mr. Aldrich told you when he phoned this morning?

517
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:14,940
 Well, the fact is,

518
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:15,940
 now that I think of it,

519
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:17,940
 he did seem to be just a bit confused.

520
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:19,440
 All I gathered was there

521
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:23,320
 been quite an accident and the whole family was pretty much upset but I never

522
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:27,040
 dreamed of the imagine. What is it you're laughing at?

523
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:32,240
 Humans forgive me but I prayed for Henry. Well that's better than not though.

524
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:36,440
 However I suppose the Lord will get it all straightened out.

525
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:40,640
 Are you all

526
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,640
 Who's making all that noise down there?

527
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:47,840
 Mrs. Olrich I don't think you better let him come down even if I am here.

528
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:54,460
 I'm not going to with you excuse me just a minute while I see if he's all right of course and you tell him I'll come up there and see

529
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:56,460
 Well, that's fine

530
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:59,260
 I think you'll hear me

531
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:03,600
 Thank you quiet quiet quiet. I'm not making noise. Don't come any farther down the steps

532
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,760
 You've got to go back and get into bed. What far I've had by nap

533
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:11,980
 But the amisic caution has come to tell you how sorry he is you've had that accident. What accident?

534
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:17,280
 How do I know? Just go back into your room and get into bed. How did you feel all right?

535
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:21,680
 This isn't my fault. You're the one that cooked up that story.

536
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:25,280
 Now go on up there and get into your pajamas and get under the cover.

537
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,280
 What, Alex?

538
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:30,280
 Sam, do you realize he even prayed for us? Now go on!

539
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:33,280
 Oh, Mr. Carson!

540
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,780
 Yes, Mrs. Orich?

541
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:37,280
 I'm sorry to have kept you waiting, but...

542
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,280
 How is the patient?

543
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:45,280
 Why, he's fine. He seems a little restless. He wants to get up and around.

544
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:51,480
 Well, Mrs. Aldrich, before I go up there, I went over to sit down in your sofa and I

545
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:57,040
 moved that cushion and didn't look where I was sitting and apparently somebody left

546
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:59,040
 the chocolate drop under there.

547
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,040
 Oh, dear.

548
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:02,200
 Have you sat on it?

549
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,680
 That's all right, Mrs. Aldrich.

550
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,400
 This is an old suit, anyhow.

551
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:08,320
 Mr. Carson, I can't begin to tell you how embarrassed I am.

552
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,080
 Oh, there's nothing be embarrassed about.

553
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:13,840
 I happen to know that ordinary cleaning fluid will remove this sort of thing without any

554
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:14,840
 trouble, whatever.

555
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,840
 Yes, I found that out too.

556
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:20,340
 Would you excuse me while I go out to the kitchen and see whether there's any left?

557
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:21,840
 I mean... Mother!

558
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,340
 Yes, Mary, is that you?

559
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,340
 Yes, Mother!

560
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:25,840
 Dear, I didn't know you were home.

561
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,840
 Oh, yes, I've been upstairs with it.

562
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,340
 Oh, is this...

563
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:31,840
 Well, my goodness, I thought you were out looking for...

564
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:35,840
 Mr. Carson, I'll get you cleaned up in just a minute.

565
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:36,840
 Blandy!

566
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:37,840
 Oh, hello, Mr. Carson.

567
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:38,840
 Hello, Mary.

568
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,840
 Say, why do your mother's getting the cleaning fluid?

569
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,840
 Could my grub stairs and see the patient?

570
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:43,840
 The patient?

571
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,840
 Yes, let's go up and see how he is.

572
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,240
 Tell me, Mary, how was he when you saw him last?

573
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,440
 Oh, why?

574
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,640
 He was fine.

575
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,240
 But we've had quite a little trouble persuading him

576
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,140
 to get in bed.

577
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:54,940
 Yes?

578
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:56,940
 Yes, he had an engagement for Sunday dinner.

579
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:59,640
 And my goodness, he just insisted that he was going

580
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,640
 to go no matter what.

581
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,640
 Yes?

582
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,640
 Well, I'll give him a good talking to him,

583
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,740
 tell him to take care of himself.

584
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:08,140
 You know, we've been thinking for a long time

585
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:09,340
 of putting him on the board.

586
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:11,240
 And I don't know but what this would be a good time

587
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,040
 to bring it up.

588
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,240
 On the board?

589
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,740
 Isn't he a little young for that?

590
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:16,300
 Your home, not a bit.

591
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:18,100
 We need someone with his experience.

592
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:20,500
 Oh, we'll hear this door right here.

593
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,420
 I'll let you go in first, Mr. Carson.

594
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:24,580
 All right.

595
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:26,880
 Well, old man, how are you?

596
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,280
 Oh, gee whiz.

597
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:30,580
 Oh, what are you doing at Henry's bed?

598
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:33,860
 Mary, when Henry left, he said it was just going to be flowers,

599
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:35,180
 and then I could get up.

 Hi, you fellas.

607
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:28,840
 This is your V-mail gal Jill saying "V-mail for some of you, V-mail for some more of you,

00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:31,840
 and for the rest of you who are getting too few dimensions."

609
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:36,380
 Good night if you don't use vast V-mail, how do you expect us to get your letters answered

00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:37,860
 on the double?

611
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:43,280
 And another thing, V-mail letters don't require an envelope, and you can make the notice short

 Mary, I want you to run upstairs right this minute and get me a clean handkerchief.

615
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,860
 Yes, mother, I'll get it right away for you.

616
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:58,360
 And, Henry, why don't you have both your shoes on?

617
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:02,560
 Well, that's what I was just going to tell you, mother. I can only find this run.

618
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:05,460
 Mother, I don't think you have any clean handkerchief.

619
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:08,760
 - What, Mary? - Come on, Alice. Is everyone ready to start?

620
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:11,160
 Now, Sam, where are you going with that suitcase?

621
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,660
 There's suitcase to church.

622
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:16,060
 And it is a complete change of Thai shoes, socks, and handkerchiefs.

623
