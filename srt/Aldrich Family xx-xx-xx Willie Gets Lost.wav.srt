00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 And real over it! Coming, Mother!

00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 The Aldrich family! A special rebroadcast for you soldiers, sailors, and Marines of the United Nations.

00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 A world filled only with teenage boys is something for bidding to imagine.

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 But a world without any teenage boys is just as for bidding.

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,780
 For youngster like Henry older dad that's to everyone's everyday experiences

8
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:03,560
 But he opens in the older living room the time is Saturday morning

9
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:06,880
 But Mary haven't I made it clear? I'm not any good at that sort of thing

10
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,360
 I mean what's different says it may you don't have to entertain or anything?

11
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,820
 Oh, you have to do it keep your eye on him. Mary. Let me ask you something

12
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:17,780
 How old is this child you want Homer me to take care of Henry? He's not a child

13
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:19,400
 He's nine years old well

14
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,920
 I'm not gonna spend the only day of rest I have in the week keeping my eye on my hero

15
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,920
 But Mother Thomas is Mother that you would.

16
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:25,920
 But I take care of it.

17
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,920
 Is that one of us would?

18
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,920
 And Henry, I thought you asked me to help you with your kind first weekend.

19
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:31,920
 I did.

20
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:32,920
 Sure, I'd be glad to have you help.

21
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,920
 And I would either go to the great enough of your room for you.

22
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:35,920
 Including my closet?

23
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:36,920
 Yes, Henry.

24
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:40,920
 I've had just one thought in my mind all morning and that's to make the weekend happy.

25
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,920
 It's perfect for you, it's possible.

26
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,920
 And now somehow you've disappointed me.

27
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,920
 I have.

28
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,920
 Well, look, let me step out on the porch and speak to Homer for a second.

29
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,920
 for a second. And maybe I can...

30
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:52,920
 Will you wait here?

31
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,920
 Alright, I'll be answering the phone.

32
00:01:54,920 --> 00:02:17,920
 And Henry, I think we should also know about even trying to clean out your lunch

33
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,440
 minutes to bus leaves for Abbott City and Gwen and Ada over there expecting us to

34
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:27,240
 come on it. Well that's what I want to ask you Homer. If we text the 10 o'clock

35
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:31,080
 flush over there I don't suppose we could keep our date and get back here by 12

36
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:36,000
 couldn't we? By 12 tonight? No we can't keep Willie out that way. Who's Willie? Oh

37
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,280
 well that's something I'd rather not go in to. Yes Mary Henry I thought you

38
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,120
 wanted to make that flop. Henry I just got this job Graham and you certainly

39
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,420
 appreciated your being so good about it about why you forgot taking care of

40
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:53,280
 Willie Mary what did I say I do anything like that I thought you were going out to

41
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,480
 arrange it with homeless she was I just went out to just be doing what mother

42
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,920
 guy to say when she finds out you've walked out on Willie mother where is she

43
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:05,040
 I'm gonna ask you say right here but Mary where you going he's out in the kitchen

44
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:10,920
 Henry mother are you satisfied with the way Henry's getting along and friends

45
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,920
 You know, I have time to worry about Henry's friends right now.

46
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,920
 What have you done with Willie?

47
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,920
 Well, that's what I was anxious to tell you about.

48
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:20,920
 Don't you think that since Henry is a boy and Willie has a better time with him than with me?

49
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:21,920
 Yes, I suppose so.

50
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,920
 That's what I've been trying to tell Henry and motherly won't even listen to me.

51
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,920
 Mary, I have time to worry about that now.

52
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,920
 One of you is to take care of and then you'll have to decide it between yourself.

53
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:34,920
 And whatever we decide will be all right with you, that's all I wanted to know.

54
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,920
 Henry! Henry! Henry!

55
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,420
 Henry Olgrip!

56
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,420
 What, Mary?

57
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,420
 May I ask what you're going down the front wall for?

58
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,420
 Mary Holman, I've got a catch-up, but...

59
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:47,420
 And Henry, don't you realize how upset we all are over your French?

60
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:48,420
 My friends?

61
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:49,420
 Your French and Willie!

62
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:51,420
 Or don't you ever want to get to Princeton?

63
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:52,420
 What mother say?

64
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:57,420
 He said Willie would be much happier if he were with you because you're a boy, and I'm a seller for you myself.

65
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,420
 She did.

66
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:00,420
 Hey, Henry, why would Princeton care with you?

67
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,420
 I'm a mother.

68
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:02,420
 I'm a mother.

69
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:03,420
 And just a second home.

70
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:05,420
 I'm going to leave it up to you, Henry.

71
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:06,420
 I've got to go in and change.

72
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,920
 But, Mary, why must I be the one to decide?

73
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,420
 You realize we have five minutes left?

74
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:13,420
 Homer, I'm stuck with Willie Jenkins.

75
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,420
 And how about Gwen and Aida?

76
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:17,420
 You mean you'd rather play with Willie than with Gwen?

77
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,420
 No, Homer.

78
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:20,420
 But my mother's worried about Gwen.

79
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:25,420
 I mean, Henry, if I get over there and tell Aida, you couldn't come, she'll take my head off.

80
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:28,420
 She went to a lot of trouble to get Gwen lined up for you.

81
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:30,920
 I told you were very particular who you went out with.

82
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,920
 But how about Willie? I've got to keep an eye on him.

83
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,920
 Where is he? He's out in the garden.

84
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,920
 I have to say, I'm sure he's all right.

85
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,920
 Okay, okay.

86
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,920
 Why don't we tie him safely to a tree and beat him?

87
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,920
 Hi, uh-oh, I don't want to tighten, right?

88
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,920
 We'll put him on the end of a long clothes line,

89
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,920
 and leave a glass of water for him in case he gets thirsty.

90
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,920
 Oh, no, we can't do that.

91
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,920
 Alright, then why don't we take him with us?

92
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,920
 On the bus.

93
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,920
 Way over to Abbott City.

94
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,920
 Listen, all you and mother want you to do is take care of him, doesn't she?

95
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,920
 What given to them make whether you take care of him here or in Abbott City?

96
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,920
 That's true.

97
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,920
 And, gee, there he is.

98
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,920
 Hey, Lily!

99
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,920
 You want?

100
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,920
 Come here!

101
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,920
 What are you doing with that rose boy?

102
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,920
 I said it up.

103
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,920
 I saw an oldie for you.

104
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,920
 Well, where's the holly you got it out of?

105
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,920
 I want to know.

106
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,920
 Now listen, Lily.

107
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,920
 You gotta put that back and come on with us.

108
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,920
 I'm not going anywhere.

109
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,920
 Oh, yes you are.

110
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,920
 Now, come on.

111
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,920
 And listen, Lily.

112
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,920
 That's my father's favorite rose boy.

113
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,920
 And he doesn't want to take it all the way to Abbott's Finney.

114
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,420
 Fanny!

115
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:37,520
 Hello there, Alice oldie.

116
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,920
 Isn't that you up there on the farm?

117
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,420
 Oh, good morning, Mrs. Smith.

118
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:42,920
 I just thought I'd get the little sweeping done out here.

119
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,920
 My, isn't this a nice morning?

120
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,420
 Isn't it?

121
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:47,920
 And Alice, I want to tell you what a nice boy I think you have.

122
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,920
 Oh, Henry!

123
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,920
 I guess so. I'm going down Maple Street with Homer Brown.

124
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,420
 It's the funniest thing the way I happen to see them, really.

125
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:57,820
 I was about a block away and I heard a small boy screamin'

126
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,820
 "Creamy at the top of this lungs, Alice."

127
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,820
 "And it's this, I thought he must be fine."

128
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:02,820
 "Well, they heard him."

129
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:03,820
 "Oh, no."

130
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:04,820
 "It's Nandi, we're just laughing."

131
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:08,420
 Henry was running on one side of him and home over to the other side of him

132
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:10,920
 and they were holding him right up in the air.

133
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,920
 "Really?"

134
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:15,420
 "Yes, and the little boy was waving a great big bush."

135
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:17,420
 "He must have been having the best time."

136
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,420
 "Oh, that must be Willie Jenkins."

137
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,920
 Apparently, Mary decided she'd let Henry take care of him.

138
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,920
 "Well, from the weird look."

139
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,800
 Henry certainly has a way with young people.

140
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,800
 And that's why I stopped by Mrs. Orgick.

141
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,960
 I wanted to ask her something.

142
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,440
 Yes, Mrs. Smith, I had to go to Red Cross

143
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,760
 for afternoon to week.

144
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:37,760
 And my little girl is a real problem, but she's very sweet.

145
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,240
 And I wondered when I saw Henry just now,

146
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,000
 whether he wouldn't like to earn a little money now and then.

147
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,440
 Taking care of your little girl?

148
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,040
 Would be a great week for her.

149
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,800
 Oh, I agree with you, and it would be a wonderful experience

150
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,640
 for Henry.

151
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:52,220
 (upbeat music)

152
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:54,480
 (laughing)

153
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,820
 - Hello?

154
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:00,280
 Hello, was this Obisity 441?

155
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,900
 - How's your 20 cents, please?

156
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,500
 - 20 cents as much as that.

157
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:08,800
 - Hello?

158
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,700
 - Oh, hello, is this?

159
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,580
 Is this just a minute?

160
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:13,580
 - What did you say?

161
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:15,480
 - Hey Homer, what did you say, her name is?

162
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:18,640
 - Ada, Ada, she wants you right at there.

163
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,820
 - Write it down.

164
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,900
 Listen, Homer, you wanna mix me up?

165
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:22,900
 Hello?

166
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:23,900
 Hello?

167
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:24,900
 May I speak with Ada Ashley please?

168
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,900
 I'm late again to come to the phone right now.

169
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,900
 She's going down to the bus terminal to meet someone.

170
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:29,900
 She has?

171
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:32,900
 Yes, we're having two visitors from Vanderbilt.

172
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,900
 Oh, well look we missed the bus.

173
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:35,900
 Who is?

174
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:36,900
 All of us.

175
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:37,900
 Oh is this Homer?

176
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:38,900
 No it's Henry.

177
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:39,900
 Oh you're mine.

178
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:40,900
 What's that?

179
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:41,900
 Henry, aren't you coming?

180
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:42,900
 It's yours, you're coming.

181
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,900
 Only we had a little trouble.

182
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,900
 And there isn't another bus for an hour and a half.

183
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:47,900
 There isn't.

184
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,900
 No but don't worry, we're gonna hitchhike over.

185
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:50,900
 Alright.

186
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:51,900
 And listen.

187
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,900
 Do either of you or Ada have a kid sister?

188
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:55,900
 A kid sister?

189
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:56,900
 Yes.

190
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:00,900
 Well, my mother was a little worried about friends, but now I mean...

191
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:04,900
 Well, you suppose she could sort of entertain someone we're bringing over with us?

192
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:05,900
 Well, I'll find out.

193
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,900
 And we'll be awfully glad to see you, Henry.

194
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:08,900
 I understand you're very nice.

195
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,900
 Well, Gee, I understand the same thing.

196
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:11,900
 Hey, Henry.

197
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,900
 What do you think happened?

198
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:16,900
 Listen, when I think Homer's fidgeted up so we can get a ride.

199
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:17,900
 Goodbye!

200
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:18,900
 Goodbye!

201
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:48,780
 I've fixed it up will he just fill the strawberry soda all the way down his front well gee wiz homie didn't I tell you to keep an eye on him he won't let go of that rose bush Henry that's the trouble I told him when he started he couldn't drink his soda no hands. Hello Mrs. Olga to his residence. Hello Mrs. Olga this is Mrs. Emily Jones. Oh yes Mrs. Jones Mrs. Olga I was just talking with a couple of the ladies from the red.

202
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:53,580
 cross and I understand your son is marvelous with little children. Well I

203
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:57,580
 wouldn't go so far as to say that but of course I'm his mother and I'm afraid it

204
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:00,980
 wouldn't sound right if it came from me. Well just the same that's what I hear

205
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:04,740
 Mrs. Aldrich and I understand he's taking care of one or two children in

206
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:09,140
 these fair times and couldn't take on anymore. Oh you'd like to have him take

207
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:14,660
 care of your little boy too? Oh I have two little boys. One five and one seven and

208
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:17,780
 this is all the different off Henry really would play with them every afternoon

209
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:20,080
 And my worries would all be over!

210
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,080
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

211
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:31,680
 Winston, first, lay a minute.

212
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,980
 Willie, will you please walk a little faster?

213
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:36,580
 Don't you realize we're only two miles out of town?

214
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:38,380
 And just because we've got you along with us,

215
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:39,680
 nobody will give us a walk.

216
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,680
 I'm not stopping, I know, but you certainly

217
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,280
 discouraged them.

218
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,580
 Why don't you throw that darn rose push away?

219
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:46,580
 No.

220
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:48,980
 Willie, will you stop living every time you take a step?

221
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:50,180
 You make me nervous.

222
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:52,080
 Well, I've got a nail in my suit.

223
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,080
 And I'm going to sit down here and take it over.

224
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,380
 There we go, Henry.

225
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:56,180
 There we go.

226
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,780
 He's sitting down again.

227
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:00,580
 Willie, won't you please listen to the reason?

228
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:02,680
 You took your coat off and left it someplace

229
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,580
 and we lost half an hour, never found it.

230
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:05,780
 But I was hot.

231
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:07,280
 Here, poor I sure was.

232
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,980
 Is any car coming, Henry?

233
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:09,980
 No.

234
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:12,280
 Help me get the darn thing off and fix it for him.

235
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,280
 Where's his stone?

236
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,380
 Where's his stone?

237
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,380
 Are you going to hit me?

238
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:18,380
 I don't put ideas in my head.

239
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:20,380
 Look, moment.

240
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:21,380
 Well, I take a shoe off.

241
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:23,380
 You shorten half or you can sew that rose foot.

242
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:25,380
 I don't know, fellas. I don't know.

243
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:26,380
 Let's go.

244
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:27,380
 Oh, stop switching me.

245
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:29,380
 There is many nails in your shoe.

246
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:30,380
 It's just your imagination.

247
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,380
 Well, look at my foot.

248
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,380
 It's your saw.

249
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:34,380
 Whoever dressed you didn't get all the wrinkles out.

250
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,380
 I bled myself.

251
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:37,380
 Hey, Henry, here comes a truck.

252
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:40,380
 Oh, Mr. Yes or Yes or I?

253
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:41,380
 Mr.

254
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:43,380
 He was going to stop.

255
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:45,380
 Come on, my friend.

256
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:47,780
 Sure, five feathers so much.

257
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:49,380
 Boy, I'll say.

258
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:50,380
 Come on, Lily.

259
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:51,380
 No.

260
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:52,780
 Now listen, Lily.

261
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:56,380
 Do you remember what I had to do to your wrist last time you wouldn't mind me?

262
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,380
 No.

263
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:58,880
 Let's just lift him, Henry.

264
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,180
 Don't hurt him, Homer.

265
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,880
 Just let him know we mean business.

266
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,880
 I'm good.

267
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,880
 Yes, sir.

268
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,880
 We're in.

269
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:11,380
 You boys are in the heart, Dad, I'm in the right.

270
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,880
 I'll say, can we certainly appreciate it?

271
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,880
 I'm really isn't this pretty nice?

272
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:18,880
 Aren't you glad you're going over to Abbott City and see some girls?

273
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:19,880
 No.

274
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,880
 Now listen, Lily, don't be so smart.

275
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,880
 Will you guys aren't so smart?

276
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:24,880
 You know what you just did?

277
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,880
 What?

278
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,880
 You left my shoe back there when we got on.

279
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:38,880
 Hello, Samuel Otis speaking.

280
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,880
 Is this the order to take care of war workers' children?

281
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:42,880

 (

289
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:14,580
 (Music)

290
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:15,580
 Hello?

291
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:16,580
 Hello?

292
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:17,080
 Hello?

293
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,280
 Is this Gwen?

294
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,280
 This is Homer.

295
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,880
 My gracious, Homer, where are you?

296
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,080
 That's what I'm calling to tell you about.

297
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,280
 We're getting there.

298
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,480
 How far are you?

299
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,680
 We don't know.

300
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:30,720
 We got a ride part way and then Willie Drozewish got in the guy's eye.

301
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,920
 What did you say?

302
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,760
 He almost ran up a telephone pole and the guy made us get out.

303
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,560
 What, Henry's right outside where I'm phoning you, trying to stop another car.

304
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,560
 I certainly hope you get here soon, Homer.

305
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,260
 I've got my sister all lined up.

306
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,960
 Your sister, to me?

307
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,260
 I thought you were bringing someone by the name of Willie.

308
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:48,260
 We are.

309
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:51,360
 I'm not sure because my sister broke his aces with a soldier, that's how she can see him.

310
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,660
 Ah, this is all here.

311
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:56,260
 And he hopes Willie's a mighty most person boy.

312
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:57,260
 And why?

313
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:59,260
 Well, he's nice.

314
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:00,760
 But he's lost his shoes.

315
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:01,760
 He did.

316
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,760
 And it's happened as cold.

317
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,460
 And we hung his shirt back on a bush to dry after his soda slips.

318
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:08,460
 That's the best!

319
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:10,460
 A bouquet you're such a nut to worry.

320
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:12,460
 But once we get him there, he won't be any trouble.

321
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,460
 Hey, Homer!

322
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,960
 Hey, Homer! I'm coming, Henry!

323
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,960
 So goodbye, Granny!

324
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:16,960
 Bye!

325
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,560
 Henry, you stop the car?

326
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,560
 No, everybody just goes right by.

327
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,160
 You know what the trouble is, Homer?

328
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,160
 There are three of us.

329
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,160
 Sure there are.

330
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,160
 I've been telling you all the time, Henry.

331
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:30,560
 The thing for us to do is get behind a tree and I'm gonna try to flag the cars.

332
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,360
 Because these little trees, and then when they stop,

333
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,060
 We can step out and say, "Mr. How would you like to take a couple more?"

334
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:38,060
 Sure.

335
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,060
 Do it.

336
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:40,060
 Now then, will we be understanding?

337
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,060
 No.

338
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:45,060
 Well, do you see that delivery truck that's coming up the road?

339
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:46,060
 Yes.

340
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:49,540
 Well, you'll be right behind this entryway, and all you have to do is stand there, work

341
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:51,860
 perfectly safe and go like this with your thumb.

342
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:52,860
 Like this?

343
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:54,860
 Not for some that's holding the rosewood.

344
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:57,460
 Come on, can we get behind the tree?

345
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:58,460
 I'm coming.

346
00:13:58,460 --> 00:13:59,460
 Quick, get behind here.

347
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:00,460
 Is your wife writing them all right?

348
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:01,460

 In their anxiety to keep a date over in Abbott City, Henry and Homer have started off to see their girls.

 Taking along a nine-year-old boy, Henry has promised to take care of for the day.

532
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:54,540
 I'll stop him.

533
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,940
 I'll keep my eyes open.

534
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:57,540
 Hello there.

535
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:58,140
 Hello.

536
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:59,340
 Could you stop, please?

537
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:01,140
 I'll find if you want to go.

538
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,340
 I don't want to go anyplace.

539
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:04,940
 Have you seen anything of a small boy about nine years old

540
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:07,140
 going somewhere with somebody he didn't know?

541
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:08,340
 What was that?

542
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:09,640
 I haven't seen anybody.

543
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,740
 I got to move on.

544
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:11,940
 But if you see it, they got him.

545
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:12,540
 Let me know.

546
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:16,940
 Hello there.

547
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:19,340
 (crowd cheering)

548
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:20,640
 - Seriously, have you seen Anthony of a boy

549
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,740
 about nine years old?

550
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:23,940
 - But that, I'm looking for a nine year old boy.

551
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:24,940
 - With a rose bush?

552
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:25,780
 - But that?

553
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,300
 - He will fall right back, you all fair.

554
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:28,820
 - Henry, what are you doing in that car?

555
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:30,780
 - You mean you found Willie, Mr. Aldrich?

556
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:32,260
 - I have not come out of there,

557
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:34,020
 help me fix this flat tire.

558
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:36,760
 (dramatic music)

559
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:43,420
 - Ma'am, what are we going to do next?

560
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:44,660
 - I don't know what we're going to do,

561
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:46,540
 sit down and stop pacing around the living room.

562
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:50,440
 But dear, what am I going to tell Mrs. Jenkins when she comes here to the house this afternoon to get willy?

563
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:55,440
 And when I realize, Alice, that you were going to let Henry take care of all the children in this town, I shudder.

564
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,740
 Now, a fan, let's forget that and concentrate on Willie. Did you call the police?

565
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:04,040
 I call the police in San Rafael. I call the police in Abbott City. I call the state police. And they all promised to call me back.

566
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,640
 And when they called, what did they say?

567
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,640
 They didn't call.

568
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,740
 There they are right now.

569
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:09,040
 How do you know that's the police? I'll answer it.

570
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,040
 Sam, you wait here.

571
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,840
 Alice, there's no use in your getting any more upset than you already are.

572
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:15,340
 But dear, I'd like to see this thing handle the way it should be handled.

573
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:18,740
 I think the police should be told that we insist on knowing where Willa is.

574
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:19,740
 Hello?

575
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:20,740
 Hello, Mrs. O'Ogric.

576
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:21,740
 It is?

577
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:22,740
 Well, Mrs. Willa.

578
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:25,740
 Willa, my goodness, are you all right?

579
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:26,740
 Yeah, sure.

580
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:28,740
 Have you sent your laundry after this week?

581
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:29,740
 What's that?

582
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:30,740
 Where are you?

583
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:31,740
 How about your laundry?

584
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:32,740
 I love it.

585
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:33,740
 Willa, where are you?

586
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:34,740
 I lost him in a home.

587
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:36,540
 But don't worry, Mrs. O.

588
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:38,540
 It's so friendly, turn out for a ride.

589
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:39,540
 I got a call.

590
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:41,540
 Willa, take your hand, Willa.

591
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:42,540
 Hello.

592
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:43,540
 All right, Fred and Tae, yes.

593
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:47,540
 I thought you were going to tell me how to handle it.

594
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:48,540
 But he sounded happy.

595
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:50,540
 Father, I hear you're just talking about Willie.

596
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:51,540
 Yes, yes.

597
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:53,540
 You learn Mrs. Hall that you wear in peace.

598
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:54,540
 Father, I don't know.

599
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:56,540
 All he kept saying was that I said my love real.

600
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:59,540
 He hasn't got any clothes left on at all.

601
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:01,540
 I know what I'm going to do.

602
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:02,540
 What are you going on?

603
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:05,540
 I'm going to lie down and put a knife bag on my head.

604
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:07,540
 Boys, do you realize what you've done today?

605
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:08,540
 Oh, that's Father's.

606
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:09,540
 You.

607
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:11,540
 You've given Mrs. Hall that you're hitting.

608
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:15,440
 You two boys decided to take Willie and go all the way over to Abbott's

609
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,340
 and adjust to see two girls, didn't you?

610
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:17,840
 Yes, sir.

611
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,540
 And your country has asked you not to do any unnecessary traveling,

612
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:21,040
 ask it.

613
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,040
 But we were throwing in a bus, Mr. Old,

614
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,040
 and the bus was going anywhere.

615
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:27,040
 That isn't the point.

616
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:31,040
 All unnecessary traveling on buses means unnecessary wear on tires.

617
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:31,540
 It does.

618
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:33,040
 And extra passengers mean extra buses,

619
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,540
 and every extra bus means still more extra tires.

620
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:36,540
 Yes, father.

621
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:40,040
 And that was all just because you two boys wanted to see a couple of girls.

622
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,640
 You mean you gotta give up girls during the war?

623
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,940
 You can give up average sea girls, can't you?

624
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:48,240
 Unless you're prepared to walk over and see them, of course.

625
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,440
 13 miles?

626
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,340
 What's the matter with the girls right here in this town?

627
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:53,540
 She and me and I were wondering the same thing.

628
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:55,240
 We don't know what's the matter with them.

629
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,740
 And everything.

630
00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:01,540
 Do you realize how many miles I had to drive my car today just to call the view?

631
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:02,140
 Yes, Father.

632
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:03,340
 Do you realize what that means?

633
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:04,140
 Yes, sir.

634
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:05,540
 More wear on your tire.

635
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:08,840
 Exactly. And your father, whom I had to get his car out and try to find Willie.

636
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:12,960
 He did my new tires. He did. And the police are out trying to find Willie.

637
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:17,120
 Do you realize how much rubber has been wasted this afternoon just because of your thoughtlessness?

638
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,520
 Four. The whole little thing like this happened every day in every town in this country.

639
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,680
 Do you realize how many towns there are? Yes.

640
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:27,600
 And do you realize how many boys there are? But they all don't want to see Grenonata Mr. Aldrich.

641
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:32,800
 They all want to see some Grenonata. And you guys will have to choose life this minute.

642
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:36,920
 Which one you have? Your girls are victory. You mean we can't have both?

643
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,380
 not at the same time

644
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:41,180
 now go on out and take it over yes father

645
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:42,720
 I'll answer the phone out of the

646
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,720
 he and my

647
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,220
 a change of life

648
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:46,520
 Alice

649
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,260
 is that the phone of the front door

650
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:51,260
 it's both here you ask for the phone and I'll answer the door

651
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:53,420
 hello hello is this Mr. Aldrich

652
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:54,740
 it is is this police headquarters

653
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:56,380
 this is nip tonson down at your office

654
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:58,740
 oh yes mr. Aldrich I'm sorry to bother you

655
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:01,540
 but some woman is just like three children here

656
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:02,380
 pretty what?

657
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:03,880
 she's just gone on to the night shift

658
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,620
 and mr. Aldrich he's afraid your office

659
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:07,620
 This isn't going to be big enough for her children to play.

660
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:10,620
 Miss Thompson tell her we are not running in her scene where she please leave.

661
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:12,620
 He's already left and what all I do with the children?

662
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:15,620
 I don't care, do anything, take them home with you, goodbye.

663
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:16,620
 Yes, Alice?

664
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:18,620
 Sam's here, he's here.

665
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:19,620
 Who is?

666
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:20,620
 Willie, he came back with the laundry.

667
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:21,620
 He did what?

668
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:23,620
 The laundry charts the niggity.

669
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:25,620
 He's out in the kitchen eating a piece of pie.

670
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:28,620
 And Sam, I don't know where he got it, but he brought me a rose voice.

671
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:31,620
 Hello, very thoughtful, I'm sure.

672
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:35,100
 I'm sure later on the end you can take it out and plant it with your other

673
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:37,100
 bushes what letter you have in your head

674
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:41,340
 before you open it my office

675
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:43,740
 some woman is left three children down there

676
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:47,460
 I'm going to take care of that be wonderful you can go right on the word

677
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:48,340
 and not

678
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:52,420
 now it's a bit early to the nursery I put up some of the money for it but Henry

679
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:56,740
 isn't going to run it we haven't got enough time but here how can we ever

680
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:59,580
 develop his character how about my piece of mind

681
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:01,980
 Hey, look at this nose. It's from Henry.

682
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:02,780
 A man race?

683
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:03,980
 From Henry and Homer.

684
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:05,280
 Why would they be riding to us?

685
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:08,380
 Dear mother and father, and Mr. and Mrs. Olga.

686
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:09,580
 Mr. Mrs. Who?

687
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:12,380
 We are certainly sorry we were so soughtless,

688
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:14,880
 and hope the country will not suffer too much.

689
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,780
 We have taken an oath not to ride on another tire for the duration,

690
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:21,980
 unless it is for a sense of need, not girls.

691
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:24,780
 Well, I'm glad to see my talk here some good.

692
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:28,780
 So we're taking your advice and walking to Abbott's city to see the girls.

693
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:33,340
 They're walking all the way. But don't worry about our wasting shoe leather.

694
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:35,580
 Is we are wearing our rubber so steeped?

695
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:40,780
 Yes, that's fine. Mother! Mother, what do we do with your phone?

696
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:44,380
 Oh, Mary. Hand me at home when they were running down the street just as fast as I could go.

697
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:46,980
 Yes, dear. We know all about it. They're going to Abbott City.

698
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:48,380
 But, Mother, don't you understand?

699
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:49,980
 We're always chasing light after them.

700
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:52,180
 Is what? Oh, that's no way a minute.

701
00:28:52,180 --> 00:29:13,680
 [Music]

702
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:16,180
 This is the Armed Forces Radio Service.

703
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:18,760
 (upbeat music)
