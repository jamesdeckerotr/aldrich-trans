 Henry and his pal, Dizzy Stevens, are just coming down the stone steps of Central High School on their way to lunch.

 Well, Dizzy, what I want to know is where it could have gone.

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 Listen, a lunch box isn't something a person just overlooks.

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 Well, you certainly overlooked yours.

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 Oh, no, I didn't.

 How am I going to buy anything?

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000

 and a combined can opener and nail file.

 Henry, do you realize what you're doing with that knife?

82
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:26,380
 Well, you just cut your tie in, too.

83

 And besides, look, what is it? I just found 10 cents in my pocket.

 Are you sure that is in mind?

93

 How would your dime get in my pants pocket?

94
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,820

 You'd like to take me to the picnic.

105
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:31,620
 You mean you haven't got any of those things, will you?

106
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,620
 Of course I haven't!

107
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:35,420
 Would you like to be my partner, Henry?

108
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:37,220
 Well, the only thing is...

109
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:39,920
 Oh, has somebody else asked you?

110
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:46,020
 Well, somebody asked me not to accept any offers until I see about something else.

111
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,720
 I love to put up a lunch, Henry.

112
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,120
 I just get the biggest kick out of it!

113
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,920
 Don't talk anymore about food, Agnes.

114
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,420

 She was, I'm hungry enough to eat a well-balanced lunch.

118

122
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,200
 Oh, come on, let's go in and see.

123
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,880
 Oh, I don't think you better go into 'em.

124
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,200
 Going into me to couple of the fellas in here.

125

 Well, would you let me know about the picnic, Henry?

127
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,780
 Give me three days, Agnes.

128
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:29,020
 But if you'd rather not wait that long, I'll understand.

129

 What do you have?

134
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:38,340
 Do you know who that girl is sitting at the counter?

135
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,180
 Which one?

136
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,140
 The blind with the blue eyes.

137
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:43,740
 Yeah, isn't she a beauty girl?

138
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:45,900
 You couldn't know me a dime, could you?

139
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,980
 That's all I got myself, Homer.

140
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:50,020
 I'll pay you 25% interest.

141
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:52,580
 No, I've got to go over to the counter and get my lunch.

142
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,580
 I saw a first though Henry.

143
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,580
 Yeah.

144
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:58,580
 What do you have?

145
00:06:58,580 --> 00:06:59,580
 Oh yeah.

146
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,580
 I guess this young lady was here first.

147
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:03,580
 Oh well I haven't decided yet.

148
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:04,580
 Oh.

149
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,580
 Mr. Is that big ham there?

150
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:07,580
 Yes sir.

151
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:09,580
 What's that next to it?

152
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:10,580
 Those big.

153
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:11,580
 Oh.

154
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:12,580
 What's this?

155
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:13,580
 It's fried chicken.

156
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:16,580
 Well I'll take apple pie.

157
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:18,580
 Apple pie.

158
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:20,580
 A small piece.

159
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:21,580
 That's a nickel isn't it?

160
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:24,580
 - Yes, sir. - Put a scoop of ice cream on it.

161
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:27,580
 Could I trouble you for a paper nap, can you?

162
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:30,580
 Oh, oh, sure. How many would you like?

163
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:32,580
 Just one.

164
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:35,580
 Here, she was. Take the whole container.

165
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:38,580
 Uh, do you want whipped cream on that pie?

166
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:41,580
 Well, no extra charge. Shoot the works.

167
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:43,580
 Hey, um...

168
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:45,580
 Not bad.

169
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,580
 That'll be 15 cents.

170
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:48,580
 15 cents?

171
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:51,580
 Nickel for the pie, dime for the large ice cream.

172
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:53,580
 Yeah, well, that's fair enough.

173
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:57,580
 Only, uh, can I have the water ice cream in the first place?

174
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:58,580
 You don't want this?

175
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:01,580
 Well, would it be an awful lot of trouble if I didn't take it?

176
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,580
 You mean I got a dismantle, is it?

177
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:05,580
 [laughter]

178
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:07,580
 Well, I'm afraid so.

00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:08,580
 Listen, what do you want?

180
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:09,580
 Well...

181
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:11,580
 Could I have the menu, please?

182
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:12,580
 Oh, sure.

183
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:17,580
 You wouldn't like a piece of apple pie on me, would you?

184
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,180
 I don't think I should.

185
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,740
 Well, why not?

186
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:26,260
 Gee whiz, Mr. One apple pie and I think I'll take the same.

187
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,260
 Just plain?

188
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:28,260
 Yes, sir, plain.

189
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:33,020
 Well, it certainly seems good to have spring here.

190
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,860
 I like spring.

191
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,780
 I like to go on picnics, too.

192
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:37,780
 You do?

193
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:38,780
 Yeah.

194
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:40,700
 Are you going to the craft picnic?

195
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,180
 I'm not saying yet.

196
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:46,260
 Well, what's the idea of shaking pepper all around?

197
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,260
 Gee whiz, Mr.

198
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,860
 I know I had it in my hand.

199
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:53,060
 Would anyone mind if I could take ice cream on my pie?

200
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:54,600
 You want ice cream too?

201
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,800
 Vod you're small.

202
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,400
 Well I think I'll take the small.

203
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,300
 Not large?

204
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,980
 How about you buddy?

205
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:05,700
 What was the matter of fact I don't think I'll eat anything at all?

206
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,940
 I must be hungrier than you.

207
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:09,180
 Yeah.

208
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:12,180
 Frankly I was just going to eat to kill time anyhow.

209
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,980
 Oh could I have a chocolate mold or two?

210
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:15,880
 A chocolate mold?

211
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,880
 One cup!

212
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:21,520
 (audience laughing)

213
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:24,320
 Yes, one chocolate maul.

214
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,880
 - What is your name?

215
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,560
 - My name is Henry Albridge.

216
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,880
 - My name's Geraldine Love.

217
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,880
 - It is?

218
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,240
 - Mm.

219
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,800
 - She was Geraldine Love.

220
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,920
 (audience laughing)

221
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,000
 - Who takes the check?

222
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,800
 - Oh, I'll pay for it.

223
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,960
 I wonder, I wonder if--

224
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,280
 - Who are you looking for?

225
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,920
 I just thought there might be someone in here I know.

226
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,920
 Who?

227
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:49,920
 Why, you're...

228
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,160
 Wonder whether there could be anyone outside looking for me.

229
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:56,320
 Would you mind excusing me for just a second while I step out?

230
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,480
 How about this test?

231
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,400
 I'll be right back!

232
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,840
 Busy?

233
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,560
 Hey, Busy, why don't you have?

234
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,800
 Come here, I'm in a terrible position.

235
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,760
 What happened?

236
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,840
 Hurry up.

237
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,560
 Here's my knife.

238
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,640
 Give me that 50 cents.

239
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,560
 I haven't got 50 cents anymore.

240
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,200
 No?

241
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,640
 No, I've been getting something to eat.

242
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,720
 Haven't you anything?

243
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,880
 Just 30 cents.

244
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,980
 Well, she was, I don't make 40 cents, give it to me.

245
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:17,820
 Here's the knife.

246
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,840
 Oh, I didn't give the side to eat after all.

247
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,080
 Only in a way I did.

248
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,440
 Oh, he had teeth, thanks.

249
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,240
 So long.

250
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,880
 Yeah, I've got to go back in.

251
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,200
 - Was anyone out in front?

252
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,400
 - Was there?

253
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,320
 And was it a good thing I saw him?

254
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,840
 - That'll be 20, 30, 40 cents.

255
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,680
 Huh?

256
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,000
 That'll all.

257
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,440
 - Aren't you gonna eat anything?

258
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:41,160
 - See, if you could have seen the lunch I brought from home.

259
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,520
 - Oh, you've already eaten?

260
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,960
 - I stuffed myself.

261
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,160
 Hey Henry, what do you have, Disney?

262
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,460
 Your mother's out here.

263
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:48,460
 My mother?

264
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:50,700
 Henry, I've been looking all over for you.

265
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,760
 Is somebody sick for you?

266
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,600
 No, dear.

267
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,800
 You let your lunchbox at home in the living room.

268
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,640
 Mother?

269
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:58,040
 Well, dear, you can't go all day without anything to eat.

270
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,240
 For mother, I've had more than enough.

271
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,280
 I left that box home on purpose.

272
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,280
 Hi, Geraldine.

273
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,480
 Is that you in there?

274
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,040
 Oh, hello, where are we?

275
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,640
 And where did you come from, Erwin?

276
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,160
 I see you find your box, Henry.

277
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,380
 Now maybe you can eat something.

278
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,960
 Henry, mother, do you mind if I change the subject

279
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,680
 for just a minute. I want you to meet Geraldine Love.

280
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,880
 Hello. Come on, Henry. Let's go over to school.

281
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,680
 Okay. It was nice when I saw Henry.

282
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,720
 She wish she's gone.

283
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,440
 Who is that young woman, Henry?

284
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,760
 She's the best looking girl in school, mother.

285
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,800
 She's hardly the best man, Ed.

286
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,520
 But you don't really know her.

287
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:34,160
 And while I appreciate your bringing this lunchbox,

288
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,920
 I do think it could have handed it to me more cautiously.

289
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,720
 Henry, Agnes Lawson's mother phoned this morning.

290
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,800
 Well, she said, "I wanted to know whether you wouldn't like

291
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:45,480
 to go to the class picnic with Agnes. I hope you didn't tell her I would.

292
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:49,360
 Why wouldn't you dare? I couldn't possibly. Why not? Because.

293
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,320
 Henry, there isn't any girl you know quite as nice as Agnes.

294
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,240
 But mother, she can't begin to compare with Geraldine.

295
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:59,260
 I'm sure he isn't as rude as that young woman. You're just jumping at the conclusion.

296
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:03,280
 Henry Agnes' mother has always been so nice to you. And so is Agnes.

297
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:07,200
 But she's still not my idea of a girl I might go on a picnic with. Then I don't

298
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,760
 think you should accept any more of her hospitality.

299
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:13,020
 Henry! Say! Henry! Aren't you going to be late to class?

300
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:13,860
 Oh, hello Agnes!

301
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,460
 Oh, hello Mrs. Olgritte!

302
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:17,820
 The light film may ring any minute, Henry!

303
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,700
 Well, there's still lots of time, Agnes.

304
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:23,200
 Henry, don't you think this would be a good time to tell Agnes what we were just discussing?

305
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,260
 For Mother, look at the clock. I didn't know it was so late.

306
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,980
 It won't take one minute.

307
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,260
 What is it about?

308
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:30,540
 Well, Agnes...

309
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:35,160
 Would you like to have me go to the picnic with you?

310
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:38,160
 Oh, Henry, of course!

311
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,400
 Well, I'd like to go with you.

312
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,360
 See that, there it didn't take one second.

313
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,740
 Oh, I'm so glad you can go Henry.

314
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:46,240
 I think I'd better hurry.

315
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,280
 Oh, do you mind if I walk with you?

316
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,580
 No.

317
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:50,480
 Goodbye, dear.

318
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,480
 Goodbye, mother.

319
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,080
 Goodbye, little girl, Bitt.

320
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,820
 When are you going to eat your lunch?

321
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:56,220
 During music.

322
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,920
 Dilly.

323
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,420
 Look, hurry across the street.

324
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:00,760
 Oh, Henry, all of it.

325
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,320
 Oh, she was Geraldine.

326
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,860
 Could I see you alone, Henry?

327
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:05,660
 Oh, wait for you.

328
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,260
 Right at the entrance, Henry.

329
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,520
 You better go right on in, Agnes.

330
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,620
 Henry.

331
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:11,420
 Well.

332
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:14,460
 Henry, everyone Cooper can't go to the picnic.

333
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:17,020
 Would you like to be my partner?

334
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:19,200
 I...

335
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,800
 be your partner.

336
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,600
 Of course.

337
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,980
 Well, gee, where is...

338
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:25,440
 Would you?

339
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,340
 The only thing is...

340
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:28,380
 Has someone else asked you?

341
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:30,740
 I can fix it, all right.

342
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,340
 I can fix it, I'm sure I can.

343
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:33,040
 Really?

344
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,140
 Of course.

345
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:35,880
 Oh, Henry.

346
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,480
 Henry, I'm so thrilled you can go.

347
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,980
 She was. Think how I feel.

348
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:41,480
 I'm going with you.

349
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:47,580
 Boy, I'm going with you.

350
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:49,480
 Can you bring the long Henry?

351
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:52,280
 I bring you.

352
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,380
 Oh, I just hate to put up an old lunch.

353
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:56,280
 Sure, I'd be very glad to.

354
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,880
 Oh, my goodness. We better hurry.

355
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,380
 Henry, hey, Henry, I've got a message for you.

356
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:00,980
 Come here.

357
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:01,980
 What is it, Dizzy?

358
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:02,680
 Come here.

359
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,480
 Could you excuse me, Geraldine?

360
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,040
 You won't forget Henry.

361
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,040
 Forget?

362
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,320
 How could I?

363
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,120
 Listen, Henry, let me tell you, boy, you're gonna pass right out.

364
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,120
 Why?

365
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,560
 I fixed it up for you.

366
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,600
 You fixed what up for me.

367
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,960
 To go to the picnic.

368
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,960
 With whom?

369
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:19,880
 The girl you said you wanted a meat.

370
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,560
 But I just met her.

371
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,840
 Oh, no, Henry, that isn't the girl you wanted a meat.

372
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,560
 I just talked to the one you want.

373
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,360
 She's crazy to have you go.

374
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,720
 But, Dizzy, I've already got a date with this one.

375
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,000
 It's too late to tell the one I have talked to you.

376
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,400
 You can't go, Henry.

377
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,160
 She busted a date purposely.

378
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,880
 Boy, on eye your pal?

379
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,800
 I'll say you're my pal.

380
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:45,160
 That makes three girls and one picnic.

381
00:14:45,160 --> 00:15:03,280
 You know, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls of Henry's age often say

382
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:06,120
 and do a lot of things that puzzle parents.

383
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,680
 But among the most surprising things

384
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:11,600
 about all boys and girls is their strange powers of hearing.

385
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,080
 Your own son, for instance, may be just upstairs

386
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,840
 in his room when you call him from the kitchen.

387
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,200
 - Tommy?

388
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,920
 Oh, Tommy, come down here a minute.

389
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,320
 Tommy!

390
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,080
 - But no answer, so you call again.

391
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,840
 And this goes on for several minutes

392
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,600
 until you finally say to yourself.

393
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,520
 - Well, I did think he might want this extra dish

394
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:35,520
 of jello chocolate pudding if he doesn't, I'll eat it myself.

395
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,520
 Wait a minute, Mother, here I am.

396
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,520
 Where is it?

397
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,520
 Uh-huh.

398
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:45,520
 You see, it just goes to prove that all you have to do is mention just barely whispered

399
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:50,520
 jello chocolate pudding, and folks young and old will come running.

400
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:54,520
 Because seriously, ladies and gentlemen, jello chocolate pudding is a mighty delicious treat.

401
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:58,520
 It's a grand satisfying dessert, delightfully smooth and creamy,

402
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:03,840
 me, and every tempting spoonful is rich with swell, chocolaty flavor. You'll be glad to

403
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:08,920
 know, too, that jello chocolate pudding is easy to make, and that it costs only a few pennies.

404
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:14,040
 So try some real soon. For keen, luscious enjoyment, jello chocolate pudding is in a

405
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,120
 class by itself.

406
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:29,120
 [Music]

407
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:33,800
 Now getting back to Henry Alvich, when we left him Henry through no fault of his own,

408
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:37,040
 was dated with three girls for the class picnic.

409
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,120
 Now the scene opens on the morning of the picnic.

410
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,800
 Henry wearing an apron is working in the Alvich kitchen.

411
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,360
 Mother, is this all the wax paper we have?

412
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,600
 Well, Henry, you've already used two rolls.

413
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,240
 But I'm making the sandwiches big.

414
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:54,160
 May I ask how big Geraldine's mouth is?

415
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:59,640
 Look, Mother, look at this well bottle of stuffed olives.

416
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,840
 Where did you get enough money to buy those?

417
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,840
 I sold a picture that was up on my wall.

418
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:07,440
 Mother, I wonder why Geraldine doesn't like to put up a lunch.

419
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:10,680
 What did Agnes say when you told her you couldn't go with her?

420
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,960
 Very little.

421
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,440
 Well, Henry, I still don't like it.

422
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,760
 But don't you think it was alright for me to tell a girl,

423
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,760
 dizzy, fixed up for me that I couldn't go?

424
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,760
 That was entirely different, huh?

425
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:25,200
 Henry, what's the trouble of the portable phone of grass that was up in my room?

426
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,200
 Mary, I meant to speak to you about that.

427
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,200
 Do you need it today?

428
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,200
 What's more, I'd like to know what became of that pillow that was up in my room?

429
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,200
 Well, which one?

430
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,200
 The Princeton one.

431
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:39,000
 Couldn't I borrow that if I take very good care of it?

432
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 I'm going to rent a canoe, Mary.

433
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 Why can't you take my Harvard pillow, Henry?

434
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 She was, though I could ask any girl to sit on Harvard.

435
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 Why not, Henry?

436
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 Well, in the first place, it's coming out at the seams.

437
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 No, Agnes will notice that.

438
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 Agnes, I'm not going with Agnes.

439
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 I thought you were.

440
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 Mary, didn't you tell Agnes?

441
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 How are you?

442
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 Mary.

443
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 Mary, the message I gave you.

444
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 When you were going over to her house yesterday, I cooled downstairs to you.

445
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 I didn't hear you.

446
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 But you must have.

447
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,600
 I said Mary, will you please tell Agnes I can't take her to the picnic because I have a very urgent engagement

448
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:20,840
 Well, I certainly didn't understand you had a G whiz if that doesn't leave Agnes in an embarrassing position

449
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:28,340
 Why Agnes why Agnes she'll have to eat her lunch alone. Oh, no, she won't dare mother

450
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:35,120
 I couldn't take her you certainly will the level Geraldine thing you've known Agnes a great deal longer than you had Geraldine

451
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,120
 My mother haven't you caught on?

452
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,120
 I'm not fond of Agnes.

453
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,120
 If I take her I'll be embarrassed the whole afternoon.

454
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,120
 Mary, could you let me speak to Henry alone, please?

455
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,120
 Yes, mother.

456
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,120
 But I fully disapprove of the whole thing.

457
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,120
 That's because neither one of you is a boy.

458
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:54,120
 And what's more you've never had to take out Agnes?

459
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:59,120
 Henry, I realize Geraldine must be a very pretty girl.

460
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,120
 She's beautiful, Mother.

461
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:03,120
 Well, that's Grant. She's the most beautiful girl that ever lived.

462
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,120
 But don't you see how Agnes is going to feel?

463
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,120
 And her mother's always been so nice to you.

464
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,120
 Oh, don't misunderstand me, mother.

465
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,120
 I'm very fond of Agnes's mother.

466
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:15,120
 In fact, if it were a choice, I'd rather take her.

467
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:21,120
 I'm sorry, dear. I'm not going to say anything more, I see.

468
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,120
 Does that mean yes or no, mother?

469
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,120
 I've said, "All I'm going to."

470
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,120
 Henry, get me, sister, front door!

471
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,120
 Hey, Henry! I'm calling, Des.

472
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,520
 Henry, I'm in an emergency.

473
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,360
 (audience laughs)

474
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,200
 What's the matter?

475
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,480
 Do you wanna buy this knife?

476
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,480
 I'll let you have it for 50 cents.

477
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,640
 It isn't worth 50.

478
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,480
 You try to sell it to me for 50.

479
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,480
 (audience laughs)

480
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,320
 And if you don't buy it,

481
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,040
 I won't have any lunch at the picnic.

482
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:45,920
 Why not?

483
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,280
 My girl can't go.

484
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,400
 She can't, doesn't she?

485
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,240
 No.

486
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,960
 It would be your...

487
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,880
 Listen, busy.

488
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:55,280
 If I'll fix you up with one of the slullest girls

489
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,680
 you ever met in your life,

490
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:57,720
 will you give me that knife?

491
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,640
 Are you kidding me?

492
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,720
 Do you like fried chicken?

493
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:04,560
 And peanut butter sandwich and devil leg. Oh sure I do. Give me the night

494
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:08,660
 This here. Who is it? Come here while I tell up on boy. Are you one luck?

495
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:10,540
 Hello operator

496
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:13,000
 She was what she liked. She's a dream

497
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,080
 Yeah, and she's got the swallest mother

498
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:24,800
 Operator I want one at three seven three one. Let's freeze now wait a minute Henry

499
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:28,800
 Isn't that Agnes's number

500
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:35,560
 Dizzy, her mother can cook. I know, Henry, but I'm not interested. She's got a lunch basket

501
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:49,380
 that's really a laundry hamper. She has? Mm-hmm. A operator? The line's busy? Well, will

502
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:56,360
 you let me know when it isn't? Boy, am I going to have a swell time with Geraldine. You know

503
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,360
 What I'm going to do, Dizzy?

504
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,360
 Why?

505
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,360
 Well, I'm going to rent a canoe.

506
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,360
 Where'd you get the money?

507
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,360
 I sold a set of books I never read.

508
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:07,360
 And hey, look at this phonograph.

509
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,360
 Gee whiz, what did you sell?

510
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,360
 I get that.

511
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,360
 Oh nothing.

512
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,360
 Want to listen to something swell?

513
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:21,360
 Ever hear anything like it, Dizzy?

514
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,360
 I got a pillow from Princeton, too.

515
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,960
 Yeah, I'm gonna let Geraldine sit on it.

516
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,760
 Right in the middle of a canoe.

517
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,360
 And then you know what...

518
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,360
 And then what?

519
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,960
 Well, you know that capicle...

520
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,360
 ...weild on the far side of the lake?

521
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,660
 Yeah...

522
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:43,560
 Boy, is that a swell place to eat lunch?

523
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:46,160
 She would.

524
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,660
 Hello?

525
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:52,560
 Hand me what happened to the racquet?

526
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,160
 Hello, Agnes?

527
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:59,160
 Agnes, how would you like to have me arrange a very pleasant surprise?

528
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:03,160
 How would you enjoy going today with Dizzy Stevens?

529
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:06,160
 What does she say, Henry?

530
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:09,160
 Oh, no, Agnes, I think you've got the wrong idea of him.

531
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,160
 What's that?

532
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:15,160
 Oh, no, Agnes, he isn't like that.

533
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,160
 Hang up, Henry.

534
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,160
 Maybe who are you talking?

535
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,160
 Agnes, Mrs. Orrich.

536
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,160
 Henry, you are not to tell her you can't take her.

537
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,420
 - Can't take her. - Yep, but mother--

538
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:24,660
 - Did you hear me?

539
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:25,900
 - Yes.

540
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,020
 Hello Agnes.

541
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:29,460
 I'd like to go with you.

542
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:32,500
 No, I'd be very glad to.

543
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:36,860
 I'll pick you up in about an hour.

544
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:37,700
 Goodbye.

545
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:42,060
 Henry, could I have my knife?

546
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,420
 She was.

547
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:45,200
 Am I gonna have a swell time?

548
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,020
 Agnes and Geraldine both at once.

554

 Maybe she changed her mind, Henry.

555
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,760
 I'm sure Geraldine is coming. She told me she was.

556
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,760
 Aww, couldn't we get into the canoe here?

557
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:13,760
 You know, I've always wanted to go in a canoe.

558
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,760
 Haven't you ever been in one?

559
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,760
 No.

560
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,760
 Can you swim?

561
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,760
 No, I can't.

562
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:21,760
 Is that right?

563
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:25,760
 Oh, gee, look who's coming down the path.

564
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,760
 Who is it?

565
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:27,760
 Geraldine.

566
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,760
 I'll be back in the second magnet.

567
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,760
 Oh, gosh, Henry, why don't you wait here on the top?

568
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,760
 I've got to help her carry your sweater.

569
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,760
 Hello, Henry.

570
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:39,760
 Oh, I saw you came.

571
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,760
 Let me carry your sweater for you.

572
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,760
 I think you have it so much.

573
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,760
 Henry, who's that down on the dock?

574
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:49,760
 Well, it seems Geraldine there was a misunderstanding.

575
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,760
 Henry that girl isn't going with us, is she?

576
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,760
 Geraldine, she's just a friend of a family.

577
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,760
 But I asked you to go.

578
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,760
 Well, I'm here to go with you.

579
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,760
 She's really going just for my mother.

580
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,760
 Hi Geraldine.

581
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:02,760
 Now look over here.

582
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:05,760
 Oh, Erwin Cooper. I thought you couldn't come.

583
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,760
 I'm here though. Hi, Henry.

584
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,760
 Glad to see you, my boy.

585
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,760
 I'm glad to see you.

00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,760
 Oh, I'm glad to see you.

588

 Who's that calling you Henry?

589
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,560
 It's just a girl.

590
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,560
 Tell me!

591
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,560
 Yes Agnes!

592
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,560
 Tell me!

593
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,560
 What's the matter?

594
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,560
 You Henry look!

595
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:27,660
 He's got one foot on the dock and one foot on the canoe and he's holding your lunch bag

00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,160

 Pull your legs together!

 I'm going to fall in!

600
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:36,160
 Oh, put that lunch bag down Agnes!

 I'm going! I'll pull her out.

611
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,160
 It's only three feet deep.

612
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,160
 Grab a canoe, Agnes!

00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,160

 Just get off your knees.

618
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,160
 - What's that lot?

619
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,160
 Then wait in.

620
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,160
 I'm coming Henry.

00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:16,160
 Open your eyes. You're waiting the wrong way.

 Oh, James, wait a minute.

 Don't drip in the lunch basket.

 Oh, I won't, Henry. I'll just squeeze my dress out a little here and there.

00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:53,160
 Oh no, this sounds awfully warm.

634
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:57,160
 We can get in the canoe and I'll be jive by the time we get to the other side of the lake.

635
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,160
 Where's Geraldine?

636
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,160
 Oh, there she is! Look!

637
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:03,160

 ...the Renekindo.

00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:09,160
 And they took my lunch basket.

641
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:11,160
 Come on, come on, Henry.

642
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,160
 Get in this canoe with me, huh?

643
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,360
 Sure.

644
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,160
 I'll get in.

645
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:21,160
 Isn't this lucky you had this crimson pillow for me to sit on?

646
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,160
 Yeah.

647
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:26,160
 Say, did you know your hair has all come down?

648
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:29,160
 I let it down on purpose!

653
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:17,460
 You know, ladies and gentlemen, when folks get to talking about favorite desserts,

 there's one they never fail to mention, and that's "Butterscotch pry."

655
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:27,060
 Yes, the butter scotch pie is a mighty swell treat, and it's marvellously easy and inexpensive

656
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:30,980
 to make too when you make it with jello butter scotch pudding.

657
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:35,460
 Because when you use jello butter scotch pudding for the filling, you do away with all guessing.

658
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:40,820
 You save time and effort, and you make certain that every single pie will be a grand success.

659
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:45,700
 Furthermore, this rich, taffy-colored pudding gives you a pie filling that's as creamy and

660
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:48,180
 satin smooth as can be.

661
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:53,180
 You'll be delighted with its golden butterscotch flavor, its zestful, satisfying goodness.

662
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:56,180
 So furlough the lead of so many smart modern housewives.

663
00:27:56,180 --> 00:28:03,180
 Tomorrow night, treat the family to a luscious butterscotch pie made the easy way with jello butterscotch pudding.

664
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:08,180
 Ask your grocer for several packages of this tasty dessert, but be sure to say jello butterscotch pudding.

665
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:13,180
 Because only jello butterscotch pudding can give you such rich mellow enjoyment.
