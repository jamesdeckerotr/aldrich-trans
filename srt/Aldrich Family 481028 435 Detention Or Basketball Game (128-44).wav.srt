1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 It's the Irish family.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 The Irish family presented by the Jell-O family.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 J.T. F.L.L.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 Oh, mad at, oh mad at Will's back!

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 Well, my dear little talking people.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 Hey, hey, hey, why the big swoon there?

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 We're the Henry Irish Band Club.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 Oh, I see.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 Can we send him a present there to Ken Ken Ken?

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 Well, that'd be nice.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,240
 have in mind how about a big shaggy dog the kind of jumps all over you and goes

12
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:41,500
 go after black oh Henry wouldn't want any aluminum goes no Henry wouldn't work

13
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:50,520
 with the go Henry I don't know Henry I don't know if I just forget the dog why

14
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:55,360
 don't you send Henry a present that the whole family will enjoy of course why

15
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,360
 I didn't waste any of that!

16
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:02,360
 Jello, the world's most famous shimmering dessert with the six delicious flavors.

17
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:05,360
 Or any of the three flavors of Jello Tapioca Pudding.

18
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,360
 Whoa!

19
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,360
 That's the pudding with the personality.

20
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,360
 And, Dipples!

21
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:15,360
 And there's no treat in the world like those smoothest cream Jello Pudding.

22
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,360
 Ahhh!

23
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:22,360
 Henry and everybody else will swoon when they taste Jello Pudding's three delicious flavors.

24
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:51,360
 Can't you just taste that luscious light? And the chocolatey good? And the buttery brown, bonny, bonny. Scotch. Edge yellow pudding. And they're smooth as cream. But you all like them? No, not much. Oh, he's in there. Hey, look at that clock. It's time for...

25
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:57,360
 I'm for the Aldrich family based on characters originated by Clifford Goldsmith

26
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,860
 and starring Ezra Stone as Henry with Jackie Kalk as Homer.

27
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:05,360
 Henry! Henry Aldrich!

28
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,360
 Coming, mother!

29
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:21,360
 [Applause]

30
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,360
 No one has ever yet succeeded in crowding into one definition

31
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:30,360
 all the amazing characteristics of a typical teenage American boy.

32
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:35,360
 The best you can do is to say boys will be boys and let it go at that.

33
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,860
 This is a special issue of Henry Aldridge.

34
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:41,060
 The scene opens in an empty classroom at Central High.

35
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,460
 Henry, let's go. I'm hungry.

36
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:45,060
 Wait a minute, Homer.

37
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,360
 Do you hear footsteps out there in the hall?

38
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:52,760
 Sure, all the kids are going downstairs to eat their lunch, like sensible human beings.

39
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:56,560
 But do you hear any footsteps that sound like Mr. Nelson?

40
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,560
 Henry, what are you afraid of?

41
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,360
 Who's afraid? I'm not afraid.

42
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,760
 And why are you holding my hand?

43
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,060
 Look, Homer, just open the door, say.

44
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,780
 Sure, and we'll both go downstairs and eat our lunch.

45
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:14,280
 No Homer, just peek out into the hall and tell me when you see Mr. Nelson going into the teacher's room.

46
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,300
 Okay, Hen, but don't stick your head out.

47
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,740
 How can I see him if I don't stick my head out?

48
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:22,000
 But he might see you. Is that bad?

49
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,900
 Quick Homer, close the door.

50
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,480
 But Hen, we are in home.

51
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:28,760
 Here, have my lunch. I've got glue on my mind.

52
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,220
 Oh boy.

53
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:35,120
 Look, all we have to do is wait till Mr. Nelson is safely inside the teacher's room.

54
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,120
 Yeah, why?

55
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,420
 Homer, isn't it clear?

56
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:39,220
 I've got to keep out of his way.

57
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:42,020
 Although, gee whiz, it wasn't even my fault.

58
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,320
 I don't think.

59
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,220
 Hello, Wolfen.

60
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:47,220
 Knocking over the glue pot in manual training.

61
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:51,820
 Besides, I was just doing, willy, a good turn by helping him knock his block off.

62
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:53,220
 Helping him, Mom?

63
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,220
 Knock his block off!

64
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:55,720
 Knock his block off!

65
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:59,820
 He went and put one block too many in his inlay breadboard.

66
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:03,080
 And you knocked over a whole pot of glue?

67
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,880
 No, gee, was it was only half full?

68
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,380
 Or Mr. Nelson threw a fit?

69
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:10,480
 You know what really made a man?

70
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,620
 He stepped in the glue, see?

71
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,560
 And walked right out of his shoe.

72
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,760
 [LAUGHTER]

73
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:19,140
 And right there in the toe of his sock

74
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:21,460
 was about the biggest hole I've ever seen.

75
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:22,980
 [LAUGHTER]

76
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,900
 Me, whiz.

77
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,340
 Gee, you don't ever think of teachers

78
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:31,340
 being real human beings with holes in their socks, do you?

79
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:35,340
 And I'm not sure, but I think he had one in the heel, too.

80
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,340
 Why, him?

81
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:39,340
 Sure. So tell me the truth.

82
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:43,340
 Do you think I deserve to get a detention for a little thing like that?

83
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:46,340
 She was to Mr. Nelson, give you a detention?

84
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:50,340
 Not yet. That's why I'm avoiding him. All he said was he'd look into the glue

85
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:51,340
 pod later.

86
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,340
 Oh, somebody's coming.

87
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,340
 Well, can we, my peanut butter sandwich?

88
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:56,340
 under the desk.

89
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,340
 Henry, you're sitting on.

90
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,340
 Stop squirming Homer, we'll show.

91
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:02,340
 How could we?

92
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:06,340
 Henry, my goodness, what are you and Homer doing under that desk?

93
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,340
 Kathleen, I thought you were.

94
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,340
 Homer, get up.

95
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:11,340
 I can't, I'm underneath.

96
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,340
 Hi Kathleen.

97
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:13,340
 Hi Kathleen.

98
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:16,340
 My goodness, I was just talking about you.

99
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:17,340
 Allow me Kathleen.

100
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:20,340
 Homer, what could I possibly say about you?

101
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:21,340
 That's true.

102
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:24,340
 It was about the basketball game this afternoon, Henry.

103
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:27,340
 Yeah, the basketball game.

104
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:30,340
 And my goodness, the silliest thing happened.

105
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:33,340
 Guess who asked me to go to the game with him, Charlie Clark?

106
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:34,340
 Charlie Clark?

107
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:36,340
 Well, you know how he pesters me.

108
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:38,340
 He even wanted to take me out for soda afterwards.

109
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:42,340
 My goodness, I suppose he thinks I'd be the envy of all the girls if I went with him.

110
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:44,340
 Wouldn't maybe envy a Shivu in with Henry.

111
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:46,340
 Homer, don't be ridiculous.

112
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:48,340
 Cross home, don't be ridiculous.

113
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:50,340
 Kathleen, what's so ridiculous about that?

114
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:57,340
 And Henry, Charlie said, "If at the last minute you couldn't take me to the game to let him know."

115
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:58,340
 Oh, he did.

116
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,340
 Well, Gee, what did he mean by that?

117
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:02,340
 Well, that's what I wondered.

118
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:04,340
 You are going to take me out to Henry.

119
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:06,340
 Well, sure, Kathleen, absolutely.

120
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:10,340
 I might be, well, a couple of minutes late, but I'll be there.

121
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11,340
 I'm pretty sure.

122
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,340
 There's nothing wrong with her, Henry.

123
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,340
 The wrong?

124
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:15,340
 She was, no.

125
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:16,340
 Everything...

126
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:19,340
 The things have never been better, I think.

127
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:20,340
 I think.

128
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,840
 Then why are you in Homer waiting here in this classroom?

129
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:27,340
 Why, uh, why, do we, we, we lie here?

130
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,340
 Where it's quiet.

131
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:31,340
 Oh, well then I'll meet you at Miss Travis' classroom at 3.45.

132
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:32,340
 Sure.

133
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:38,340
 Oh, Kathleen is, um, is, uh, anybody out in the hall?

134
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,340
 No, Henry.

135
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:41,340
 The coast is clear, Homer, come on.

136
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,340
 Nobody can miss Nelson, bye.

137
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:44,340
 Mr. Nelson?

138
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,340
 Sure, Henry.

139
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:46,340
 Here he comes down the hall.

140
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:47,340
 Oh boy, oh, oh, look.

141
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,340
 Look, look.

142
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:52,620
 I'll be taking a drink from the water fountain here. You stand in front of me. Okay, bend over.

143
00:06:52,620 --> 00:07:17,860
 Act nonchalant, Homer. Manchalant. Oh, Homer. Oh, gee. Hello, Mr. Nelson. How are you? Just fine. How are you? Oh, I'm fine. That's fine. Fine. Now, would you mind stepping aside, Homer? I'd like to get a drink. A drink? If you're pleased. Of water? Unless they've started putting soda pop in the fountains.

144
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:22,360
 That would be an awfully good idea, don't you think?

145
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,660
 A hallmark step aside.

146
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:24,660
 Yes, sir.

147
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,660
 Why, Henry?

148
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:28,660
 Why, Mr. Nelson?

149
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:32,960
 Gee, the one person in school, I...

150
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,960
 The one person I...

151
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,660
 You wanted to speak to me, Henry.

152
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:40,860
 Yes, sir, I just want to apologize for that little accident this morning in manual training.

153
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:41,860
 Which accident do you mean?

154
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:47,180
 When I accidentally and through no fold of my own helped knock over the glue pot, you

155
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:49,540
 You mean you were the one who knocked it over?

156
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:50,740
 You mean you didn't know?

157
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:52,260
 (audience laughing)

158
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:54,780
 Well, Henry, as much as I admire your honesty.

159
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:55,620
 - Yes, sir.

160
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,260
 - I'm afraid I'll have to give you a detention.

161
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,820
 Mr. Bradley's rules, you know.

162
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:00,180
 - A detention?

163
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,020
 This afternoon?

164
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,900
 - Yes, Henry, in my room right after school.

165
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:03,820
 - But Mr. Nelson.

166
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,820
 - Now if you'll excuse me, I'm eating my lunch here

167
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:06,660
 on the teacher's room.

168
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:07,500
 - Oh boy.

169
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,060
 Hello then, Elsie.

170
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:11,140
 - How are you, Prescott?

171
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,020
 This seat taken?

172
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:15,820
 - No, go ahead, I just came from band practice.

173
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:16,980
 Have you got an aspirin?

174
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:20,580

00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,580
 Frankly, I'm hungry.

189
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:50,420
 Why, I was just wondering, Mr. Nelson,

190
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:52,520
 was it this afternoon you said you wanted me

191
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,760
 to take my detention?

192
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,600
 It was.

193
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,700
 What was it tomorrow afternoon?

194
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:56,760
 It was this afternoon.

195
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,600
 Not tomorrow?

196
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,800
 Henry, that's all right, Mr. Nelson.

197
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,340
 I'll be glad to stay after school.

198
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:08,340
 Only, what do you think our basketball team is going to do

199
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:09,140
 today?

200
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:13,260
 What they usually do, lose.

201
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,300
 Mr. Nelson, did I tell you how sorry I am,

202
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:21,320
 knocked over your sock. I mean you glue. I'm sorry too Henry. I know. Was that all you

203
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:25,020
 had just hope your shoes are all right. They will be once I get them loose from

204
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:29,060
 the floor up there. Well see whiz what do you wear these Jim shoes are very

205
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:34,020
 comfortable Jim shoe. I had to borrow them from Charlie Clark. Charlie. Oh boy

206
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:37,900
 the Mr. Nelson about to say about this afternoon. This afternoon Henry I'll

207
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:44,820
 see you at 3.30. Yes sir just before the basketball game. That's right. Oh now if

208
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:45,820
 If you'll excuse me.

209
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:50,420
 Who was that Nelson?

210
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:51,420
 The Orbridge boy.

211
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:52,020
 Yes.

212
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,420
 What do you want coming in here?

213
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:54,220
 He didn't say.

214
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:55,620
 Nice boy, that Henry.

215
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:57,520
 Are you sure you haven't gotten your aspirin?

216
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,220
 Positive.

217
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:01,620
 I hated that to give him a detention, but you know how Mr. Bradley is.

218
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:02,820
 I sure do.

219
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:05,820
 Have to keep your finger on everybody's pulse, you know.

220
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:09,420
 Speaking of pose, look who just came in.

221
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:11,620
 Well, well, Miss Trevor.

222
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:12,620
 That's a nail.

223
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:14,620
 Here, here, have my chair, Miss Trevor.

224
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:15,620
 No, I have Mark.

225
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:17,620
 Why don't I just take this empty one right here?

226
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,620
 What's that in the basket, Miss Trevor?

227
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,120
 Apples. I just cleaned out my desk.

228
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,120
 Anyone like that?

229
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,120
 No, thank you.

230
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:23,620
 I'll have one.

231
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:24,620
 Well, I'll have one, too.

232
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:26,620
 Will you have one of my letters, then, which is Miss Trevor?

233
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,620
 No, thank you. I can only stay a minute.

234
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:31,620
 Mr. Nelson, about the basketball game this afternoon...

235
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:33,620
 I'm certainly sorry you can't go with me, Miss Trevor.

236
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:37,620
 Well, as a matter of fact, Mr. Nelson, I got those papers marked last night.

237
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,620
 Oh? So I will be able to go with you after all.

238
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:40,620
 Well, why, that's great.

239
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:41,620
 Yes, but...

240
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:45,620
 Well Nelson didn't you say you had a detention this afternoon?

241
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:46,620
 Say I'd forgotten all about that.

242
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:47,620
 Oh that's too big.

243
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:50,620
 I'll tell you what Miss Trevor, I don't mind being second choice.

244
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:51,620
 What?

245
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,620
 I suppose I pick you up at your room at 3.30.

246
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,620
 Well I just a minute, I can get out of this detention.

247
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,620
 Oh no you can't Nelson.

248
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:59,620
 Miss Trevor I'll pick you up at 3.30.

249
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:01,620
 No no wait a minute press stop.

250
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:11,620
 (music)

251
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:13,620
 Thank you, operator. I'll wait.

252
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,620
 But, Henry, why are you phoning your mother?

253
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:18,620
 I'm just using my head, Homer. I can get out of this detention.

254
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:19,620
 You can.

255
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:25,620
 If I can just replace that glue I spilled, I'm pretty sure Mr. Nelson will be reasonable about the whole thing.

256
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,620
 Hello?

257
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,620
 Now, get out of the phone booth, Homer.

258
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,620
 Hello, mother.

259
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:33,220
 Henry, why aren't you in school?

260
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:34,220
 I am.

261
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:36,220
 I'm right here in Ms. Shae's booth.

262
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:38,820
 You're not in any kind of trouble, are you, dear?

263
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:39,820
 Trouble?

264
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:42,220
 Oh, see, why do you say anything like that?

265
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:47,420
 I just happen to be passing the phone, see, and I have five minutes before my next class.

266
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:48,420
 Yeah.

267
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:49,420
 And, yeah.

268
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:52,420
 And, uh, how are you?

269
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,020
 Come on, fine.

270
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:56,420
 Is that all you phone for?

271
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:59,420
 Sure, and could you please send Mary down here with a can of glue?

272
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:01,060
 The kind of what?

273
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:05,020
 Glue mother glue. What you used to stick shoes to. I mean furniture lay.

274
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:07,260
 Yeah, what do you want glue for?

275
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:12,700
 For manual training. The can they had sort of ran out, see,

276
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:17,180
 and well I thought it might help matters if I supplied them with an extra one.

277
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:21,020
 That's very nice of you Henry, but can't it wait until tomorrow?

278
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:24,900
 No, Gee was if I don't get it today, I'll probably get a detention.

279
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:25,740
 What's that?

280
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,460
 Oh, her, oh boy.

281
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:29,460
 Henry, did you say a detention?

282
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:31,960
 Look, Mother, will you please tell Mary to run all the way?

283
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,960
 Goodbye.

284
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,960
 Henry, I'm glad I found you.

285
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:36,960
 Yes, Mr. Nelson.

286
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,960
 I've been thinking over what you said to me in the teacher's room.

287
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,960
 See, I didn't mean anything by that.

288
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:41,960
 I know.

289
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,960
 But when you said you thought your detention was tomorrow...

290
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,960
 Oh, I realize now that it's today.

291
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:46,960
 But, Henry...

292
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:51,960
 I wondered what you'd think, Mr. Nelson, if I were to replace the glue, I spilled.

293
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,960
 That won't be necessary, Henry.

294
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,960
 You mean it wouldn't help matters, any?

295
00:12:55,960 --> 00:13:02,480
 Henry and view of the fact that you did clean up all the glue all except what spattered into the band saw you spattered glue

296
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,480
 I'm a band saw you mean you didn't know

297
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:11,800
 Well, Henry even if you did and I realized mr. Nelson that you have to punish me for it

298
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:15,600
 He was if you teachers didn't keep discipline around here

299
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:21,120
 Who would well Henry what I had in mind was that was mr. Nelson?

300
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,760
 I hope you won't think I'm being forward, but mr. Nelson

301
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:30,320
 What would you think of this or what how would you like to have sort of a right hand all the rest of the year?

302
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,080
 What's that gee?

303
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:36,760
 I'll clean up a manual training room and sharpen the chisels and carry messages for you and help you mark papers

304
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:40,900
 No, Henry. I don't I'll do anything if you'll just release me from that detention today

305
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:47,620
 Anything you ever asked me to do mr. Nelson no matter what it is Henry. I certainly appreciate your offer

306
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:49,620
 She was you do therefore Henry

307
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,600
 Yes, mr. Bradley

308
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:59,920
 Certainly, Mr. Bradley. Mr. Nelson about my property. I'll be back in a minute Henry. Wait right there. Sure. Mr. Nelson. I'd be glad to

309
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:06,720
 Sit down please. Thank you, Mr. Bradley

310
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,240
 Now then mr. Nelson

311
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:14,280
 Something quite serious has just happened. Oh, oh it has it has oh

312
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:21,160
 I've just received the call from a mother who claims that we're forcing her boy to supply glue from annual training

313
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,160
 What's that?

314
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,800
 And Mr. Nelson.

315
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:28,640
 When this mother pointed out that she pays taxes, to buy just such items as glue, you

316
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,640
 can imagine my position.

317
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,640
 Yes, yes sir.

318
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,800
 I was without an answer, Mr. Nelson.

319
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,800
 Yes sir.

320
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:37,320
 But Mr. Nelson, if you ran out of glue in manual training this morning, may I ask why

321
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,040
 you didn't report it to me?

322
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,520
 But Mr. Bradley, we have plenty of glue in manual training for lacquer that we're out

323
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,520
 of.

324
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,520
 Or is it varnish?

325
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,440
 No, no, I'm sure it's lacquer.

326
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,440
 You're sure?

327
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,440
 Yes sir.

328
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,440
 You're quite sure.

329
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,520
 Why, I'm almost sure sir.

330
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:53,880
 I see. So, Mr. Nelson, you claim you have plenty of glue.

331
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:54,480
 Yes, sir.

332
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,120
 Now, would you please tell me how many pots?

333
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:02,040
 Why, we have somewhere between--

334
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,040
 Well, I know we have plenty, Mr. Bradley.

335
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,960
 But I see.

336
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:09,120
 Mr. Nelson, when the school board asked me how many students

337
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,080
 we had registered in Central Hyde, do you think I replied plenty?

338
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:13,640
 No, sir.

339
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,440
 No, sir.

340
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,360
 I replied.

341
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,880
 I replied.

342
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,320
 I told them how many we had.

343
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,320
 Yes sir.

344
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:26,880
 It appears to me, Mr. Nelson, that it must be quite difficult for you to teach manual

345
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,280
 training with only vague ideas to the amount of your supplies.

346
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,280
 Yes sir.

347
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,280
 You admit it's difficult.

348
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,560
 Why, it isn't exactly that easy.

349
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,720
 That would be easier if you knew what you had in the store room.

350
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,200
 Oh yes, yes sir, Mr. Bradley.

351
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,200
 Much easier.

352
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,880
 And then I'm sure you'll agree with me that you ought to take a complete inventory of

353
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,440
 your manual training room supplies.

354
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,440
 Yes sir.

355
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,440
 Very well.

356
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,940
 Right after your last class this afternoon, Mr. Nelson,

357
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:52,300
 and I got all the figures on my desk by five o'clock.

358
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,000
 This afternoon, Mr. Bradley?

359
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,340
 I mean, you don't need tomorrow afternoon.

360
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:58,420
 I mean, this afternoon?

361
00:15:58,420 --> 00:15:59,100
 Oh.

362
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,860
 That will be all, Mr. Nelson.

363
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:01,940
 Yes, Mr. Bradley.

364
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:04,060
 And, well, thank you, sir.

365
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:07,660
 We have to keep our finger on everybody's pulse, you know.

366
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:08,460
 Yes, sir.

367
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:09,860
 I know.

368
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:11,020
 Here I am, Mr. Nelson.

369
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:12,180
 I'm still waiting.

370
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,060
 Waiting for what?

371
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:15,220
 Waiting for your answer to my proposition.

372
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:18,220
 You know about my helping you whenever you need help.

373
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:20,220
 Oh yes, Henry, I remember.

374
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:23,220
 Please report to the storeroom at 3.30 this afternoon.

375
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:26,220
 - This afternoon? - Oh, we're going to take inventory.

376
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:30,220
 And since it may take three or four hours, you better get some sandwiches from the cafeteria.

377
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:32,220
 Sandwiches, you mean we'll be that? But Mr. Nelson?

378
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:34,220
 That's all right, Henry, just charge them to me.

379
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:35,220
 But Mr. Nelson!

380
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:36,220
 Hey, Henry!

381
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:38,220
 - What, Homer? - He caught her.

382
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:39,220
 You caught who?

383
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:44,220
 Kathleen, like you just told me to. And I told you we're taking her out for a soda after the basketball game.

384
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:51,220
 Homer you didn't. And she was so excited she kissed me. Oh boy. So I flew in a movie. Oh boy.

385
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:12,180
 Now I don't have to tell you folks how good jello puddings are.

386
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:16,940
 Yes, jello, chocolate, butter, scotch, and vanilla puddings, a trio of treats,

387
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:19,940
 chock full of old-fashioned homemade goodness.

388
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:23,060
 And say, ever try chocolate peppermint pudding?

389
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:27,980
 Just prepare one package of smooth, velvety jello chocolate pudding as usual.

390
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:32,420
 While still warm, add crushed peppermint stick candy, let it chill,

391
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:35,780
 then top with whipped cream and sprigs of mint.

392
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:40,920
 Three jello puddings made with milk are nourishing, and they cook to perfection in just about

393
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,260
 five minutes.

394
00:17:42,260 --> 00:18:02,180
 No wonder more people buy jello puddings than any other prepared puddings in the world.

395
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:05,180
 Now getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldrich.

396
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:10,180
 Henry's plans to take Kathleen to a basketball game this afternoon

397
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:14,180
 have been shattered by an after-school detention for Mr. Nelson.

398
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:16,580
 As a result of his efforts to avoid it,

399
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:22,180
 Henry and Mr. Nelson are now tied up for the whole afternoon taking inventory.

400
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:24,980
 The scene opens in Mr. Aldrich's office.

401
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:26,980
 It is later the same afternoon.

402
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,180
 Hello.

403
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:30,380
 Hello. Is that Mr. Aldrich?

404
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,780
 Yes. Is that you, Homer?

405
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:34,980
 Sure. Gee, how are you?

406
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,580
 Well, I'm fine.

407
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:41,580
 Mr. Aldrich, Henry wants to know if you'd mind having your secretary, Miss Thompson,

408
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:44,580
 run down here to school with your adding machine.

409
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,580
 Adding machine? What for?

410
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:51,780
 To speed things up. And while she's here, would you mind if Henry borrowed Miss Thompson?

411
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:52,780
 What's that?

412
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:58,380
 Then maybe he could polish this whole thing off in an hour and see the finish of the basketball game anyway.

413
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,380
 Well, what on earth are you talking about?

414
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:03,340
 an inventory, Mr. Allrich, in manual training.

415
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:04,740
 Henry's taking inventory?

416
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:05,740
 Yes, sir.

417
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:07,820
 But isn't that a teacher's job?

418
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:10,140
 Sure. Mr. Nelson's helping him.

419
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:12,740
 Yes, the word is Henry coming up.

420
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:14,900
 Why aren't some of the other teachers helping Mr. Nelson?

421
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:18,060
 Right. There don't seem to be any available.

422
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:20,740
 I think they're all going to the basketball game.

423
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:21,660
 Yeah?

424
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,540
 And not being that work off on the students?

425
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:24,180
 Oh, no.

426
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:27,540
 It's just that Mr. Nelson and Henry sort of felt Henry

427
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:29,580
 should help Mr. Nelson.

428
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,580
 Now just a minute, let's get to the bottom of this.

429
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:35,180
 The bottom? I think Henry would just assume you didn't.

430
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:35,680
 What's that?

431
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:38,580
 He just assumed you forgot the whole thing. Goodbye.

432
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:41,180
 Homer, wait! Homer, come back here!

433
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:53,580
 Can't you write all this down faster, Henry?

434
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:54,580
 Yes, Mr. Nelson.

435
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:55,580
 Fifty-three hacksaw blades.

436
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:57,580
 Fifty-three hacksaw blades.

437
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:01,980
 two kegs three inch nails two kegs three inch nail twenty six parts of glue

 g_ mister nelson do you mind if i ask you a personal question or what is it

447
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:30,420
 Frankly, do you think Charlie Clark is so handsome?

448
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:32,860
 Yeah, I suppose he is, to a girl.

449
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:34,780
 See, I hope not.

450
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:38,220
 You know who I'd really call handsome?

451
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:40,060
 That Mr. Prescott, for instance.

452
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:41,140
 That's got it.

453
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:44,100
 Let's get back to our inventory.

454
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:47,820
 She was at home, Mr. Nelson, would you mind if I stepped out of the store?

455
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:49,820
 I'm just a second and had a word with my friend.

456
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:51,140
 All right, but don't take more in a minute.

457
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:52,140
 I won't.

458
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:54,260
 Give me, I just found your father and it's no use.

459
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:54,940
 Why not?

460
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:56,940
 I started asking too many questions.

461
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:59,640
 Oh boy, then there's only one thing to do.

462
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:02,640
 Homer, you've got to take Kathleen to the basketball game for me.

463
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,140
 I do.

464
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:05,440
 Here are the tickets and here's the money for the sodas.

465
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,140
 And don't let her even talk to Charlie Clark.

466
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:09,840
 Okay, sure.

467
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,040
 It'll be a pleasure.

468
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:14,040
 And be sure she has a real good time, Homer.

469
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,040
 Oh boy.

470
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,040
 [laughter]

471
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,040
 I'll say I will.

472
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,040
 Hey, wait a minute.

473
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,540
 What do you mean by that?

474
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:23,540
 Oh boy.

475
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:24,540
 [laughter]

476
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:27,040
 And then I'll wait Homer, let's talk this over.

477
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:27,540
 Oh, Homer.

478
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:29,040
 Yes, Mr. Nelson.

479
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,140
 Will you drop this case as a motto soup off

480
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:32,540
 in domestic science on your way down?

481
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:34,540
 I'd be glad to, Mr. Nelson.

482
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:36,540
 Is it creamed or clear?

483
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:38,540
 Never mind, just get it down there right away.

484
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:39,540
 The Homer.

485
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:41,540
 Well, on hand, it's thanks for everything.

486
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:42,540
 The Homer, come back here.

487
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:44,540
 Something wrong, Henry?

488
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:48,540
 Mr. Nelson, did you see that look on Homer's face?

489
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:49,540
 What about it?

490
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:53,540
 She was, I'd be better off if she went to the game with Charlie.

491
00:21:53,540 --> 00:22:03,080
 [Music]

492
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,380
 But home are the game stars in 10 minutes!

493
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:08,640
 No, do you mind if I set this case of soup down?

494
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,080
 Where's Henry? I've been waiting and waiting!

495
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,780
 That's what I want to talk to you about, Kathleen.

496
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:15,580
 Guess who you're going to the game with?

497
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:16,480
 Not Henry?

498
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,100
 No, he has to take inventory up in the store.

499
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,120
 Inventory?

500
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:22,020
 So guess who's taking you to the game?

501
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:23,260
 Not Charlie Clark.

502
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:24,260
 Guess again.

503
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,760
 Oh my god, who?

504
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,760
 Me.

505
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:27,760
 You?

506
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,760
 Sure.

507
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,760
 I'm going to the game with you.

508
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:31,760
 Sure.

509
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:32,760
 Right out in public?

510
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:37,760
 And I'm taking you off for a soda afterward.

511
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,760
 What do you say about that?

512
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,760
 Oh, I'm speechless.

513
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:40,760
 I thought you would be.

514
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:43,760
 And I must say you certainly have your nerd.

515
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,760
 Why?

516
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:47,960
 Sneaking around behind your best friend's back and trying to steal his girlfriend right

517
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:48,960
 from under his nose.

518
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,260
 But Kathleen, he gave you to me.

519
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:54,260
 Henry Aldrich would never do a thing like that to me.

520
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:56,460
 Kathleen, are you insulting me?

521
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:57,660
 Goodbye, Homer.

522
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:58,860
 Where are you going?

523
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:01,760
 I'm going up to the storeroom and help Henry take inventory.

524
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,760
 But Kathleen's students aren't allowed up there without permission.

525
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,460
 I'll get in somehow.

526
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:07,960
 Okay, Kathleen.

527
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:08,960
 That's your attitude.

528
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,460
 Where's my tomato soup?

529
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:10,960
 Right there.

530
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,160
 Okay, and see if I ever speak to you the one of you again.

531
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,160
 Homer, watch where you're going.

532
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,460
 Just where you ever want me to...

533
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:18,760
 Come and look up the day!

534
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:35,760
 What was that again, Mr. Aldridge?

535
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:40,760
 I just said, Mr. Bradley, that I don't want you to think of me as a complaining parent.

536
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,760
 Oh, no, no, of course not, Mr. Aldridge.

537
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:46,760
 Why, one of my greatest pleasures, his principal, is hearing from our parents.

538
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,760
 Well, that's fine, Mr. Bradley.

539
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:53,760
 Now, I realize it's a small thing, but my boy has his heart set on going to that basketball game this afternoon.

540
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,760
 Of course he has.

541
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:59,760
 And it seems to be just a bit unfair to force him to take an inventory just because all the teachers want to go to the game.

542
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,760
 Oh, is that what's happened, Mr. Aldridge?

543
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,760
 Didn't you know, Mr. Bradley?

544
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:05,760
 Oh, why?

545
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,760
 I assume you know what's going on in your own school.

546
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,760
 Well, I do, Mr. Aldridge. I do.

547
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:13,760
 I do. As a matter of fact, I was just about to clamp down on that very thing.

548
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:14,760
 I'm glad to hear it, Mr. Bradley.

549
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:15,760
 Mr. Bradley.

550
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,760
 Although I'm sure Mr. Aldrich, you'll agree with me.

551
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,760
 Our teachers ought to attend the school basketball game.

552
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:21,760
 Certainly, Mr. Bradley.

553
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:25,760
 Just as long as they don't neglect their own work and keep students from attending.

554
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,760
 They are entirely right, Mr. Aldrich.

555
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,760
 I'll look into Henry immediately. Thank you for calling.

556
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,760
 Thank you, Mr. Bradley. Goodbye.

557
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,760
 Goodbye, Mr. Aldrich. Let's hear from you again.

558
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:38,760
 Miss Say! Miss Say!

559
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,760
 Yes, Mr. Bradley!

560
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,760
 Miss Say! Have all the teachers go to the game this afternoon?

561
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,560
 Well, I'm not sure, Mr. Badman.

562
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,720
 No, not sure.

563
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,600
 Miss Shea, as my secretary, it seems to me

564
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,200
 you ought to know what's going on in this school.

565
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,000
 Yes, Mr. Badman.

566
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,920
 Didn't any of the teachers have papers to mark

567
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,400
 or lessons to prepare?

568
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,680
 Didn't any of them have detention?

569
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,340
 Well--

570
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:56,280
 Yes, Miss Shea.

571
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58,120
 Well, Mr. Nelson is taking inventory.

572
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,240
 Inventory.

573
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,040
 Go up there and tell Henry Aldrich I

574
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,360
 want to see him immediately.

575
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:05,840
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

576
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:16,840
 This is Stillmas Trevor's classroom isn't it Mr. Nelson?

577
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:17,840
 Henry, I'm beginning to wonder.

578
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,840
 This is where Kathleen said to me,

579
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,840
 "She was, I wonder where they are."

580
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,840
 We're only a few minutes late.

581
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,840
 Henry, are you sure Mr. Bradley said to drop the inventory?

582
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:27,840
 Positive, Mr. Nelson.

583
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,840
 He was as nice as pie.

584
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:30,840
 That's strange.

585
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:36,840
 strange. He said to go to the game and to remember all the good plays so I could tell my father.

586
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:42,840
 Oh, there's Mr. Trevor now. And Kathleen too. Hi Kathleen, I'm glad to see you.

587
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:45,840
 Hello Henry. Listen, I'll speak to you alone for a minute.

588
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,840
 Well, of course. What if I'm afraid to do that?

589
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:51,840
 Boy Kathleen, let's get going to the game. I'm finally all straightened out.

590
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:56,840
 You are? Well look. For a while I was pretty worried Kathleen. I thought I'd never get to take you.

591
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:59,240
 Well everything's alright now, come on.

592
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,940
 But that's just it Henry. I can't go.

593
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:03,940
 You can't go. Why not?

594
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:06,540
 Henry, I was only on my way to help you with your inventory.

595
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:07,340
 Oh, Kathy.

596
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:08,640
 Who am I going to do, Mr. Bradley?

597
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,340
 You have to excuse Kathy.

598
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:12,840
 Henry, she has a two-hour detention this afternoon.

599
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:13,840
 A detention?

600
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,840
 Yes, here in Miss Trevor's room.

601
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,840
 Henry, what would you think of a young lady who climbs around on fire escapes?

602
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,840
 Fire escapes, Kathleen.

603
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:22,840
 Oh, Miss Trevor.

604
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,140
 Yes, Mr. Bradley.

605
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:25,740
 Miss sooner you'll begin your detention.

606
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:28,380
 The sooner you will be free to talk to Mr. Nelson.

607
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:30,080
 She was Kathleen.

608
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:34,480
 Gee, you mean I have to go to the basketball game with somebody like Homer?

609
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,880
 Homer, Cacko-Ezer.

610
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:36,720
 He can?

611
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,720
 He's down in the nurse's office there reviving him with tomato soup.

612
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,360
 [laughter]

613
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,760
 Sorry, I can't go to the game with you, Mr. Nelson.

614
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,760
 I'm sorry too, Mr. Trevor.

615
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,760
 Come along, Kathleen.

616
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,760
 Goodbye, Henry.

617
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,760
 Goodbye, Kathleen.

618
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,760
 [sighs]

619
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:58,760
 She was... I know exactly how you feel, Henry.

620
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,760
 Mr. Nelson.

621
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,760
 Yes, Henry?

622
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:06,760
 Mr. Nelson, how would you like to go to the basketball game with me?

623
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:09,760
 I'd be delighted, Henry. Let's go.

624
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:25,360
 [Music]

625
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,960
 Henry, are you still mad?

626
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,560
 Because Kathleen just happened to accidentally kiss me.

627
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,360
 Henry.

628
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,160
 Huh?

629
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,760
 Won't you even speak to me?

630
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,560
 Henry.

631
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,760
 Huh?

632
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,760
 Mr. Seymour.

633
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:41,760
 Ah, yes, Homer.

634
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:45,760
 Will you ask Henry why he won't shake hands with me and end this whole thing?

635
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:50,760
 A sure thing, but first let me tell the folks about the happiest ending a meal ever came to.

636
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:55,760
 Yep, it's jello. The luscious shimmering dessert everybody goes for,

637
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:59,760
 because you just can't beat jello for tempting fruit-like goodness.

638
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:05,760
 In any one of those six delicious flavors, strawberry, raspberry, cherry, orange, lemon, or lime.

639
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:11,160
 lime. Every jello flavor is a special treat in itself, rich with that famous

640
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:16,520
 locked-in goodness. Flavors sealed right in by a special process so it can't get

641
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:22,680
 out till your first delectable spoonful. And that's why jello is America's

642
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:26,320
 favorite gelatin dessert.

643
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:38,500
 Here's hoping you'll be in your living room and ours next week at the same time.

644
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,880
 Good night folks.

645
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:48,880
 The Aldrich family starring Ezra Stone is Henry with Jackie Kalka's Homer.

646
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:52,880
 It's written by Patricia Joudry and Del Dinsdale with music by Jack Miller.

647
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:57,880
 Mr. and Mrs. Aldrich are House Jamison and Catherine Rod.

648
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:00,880
 And this is Dan Seymour in New York saying,

649
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:05,120
 The Aldrich family is brought to you by the Jell-O family.

650
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:10,000
 For dessert that are delicious,

651
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,440
 I believe me, you should know!

652
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:19,280
 They are made by famous J-E-L-L-O!

653
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:35,120
 Listen again next Thursday, same time, same station, to another sparkling half hour with the Aldrich family.

654
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:41,120
 This is NBC, the national broadcasting company.
