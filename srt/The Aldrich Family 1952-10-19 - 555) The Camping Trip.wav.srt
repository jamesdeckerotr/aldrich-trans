1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 In just a moment enjoy the Aldrich family.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 But first this is Bob McKenzie.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 A little later this evening, why not stop off at the Phil Harris Alice Faye household just for last?

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 As another Sunday feature theater guild on the air will star John Lund and Vivekka Lindfors

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 in Robert Nathan's heartwarming story of two refugees from war to Europe in their flight to freedom.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 Our story is titled The Seagull Cry.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 Then for mystery fans, there's another dragnet case history

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 and our newest Sunday show, Barry Craig,

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 a confidential investigator.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 Just stay tuned to this station,

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 and now it's the Aldrich family on NBC.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 [music]

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 Henry! Henry Aldrich!

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 Coming, mother!

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 [applause]

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 Yes, it's the Aldrich family as transcribed written by Clifford Goldsmith.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 Someone once said that when you finally grow up and leave your teenage behind you,

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 it's like being expelled from paradise. You can't ever go back.

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 But there's one thing you can do.

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,200
 You can recall that wonderful time of your life in the misadventures of Henry Aldrich

21
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:32,360
 The scene opens in the Aldrich living room. It's mid-afternoon now listen Mary for the last time

22
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:38,720
 I'm not gonna ask you again. Where is it? I don't have it Henry. All right, Mary. All right. Just remember

23
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:43,680
 I'm not gonna ask you again good wish I go around humiliating myself. That's what I say sure

24
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:50,400
 The last time Mary where'd you put it? Henry I give you my word. I don't know where it is anymore than you do

25
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:53,700
 All right, Mary, but I just want you to know that I know you took it.

26
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,000
 Mary took what, Henry?

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 My...

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 Nothing, Mother. Nothing at all.

29
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,500
 Now, wait a minute, Mary. Don't go upstairs.

30
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,500
 I'd like to make you a proposition.

31
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,800
 Now, Mary?

32
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,800
 But, Mary, will you let me start your bureau?

33
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,400
 If I promise to put everything back...

34
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,000
 No!

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 Henry?

36
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,600
 Sam!

37
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,400
 Hello, Father.

38
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,900
 Dear, why in the world are you coming home from the office at this time of day?

39
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,400
 But a very special reason.

40
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,900
 Now, let me forget this envelope.

41
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:18,800
 Envelope?

42
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,800
 Is that why...

43
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:24,720
 with you please call Mary and tell you want to downstairs at once what for she

44
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:29,400
 locked herself in a room and Rick would you come in here and just a minute father

45
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:35,120
 I have to go outside for something and why are you home so early well all summer

46
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,480
 I've been saying that sometime Henry and I ought to pack up and go off on a

47
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:43,080
 camping trip here you want going on a camping trip in October on you why not

48
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:48,760
 I'm all caught up at the office October Alice there's a tang in the air all the

49
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,720
 leaves are starting to turn color. It's a wonderful idea.

50
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:56,880
 What is there so wonderful about sleeping on the hard, damp ground with trees dripping

51
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,880
 things on you all night?

52
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:03,720
 Here gets the poison out of your system. I'll come back a new man and after all I did promise

53
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,280
 Henry. I'm sure he's forgotten all about it.

54
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,400
 I'll hear you'll enjoy it. I'll hear you'll enjoy it.

55
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,200
 How long will you be gone? Oh maybe two or three nights.

56
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,440
 Sam Aldry.

57
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,880
 No, there. What do you think he's called Henry?

58
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:15,880
 Where is he?

59
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,380
 He ran out in the yard and got the ladder out of the garage,

60
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:20,880
 and now he's putting it up to my window.

61
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:24,380
 Henry, will you please take that ladder back?

62
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:26,380
 Mother, he practically is!

63
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:28,380
 Listen, Mary, for the last time.

64
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:29,380
 Good.

65
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:32,880
 See?

66
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,380
 Did you hurt yourself?

67
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:37,380
 Don't let her arrive.

68
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:38,380
 I think.

69
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:40,880
 Henry!

70
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,880
 This is all right, Father. I can fix your ladder.

71
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,880
 Will you please come in the house?

72
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:56,200
 There Alice is a good example of why I should take Henry on a trip. He needs to get away from the house

73
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,640
 What's wrong with the house?

74
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:05,520
 Nothing nothing. It's just that Henry needs to work off a little of that energy out in the fresh air theory was just out in the yard

75
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,160
 That isn't the same thing

76
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,200
 What Henry?

77
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,720
 Did that ladder cost a great deal Henry? Yes, sir

78
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,320
 And Sam, I've got to go up and get something in marriage.

79
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:16,820
 Very well.

80
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,420
 Wait a minute, Mother, I'd like to go with you.

81
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,220
 Henry.

82
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:20,220
 Yes, Father?

83
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,220
 Would you mind waiting here, please?

84
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,520
 Do you want to speak to me now?

85
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,520
 I do.

86
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,120
 Oh.

87
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,920
 Henry, how would you like to get away from all this?

88
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:32,520
 You're going to send me away just because I broke the ladder?

89
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,320
 How would you like to go on a camping trip?

90
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,320
 Hello?

91
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,320
 I go with you.

92
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,320
 In October?

93
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,320
 The weather prediction is warm and sunny for the next few days.

94
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,820
 Perhaps the last good ones will have.

95
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,020
 How about it?

96
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,060
 Go camping?

97
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,420
 Just the two of us?

98
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:47,920
 Yes, I will start this afternoon.

99
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,580
 Sleep right out in the woods.

100
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,060
 Catch our own fish, cook our own grub.

101
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:55,060
 The only thing is, Father, in a struggle.

102
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:57,620
 I have to go to the movies tonight.

103
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:58,260
 To the movies?

104
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:59,340
 Yes, sir.

105
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,260
 A bunch of us sort of planned to go this evening.

106
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:04,620
 Wouldn't you rather get out and eat your own fish?

107
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,580
 For Chief Westfather, they're counting on me

108
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,620
 to sit with them.

109
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,460
 Couldn't we go some other time?

110
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:13,620
 Well, not as well as today. Not any later this year.

111
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:16,980
 What's more, Homer Brown and his father may go with this.

112
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:18,700
 Homer and Mr. Brown?

113
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,700
 That throws a different light on him.

114
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:23,780
 But Homer's seen the picture and it doesn't matter to him.

115
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:26,220
 I see. Very well.

116
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,540
 Couldn't we go tomorrow, father?

117
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,980
 No, Henry, if you don't care anymore about it than that,

118
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:32,100
 then you needn't even think of going on.

119
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,420
 Mr. Alberts!

120
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:35,500
 Come in, Homer.

121
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,700
 I am in.

122
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:37,200
 I know.

123
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:37,940
 Hi, Henry.

124
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:38,740
 Hello, Homer.

125
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:43,380
 Mr. Alrich, my father wanted me to come over and tell you he doesn't know why he didn't think of it before.

126
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:46,100
 But we can't possibly go on that camping trip.

127
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:46,840
 Why not?

128
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:50,240
 We have to go to a wedding this afternoon, in a party afterwards.

129
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,720
 That's quite all right, Homer.

130
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,540
 I'm not sure I wanted to go camping anyway.

131
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:56,440
 Aren't you going at all, Father?

132
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,840
 Alone.

133
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,660
 Well, look, she was Aga with you.

134
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:00,840
 No, thank you, Henry.

135
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,940
 Sir, when you come upstairs, please...

136
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:04,240
 What's the trouble now?

137
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,840
 Mary's dead in the key in her door and she can't get it unlocked.

138
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,440
 I'll be right there.

139
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,880
 Father, wouldn't you like to join us at the movies?

140
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,880
 At my expense?

141
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,880
 Thank you, I would not.

142
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,760
 Henry, what did your mother say?

143
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,960
 Was there a matter with Mary?

144
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,600
 Boy, do you know what she did to me, Homer?

145
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,760
 Just to be humorous?

146
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,640
 No, what?

147
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,120
 She stole my diary.

148
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,480
 Your diary, Henry?

149
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,240
 A five-year diary.

150
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,360
 I just started it this year.

151
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,120
 And Mary has it?

152
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,120
 Sure.

153
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,120
 And it's got into what I think of everybody I know.

154
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:31,880
 Including me?

155
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,380
 Sure.

156
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:33,000
 Well, come on.

157
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 I hope you look for it.

158
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,880
 Henry, may I have a talk with you?

159
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,760
 With I, Mother?

160
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,020
 Hello Mrs. Orich.

161
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:39,780
 Hello, Homer.

162
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:42,680
 Would you mind stepping into the hallway for a minute?

163
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,680
 What do you want me to do out there, Mrs. Orich?

164
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,420
 Just wait till I'm through talking.

165
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:49,820
 Oh, oh, I get it.

166
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:52,620
 Well, I'm sure whatever it is, Henry didn't make it.

167
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,340
 Mother Mary started the whole thing by taking my diary.

168
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:57,540
 That isn't what I want to talk about.

169
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:00,140
 Dear, your father feels rather badly.

170
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:00,740
 Father does?

171
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:02,860
 Because you'd rather not go camping.

172
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:03,860
 Oh.

173
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,300
 But mother, I told him I'd like to go.

174
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,300
 He said you insisted on going to the movies.

175
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,900
 Yeah, I don't know where we ever got that impression.

176
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,700
 I'll admit I did mention the movies,

177
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:15,300
 because it's a picture I feel it's my duty to see.

178
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,800
 I didn't refuse to go camping.

179
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,200
 Well, you see, dear, your father does enjoy doing things with you.

180
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:23,300
 And I'm afraid this time he was just a little hurt.

181
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,800
 Oh.

182
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,300
 Well, yeah, I didn't realize he was that sensitive.

183
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,300
 Maybe I ought to take him camping.

184
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,300
 Would you like to?

185
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,300
 Sure, I'd do him a lot of good.

186
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:38,440
 He needs to get away from the house for a while the house sure on the fresh air and different surroundings

187
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:42,580
 What's the matter?

188
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:46,340
 Came out too far

189
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:51,620
 Looking for something of Henry

190
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:59,160
 He heard his finger opening my door and he's feeling very sorry for himself mother a yes

191
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:02,660
 I'm not speaking to Mary. Will you please tell her I'll go up and get the iodine?

192
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:07,660
 Mother, I think Henry's entirely too sensitive.

193
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:10,660
 Mary, dear, do you know where Henry's diary is?

194
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:14,660
 Well, exactly what do you mean by that, Mother?

195
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,660
 I mean, did you hide it?

196
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,660
 Well, yes, but...

197
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,660
 Well, yes, but...

198
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:21,660
 Well, yes, but...

199
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,660
 That's what puzzles me.

200
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:24,660
 Where did you put it?

201
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:25,660
 In the cold, haper.

202
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:26,660
 In the cold, haper.

203
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:27,660
 In the cold, haper.

204
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:28,660
 In the cold, haper.

205
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:31,660
 And when I went back to get it, it was gone!

206
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:35,660
 Oh, I don't really have even the slightest ideas to where it is.

207
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,660
 For all I know it may have gone to the laundry.

208
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:40,660
 Now Mary, I don't think that was very nice.

209
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:43,660
 But Mother, there wasn't one word in it, the laundry could take a pen sat.

210
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:47,660
 Mrs. Allrich, is Henry still upstairs?

211
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,660
 Homer, what are you doing in there?

212
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:53,660
 Well, did you know one of the drawers in your desk is locked?

213
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:55,660
 Homer, please leave my desk alone.

214
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:59,660
 Mary, I want you to do something for me.

215
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:03,260
 something for me what is it father you see this brown envelope yes well before I

216
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:06,540
 forget when I missed a Warren calls for it will you please be sure that he gets

217
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:11,340
 it certainly father Sam are you and Henry really going camping yes Alice we had a

218
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:15,980
 little talk upstairs and I agreed to take him I'm married did I write Mr. Warren's

219
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:19,700
 name on the envelope oh my goodness father I can certainly remember Mr. Warren

220
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:22,500
 can't I don't lose it it's extremely important

221
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:26,900
 Mother if father tell you I agreed to take him yes Henry every what's not

222
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:31,500
 Don't you wish you knew can't you tell me it's something very private

223
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:35,700
 Sam I'll go in the kitchen and boil a couple dozen eggs for you and Henry to take with you

224
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:41,240
 She mother you don't need a boil in the air. No Alice. We'll cook our own food. What food the fish we catch

225
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:46,480
 All we want is a little flower so we can make biscuits and some bacon what over I

226
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:53,960
 Did what does this mean? It says Sam dropped in tonight, and I found him terribly nice

227
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:58,960
 But very sensitive who's very sensitive home or where did you get that?

228
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:02,740
 Well, you know that lock drawer in your desk and may I have it please?

229
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:12,340
 Alice when did you write that never mind we can't read it we certainly may not I'm going to take it out and burn it

230
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:16,060
 Well, come on, honey. Let's go up and get into our whole close your father

231
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:22,540
 So long over you're leaving me Henry don't you want to go home? Well, I was gonna look for your diary some more

232
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,660
 Wait a second Homer. I just had a wonderful idea

233
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:32,480
 Boy, will it kill Mary? It will she's got a brown envelope Homer a brown envelope. She says it's very private

234
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,440
 Before I go Catholic I'm gonna get it and hide it you are sure sure

235
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:41,140
 The only thing is Homer. You're not afraid of Mary. Are you?

236
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:47,060
 No, but maybe I really are after all Henry you aren't gonna open the envelope are you she was no

237
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:50,860
 We're just gonna hide it for a few days to get even. I think it's a great idea.

238
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:55,740
 Sure. And boy, will that teacher a lesson about taking things that don't belong to her?

239
00:10:55,740 --> 00:11:09,660
 Father.

240
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,420
 Yes, Henry?

241
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:15,500
 I don't mean to be critical, but don't you think the fish would bite better if we didn't whistle?

242
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,980
 Yes, good idea.

243
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:20,620
 Nice, tangy day, isn't it?

244
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:24,020
 Just look at those leaves, brown, red.

245
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:27,020
 I think I'll cast out here in this other direction.

246
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:31,500
 It will seem to be biting very well.

247
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,700
 Yeah, them time. They're just getting used to us.

248
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:38,140
 Boy, I have to laugh every time I think of it.

249
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,420
 Every time you think of what?

250
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:40,860
 Don't we act even with Mary?

251
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:41,660
 You did.

252
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,340
 See, did I hide something of hers?

253
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,340
 Yeah.

254
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:47,660
 I have ever once said, "You're not good, John, I came to visit us."

255
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:49,260
 He left his bag off in his room.

256
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,860
 Father, I think I got a bite.

257
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:51,360
 Good.

258
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,560
 If we just keep quiet now, be quiet.

259
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:56,260
 Now you hook a little.

260
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:57,260
 That's what I'm doing.

261
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:59,560
 Who's he whiz?

262
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,260
 How is that?

263
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:02,060
 He kicked our knapsack into the water.

264
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:04,860
 Oh, I can get it.

265
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:05,960
 Be quiet, though.

266
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:09,260
 All I have to do is to take my shoes and socks off,

267
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:12,160
 and wait right out to wear the pack of snags.

268
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,260
 You better hurry, Father. The current's taking away.

269
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,260
 Here I go.

270
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:17,260
 Mmm.

271
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,260
 It's a little chintz.

272
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,260
 I'm here.

273
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:20,260
 [laughter]

274
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:22,260
 I'll get it all right.

275
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:24,260
 Be careful, Father.

276
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:25,260
 Mmm.

277
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,260
 Don't let it be for that I thought.

278
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:29,260
 You want to throw me your coat, Father?

279
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:30,260
 No.

280
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:32,260
 I just have to take one more step.

281
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:34,260
 [crash]

282
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:35,260
 Hey, who is Father?

283
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:36,260
 Father?

284
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:38,260
 Where are you, Father?

285
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:40,260
 [cheering]

286
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,260
 (Squeaking)

287
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:49,260
 Mary, don't you have the slightest ideas to where you put it?

288
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:52,260
 I'm almost positive that I put it here on this hall table.

289
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:55,260
 And it was a brown envelope? Yes, about this big.

290
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:57,260
 Is that Mr. Warren waiting in the living room?

291
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:59,260
 And no, dear, it's Will Brown, his uncle.

292
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:01,260
 Well, I'm going to ask him something.

293
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:03,260
 Oh, Mr. Brown! Yes, Mary?

294
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:07,260
 Does your Mr. Warren really need that envelope today?

295
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:12,640
 He sure does. He was down at your father's office this morning and got a little excited or something and walked off and left it.

296
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,640
 I see.

297
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:16,300
 Just how valuable is it?

298
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:20,200
 Well, it wouldn't be valuable to anybody else, but it certainly means a lot to my nephew.

299
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,400
 It does.

300
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,200
 He had his marriage license in it.

301
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,000
 How is that all?

302
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,500
 That's all he's planning to be married at five o'clock.

303
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,500
 Today?

304
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:33,000
 I hope you don't think I'd be wearing a cutaway like this a day ahead of time.

305
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,500
 Whoa!

306
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,500
 Yes, sir, my nephew's old futures in that envelope.

307
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,200
 Look, Mr. Brown, would you mind sitting down just a minute

308
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,500
 while my mother and I go through my room once more?

309
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,500
 Well, I won't sit down exactly.

310
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,000
 I don't want to ruin this coat.

311
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,500
 I'll just sort of lean against the wall.

312
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:58,500
 What about this dick on the fire, Henry?

313
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,500
 That's what I'm doing, father.

314
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,500
 Do I smell something burning?

315
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,500
 It's just a fire, I think.

316
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:07,500
 Boy, these fish here are tasty, aren't they?

317
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,500
 Yes.

318
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,500
 Has some more?

319
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,500
 They don't mind if I do.

320
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:14,500
 Cheerless, smarter mother to put this can of sardines in an app sack.

321
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,500
 Your mother thinks of everything.

322
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,500
 They're even important.

323
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,500
 Gee, you ought to see the big one I just got.

324
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,500
 Big what, sardine?

325
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,500
 Mosquito.

326
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,500
 How do you want shivering, are you?

327
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,500
 No, I don't know. I'm almost dry.

328
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,980
 Almost dry.

329
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:33,180
 Sir, it is wonderful out here in the woods in October.

330
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:36,020
 Feel that tang in the air, huh?

331
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:38,340
 That little brown sorry he couldn't come with us.

332
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:39,900
 Who's wedding do you have to go to?

333
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:42,500
 His nephew, John Warren.

334
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,340
 Hmm, 20 minutes to six.

335
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:46,300
 Gotta be just about married.

336
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,020
 Fathers, do you deserve?

337
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:52,660
 Yes, take this knife and cut a piece of that cake.

338
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:54,300
 Oh, gee whiz.

339
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:56,460
 Cut from the end that didn't go in the late.

340
00:14:56,460 --> 00:15:03,460
 You know, son, as soon as we're through eating, I think we'd better move on to a place where there aren't so many mosquitoes.

341
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:06,460
 Father, maybe you did smell something burning.

342
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:07,460
 What is it?

343
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:11,460
 She whiz, I didn't know you put your shoes right next to this fire.

344
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:21,460
 You go through that pile of papers, dear, and I'll go through this one.

345
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:24,460
 I've been through all of them twice, mother.

346
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:28,460
 I just went through the trash pile and there's no sign of any license there.

347
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:32,460
 Will Brown, you haven't been going through the trash pile in that cutaway, have you?

348
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:33,460
 I used a long rake.

349
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:35,460
 Did I just hear the palm ring?

350
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:36,460
 If you did, don't answer it.

351
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:37,460
 Why not?

352
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:42,460
 They've been heckling us for two hours. When we find the envelope, my nephew can get married and not until then.

353
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:44,460
 My goodness, look at this.

354
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:45,460
 What, Mother?

355
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,460
 I just found a Christmas card we never opened.

356
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:48,460
 What?

357
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:52,460
 I wonder how Mrs. Standish has been so cool to me all year.

358
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:53,540
 in the old year?

359
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:56,220
 I'm waiting till you see how my nephew reacts to you.

360
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:57,860
 Where's he going on his honeymoon?

361
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:58,700
 It's a new Hampshire.

362
00:15:58,700 --> 00:15:59,740
 It's a new Hampshire.

363
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:01,460
 Well, they like it there.

364
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,940
 They will if they ever get there.

365
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:05,620
 Father, where are you?

366
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:06,580
 Here, Homer.

367
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:08,340
 Well, look, they want me to tell you

368
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:10,060
 the brides having hysterics.

369
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:10,940
 Oh, my goodness.

370
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,300
 hysterics, Homer?

371
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,340
 She says she's never going to speak to the groom again

372
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,180
 as long as she lives.

373
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:17,500
 That's a fine thing.

374
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,780
 Are all the guests still there?

375
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:19,460
 Sure.

376
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:21,420
 When I left, they just finished the wedding cake.

377
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:23,420
 Here, I brought you a piece.

378
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:25,420
 Not now!

379
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:27,420
 Does help us look for that license?

380
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,420
 Well, what did it look like?

381
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:31,420
 It's in a brown envelope.

382
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:33,420
 A brown envelope?

383
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,420
 Yes, dear.

384
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:37,420
 A brown envelope?

385
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:38,420
 About this large?

386
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:39,420
 What's the matter with you, Homer?

387
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:40,420
 Have you seen it?

388
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:42,420
 - Am I a license? - Yes.

389
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:44,420
 No, sir!

390
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,420
 Do you know what I think?

391
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:49,420
 I think we ought to get in the car and find Mr. Allrich.

392
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:51,420
 - Say I'm old, Rich. - He's with Henry.

393
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:54,420
 I'm positive that'd be the safest thing to do.

394
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:57,420
 - Where is it they're camping out? - They set up near McCorkel's Rock.

395
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:59,420
 McCorkel's Rock's way up there?

396
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:02,420
 Well, J-Father, we could find them in less than two hours.

397
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:05,420
 And I have a feeling that's the only thing to do.

398
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:08,420
 Alice, call the wedding and tell them to go ahead with the reception.

399
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:11,420
 We'll get the bride and groom married later.

400
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:13,420
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

401
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:22,740
 We'll return to the Aldrich family in just a moment.

402
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,860
 His voice has thrilled millions.

403
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:28,020
 His curly locks have been compared to spun gold.

404
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:30,380
 His background is that of a man of the world.

405
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:31,500
 Who is he?

406
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,300
 Nobody but Phil Harris.

407
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:35,980
 And tonight you can join Phil and his long-suffering wife,

408
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:39,540
 Alice Faye, in another of their funny misadventures.

409
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:44,180
 Then your weekly theater guild on the air presents John Lunn and Vivica Linfers

410
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:49,300
 in a tender story of two war offerings, Seagull Cry by Robert Nathan.

411
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:51,940
 Next comes two of the top NBC news programs.

412
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:55,540
 First, Martha Roundtree's panel conference Meet the Press,

413
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:59,300
 then the American Forum of the Air with Theodore Granik as your moderator.

414
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:05,060
 On both shows, NBC microphones will bring you the people who are the names in tomorrow's headlines.

415
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:08,340
 So check your local newspaper for broadcast times.

416
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:10,740
 Stay tuned to this NBC station.

417
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:13,380
 For theater guild on the air, the Phil Harris Alice

418
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:17,020
 Peycho, Meet the Press, and the American Forum of the Air.

 [MUSIC PLAYING]

420
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:28,700
 And now getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldrich.

421
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:31,860
 To get even with his sister who had lost his diary,

422
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,940
 Henry has hidden an envelope which he believes is hers,

423
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:37,460
 and he's gone off on a three-day camping trip.

424
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:41,460
 He's unaware of the fact that the envelope contains an important marriage license.

425
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:44,460
 The scene is in the woods. The time is late at night.

426
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:46,860
 Father, where are you?

427
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,460
 Right here, Henry.

428
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,360
 Where?

429
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,360
 I'll display you.

430
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:50,860
 Oh.

431
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:54,860
 You think we'll like this place better in the last two places we unpacked in?

432
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:57,160
 Marisin' a mosquito anywhere near here.

433
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,960
 Now, line down and get comfortable.

434
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,660
 Gee, I wish our flashlight hadn't dropped in the water.

435
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:04,360
 You don't need a flashlight.

436
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:07,060
 Father, have you any idea where we are?

437
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:12,460
 I know exactly where we are. We're about a mile and a half from the main line of the Y and R railroad.

438
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:13,980
 Now, lie down and go to sleep.

439
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:14,980
 I am.

440
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:18,220
 Heee, this is the life, isn't it?

441
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:20,380
 You think it'll rain?

442
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:21,980
 There isn't a chance.

443
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:27,060
 See, what was that?

444
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:31,900
 Just a thunderstorm, way over on the other side of the valley.

445
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:34,460
 I'll close your eyes and go to sleep.

446
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:35,380
 Yes, Father.

447
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:38,660
 I wonder why the stars are now?

448
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:41,360
 Give them time. They'll come out.

449
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:45,360
 Too bad Will Brown and Homer couldn't have come along with us.

450
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,960
 Who's why did you say it was?

451
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,960
 Mr. Warren, the young business man who just moved to town.

452
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,560
 I expect to do a lot of business with him.

453
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:58,660
 What's that?

454
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:00,460
 Just some animal.

455
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:04,960
 Why don't you just relax, Henry, and enjoy nature?

456
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:06,860
 Sound like a train whistle.

457
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:09,860
 Well, it might have been a train over on the Y&R.

458
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:10,860
 Oh.

459
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:15,660
 Listen, Father, don't you think we ought to go some other place?

460
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:18,060
 No, Henry, there's no sense in trying to go anyplace else.

461
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:20,660
 We'll be just as comfortable here as if we were home.

462
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:25,460
 Father, is it raining where you are?

463
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:29,460
 Well, just a little.

464
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:31,460
 You better pull your blanket over your head.

466
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,160
 For our train whistle sounds closer.

467
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,860
 Well, of course it sounds closer.

468
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:41,360
 It's going to pass within a mile and a half of it.

 What's that?

472
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:53,160
 Do you feel any ties under you?

473
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,860
 How did we get way over here?

00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:55,860

 Oh, Sam!

 Maybe they went a little farther into the woods.

 Oh, man, they couldn't have gone.

 I'd be wearing it out hiking.

 I am. Let's try the back door.

530
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:32,920
 Yes, Mary?

 Wake up, you father!

532
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,920
 I know it.

533
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,920
 Hello?

534
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,920
 Hello, is this Alice Aldrich?

535
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:41,920
 Yes.

536
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,920
 This is Margaret Kilmer next door.

537
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:44,920
 Oh.

538
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,920
 I don't want to laugh you in the middle of the night,

539
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:50,920
 I got my bedroom window a moment ago I saw two men prowling round to a house.

540
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,920
 - Oh, man? - Yes.

541
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,920
 Are you sure everything is law?

542
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,920
 Oh, yes. At least I think everything is.

543
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:00,920
 Well, then I wouldn't worry dear. They'll probably go away in a few minutes.

544
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,920
 Yes, of course.

545
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,920
 I hope I am disturbed you.

546
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,920
 Oh, no. No, not at all.

547
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,920
 Goodbye.

548
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:12,920
 - How do you want it? - It wasn't anyone. Mary, just Mrs. Kilmer.

549
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:13,920
 Mrs. Kilmer?

550
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:17,920
 She says not to worry, but there were two men outside.

551
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,920
 Two men, mother?

552
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:23,920
 Now don't be afraid. Every door and window is locked, except perhaps the cellar door.

553
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:24,920
 Didn't we lock that?

554
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:27,920
 Mary, we've got to go down and see whether we did or not.

555
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:28,920
 At this time of night?

556
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:31,920
 Yes, dear. Let's not turn on any lights.

557
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,920
 I won't, mother.

558
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:38,920
 I don't wake you in the hall, dear, while I answer the phone.

559
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,920
 Who do you suppose it is?

560
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,920
 Hello?

561
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,620
 Ms. Albright's this is Joe Graham.

562
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:46,620
 Who?

563
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:48,920
 You know the best man at John Lauren's wedding.

564
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:49,920
 Oh yes!

565
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,920
 Do you have any ideas to wear Mr. Brown on corner with?

566
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:56,920
 Yes, up to McCorkel's rocks to look for Henry and Mr. Aldridge.

567
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:59,920
 Well, they haven't come back yet. We're getting a bit worried.

568
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,920
 My goodness.

569
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:03,920
 Maybe I better take a couple of the guests and go out and try to find them.

570
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,920
 Well, hope I didn't wake you up.

571
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,920
 Oh no, not at all.

572
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:08,920
 Bye!

573
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:09,920
 Goodbye.

574
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:10,920
 Mother!

575
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:13,720
 Yes, dear. I just found out and locked the cellar door.

576
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,620
 You locked it?

577
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:16,420
 I never was so frightened in my life.

578
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:18,220
 And I was just in time, Mother.

579
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:20,620
 I could hear somebody right outside.

580
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:23,420
 Dear, I'm sure we're perfectly safe. Everything is locked.

581
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:27,420
 What's that?

582
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:28,420
 Mary.

583
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:31,420
 Listen, Mary.

584
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:34,920
 Mary, someone's putting a ladder against the side of the house.

585
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,720
 They're gonna climb in one of the windows.

586
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,820
 Shouldn't we call the police?

587
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:38,620
 Yes, dear.

588
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:41,880
 And you all the time, Henry, shouldn't have left that ladder lying there on the ground.

589
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:42,960
 Wasn't it broken?

590
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,420
 I thought it was. I don't see how it was.

591
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:49,260
 I thought it was!

592
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:15,620
 time is it so 10 minutes to three are we almost home father we are Mary yes

593
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:20,240

594
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:24,760

595
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:31,440
 that clear yes father and Henry yes father I know I thought you made a very

596
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:38,960
 nice best man Sam. Thank you. Even if you were wearing cocky trousers. She gets too

597
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,200
 bad Homer and Mr. Brown didn't get there for the ceremony. Well my goodness the

598
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:46,320
 way they looked when they did get back it's just as well. Anyway it was a very

599
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:51,160
 nice wedding. Didn't you think the bride looked lovely? Oh yes mother. That is

600
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:57,160
 sleepy perhaps but lovely. What's the like her so much? She was pretty darn cool

601
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:00,160
 to me you don't say

602
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:05,000
 a lot to father and all richard you can't you know certainly not enough to

603
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:05,880
 over

604
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,560
 it's just

605
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,520
 well it's just frankly

606
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:16,520
 i think there was a little too much to hang in the air

607
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:27,280
 Radar can't do the entire job of protecting our country from a surprise air attack.

608
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:30,280
 That's up to us as individual citizens.

609
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:36,280
 Right now, the air defense command needs 300,000 more volunteers for its ground observacore,

610
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:42,280
 made up of patriotic citizens who contribute a few hours of their spare time each week.

611
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:50,280
 Both men and women from teenage up can join the ground observacore and perform a valuable service to our country.

 Hey, Ray, did you see your diary here?

616
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,240
 She was, Molly, where did that come from?

617
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,160
 I just came back with a laundry.

618
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,600
 What's this piece of paper with it?

619
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,960
 I didn't read it.

620
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:25,640
 It says, "We cannot accept responsibility for laundering this article, but

621
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:28,640
 suggest you send it to a reliable dry cleaner."
