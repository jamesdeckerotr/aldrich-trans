00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 [Music]

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 Henry Henry Aldrich!

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 Coming Mother!

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 [Applause]

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 Yes, the Aldrich family written by Clifford Goldsmiths.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:32,520
 [Music]

8
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:39,000
 Centerville is only a dot on the map, and 117 Elm Street is only a typical American home.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,500
 But it's where the Aldrichs live, and it isn't far from where you live or used to live.

10
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:51,500
 And as a typical teenage boy, Henry Aldrich is always certain to stir up any number of mishaps and memories.

11
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:56,000
 The scene opens in the Aldrich living room. The time is Saturday morning.

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 Oh boy Mary, do I feel swell.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,500
 Henry, why are you popping out your chest that way?

14
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,500
 I don't know. Just feel swell.

15
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,000
 Why do you say that, dear?

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 You know what happened at school this week, mother?

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 What, dear?

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 Well, they were having a meeting, see. And I didn't know they were going to elect a class debt committee.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,500
 And the first thing I know somebody nominated me.

20
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,000
 What kind of a committee?

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,500
 A class debt committee.

22
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,000
 A class debt?

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,260
 Sure, mother, we owe money, and they needed someone to take charge of it.

24
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:23,640
 And you were elected?

25
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,340
 Sure, almost unanimously.

26
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:27,240
 Who did what unanimously?

27
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,840
 The class father to me.

28
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:32,880
 Sam, Henry's been elected to wipe out his class debt this year.

29
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,880
 [laughter]

30
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:38,980
 You were?

31
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:40,640
 She was, I don't know.

32
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,900
 Everything's just suddenly going swell.

33
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,280
 And you were elected unanimously?

34
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,180
 Well, practically.

35
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:48,280
 And then the school photographer took a picture.

36
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,040
 - Of you, Henry? - Sure.

37
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:54,080
 Henry, I certainly hope you didn't have your picture taken looking like that.

38
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:58,280
 - What's the matter with me? - You never needed a haircut more in your life.

39
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:03,480
 - My haircut? I don't need a haircut. - Look at it, it's almost down to your shoulders.

40
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:07,480
 - Mother, you're exaggerating. - Would you like some ribbon, didn't it, Henry?

41
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:10,480
 - Mary. - Well, dear, you should never have left them

42
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:15,080
 take a picture of you like that, especially if they elected you unanimously.

43
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:18,080
 Mother, they didn't just point the camera at my hair.

44
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,680
 George Bigelow didn't even have a tie on.

45
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,680
 What was he doing in the picture?

46
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,880
 Well, she was father.

47
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:26,880
 You don't think you asked me to wipe out the whole debt single handed, do you?

48
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:31,080
 Well, those that don't notice George's tie will certainly notice your hair.

49
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,080
 Henry, how many are there on your committee?

50
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,080
 Well, counting everybody... 14.

51
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,580
 14?

52
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:41,080
 14?

53
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,080
 Yeah. But in the picture, I was in the first row, Father.

54
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,400
 Well, it's too late now, but you're going down and get a haircut.

55
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,200
 On a Saturday morning?

56
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:53,080
 Waste the whole Saturday morning in a barber's chair?

57
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:58,240
 As a matter of fact, if you wait until I finish the breakfast dishes, I'll go down with you.

58
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,280
 No, Mother, I can tell I'm how to cut my own hair all by myself.

59
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,880
 But Henry, how about the last time you came home with a haircut?

60
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,920
 She was married. That's the way all the guys were wearing it last month.

61
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,720
 Lo in the front and high in the back.

62
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,520
 [Laughter]

63
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:17,580
 Well, I'm going with you mother. Please don't embarrass me. My goodness

64
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:22,620
 What's embarrassing about having your mother go into a barbershop with you? It just isn't done mother

65
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:28,080
 Very idea makes me nervous. Yes, Sam. Did you come here a minute, please?

66
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:33,600
 I'll be right there and Henry you're to get ready to go down to the barbershop. Yes, mother

67
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,720
 Only don't feel you have to leave your work in order to go with me

68
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,800
 mother

69
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,900
 Mother

70
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,100
 Henry, she wants to go with you.

71
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,460
 - Mary, she'll only be embarrassed

72
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:45,220
 down there with all those men.

73
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:47,380
 You tell her I'll have to cut exactly right.

74
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:49,260
 - You better wait, Henry.

75
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,580
 Henry!

76
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:51,540
 - Henry!

77
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,500
 - Mother, he's gone.

78
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,500
 He's gone where?

79
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,340
 - To the Barbies, and when he comes back,

80
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,100
 he'll simply be a sight.

81
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:00,740
 - Well, I have a good notion to phone Thompson's

82
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,660
 barbershop and tell him just what I want done.

83
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,240
 (upbeat music)

84
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,660
 (jazz music)

85
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:19,200
 - Where are you going, Henry?

86
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,200
 (audience laughing)

87
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,140
 - To the barber shop, Homer.

88
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,780
 Now, I'm in a hurry, look out.

89
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:28,400
 You don't need a haircut.

90
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,180
 What do you want a haircut for?

91
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,500
 - Listen, Homer, do you see that lady

92
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,220
 coming down the street back there?

93
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,500
 - In the next block?

94
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,400
 The one that's running?

95
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,280
 Yeah, that isn't my mother, is it?

96
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,840
 No, she's running for a bus.

97
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,320
 Oh.

98
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,640
 What barber are you going to?

99
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:44,280
 Mr. Thompson, right here in the center bill times building.

100
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,480
 Oh.

101
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,480
 Did you know you're going to have your picture in the times

102
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,480
 tomorrow?

103
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,240
 In the times?

104
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,120
 Sure.

105
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,880
 The one guy Maccorkel took of the class debt committee.

106
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,000
 Is it going to be in the times?

107
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,560
 Sure, tomorrow.

108
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,280
 He spent all day yesterday persuading them to run it,

109
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,720
 and they finally gave in.

110
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,800
 Well, she wins.

111
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,200
 Imagine.

112
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,120
 Homer, home do you see that car coming?

113
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,420
 That isn't my mother, is it?

114
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:06,420
 No.

115
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:07,760
 Just the same.

116
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,340
 I'd better go into the barbershop.

117
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:11,800
 If I see your mother, I'll tell her you're looking for her.

118
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,760
 No, Homer.

119
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:17,680
 [LAUGHTER]

120
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,440
 You never even saw me.

121
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,560
 All right, there, Henry.

122
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,840
 Now, how do you do, Mr. Latin?

123
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,760
 Well, hello, Henry.

124
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,880
 Hello, Mr. Thompson.

125
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,360
 There, do you like this chair here?

126
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,840
 Well, you have one not quite so near the window.

127
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,960
 You don't like this one?

128
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,400
 Well, I'm thinking of the strong light.

129
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,120
 This is the only one that isn't busy.

130
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,520
 Hop in. Yes, sir.

131
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,000
 - Air print? - Yes, sir.

132
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,560
 How do you want it?

133
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,880
 Well, I'll tell you.

134
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,920
 I want to sort of...

135
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,760
 You see this right over my ears?

136
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,840
 Yeah.

137
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,840
 Well, it's sort of hard to explain.

138
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,360
 You see this right up on top?

139
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,200
 Yeah.

140
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,400
 Well, I'll try to tell you.

141
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:58,880
 Do you know what he's sh

142
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,760
 You've never seen him?

143
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,880
 Well, how about this chart here?

144
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,360
 I got a photograph of just about every style there is.

145
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,920
 Well, gee whiz, let's take a look at it.

146
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,760
 Yeah, here you are.

147
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,640
 Now here's a style they call the New Yorker.

148
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,840
 That would sort of fit your head.

149
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,560
 You think so?

150
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,360
 Is that popular?

151
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,080
 Oh, sell a lot of these.

152
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,600
 And here's the one they call the Yale Bowl.

153
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,400
 No, I don't think my mother--

154
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,520
 in fact, I don't think anybody would care for that one.

155
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,640
 What's this one?

156
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,920
 The Ball Bremo.

157
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,760
 That's more the Eddie, Shanton, kind?

158
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:36,360
 Could you give me the bow-brummel up on top and the New Yorker on the side?

159
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:42,160
 Sure.

160
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,760
 I don't think that'd be a good combination.

161
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,760
 Well, I'm glad to have a customer that knows what he wants.

162
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:51,560
 Well, the way I look at it, if you don't know how you want your own haircut, who does?

163
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:56,360
 Would you mind swinging the chair around a little so I could look out the window, please?

164
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,960
 I thought the light hurt your eyes.

165
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,960
 I like to watch the traffic.

166
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:02,900
 How's that?

167
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:03,720
 Fine.

168
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,020
 Would you mind not twisting your head like that?

169
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:07,220
 Oh, excuse me.

170
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:09,700
 I just happen to see somebody come out of that store across the street.

171
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,020
 Say, who is that?

172
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:11,820
 That girl?

173
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,100
 Oh, that's Natalie White.

174
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:13,980
 Not bad.

175
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:15,580
 She's got a dog just like mine.

176
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,620
 Would you mind holding your head still?

177
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:18,380
 I wasn't looking at her.

178
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:20,020
 I was looking at that man go up the ladder.

179
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:23,060
 Well, the Times was putting up a new electric sign out there.

180
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:25,220
 The Times?

181
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:27,500
 Mr. Tom's not reminds me.

182
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,260
 You ever read The Times on Sunday?

183
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,700
 Yes, sir.

184
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,620
 Well, I certainly wish it'd skip it tomorrow.

185
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:33,780
 Yeah, bad news.

186
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:36,780
 They're gonna print my picture, darn it.

187
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,940
 See, do I hope they don't put it on the front page?

188
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:40,460
 What are they gonna print before?

189
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,060
 Well, I'm in charge of something over at the high school.

190
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:45,060
 Gee, was I embarrassed when I heard about it.

191
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,380
 Embarrassed?

192
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:47,820
 You know, everybody in town will see it

193
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,220
 and I'll all be calling up my mother.

194
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:52,260
 Well, most boys would be pretty proud about a thing like that.

195
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:54,580
 Well, I'd rather just be one of the crowd.

196
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:56,100
 You know, once they start printing your picture,

197
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,060
 where's it all going to end?

198
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,500
 Could you hold your head still, Henry?

199
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,000
 Just looking over at the bakery.

200
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,500
 That's Natalie White's coming across the street, isn't she?

201
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,500
 I guess she is.

202
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,500
 Good looking girl.

203
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,500
 Oh, she whiz.

204
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,500
 What's she coming in here for?

205
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,500
 Excuse me, what could I bother you?

206
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,500
 Yes, ma'am.

207
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,500
 Hello, Henry.

208
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,500
 Hello.

209
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,500
 How's your dog?

210
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,500
 She's fine.

211
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,500
 How's yours?

212
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,500
 He's fine.

213
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:21,500
 Mr. Thompson, they don't have any change over the bakery,

214
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,500
 and they thought perhaps you could change this $5 bill.

215
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,500
 Sure, I guess I can help you.

216
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,500
 Hey, Mr. Thompson, is Henry here?

217
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,760
 - Henry here? - Homer, where did you come from?

218
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,400
 - Hi, Natalie. - Hi, Homer.

219
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:35,460
 Henry, I just ran into your sister up the street.

220
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:38,560
 She told me to tell you, as soon as you've had your haircut,

221
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,140
 you're to go right home and let your mother see it.

222
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:44,180
 - Your mother? - What do you mean she has to see it?

223
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:46,580
 - Oh, did Mary say that? - Sure.

224
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:49,340
 She said Henry couldn't be trusted in a barber chair.

225
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:50,900
 - Honestly? - She was, Homer,

226
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,860
 always trying to kid.

227
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:55,740
 Mr. Thompson, when you get through on top, I'd like a shave.

228
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:58,740
 (audience laughing)

229
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:04,380
 A what? A what? A shave and make it close.

230
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:05,720
 And with Bay rum.

231
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:08,140
 (jazz music)

232
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:16,820
 Mother!

233
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,020
 Where are you, Mother?

234
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,500
 - Out here in the kitchen.

235
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,860
 - Is there anything I can do to help you?

236
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,300
 - I'm busy right this minute.

237
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,580
 They're breaking these eggs.

238
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,060
 - Oh, well, if there's anything I can do.

239
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:29,060
 Henry! I thought I told you to go to the barbers.

240
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:30,060
 I did go.

241
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:33,060
 Well, why didn't you have your hair cut?

242
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:35,060
 She was, I did. The catch of seeing?

243
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:38,060
 Henry didn't even touch it. Turn around.

244
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:41,060
 Mother, I know he cut it. I saw the hair fall off.

245
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:48,060
 Well, there I can tell when my own son, Tara, has been cut. All he did was comb it down.

246
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:50,060
 Mother, is there anything I can...

247
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:53,060
 Henry, all rich, what's happened to you?

248
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:55,060
 - So... - What do you mean what's happened to me?

249
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:57,060
 - Well, yours why did the sheet?

250
00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:00,060
 - She was married. That's just sort of... powder.

251
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:03,060
 - Talcum powder? - Sure.

252
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:06,060
 - Can you ever hear of anybody using talcum powder after shaving?

253
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:10,060
 - Henry, who's shaved you? - And what's that piece of bandage doing on your cheek?

254
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:15,060
 - It's just a cut, Mary. It's just a cut... from the razor.

255
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:18,060
 - How did the barber happen to cut you? - A ladder fell.

256
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:21,060
 [laughter]

257
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,220
 What fell Henry?

258
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:25,220
 A ladder that belonged to the center of those times.

259
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:28,140
 When the man jumped, I jumped and so did Mr. Thompson.

260
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:30,700
 My mother, look at Henry's hair.

261
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:31,860
 I have, dear.

262
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:35,500
 My goodness, it's even longer than it was before he went.

263
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,900
 How could it be, Mary?

264
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,100
 But it is, Henry.

265
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,100
 This morning, it was in curls down to here.

266
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:40,900
 And now it's straighten.

267
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:43,540
 It comes all the way down to here.

268
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:45,820
 My goodness, what's that awful smell?

269
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:46,580
 What smell?

270
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:49,060
 Henry, what did he put on your hair?

271
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:50,380
 Just a tonic mother.

272
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:52,220
 You came me from growing bald.

273
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:54,480
 Mother, hold me while I say.

274
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,660
 Henry, dear, I'm not going to have you walking around the house looking like that.

275
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:03,960
 And, Mother, did you know Henry's been going around telling everyone he's going to have a picture in the paper tomorrow?

276
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,360
 Listen, Mary, who told you that?

277
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,160
 My goodness, it's all over town.

278
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:07,860
 It is?

279
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:11,660
 I was just talking to Ted Gould and he said Mr. Thompson told him.

280
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:14,360
 Well, I certainly thought Mr. Thompson could keep it confidential.

281
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:19,360
 Henry, you're going right straight back and tell Mr. Thompson to pay a little more attention

282
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,040
 to his own business and not so much to everybody else's.

283
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:23,840
 What do you mean?

284
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:26,520
 I want him to cut your hair correctly.

285
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,560
 Mother, he did!

286
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,040
 Henry, I want your hair cut.

287
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,960
 Mother, you're just influenced by the looks of this bandage.

288
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:37,080
 If you back up into the dining room and look at me, you'll get an entirely different perspective.

289
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:43,600
 I'm not going to pay good money to have you look like that from any perspective.

290
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,400
 They'd now please start.

291
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,240
 Mother, I'll be embarrassed to death.

292
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,080
 She was Mr. Thompson's very busy,

293
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,640
 and he cut my hair and I paid him.

294
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:55,240
 I wouldn't be comfortable asking him to do it again.

295
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,960
 Well, then I'm sure Mary would be very glad

296
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,680
 to go down with you and ask him.

297
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,520
 Mother?

298
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,200
 Yes, Mother, I'd be delighted too.

299
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,400
 No, Mary, no.

300
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,680
 But Henry, don't you want to be comfortable?

301
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,280
 Mary, you can't do that, you mean.

302
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:10,240
 Can we stop acting like a child?

303
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,200
 I'll go back, Mother, alone.

304
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,000
 I'll ask him by myself.

305
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,800
 But please don't any member of this family come along.

306
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,400
 And will you tell him to take some off the sides

307
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,720
 and off the top?

308
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,800
 Yes, mother.

309
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,720
 I'll tell him to give me a good all-around trimming.

310
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,720
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

311
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:41,800
 Hello, Henry.

312
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,060
 Oh, Natalie.

313
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:43,760
 Where you going?

314
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,720
 Huh?

315
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,960
 Well, I'd carry your bundles for you

316
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,120
 if I didn't have to go back down to my--

317
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,960
 I mean, back downtown for something.

318
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,720
 You've got to go back?

319
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,680
 What happened to your face?

320
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,800
 A man fell off a ladder.

321
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,400
 [LAUGHTER]

322
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,480
 On you?

323
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,760
 No, right in front of the center go time.

324
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,080
 He didn't hurt himself, though.

325
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,680
 Oh, that reminds me.

326
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,000
 I guess I'll certainly have to buy a copy of the time

327
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,080
 tomorrow.

328
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:07,440
 You will?

329
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,360
 What for?

330
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:11,480
 You just modest-- everybody knows about it.

331
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:17,080

337
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,680
 The bottom of the vanilla extract is broken.

338
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,880
 Well, it's there, but it isn't broken.

339
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,380
 Isn't that funny?

340
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:49,080
 I thought I smelled something.

 Henry!

344
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,380
 Well, gee whiz.

345
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:56,080
 Henry, wait for me!

346
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,280
 Oh boy, goodbye, Natalie.

347
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,080
 Henry!

348
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,080
 I've got to be going.

349
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,280
 Was that your sister calling?

350
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,180
 I guess it is.

351
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:03,080
 How did I happen time to wait?

00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:14,080
 [applause]

355
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:17,080
 We'll return to the Aldrich family in just a minute.

356
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:22,080
 Tonight NBC rolls out the red carpet for two of the most popular people in radio.

357
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:26,080
 Tonight Phil Harris and Alice Fay return to the air on this station

358
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:30,080
 with their whole gang and more laughs than you can shake a stick at.

359
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,080
 And this is just a reminder to tune in.

360
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,080
 Then, as another Sunday feature,

361
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:39,080
 Theater Guild on the Air brings you Morning Star with Sylvia Sidney and Molly Goldberg

362
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:44,080
 in a story about some wonderful people who made homes out of a cold water tenement.

363
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:49,080
 And also this evening, Jack Webb stars in another dramatization of a case history

364
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:53,080
 from the files of the Los Angeles Police Force on Dragnet.

365
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:58,080
 And no NBC lineup is complete without the best news and special event shows.

366
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:03,080
 So tonight, listen to the American Forum of the Air and meet the press.

367
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:10,080
 Yes, for the tops and radio, just stay tuned to NBC.

368
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:21,080
 [Music]

369
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:24,080
 And now getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldrich.

370
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,080
 His mother is upset about his haircut.

371
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,080
 When he returned home from the barbershop,

372
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,080
 she told him to his complete embarrassment

373
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:35,080
 harassment that he must go back and have his hair recut this time correctly.

374
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:39,080
 The scene opens as Henry re-enters the barbershop.

375
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,080
 That's you, Henry?

376
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,080
 Yes, Mr. Thompson.

377
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,080
 What are you back for?

378
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,080
 You forget something?

379
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,080
 No, not exactly.

380
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:53,080
 I'll tell you, Mr. Thompson, if you aren't too busy, could you make a couple of small changes on this job?

381
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,080
 What's wrong with it?

382
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:59,080
 Oh, why, nothing's wrong with it. I like it very much only my mother...

383
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:05,080
 Well, you don't suppose you could give me a little less of the New Yorker and a little more of the Yale bowl, could you?

384
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:09,080
 Sure, I can do anything you want, but if I even touch your hair, it's going to spoil it.

385
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,080
 You think so?

386
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:14,080
 I've been cutting hair for 20 years, and that's one of the best jobs I've ever done.

387
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:19,080
 Well, now that I look at it in your mirror, I can see that it's pretty good.

388
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,080
 Your mother see it in a good light?

389
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,080
 Oh, it hasn't anything to do with my mother.

390
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:26,080
 I guess it was just a mirror we have at home.

391
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:29,080
 Of course, I'll spoil it for you if you really want me to.

392
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,320
 Oh, no, I wouldn't even have you touch it.

393
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,320
 Goodbye, Mr. Thompson.

394
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,080
 Goodbye, I see you in a couple of weeks.

395
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,080
 - Can I marry? - Oh, she was married.

396
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,080
 Have Mr. Thompson changed your hair yet?

397
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,080
 Not yet, Mary. I'm just going in.

398
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,080
 Well, I'll go in with you.

399
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,080
 No, Mary, you go on. Please.

400
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:45,080
 I'll be in here for quite some time.

401
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,080
 - Don't have me. - No, Mary.

402
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,080
 What is it now?

403
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:52,080
 Well, I'll tell you, Mr. Thompson.

404
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,080
 I know it's against my better judgment,

405
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:59,320
 especially when... well that is... well I think I'll let you spoil it.

406
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,480
 What's that?

407
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:05,920
 What I mean is... I think you could take a little more off the top and the sides maybe.

408
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,120
 What for?

409
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:12,120
 Well, I've got a hat at home, see, and it's my favorite hat and it fits a little snug.

410
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,920
 And I think maybe it would be better, isn't it?

411
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,320
 Why didn't you tell me you wanted to cut to fit a hat?

412
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:17,720
 I didn't think of it before.

413
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,360
 Well, it'll hop up in the chair.

414
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,280
 But mind you, I'm not gonna ruin it.

415
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,960
 I'm just gonna ease it off a little.

416
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,260
 Oh sure, I wouldn't want you to do any more than that.

417
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:28,460
 Quite a crowd out in front there, isn't it?

418
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:31,660
 Yeah, that new sign that's being hoisted into place is quite a job.

419
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:33,860
 I'm glad to have sort of a front row seat like this.

420
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:36,460
 Mr. Thompson, is Mr. Lappam here?

421
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:37,460
 Yeah, just a second.

422
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:38,960
 Hey, John, customer.

423
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,560
 Coming.

424
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,060
 - Whoa, Toby. - Hi, Han.

425
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,360
 Will it be Toby and haircut?

426
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,960
 Yeah, my mother says, "Give it the works."

427
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,060
 Get in the chair.

428
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:48,060
 Henry, were you just talking to that Natalie White a little while ago?

429
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:48,960
 Sure, why?

430
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,160
 Well, just because she's a new girl in town, Henry,

431
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,160
 You don't think you have to impress her with yourself?

432
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,160
 What do you mean?

433
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,160
 You don't know what you told her.

434
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:58,160
 I... about your picture being in the paper tomorrow.

435
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,160
 I told you that.

436
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,160
 Toby, I hardly brought the subject up.

437
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,160
 Hold your head still, Henry.

438
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,160
 You made the whole thing up just to make her think you were to somebody.

439
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,160
 You're crazy.

440
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,160
 You mean it isn't going to be in the paper?

441
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,160
 Yes, it is, Mr. Thompson.

442
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,160
 It is not.

443
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,160
 You want a bad Toby? You want a bad... Sure, I'll bet you.

444
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:14,160
 I'll bet you anything you want to. How much do you want a bad...

445
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,160
 Anything you want? All right, how much?

446
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,160
 Toby, I happen to know the paper is printing it.

447
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,160
 All right, all right. Here's what I'll bet you then.

448
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,660
 - Now look what you made me do. I'm giving you a bald spot.

449
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:24,660
 - Well, you better take it all off. I like it short.

450
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:27,160
 Henry, here's what I'll bet you. We'll make it a box of candy.

451
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,660
 If I win, you pay for it, and I'll give it to Natalie White.

452
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:32,660
 If you win, I'll pay for it, and you can give it to Natalie.

453
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:35,160
 - Say that again, Toby. - Wholesale.

454
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:39,660
 - Will you? - If I win, all you have to do is buy me a box of candy to give to Natalie.

455
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:42,660
 - And if I win, you buy me one to give her? - Sure.

456
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,160
 - Shape. - Shape. - Shape.

457
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,160
 - Hey. - Wholesale. - What's up, Ms. Mier?

458
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,160
 - It's a bat. - It's a bat.

459
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,160
 Hey Henry!

460
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,160
 What do you want Homer?

461
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:54,160
 I thought we were going to listen to the World Series this afternoon.

462
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,160
 Keep quiet while I finish combing his hair.

463
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,160
 But the game's begun. The first man struck out.

464
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,160
 I'll be right there Homer.

465
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,160
 Yeah, there you are Henry.

466
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,160
 Henry?

467
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,160
 - Ken, you hurry Mr. Lapham. - That job's perfect Henry.

468
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,160
 Now don't you even touch her comb to it.

469
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:08,160
 Well thank you very much Mr. Thompson. Frankly it's just exactly what I wanted.

470
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,160
 Hurry up Henry.

471
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,160
 I'm coming. Thank you Mr. Thompson.

472
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,160
 See you in a couple of weeks.

473
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,160
 And wait for me brothers. Mr. Lapham couldn't you just sort of chop it off.

474
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,000
 - What up?

475
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 - She whizzed, is that Toby think he knows everything?

476
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:20,840
 - Why?

477
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:23,480
 - He comes in and he tries to make out I'm a liar.

478
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:26,080
 My picture isn't gonna be in the paper tomorrow.

479
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:26,920
 - It isn't.

480
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,800
 - What?

481
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,120
 - It isn't.

482
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:30,960
 - What do you mean it isn't?

483
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,160
 You're crazy.

484
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,000
 Are you trying to make me out a liar, Henry?

485
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,880
 - You're the one that told me it was going to be in.

486
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,600
 - But I just heard that Guy no Corkel

487
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,480
 that took the picture dropped his camera.

488
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,320
 - When?

489
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,760
 - I don't know when he dropped it.

490
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:43,800
 How would I know?

491
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:47,260
 Well, Gee whiz, Homer, you should never miss Led me like that.

492
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:48,860
 Am I gonna be disgraced?

493
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:50,620
 Why care about Toby?

494
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:53,220
 Homer, it's all over town that my picture's going to be in.

495
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,780
 Well, don't blame me, Henry.

496
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:57,440
 Gee whiz, you think I wanna pay for a box of chocolates

497
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,180
 for Toby to give to Natalie?

498
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:01,780
 Then have him sit and even eat them with her?

499
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:04,200
 (jazz music)

500
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:12,740
 Again, mother?

501
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:13,740
 Yes, dear.

502
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,540
 Mother, what does Henry have to do again?

503
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:18,440
 Mary, dear, if I were you, I'd stay out of this.

504
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:21,140
 Oh, my goodness, Henry, it's worse than ever.

505
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:23,480
 Now, listen, Mary, I'm tired of this.

506
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,540
 All I've heard since I got up this morning is my hair.

507
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:27,140
 It's been hair, hair, hair.

508
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:28,740
 Henry, what, Homer?

509
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:30,240
 The Yangt's just scored.

510
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,900
 Mother, please don't make me go back and be trimmed again.

511
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,340
 Right in the middle of the world series.

512
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:37,220
 Henry, I don't want to hear another word about it.

513
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:39,340
 You're to go back and tell Mr. Thompson

514
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:41,340
 that I want your hair cut correctly

515
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,340
 I'll know the reason why.

516
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:44,340
 Well, go.

517
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:46,340
 Only when I get back into that chair,

518
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:48,340
 it'll be just like getting up on the guillotage.

519
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:49,340
 Henry!

520
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:51,340
 Come on, Homer, we gotta go downtown again.

521
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:52,340
 No.

522
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:53,340
 Homer, I have to.

523
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:55,340
 Mother, do you want me to go within this time?

524
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:58,340
 Listen, Mary, don't you even come near that barber shop.

525
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,340
 What do you have to go for, Henry?

526
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:02,340
 I have to have my hair cut again.

527
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:05,340
 How are you gonna have it done this time?

528
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:07,340
 [laughter]

529
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:09,340
 Well, I don't give a darn howie cut,

530
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:10,340
 I've lost interest.

531
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:12,340
 Aren't you even interested in how the yanks come out?

532
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:13,340
 No.

533
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:14,340
 Did you have that snapshot of me?

534
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:15,340
 Sure.

535
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,340
 Do you understand what you're going to do with it?

536
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:18,340
 Sure.

537
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:20,340
 I just put it under the door of the Times office and beat it.

538
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:21,340
 Is my name on the back?

539
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:22,340
 Sure.

540
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:26,340
 It says Henry W. Aldrich, chairman of the class debt committee.

541
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:28,340
 I guess that'll put Toby in his place.

542
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:32,340
 It's too bad you don't have one where you're not in a bathing suit.

543
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:34,340
 You think they'll really print it Homer?

544
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:36,340
 To be honest, no.

545
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:38,340
 But I'll tell you how you could get it in though.

546
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:40,340
 - How? - Get engaged.

547
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,340
 Then they'd be sure to print your picture.

548
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:44,340
 On the society page.

549
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:46,340
 In a bathing suit?

550
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:47,340
 What difference would that make?

551
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,340
 You'd win the box of candy.

552
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:51,340
 I know how I might get my picture in.

553
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:52,340
 How?

554
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:54,340
 If I could only be near a good accident just as it comes off,

555
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:56,340
 then maybe I could.

556
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:58,340
 Look out, Harry, do you want to be killed?

557
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:00,340
 He was. Why does he watch where he's going?

558
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:04,340
 Boy, I practically saved your life.

559
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:06,340
 I'm not sure you should have.

560
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:09,820
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

561
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:21,220
 Box of candy, eh?

562
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:22,260
 Yes, Mr. Aldrich.

563
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:23,940
 And Toby was sitting in this chair here,

564
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:27,100
 and your son Henry was over there in Mr. Thompson's chair.

565
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,700
 And they started arguing about Henry

566
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,620
 having his picture in the paper tomorrow.

567
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:32,060
 Is it going to be in?

568
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,460
 So he says, Mr. Aldrich.

569
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:35,500
 And Toby says he's crazy.

570
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,540
 That's how they came to bet the box of candy.

571
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:40,420
 Well, now then is there anything else?

572
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:41,660
 You all through shaving me?

573
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:42,500
 Yes, sir.

574
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,700
 I'll tell you what you can give me.

575
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,540
 A couple of good, the hot towels.

576
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:46,380
 Yes, sir.

577
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:49,180
 Just let me lie under them for a while and relax.

578
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:51,260
 Yes, Mr. Orange.

579
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:52,900
 You heard how the ball game's going?

580
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:55,620
 42, seventh inning.

581
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:58,140
 Now, just put your head back, Mr. Orange.

582
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:00,420
 Good.

583
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,460
 Too, huh?

584
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:02,380
 No.

585
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:04,580
 No feels good.

586
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:06,780
 Mr. Lopman, is Mr. Thompson here?

587
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:09,220
 Well, you back who wants me?

588
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:11,480
 It's Henry, Mr. Thompson.

589
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,820
 Now what?

590
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:14,420
 Yeah, Mr. Thompson.

591
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:16,220
 Could I just have a word with you?

592
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:17,500
 You've changed your mind again?

593
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,420
 Who knows?

594
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:21,920
 No, as far as I'm concerned, my hair's just perfect the way it is.

595
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,780
 Only if you'd be willing to cut it a little short,

596
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:26,140
 I'd be glad to pay a $0.60 out of my allowance.

597
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,940
 What do you want to do that for?

598
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,700
 You rolling in money?

599
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:30,820
 I don't care about money.

600
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:33,340
 The main thing is, I want to see everybody satisfied.

601
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:36,340
 Well, hop up there. I'll get my clippers.

602
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:40,040
 Between this haircut and that box of candy you bet you're going to be broke.

603
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:42,040
 She was, why should I worry about money?

604
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:44,740
 My allowance has gone as always. Plenty more where it came from.

605
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:52,240
 I don't like it personal, Mr. Thompson, but I wonder if they have your hot towels. Aren't too hot.

606
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,340
 What makes you say that?

607
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:55,440
 I thought I heard the man in the next chair groans.

608
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,640
 It's still, Henry.

609
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,940
 Yes, sir.

610
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:04,940
 [Music]

611
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:07,940
 If your mother doesn't like it this time, it won't be my fault.

612
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:13,940
 [Music]

613
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:15,940
 You think you ought to make it that short?

614
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:18,940
 Sure. We're closed all day tomorrow, and this is your last chance.

615
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:22,940
 [Laughter]

616
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:25,940
 I know Mr. Thompson both still, don't even speak.

617
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:27,540
 (buzzing)

618
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:29,340
 (sighs)

619
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:30,680
 There.

620
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:33,040
 - Well, I think that's much...

621
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,780
 Will that be a full 60 cents, Mr. Thompson?

622
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:36,940
 - Forget it.

623
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:37,780
 - Forget it?

624
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:39,620
 - Yeah, and I'll try and do the same.

625
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:41,280
 - Well, thank you very much.

626
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,520
 Now let me go home and watch the game

627
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,360
 without anything on my mind.

628
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,220
 Give all Mr. Thompson, I'll see you in two weeks.

629
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:47,720
 - Forget it.

630
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,700
 - Hey Henry, Henry.

631
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,860
 - Oh, I thought you were Henry Aldrich.

632
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:55,900
 (audience laughing)

633
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:58,500
 I am Henry Aldrich.

634
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,360
 What happened to you?

635
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:02,300
 Now listen, Homer, what is it you want?

636
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,260
 Turn around and let me see your face.

637
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:05,540
 You're looking at my face.

638
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:07,540
 [LAUGHTER]

639
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:09,820
 Did you take care of the picture?

640
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:11,000
 I got caught.

641
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:11,900
 Wear Homer.

642
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:14,220
 Sticking your picture under the time's door.

643
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:16,300
 Just as I put it there, the door opened,

644
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:18,780
 and they told me to take it and beat it.

645
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:21,180
 Well, she was, Homer, you're a big help.

646
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:23,340
 Hello, Henry.

647
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:25,540
 Oh, I thought you were.

648
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:26,940
 Oh my!

649
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:28,700
 Now listen Natalie!

650
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:41,220
 You have some scrambled eggs, Henry?

651
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:42,460
 No, thank you Father.

652
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:43,340
 Mary!

653
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:44,260
 Yes Mother?

654
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:47,620
 Will you please tell your brother he just spilled some marmalade?

655
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:50,340
 But I'm not speaking to him either Mother.

656
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:51,220
 Why not?

657
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:55,460
 Well look at him Father, his head is practically shaved.

658
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:57,220
 Well, she whiz, Mary.

659
00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:00,340
 After you've gone to the barbershop as many times and one day as I did yesterday,

660
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:02,260
 you can't expect to have much hair left.

661
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:05,180
 Let's not even mention Henry's hair anymore.

662
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:07,140
 I'm going to get ready to go to church.

663
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:09,020
 I'll be ready to go with you just a minute, mother.

664
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:11,340
 Oh, no, you're not going with me.

665
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:13,980
 Well, she whiz.

666
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:16,500
 I mean, I can't appear in public with anyone in the family.

667
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:19,100
 Henry, have you been down to corner to get the times?

668
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:19,820
 No, Father.

669
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:20,820
 Did you forget it?

670
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:22,020
 No, sir. I...

671
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:24,620
 I just thought you'd like to eat breakfast and peace.

672
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:26,420
 Without worrying about anything.

673
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:27,980
 As soon as you finish your breakfast,

674
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:29,500
 would you please go and get the paper?

675
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:30,980
 Yes, sir.

676
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:33,580
 But first, could I make a proposition with you?

677
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:35,580
 What kind of a proposition?

678
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:37,780
 Well, if I go down and get the paper,

679
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:40,140
 not only this morning, but every Sunday morning

680
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:44,540
 for the next six months, could you advance me a dollar and a half?

681
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:47,460
 To buy a box of candy.

682
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:49,220
 A box of candy?

683
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:50,820
 Oh, but what do you mean by that?

684
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:53,260
 I thought you were rolling in money.

685
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:54,860
 I'm rolling in it.

686
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:56,940
 After all, when your allowance runs out,

687
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:59,500
 there's always plenty more where it came from, isn't there?

688
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,460
 Who told you that?

689
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:02,460
 - Just Tom and Gossett. - A Mary?

690
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:03,380
 Yes, Mother.

691
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:06,620
 Will you please tell your brother that Toby Smith is very anxious

692
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:08,420
 to speak to him on the phone?

693
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:11,860
 Mother, could you please tell him I can't possibly come to the phone?

694
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:12,900
 Why not?

695
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,220
 I'm sick in bed.

696
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:15,340
 But you're not.

697
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:17,900
 Couldn't you say he's been scalped?

698
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:21,260
 Please, Mother, tell him I can't come to the phone.

699
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:22,260
 Who's that?

700
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:24,900
 Excuse me. Excuse me, but is Henry here?

701
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:25,860
 What do you want, Homer?

702
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:28,260
 Did you see the paper? Did you see the paper?

703
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:29,420
 Not even interested in it.

704
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:32,620
 Did you see the front page? Here, take a look.

705
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:33,940
 What? At this?

706
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:36,820
 What is it? Just three pictures of their putting up that new sign

707
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:38,060
 in front of the Times office.

708
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:41,140
 Don't you see yourself? Me? Where?

709
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:44,180
 Sitting in Thompson's barbershop in the chair.

710
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:46,940
 I am? Well, how do they have the print back?

711
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:48,820
 Well, why don't you read what it says?

712
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:52,140
 These three unusual photographs were snapped in front

713
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:57,140
 of the Times building yesterday at 11 a.m., 1 p.m., and 3 p.m.

714
00:27:57,140 --> 00:28:00,140
 (audience laughing)

715
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:04,220
 Which one am I in?

716
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:05,140
 All three.

717
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:08,080
 (audience laughing)

718
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,060
 All three.

719
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:12,740
 Look at yourself under my magnifying glass, Henry.

720
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:16,020
 You can even see the sky where Mr. Thompson cuts you.

721
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:17,900
 Well, gee, where's?

722
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:19,220
 Look pretty good, don't I?

723
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:23,940
 My other is told we still on the phone.

724
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:26,940
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

725
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:36,700
 You would be a poor businessman to invest money

726
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:39,500
 without determining what your dividend would be.

727
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,140
 So I'd like to tell you what return

728
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:44,820
 you'll receive on your investment in your community test.

729
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:49,220
 Well, normally, about 40% of 100 families received directly

730
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:53,900
 Services of some kind from one or more red feather agencies during the year.

731
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:56,460
 So that services include aid to the handicap,

732
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:59,900
 to orphan children, to the agent, and to the sick and needy.

733
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:04,860
 All families benefit indirectly because these services work to make your community

734
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:08,260
 a healthier, happier, better place in which to live.

735
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:11,220
 Well, this year it's a bigger red feather because

736
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:13,420
 the United Red Feather Campaign

737
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:16,460
 must raise $17 million extra

738
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:19,460
 to provide for the United Defense Fund services,

739
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:23,980
 which include 257 USO clubs, USO camp shows,

740
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:27,200
 American Relief for Korea, and many others.

741
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,720
 So when you make your contribution,

742
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,820
 give enough to cover normal needs,

743
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:33,300
 plus an extra amount for the added services

744
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:36,540
 made necessary by this defense emergency.

745
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:38,660
 It's a bigger red feather this year.

746
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:40,420
 Give the United Way.

747
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:43,000

749

 She homer, am I sore at Toby?

750
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,160
 Why, Henry?

751
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,520
 Didn't he give you the box of candy to give to Natalie?

752
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,600
 Sure he did.

753
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,800
 But I didn't know he was going to put my pictures in it.

754
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,320
 Those three getting your hair cut?

755
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,120
 Sure.

756
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,920
 And on the bottom he wrote, "Charmon of the Class Debt

757
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,280
 Committee, going into debt."
