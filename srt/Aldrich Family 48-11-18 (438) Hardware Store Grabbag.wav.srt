1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 It's the Aldrich family. I beg your pardon. We said it's the Aldrich family. Yes, it's the Aldrich family presented by the Jell-O family. J-E-L-L-O. Oh, Meredith, Meredith, will I? Well, it's my talking people all ready to enjoy the Aldrich family. Oh, hey, hey, what's the matter here? Got to do the dinner dishes.

2
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,360
 You can still listen to Henry in a homer and do the dinner dishes too.

3
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:35,600
 Hey! Good idea, Bob.

4
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,560
 You bet it's a good idea, Bob.

5
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:38,760
 Did you have a good dinner?

6
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,280
 You bet!

7
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,280
 You!

8
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,160
 Sounds like you had smooth as green jello puddings, maybe.

9
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,000
 Uh...

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:46,800
 No.

11
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,300
 No.

12
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:49,880
 Well, then maybe the pudding with the personality and the dimple?

13
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,440
 Jello tapioca pudding?

14
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:51,940
 Right.

15
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:53,280
 Did you have jello tapioca pudding?

16
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,840
 Uh...

17
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:55,340
 No.

18
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:55,840
 No.

19
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,240
 Well, then what did you have for dessert?

20
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,240
 The world will famous shimmery

21
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,240
 These are...

22
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,240
 That's jello.

23
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,240
 In those six delicious flavors

24
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:05,240
 Starting with strawberry

25
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:07,240
 Let's berry

26
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,240
 Cherry

27
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,240
 Lemon

28
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,240
 Lemon

29
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,240
 Mmmm

30
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,240
 Mmmm

31
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,240
 Can't eat

32
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,240
 out health

33
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,240
 Oh

34
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,240
 Would you like it?

35
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,240
 Oh no, not much

36
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,240
 I hope I'll speak to you

37
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:29,240
 Hey, look at that clock.

38
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,240
 It's time for...

39
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:36,240
 The Aldrich family, based on characters originated by Clifford Goldsmith,

40
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:41,240
 and starring Ezra Stone as Henry with Jackie Kelke as Homer.

41
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:44,240
 Henry! Henry Aldrich!

42
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,240
 A Ming Mother!

43
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:53,240
 [applause]

44
00:01:53,240 --> 00:02:01,840
 Life's greatest gift is you.

45
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,460
 And fortunately, it isn't confined to anyone age.

46
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,760
 Youth can be recaptured at any time by anyone

47
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:13,120
 who simply shares the experiences of an enthusiastic teenage boy

48
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,760
 like Henry Aldridge.

49
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:18,000
 The scene opens in Henry's bedroom. It is Saturday morning.

50
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,560
 Now listen, Henry, that's no way to hold it.

51
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,960
 It is so y-you have to tip it.

52
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,760
 Then how can you get the knife in?

53
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,900
 Homer, what go? Gee whiz, whose piggy bank is this anyway?

54
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,600
 Okay, go ahead if you're so smart.

55
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:36,160
 Why should I help you scrape up money to throw down the drain?

56
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,200
 What do you mean down the drain?

57
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:42,660
 If I can get enough money out of this bank, I'm gonna ask Kathleen to go to a movie tonight.

58
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:46,660
 Henry, you're crazy. You take Kathleen to a movie in what have you got?

59
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:50,660
 A lot of memories and a good night kiss. If you're lucky.

60
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:54,660
 What's wrong with that? Well, you can do that any old time.

61
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:59,660
 But boy, it isn't every day in the week that Springer's hardware has a grab bag sale.

62
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:02,660
 That's just it, Homer. You buy a grab bag and where are you?

63
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:06,660
 But take Kathleen to the movies and at least you know what you're getting.

64
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:11,660
 Sure. So why not buy a grab bag and get pleasantly surprised?

65
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:14,160
 Boy, another dime!

66
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,860
 How much have you got out of your bank now?

67
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:17,260
 50 cents so far.

68
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:18,460
 50 cents?

69
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:21,060
 And there's one more coin in here.

70
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:27,560
 Boy, if I had 50 cents, I'd get my best friend and pull our money and invest it in a grab bag.

71
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:31,160
 Now wait a minute Homer, how much money have you actually got?

72
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,560
 A dime.

73
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,260
 Okay, so stop wasting your breath on grab bags.

74
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,660
 My mind is made up.

75
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:41,260
 What Henry, did I tell you those grab bags have values up to ten dollars in them?

76
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:43,260
 Hey, look, a quarter!

77
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:43,760
 Yeah?

78
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,260
 That gives me exactly enough to cover Kathleen.

79
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:49,260
 Two balcony seats, two sodas, and a nickel's worth of candy.

80
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:53,760
 Oi, what you couldn't get at spring or $0.75.

81
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,760
 $0.75?

82
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,260
 You mean they have grab bags as low as that?

83
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:59,760
 Sure, none of them are over a dollar.

84
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,260
 Homer, you're crazy.

85
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:04,760
 Are you telling me they have $10 values all for under a dollar?

86
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:08,260
 Sure, it's the chance of a lifetime, Henry. You can't lose.

87
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:10,260
 But how can you be sure what you're getting?

88
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:14,500
 That's the beautiful part. You can. That's where the fun comes in.

89
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,860
 See, it does sound interesting.

90
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:20,660
 And you know what you might win, Henry? That bicycle pump you've been lying.

91
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,860
 Oh, boy. Do you really think so?

92
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:23,660
 Oh, Henry.

93
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:24,660
 Yes, Father?

94
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,660
 You think that's out here in the hall a moment?

95
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:27,660
 Sure, Father.

96
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:28,660
 Homer, wait here.

97
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:29,660
 Okay, but don't be long.

98
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:33,660
 I have it just passing your room, Henry. I couldn't help overhearing.

99
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,660
 You mean about the grab bag sale, Father?

100
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:36,660
 Then that sounds swell.

101
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:39,260
 Frankly, son, it sounds a little risky to me.

102
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:40,260
 to me.

103
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:43,260
 Risky for other gee wizards the chance of a lifetime.

104
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:46,460
 When you invest in one of those grab bags you can't lose.

105
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:48,700
 Even though you have no idea what it might be inside.

106
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,780
 But that's the beautiful part father.

107
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:53,100
 There might be anything inside.

108
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,420
 There might also be nothing.

109
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:57,180
 But Homer said their value is up to ten dollars.

110
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:00,060
 Henry, I want you to make your own decision in this matter.

111
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:03,900
 But remember one thing, merchants can very seldom afford to give away anything valuable.

112
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:07,100
 But, father, do you know what I might get for seventy-five cents?

113
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,860
 A bicycle pump.

114
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:10,620
 Henry, you're being very optimistic.

115
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,220
 I have it on good authority.

116
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:14,300
 Now, son, I know all about grab bags.

117
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,220
 I've had my fingers burned. You haven't.

118
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:19,060
 But, Father, these bags are entirely different.

119
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:21,060
 Henry, let me explain one more thing.

120
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,460
 We're going to time.

121
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:33,100
 Hello?

122
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,900
 Hello?

123
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:35,580
 Hello?

124
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,100
 Hello, Kathleen.

125
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:39,700
 Listen, I'm phoning from Springer's hardware, see?

126
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:40,900
 Oh, hello, Mr. Springer.

127
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:41,700
 And who?

128
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:42,260
 What?

129
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:44,340
 Kathleen, this is Henry.

130
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:46,940
 I'm down here at Springer's with Homer and his dime.

131
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:47,740
 You are?

132
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:48,580
 Sure.

133
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:52,540
 And look, how would you like to go to the movies tonight?

134
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:53,740
 The movies?

135
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:55,740
 I'd love to, Henry.

136
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,300
 And sit in the balcony?

137
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,300
 Uh-huh.

138
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,860
 Way in the back?

139
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,180
 Uh-huh.

140
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:02,380
 What's playing?

141
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:04,580
 Playing?

142
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:06,460
 Kathleen, don't you like me anymore?

143
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:08,220
 (audience laughing)

144
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,920
 - Of course I do.

145
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,740
 - I know, but, well, Gee, you never used to ask

146
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:13,900
 what was playing.

147
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:16,100
 - Well, honey, it's a perfectly minor point.

148
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,660
 - Okay, then it's all settled.

149
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,580
 I'll come by for you right after supper.

150
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:20,700
 - Thanks, Henry.

151
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,020
 Goodbye.

152
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,020
 - Goodbye.

153
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:26,380
 - Hey, Henry, look at this bag here.

154
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:27,220
 - Which one?

155
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,080
 - This one with all the bulges in it.

156
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,780
 Doesn't it drive you crazy wondering what's in it?

157
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:33,100
 - Not me, Homer.

158
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,340
 I'm just down here to keep you company.

159
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:39,100
 She, and aren't you the least bit interested in buying anything?

160
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,540
 Not if I have to risk every cent I have in the world.

161
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:44,340
 Now you take this long skinny bag here.

162
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:46,300
 Yeah. It's 30 cents, isn't it?

163
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,820
 Sure. Go ahead, and why don't you buy it?

164
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:53,180
 Why should I spend 30 cents for just a plain ordinary yardstick?

165
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,820
 A yardstick? Is that all that bag is?

166
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:58,820
 Sure. And she whizzed if I hadn't listened to my father,

167
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,380
 I might have been carried away.

168
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:01,980
 Hiya fellas. Here comes Willie.

169
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,220
 Hi fellas, what you doing?

170
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:05,320
 Just looking around, Willie.

171
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,020
 Yeah?

172
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:08,560
 Hey, Henry, are you gonna buy that wrong thin crab bag?

173
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,820
 He might be, Willie.

174
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,320
 I am not, Homer.

175
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,420
 Well, can I have a fan?

176
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:13,320
 Sure, here.

177
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:13,820
 Bank!

178
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,820
 Oh, Mr. Springer, here's my 30 cents!

179
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:18,320
 Wait, Willie, don't you know what's in that bag?

180
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,420
 Don't tell him, Homer.

181
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:20,020
 Don't tell him.

182
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,720
 You know how stubborn Willie is.

183
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,520
 Yeah, but...

184
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,920
 Let him get burnt by himself.

185
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,220
 It'll be a good lesson for him.

186
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,920
 Hey, you wanna watch me open my bag?

187
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,120
 Sure, Willie.

188
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,820
 I'll now stand back, fellas.

189
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:32,320
 Boy, I bet you'll get a surprise, Willie.

190
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,520
 - Yeah, I hope so.

191
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,040
 Hey!

192
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:36,760
 - What is it, Willie?

193
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,600
 Let's see.

194
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,760
 - Oh boy.

195
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,120
 - Oh boy.

196
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,840
 - A collapsible fishing rod.

197
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,440
 Just what I've always wanted.

198
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,200
 - Gee, those things cost about $7.

199
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,800
 Just think, Henry, you could have had it.

200
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,080
 - Yeah, but I could have sworn it.

201
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,760
 Let's see that fishing rod, Willie.

202
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,080
 Boy, this is slick.

203
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,600
 - Well, I'll say.

204
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,600
 - Gee, Gee, are you lucky?

205
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,720
 - I sure am.

206
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,920
 Well, sworn, fellas.

207
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,480
 Where are you going, Lily?

208
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,320
 - Fresh 'em?

209
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,640
 - Boy.

210
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,480
 - Boy.

211
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:12,000
 Henry, maybe your father still has a few things to learn.

212
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,960
 - Yeah.

213
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,960
 I guess he didn't live during a period of inflation.

214
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,320
 (audience laughing)

215
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,320
 - I'll say.

216
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,120
 You know, Homer, I've been thinking.

217
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:20,960
 - Yeah.

218
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,920
 - Kathleen might enjoy a movie tonight, sure.

219
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,240
 Only she'd be even crazier about something

220
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,480
 I might win in a grab bag for her, wouldn't she?

221
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,400
 - Now you're talking sense, Ham.

222
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,800
 - Sure, Homer, come on.

223
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,400
 Help me pick out a grab bag.

224
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,400
 How about this one?

225
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:38,680
 Boy, well my father hears that merchants really do give valuable things away.

226
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,680
 Hey Henry.

227
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,680
 Hi Charlie.

228
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:41,680
 Don't bother us Charlie.

229
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,680
 We're busy looking for a grab bag to buy.

230
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:44,680
 Yeah, what?

231
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,680
 How should we know Charlie?

232
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,680
 We haven't bought it yet.

233
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:50,360
 Well if this told me Smith I'm going to see what he got in his grab bag.

234
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,640
 Listen Henry, how would you like to buy this nifty box of clothes pin?

235
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,640
 Clothes pins?

236
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,240
 What could I possibly do with clothes pins?

237
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,560
 Well you could use them to hang girls pictures up on your wall.

238
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,560
 What?

239
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:05,420
 for starting fires. Charlie you're crazy. Oh now look Henry I paid 25 cents for

240
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:10,740
 him and I'll let you have him for 20. Oh no. 15. Nothing doing. 10. Well you pay a

241
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:14,680
 quarter for a thing like that for. I got it in the grab bag and boy am I gonna

242
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:18,820
 sue Mr. Springer. Well look Charlie naturally merchants can't give away

243
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:24,100
 valuable things in every grab bag. Hey Henry get some just bought what for 60 cents.

244
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:29,900
 A paint sprayer. Why? Toby Smith for only 60 cents. Homer what could you do with a

245
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:34,700
 thing like that except spray paint. Plenty. I happen to know my father would pay five

246
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:40,460
 dollars for a new paint spray. Five dollars? Five dollars. You look. Cold cash? Cold cash? I'm the

247
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:46,300
 line Henry. He's gonna need one to paint our house. Oh boy. Oh boy. Let's start looking home where

248
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:50,460
 there might be another sprayer in these grab bags here. There might. She whizzed a bite. Where are

249
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:55,420
 you going Charlie? Home and get some more money. One thing about a paint sprayer home where you can

250
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:56,820
 and tell it by the feel of it.

251
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:59,020
 - Okay, I'll start feeling from this side.

252
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,460
 - Sure, and I'll start over here.

253
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:02,020
 - And we'll feel taught each other.

254
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:02,940
 - Oh, why?

255
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,380
 - Yes, Mr. Springer?

256
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:07,180
 - All right, but we can't allow any feeling around.

257
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:09,860
 (audience laughing)

258
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,940
 - Make a chance of it like everybody else.

259
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:13,460
 - Sure, Mr. Springer.

260
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:16,300
 - Boy, Homer, that's what I call loyalty.

261
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,140
 - How do you mean?

262
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:18,980
 - See, Mr. Springer is practically a member

263
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:20,460
 of our own family, isn't he?

264
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:21,300
 - He is.

265
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,500
 - Sure, he's engaged to my aunt, Harriet.

266
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,500
 Well frankly I don't blame him for being cranky.

267
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,500
 (audience laughs)

268
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:32,500
 Homer are you positive you didn't feel anything remotely like a paint spray?

269
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,500
 Positive. You couldn't mistake a thing like that.

270
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,500
 Boy what I couldn't do with five dollars.

271
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,500
 Makes me a week to think about it.

272
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,500
 Let's sit down.

273
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,500
 Hey, Henry.

274
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,500
 Yeah?

275
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,500
 I found one.

276
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,500
 A paint sprayer?

277
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,500
 Yeah, I'm sitting on it.

278
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,500
 Who were you sure?

279
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,500
 Sure, I'm sure.

280
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:58,100
 home where I forgot I left my 75 cents at home. Well that's a fine thing. Look Homer you stay

281
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:02,420
 right here and guard this paint sprayer while I run home for my money. But what if somebody

282
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:07,220
 else wants to buy it? Just don't let them and Homer if you can keep it for me I'll give you a dollar

283
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:10,180
 when I sell. Okay Henry run.

284
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:23,100
 It's nice of you to drop in Harry. It's sit down. I'll pour you some coffee.

285
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,740
 Thank you, Alice. How sad.

286
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:26,100
 He's just fine.

287
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,860
 How's Mr. Springer?

288
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:29,780
 Alvin? Just fine.

289
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:31,660
 Art men a problem.

290
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:32,420
 Oh.

291
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:35,340
 Have you and Alvin had a quarrel, Harry?

292
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:37,420
 Oh no, just a little disagreement.

293
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:39,980
 Alvin thinks I should take a painting again.

294
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:40,620
 Really?

295
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:43,420
 Yes, he believes in women having outside interest.

296
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:48,540
 But as I said to him, I said, "Alvin, I said frankly, I don't think I'm very talented, do you?"

297
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:53,940
 Well to tell you the absolute truth, Harry, and he said, "Yes, Harry, it's I do."

298
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,940
 Oh. Oh, he did.

299
00:11:55,940 --> 00:12:00,940
 Of course, he admits he doesn't know a thing about art, but he knows what he likes.

300
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:01,940
 Isn't that nice?

301
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:02,940
 Four-thousand.

302
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:06,940
 He just can't help seeing me through rose-colored glasses, I guess.

303
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:07,940
 Mother!

304
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:08,940
 Oh my goodness, that's Henry.

305
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:10,940
 Mother, quick, where's my 75 cents glow in, Harry?

306
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:11,940
 Hello.

307
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:16,940
 Henry, you told me to keep it for you and not to give it to you under any circumstances until tonight.

308
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:21,360
 Mother don't you understand I've cornered a valuable grab bag and I'm going to make a killing.

309
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,340
 You've forgotten what your father says?

310
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:26,160
 No, only he doesn't understand. This sale is different.

311
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,140
 I know!

312
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:29,820
 Henry is right. I happen to know personally.

313
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:32,780
 There are some very valuable grab bags down there.

314
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:35,240
 It's very well I'll go upstairs and get your money.

315
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:38,380
 You will? That just give me time to make a phone call.

316
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:39,660
 Number please!

317
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:40,900
 Alm, 1-1-0.

318
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:41,980
 Alm, 1-1-0.

319
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:43,040
 Yes, operator.

320
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,220
 Harriet, I do wish you let me have.

321
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:47,720
 Mother, can you please hurry with my money?

322
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,220
 With my money?

323
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:49,720
 Homer's sitting on something.

324
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,720
 Hello.

325
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,720
 Hello, Kathleen.

326
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,720
 Let me ask you something quick.

327
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,720
 What is it?

328
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:59,220
 Well, suppose, just suppose you were going out dancing to the country club.

329
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,220
 Oh my goodness, when?

330
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:03,220
 Well, suppose it's tonight, see.

331
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:05,220
 What color dress would you be wearing?

332
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,220
 What color?

333
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,220
 Sure.

334
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:09,220
 So I could send you flowers, if.

335
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,220
 Flowers!

336
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:14,220
 If I provide it, I get $5 for a certain something I'm going to win and it doesn't cost too much for a tax.

337
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:17,000
 - Oh my goodness, Henry, you mean we're going in a taxi?

338
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,300
 - We might, so what color, Kathleen?

339
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,900
 - What, just any color?

340
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:23,220
 Although I do like those big black shiny ones.

341
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,540
 - Black flowers?

342
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:25,900
 - Are we talking about taxi?

343
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,900
 - No, Gee, who is?

344
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:30,820
 - Oh my goodness, well, any orchid color flower will do.

345
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:32,300
 And I have to hurry and get my hair done.

346
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,140
 - But, but Kathleen--

347
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,300
 - Well, I know, Henry, I'll see you tonight.

348
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,100
 - Sure, only understand, it isn't death on that,

349
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,220
 don't you, Kathleen?

350
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:39,180
 Kathleen!

351
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:41,760
 (upbeat music)

352
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,340
 (upbeat music)

353
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:50,280
 - Now wait a minute, Charlie, what are you doing?

354
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,520
 - What do you mean what am I doing?

355
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,040
 I'm trying to pick out a paint sprayer.

356
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,440
 - But you're not allowed to feel a grab bag.

357
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,000
 You just have to take your chin.

358
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,720
 - Now listen Homer, since when do you own this hardware store?

359
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,840
 - Charlie, get away from this grab bag.

360
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,160
 - But it might be a paint sprayer.

361
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,600
 - And it might not, and besides it's reserved.

362
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,080
 - Then it is a paint sprayer.

363
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,800
 - Now listen, Charlie, not Homer, let go of me.

364
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:14,280
 Charlie don't get mad. I didn't mean to push you. Let's just talk this over

365
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:18,880
 calmly. Oh yeah listen you little pith squeeze. Charlie you're backing right

366
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:25,960
 into the garden hole. I'll take this grab bag here. Hey. Hey that's Henry's grab bag

367
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:33,160
 old lady. Homer you've got the hose looped over your arms. Lady come back. Homer look out! Hey!

368
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:52,160
 [Music]

369
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:58,160
 It's a fact, folks. More people buy jello puddings than any other prepared puddings in the world and no wonder.

370
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,160
 because you never tasted anything better than jello puddings.

371
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,160
 Yes, jello chocolate butter, scotch and vanilla puddings,

372
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:08,160
 chuck full of old-fashioned homemade goodness.

373
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,160
 Try 'em. Compare them.

374
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:14,160
 See if you don't say that jello puddings are richer, creamier,

375
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,160
 more all-around delicious, and they cook to perfection in just about five minutes.

376
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,160
 Ask your grocer for jello puddings and say,

377
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:26,160
 better ask for three packages while you're about it, so you'll be prepared for the weekend.

378
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,160
 That's Jell-O putting.

379
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,160
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

380
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:44,160
 And now getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldridge.

381
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:48,160
 Hoping to make a fortune from a grab bag he wants to buy and then sell for a profit,

382
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:53,160
 Henry has been planning to entertain Kathleen elaborately this evening.

383
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:57,160
 But his chances of getting the money are now getting slimmer and slimmer.

384
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:01,160
 The scene opens in a back room of Alvin Springer's Sanderville Hardware Store.

385
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,160
 It is the same morning.

386
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:07,160
 Excuse me, Mr. Have you seen anything of my friend Homer Brown?

387
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,160
 I have no friend of mine Henry already.

388
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,160
 Homer, is that you?

389
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,160
 Sure, just look at it.

390
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,160
 I am, Gee, what has happened to your face?

391
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,160
 Never mind my face. That'll wash off.

392
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:20,160
 But how can I get all this pain and grease off my clothes?

393
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,160
 What have you been doing?

394
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:26,560
 Boy, everything. Hoisting paint drums, mixing putty, filling turpentine bottles.

395
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,360
 But why?

396
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,560
 Just because I had a little accident trying to save your darn grab back.

397
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,360
 You mean it's gone, but I was counting on that five dollars.

398
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,760
 Kathleen thinks I'm taking her out dancing tonight.

399
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:40,560
 Listen, Henry. How much do you think you could sell an outboard motor for?

400
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,060
 An outboard motor? Homer, you're crazy.

401
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:46,960
 Who's crazy? You know the one Mr. Springer's had in his window for two years.

402
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:51,120
 Sure, but it just happened an hour ago. I saw him lugging into that room over there

403
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:57,960
 Yeah, and then he came back in here with that box and he said whoever buys it this afternoon is gonna get the surprise of their life

404
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:03,360
 Homer do you mean it and it's only 75 so sure it's what they call a sleeper. Oh

405
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:10,240
 Boy gee I could sell that for ten times as much as the paint sprayer sure so you owe me ten dollars

406
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:15,200
 Oh, hold on. Second thought I probably can't get more than five times as much.

407
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,200
 Now listen, listen.

408
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:19,200
 Look, why don't I go out now and round up a prospective buyer?

409
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,200
 Oh, Homer.

410
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:23,200
 Mr. Springer, what time are those grab bags going on sale?

411
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,200
 It looks like Char, Henry.

412
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:27,200
 You're sure you won't sell any of them before that?

413
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,200
 Nope.

414
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,200
 Gee, that's, well, goodbye, Homer. I'll be back.

415
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:34,200
 Homer, I've been keeping an eye on you this morning. You've certainly done a good job back here.

416
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,200
 I have.

417
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:40,200
 Yes, sir. And to show my appreciation, I'm going to let you have any grab bag you'd like for that dime of yours.

418
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:45,440
 a dime. You mean I can have any bag at all? Yes sir. You mean I could even have the

419
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:50,880
 outboard motor. What outboard motor? Oh gee I shouldn't have mentioned it. I mean

420
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:57,960
 this big grab bag right here. Oh Murr that isn't an outboard motor. It isn't. Oh boy

421
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,080
 is Henry gonna get a surprise.

422
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:09,580
 [Music]

423
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:10,080
 Hello!

424
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,080
 Hello, Kathleen!

425
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:13,080
 Henry, is it only you?

426
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,080
 What do you mean, only me?

427
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,080
 Oh my goodness, you dragged me out from under the dryer!

428
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,080
 I did?

429
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:19,080
 I'm standing right here positively dripping!

430
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:25,080
 Look, Kathleen, I just wanted to tell you that the thing I'm selling now is much more valuable than the thing I was selling before!

431
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,080
 It is, Henry!

432
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,080
 Yeah!

433
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,080
 What is?

434
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,760
 I can't tell you. I'm down at the Acme Machine Works right now.

435
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,080
 And we are going to the country cup tonight, aren't we?

436
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,760
 Sure, absolutely. And not only that.

437
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:37,420
 Yes?

438
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:40,400
 Kathleen, how would you feel about a season ticket?

439
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,800
 A season ticket?

440
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,640
 Sure, and go every Saturday night in the year.

441
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,640
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

442
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:57,040
 Boy, Mr. Springer, the grand prize.

443
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,280
 You're certainly the lucky one today, Homer.

444
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,260
 It's the only thing I ever won in my whole life.

445
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:03,920
 Do you mind if I use your phone?

446
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:04,680
 Go ahead.

447
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,380
 Thanks.

448
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:06,480
 Now, Brooklyn.

449
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,000
 I owe him 6-1-0.

450
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,200
 I owe him 6-1-0.

451
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,840
 She and Mr. Springer, to think Henry's Aunt Harriet painted that all by herself.

452
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,260
 Yes, sir, and she's never had a lesson in her life.

453
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:17,280
 Would you believe it?

454
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,200
 Well, to tell you the truth...

455
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,200
 Neither would I.

456
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,600
 All it needs now is a nice brand.

457
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,520
 Hello!

458
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,640
 Hello, mother.

459
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,840
 Guess who this is?

460
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,440
 Oh, my don't be silly.

461
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,240
 Listen, Mother, a wonderful thing just happened.

462
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,840
 I just bought a grab bag.

463
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,640
 I thought you didn't have enough money to buy one.

464
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:39,040
 Well, I didn't, but Mr. Springer just had me move a few paint drums and gave it to me for practically nothing.

465
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:39,540
 Really?

466
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:41,840
 And, Mother, I won the grand prize.

467
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:42,540
 You are?

468
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:46,840
 Sure, and it's something you've always wanted, and I'd be willing to let it go, cheat.

469
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,840
 Oh, Rhett, it isn't... it isn't sure.

470
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,340
 It's a sort of a painting.

471
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:52,440
 Oh, my heavens.

472
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,740
 And for the inside or the outside of the house...

473
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:55,340
 Why?

474
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:58,620
 Oh, you're a deer and now would you hang up? I'm too excited.

475
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:02,140
 Okay, and don't worry, Mother. Mr. Springer's gonna clean me up.

476
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:03,580
 That's nice, dear. Goodbye.

477
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:04,220
 Goodbye.

478
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:07,020
 Oh, Mr. Springer.

479
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:08,140
 Yes, Homer.

480
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:11,260
 Have you tried looking at this painting upside down?

481
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:22,380
 Oh, Alice, I just had a dash right over.

482
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:23,880
 And Mrs. will tell me again.

483
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,680
 Homer won the grand prize.

484
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:28,980
 We're having our house painted absolutely free.

485
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,180
 Oh my god.

486
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:31,580
 Oh, is it marvelous?

487
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:34,380
 And Mr. Spring has already given home with the drums of paint.

488
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:38,380
 And Mrs. and I had no idea there was anything worthwhile in those grand days.

489
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:40,380
 Oh, Alice, I still can't believe it.

490
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:43,580
 You know, Will and I had to choose this year between having a house painted

491
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:47,080
 or getting me a new fur coat and we decided on the house.

492
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:47,680
 Really?

493
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:51,580
 Yes, we agreed the house takes more of a beating in the window than I do.

494
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:53,180
 (audience laughing)

495
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:54,580
 - Mr. Booker's not mean that now?

496
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:56,220
 - Why not, Alice, why not?

497
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:59,740
 I'll get you head on, let's go look at fur coats right away.

498
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:01,100
 Shouldn't you wait until we'll,

499
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,900
 Alice, I'm only going to look.

500
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:05,480
 (upbeat music)

501
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:13,580
 - Hello?

502
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:15,020
 Are you listening, Kathleen?

503
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:16,620
 - Of course, Henry, then what happened?

504
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:19,340
 - Well, I found a fella who had a boat, see,

505
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:20,620
 but no motor.

506
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:22,820
 Yes, and you sold him your motor?

507
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:24,180
 And not exactly.

508
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:24,680
 No.

509
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,540
 He sold me his boat.

510
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:27,540
 My motor!

511
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:29,900
 Well, that is, I gave him my IOU.

512
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:32,980
 And by next summer, the boat will be mine, I hope.

513
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:35,260
 Henry, that's wonderful.

514
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:38,460
 My goodness, I'll be the proudest girl at the dance.

515
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:39,260
 The dance?

516
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:41,060
 Just imagine I'll be the only one

517
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:43,620
 there dancing with a boy with an outboard motor.

518
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:44,140
 What?

519
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:46,340
 [LAUGHTER]

520
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:49,900
 Kathleen, look, about the dance.

521
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:50,900
 Yes.

522
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:54,540
 How would you feel if we were to give up all activities this winter?

523
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:55,540
 What?

524
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:59,540
 And spend two solid months sailing around in the moonlight next summer.

525
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:03,060
 But Henry, what do we do during the long winter evening?

526
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:05,980
 Why, we can polish the boat.

527
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:06,980
 Polishes?

528
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:08,460
 Yeah, and grease the motor.

529
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:11,060
 But Henry, I've just had my hair done.

530
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:12,060
 Well, I'll tell you.

531
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:13,460
 Gee, look at the time.

532
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:14,460
 It's 1.30.

533
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:15,460
 It is?

534
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:17,220
 I've got to get back to Springer's and buy my grab bag.

535
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:18,220
 But Henry!

536
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:22,720
 outboard motor right over to your house Kathleen so we can admire it together.

537
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:39,220
 Sam.

538
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:40,920
 I'm reading my paper, Ollie.

539
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,360
 The adenos ready.

540
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,000
 Yes? Where's Henry?

541
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,640
 Up in his room he doesn't feel like eating.

542
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,760
 I should think he wouldn't.

543
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,520
 Well, he can't say I didn't warn him.

544
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:53,240
 I told him not to count on an outboard motor.

545
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:56,200
 Here I can't help feeling sorry, Farron.

546
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,600
 What honor is he going to do with a bear trap?

547
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:01,340
 [LAUGHTER]

548
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:04,040
 Naturally, Alice, he's going to trap bears.

549
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:07,120
 Sam, there isn't a bear within 500 miles of here.

550
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,600
 Alice, I'm joking.

551
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,520
 I wouldn't feel so badly, Sam, if I

552
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,920
 thought he'd really learned a lesson from this whole thing.

553
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:13,920
 Alice learned one thing.

554
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,720
 At least he won't be so optimistic after this.

555
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,960
 When you answer the phone, dear, while I serve dinner.

556
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:19,720
 All right, Alice.

557
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:22,320
 Hello.

558
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,280
 May I speak to Mr. Aldrich, please?

559
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,800
 Uh, which Mr. Aldrich do you want?

560
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,680
 Mr. Henry Aldrich.

561
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,400
 - Yeah, at the moment. - Henry.

562
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,480
 Yes, Father.

563
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,720
 You want it on the telephone?

564
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,320
 Perhaps you could take the message.

565
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,960
 This is Mr. Jenkins, the Tanner.

566
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,560
 - The what? - The Tanner.

567
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:40,440
 I have that information regarding the cost of turning a bear skin into a rug.

568
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,160
 What's that?

569
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,600
 It all depends on the size bear you're trapped.

570
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,440
 I am not trapping any bears, and neither is anyone else,

571
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:51,440
 in this family goodbye father didn't you say that phone call was for me that was

572
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:57,600
 the tenor Henry I took care of him you did father but I had my plans all made

573
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:03,520
 you can just unmake them come on into dinner if if you don't mind father I

574
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:10,240
 rather go back up I'm coming Alice you know the I've been thinking couldn't

575
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,640
 you give Henry just enough money to take Kathleen to the movies tonight no

576
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:16,640
 No, Alice. That's the only way youngster ever learned.

577
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,640
 I know, but...

578
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20,640
 That's the way you had to learn. That's the way I had to.

579
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,640
 Good heavens, what's that?

580
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,640
 What's what, dear?

581
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,640
 That, on the center of the table.

582
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:32,640
 Well, they're candles, dear. You see, shaped like little stars, and they float in the water.

583
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,640
 Why?

584
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,640
 Why?

585
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,640
 I said, why?

586
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,640
 Well, they're pretty. Sam, I won them today, and I thought I'd better use them.

587
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,640
 I see.

588
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:45,640
 Alice, you weren't anywhere near Springer's part where today were you?

589
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,640
 What? How did you...

590
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,640
 But...

591
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,640
 dear, before you get angry...

592
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,640
 That's all right, Alice.

593
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,640
 Do you know anyone who could use a dozen bottles of bubble bath?

594
00:24:54,640 --> 00:25:00,640
 It's for dogs.

595
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,640
 Oh, Sam, you bummer-grab bag too?

596
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,640
 I'm afraid so, Alice.

597
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,640
 But dear, we don't even have a dog.

598
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,640
 You owe anybody home?

599
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,640
 We're in the dining room, Homer.

600
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,640
 - You certainly have to admire his timing.

601
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,640
 - Oh, everybody.

602
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,640
 - Oh, gee whiz, is it dinner time?

603
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:20,640
 - My strange coincidence, yes.

604
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,640
 - Sit down, Homer, we're one short tonight.

605
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,640
 - Boy, I'd love to.

606
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,640
 We aren't eating at our house, Tamarae.

607
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,640
 - Not at all?

608
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,640
 - No, ma'am.

609
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,640
 My mother doesn't feel she should fool around in the kitchen

610
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,640
 in her new fur coat.

611
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,640
 - Why doesn't she take it off?

612
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,640
 - She doesn't dare.

613
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,640
 As soon as my father gets his hands on,

614
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,640
 he's taking it back to the store.

615
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,640
 to the store.

616
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,980
 (audience laughing)

617
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:43,400
 What's that under your arm?

618
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:46,560
 Oh gee, I almost forgot, it's my grand prize.

619
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,000
 See?

620
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,760
 - Good heaven.

621
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,360
 - Only my parents felt that since it was your sister

622
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,880
 that painted it, Mrs. Aldrich,

623
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:56,040
 you should have the privilege of hanging it.

624
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:59,040
 - Harry, you painted that?

625
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,240
 - It looks good upside down too.

626
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,080
 (audience laughing)

627
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,040
 - What on earth is it?

628
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:05,720
 - Why it's fish there, in a bowl.

629
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:08,680
 Sure, I love them up in the fish book.

630
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,240
 I think they're suckers.

631
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,680
 (audience laughing)

632
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,680
 Yes?

633
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:15,200
 Oh, ma, you brought it to the right place.

634
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,520
 Alice, get me a hammer.

635
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,760
 Sam, what are you gonna do to it?

636
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,040
 Hang it over the mantelpiece.

637
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,120
 She will.

638
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,600
 Where it'll be a lesson to all of us,

639
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,000
 the rest of our lives.

640
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,580
 (upbeat music)

641
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:32,200
 (audience applauding)

642
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:38,080
 Boy, Henry, I got good news for us.

643
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:38,960
 You have, huh?

644
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:39,460
 Sure.

645
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:41,400
 How'd you like to go to the movies to marry?

646
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:44,840
 Now listen, Homer, you know we haven't got a nickel left to our name.

647
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,920
 That's the beautiful part of it, him.

648
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:50,520
 I've invited someone to go with us, who's agreed to absorb our overhead.

649
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,680
 Well, G-Wiz.

650
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,180
 Sure.

651
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:52,880
 Who?

652
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,360
 Agnes Lawson.

653
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:57,040
 Well, that solves Henry's overhead problem.

654
00:26:57,040 --> 00:27:01,320
 And ladies, a good way for you to help solve yours when it comes to family budgets

655
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,560
 is to serve jello puddings often.

656
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:06,040
 They cost little and they taste grand.

657
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:08,920
 Yes, yellow chocolate butter scots and vanilla puddings.

658
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,360
 A trio of treats,

659
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:13,560
 chock full of old fashioned homemade goodness.

660
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:16,240
 Tomorrow night, try confetti tarts.

661
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,480
 Just prepare a package of yellow vanilla pudding as usual.

662
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,880
 When cool, pour your luscious creamy

663
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:24,440
 yellow vanilla pudding into crisp individual

664
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,040
 baked pastry shells.

665
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:29,120
 Chill thoroughly, then top with a generous helping

666
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:32,040
 of well-drained canned fruit cocktail.

667
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:35,720
 Remember all three jello puddings made with milk are nourishing,

668
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:39,280
 and they cooked a perfection in just about five minutes.

669
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:42,600
 No wonder more people buy jello puddings

670
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,600
 than any other prepared puddings in the world.

671
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,180
 (upbeat music)

672
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:54,520
 Friends, let's recognize this fact.

673
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:58,160
 Our American economic system has brought greater material means

674
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,080
 for happiness to more people

675
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:05,080
 than any other the world has known, and it has preserved the basic freedoms.

676
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:09,080
 So let's all of us strive to make that economic system even better,

677
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:14,080
 as an employee or employer, as a farmer or as a professional man.

678
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:18,080
 Remember, the better we produce, the better we live.

679
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:28,080
 The Oldrich family starring Ezra Stone as Henry with Jackie Kalka's Homer

680
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:33,200

681
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:38,720
 are house Jameson and Catherine Ron. And this is Dan Seymour in New York saying,

682
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,920
 "The Aldrich family is brought to you by the Jello family."

683
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:52,360
 "Four desserts that aren't delicious. I believe me you should know. They are made

684
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:56,360
 by famous J-E-L-L-P-O.
