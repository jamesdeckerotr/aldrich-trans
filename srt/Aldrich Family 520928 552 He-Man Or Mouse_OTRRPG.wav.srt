7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 There's an old saying that claims you're only young once.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,400
 But as a matter of fact, you can be young more than once, and the best way of doing that is

9
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:42,200
 to share the misadventures of a typical boy like Henry Aldrich.

10
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:46,300
 He'll take you right back to your own teenage days.

11
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:50,720
 The scene is the living room of Nancy Adams, one of Henry's favorite classmates, and the

12
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,440
 Time is evening.

13
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,360
 Nancy, tell me honestly.

14
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,040
 What is it you like about Bill Turner?

15
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,120
 I don't know, Henry.

16
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,840
 I just like him, don't you?

17
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,840
 Well, sure he's all right.

18
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,440
 If you like athletes.

19
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,960
 What's the matter with athletes?

20
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,400
 Nothing.

21
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,720
 Except you're so athletic.

22
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:10,080
 I mean, well, to hear Bill Turner talk,

23
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,320
 you think he was Joe DiMaggio, the Notre Dame football

24
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,440
 team in gorgeous George.

25
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,920
 All rolled into one.

26
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,160
 That's so loud, Henry.

27
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,080
 He might hear you.

28
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:17,720
 Who do you hear me?

29
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,200
 He's out in the front hall.

30
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,000
 I like them only.

31
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,900
 Frankly, is there any way of getting rid of them?

32
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:24,320
 - You're eating your dog like him?

33
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,640
 - Well, sure, I'm crazy about him only.

34
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,700
 - Hey, Nancy.

35
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:27,540
 She whiz.

36
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,100
 - Nancy, did I ever tell you about the time

37
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,200
 I dove off the top of the boat house?

38
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,120
 - Oh, Bill, I didn't even know anybody could climb up that high.

39
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,440
 - Oh, it's easy.

40
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,920
 And you know that flagpole down at the end of the lake?

41
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,120
 - Yes.

42
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,880
 - I dove off that once, too.

43
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,440
 - Nancy, how's your mother?

44
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,480
 - Oh, she's better, Henry.

45
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,880
 She just strained her back a little.

46
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,600
 - Boy, was that some luck I had in the game Saturday.

47
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,760
 You remember when those three guys tackled me

48
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:52,000
 and I carried them right across the gold for a touchdown?

49
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,760
 Oh, that was just wonderful, Bill.

50
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,360
 I don't see how you stood up.

51
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,280
 Nancy, what kind of a television set is this?

52
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,000
 I don't know.

53
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,960
 Hey, Henry, could you or Bill open this window

54
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:00,800
 a little, please?

55
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,140
 Sure, why not?

56
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:01,880
 Oh, wait a minute, Henry.

57
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:02,320
 I'll open it.

58
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,400
 Well, that's all right, Bill.

59
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,400
 I've got it practically--

60
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,120
 practically.

61
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,480
 Is it stuck, Henry?

62
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,400
 No, it isn't stuck.

63
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:10,680
 I just--

00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,520
 [GRUNTING]

65
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,800
 Could you stand back, please, Bill?

66
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,360
 How am I in the way?

67
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,020
 I want to get some leverage.

68
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,160
 - Here, Henry, let me show you how to open it.

69
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,660
 - Now look, Alpil, all I have to do is...

70
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:24,360
 (clears throat)

71
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,520
 Nancy, would you mind if I pushed this sofa away?

72
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,360
 - No, Henry.

73
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,600
 - Well, don't get off, I'll push you along.

74
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,440
 - Along.

75
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,240
 (audience laughs)

76
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:35,240
 - Well, maybe if you just got up for a second, Nancy.

77
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:39,480
 Never mind this sofa, I'll just...

78
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,560
 She was who opened that window.

79
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,400
 - I did.

80
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,160
 (audience laughs)

81
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,360
 You know, I thought I had it started,

82
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,640
 I just should have kept at it.

83
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,240
 Anything else you want done, Nancy?

84
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,120
 Well, there's some ginger ale out in the kitchen

85
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:51,960
 if one of you wants to--

86
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,960
 But you as I'll get it for you, Nancy, you stay where you are, Bill.

87
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,840
 You're sure you don't need any help lifting the bottles?

88
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,480
 You'll find everything out there on a tray, Henry.

89
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,520
 All you have to do is put some ice in the glasses.

90
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,360
 I'll be right back.

91
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,640
 Nancy, isn't there any way of getting rid of him?

92
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,200
 This evening?

93
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:06,800
 Sure.

94
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,560
 Bill, Henry Aldrich is one of the nicest--

95
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,000
 Nancy, I'm not saying he isn't.

96
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,200
 Only, frankly--

97
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,360
 Frankly, what?

98
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,760
 Well, three's a crowd.

99
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,280
 And frankly, I have crowds cheering for me every time

100
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,800
 I go out on the field.

101
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,320
 I want to be alone.

102
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,440
 Excuse me, Nancy.

103
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,760
 But is there any special way of getting your ice trays loose?

104
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,760
 Well, my mother never has any trouble, Henry.

105
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,280
 All she does is pull and they come right out.

106
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,520
 That's funny.

107
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,640
 I'll take another crack at it.

108
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,440
 Nice guy.

109
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,360
 I'd like to see him come out for football practice

110
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,240
 some afternoon.

111
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:40,560
 Bill, what did I tell you about sympathy and understanding?

112
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,680
 Oh, I understand, Henry.

113
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,960
 That's why I have no sympathy for her.

114
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,600
 I don't forget about him.

115
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,280
 What about that dance Friday night?

116
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,120
 What about it?

117
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,320
 Well, what time should I--

00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,240
 [LAUGHTER]

119
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:54,320
 What time should I--

120
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:57,000
 You know, he's going to wreck your refrigerator.

121
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,600
 What time should I call for you?

122
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,600
 Oh, about that.

123
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,600

128
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,680
 Just an answer.

129
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,680
 Yes, mother?

130
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,520
 - All those boys playing football down there.

131
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,520
 - No, Mother Henry's getting some ice.

132
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,640
 - I'll pick everything up, Nancy.

133
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,040
 - Does your father have a hammer I could use

134
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,720
 with this screwdriver or a small crowbar

135
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,960
 would be even better?

136
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,960
 - Henry, what's that all over your suit?

137
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,800
 - It's, well you see, I was aiming for the ice cubes,

138
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,120
 but was your mother planning to have

139
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,200
 tomato juice for dinner?

140
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,760
 (audience laughing)

141
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,600
 - Why?

142
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,240
 - There's a freshly opened can in the ice box.

143
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,400
 - Oh my goodness.

144
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,400
 - Of course if they're going out for dinner,

145
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,520
 it'll keep the tomorrow's lunch.

146
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,720
 - I'm out of the way, Henry, I'll get the ice out.

147
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,080
 - Now wait a second, Bill, you'll need something

148
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:43,920
 to loosen it with.

149
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,920
 - What's the matter with my hands?

150
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:49,480
 - Some guy sure loved a brag.

151
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,560
 - Why a bill turner?

152
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,560
 - Whoa!

153
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,960
 Hey, who could put her on the floor?

154
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,080
 - I'm here!

155
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,400
 - Just took it out so I could get better leverage.

156
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,400
 - Nancy, will one tray of ice be enough?

157
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,960
 - She did, I loosen it that much?

158
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,520
 - Nancy, I don't think you'll feel the same way about

159
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,520
 you know who, once you get a look at your mother's kitchen.

160
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,760
 - I think I better be going.

161
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,240
 Oh, Henry, do you have to?

162
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,800
 Well, I've got a lot of homework to do,

163
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,720
 and I think I better.

164
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,640
 Don't you?

165
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,080
 Well, if you have to.

166
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,560
 I, I, I had a very swell evening, though.

167
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,880
 Oh, I'm awfully glad, Henry.

168
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,680
 Well, so long.

169
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,440
 You really have to go.

170
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,480
 I think I better.

171
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,400
 Oh, but would your mind closing that door

172
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,840
 that coach told me to keep out of draft?

173
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,680
 Oh, oh, sure.

174
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,320
 I didn't realize I was keeping the door open.

175
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:36,120
 What time should I call for you Friday evening?

176
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,480
 Friday evening?

177
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,080
 Sure for the dance.

178
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:42,080
 Henry, I didn't promise to go with you, did I?

179
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,720
 Why sure, why sure?

180
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,640
 You didn't?

181
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,760
 I don't see how I could have.

182
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,200
 I'm going with Bill.

183
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,360
 Oh.

184
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,060
 With Bill?

185
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,480
 Oh, I'm terribly sorry, Henry.

186
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,080
 I guess you must have misunderstood it.

187
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,560
 Hey, what about that door?

188
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,120
 I'll walk you after the porch.

189
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,080
 No, no, you go back and have your ginger ale.

190
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,480
 I can find my way, all right.

191
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,360
 Boy, I hope you understand, Henry.

192
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,640
 Oh, sure.

193
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,800
 You and Bill just go ahead and enjoy yourselves.

194
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,280
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

195
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:15,080
 [Music]

196
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,120
 Sam, could you pass the toast please?

197
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,660
 Hey, you are, dear.

198
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,480
 Why didn't Henry go to the dance?

199
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,120
 Well, dear, that's what I don't know.

200
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:25,720
 Do you remember the other evening when he came home from Nancy Adams soaking wet?

201
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,220
 When?

202
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:29,360
 Last week, dear, a couple of nights before the dance.

203
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,000
 He walked into the house covered with tomato juice.

204
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,900
 And Sam, Henry hasn't been himself since then.

205
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,140
 Did you have a talk with him?

206
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:39,940
 Yes, and all he'd say was he felt dancing was a waste of time.

207
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:40,780
 Mother!

208
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:42,940
 And Mary come in here and eat your breakfast.

209
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:44,940
 Mother, what's this letter all about?

210
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:45,740
 What letter?

211
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,740
 Why is the silliest thing I've ever seen?

212
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,540
 It must be for Father.

213
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:51,140
 May I see it, please?

214
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,540
 Who's it from, Sam?

215
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:57,140
 From the Lionel Strong Ford Institute of Physical Development Incorporated.

216
00:06:57,140 --> 00:07:03,140
 Dear Mr. Olrich, are you a man or a mouse?

217
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:05,940
 I knew all the time it wasn't for me.

218
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:06,940
 Yeah.

219
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:07,940
 Mm-hmm.

220
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:09,700
 No man can make his mark in the world.

221
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:15,700
 No man can inspire the love of a good woman unless he is willing to develop his inner potential

222
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,940
 strength in our 26-week course.

223
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:20,500
 Sam, what in the world is that?

224
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,300
 I don't know, Alice, but I'm fascinated.

225
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:27,500
 We can give you a money-back guarantee if your chest expansion does not increase by

226
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,580
 at least two inches during the first six lesson.

227
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:32,660
 How many inches, darling?

228
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,660
 You quiet Mary, that's just the first six lessons.

229
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:41,660
 We also offer a shorter course for the busy executive, interested in only partial development.

230
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:44,660
 Remember, decide now, yours Julie.

231
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:45,660
 Father, what's that?

232
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:57,660
 P.S. replied by return mail and received free, one genuine simulated nylon tape measure, especially desired, for checking your chest development.

233
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,660
 Dear, when did you write for that?

234
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:01,660
 May I see the envelope please?

235
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:04,160
 - Father, it's addressed to Mr. Harold Olrich.

236
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,660
 Who's he?

237
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:08,160
 - I have no idea whether he's a man or a mouse.

238
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,660
 - Well, he put the letter back in the envelope, please.

239
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:11,660
 It's probably for Henry.

240
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:13,660
 - Mother, why would he want to develop?

241
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,660
 - I don't know, dear.

242
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,660
 And besides, it's none of our business.

243
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,660
 Please put it back in the envelope.

244
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:24,660
 - Well, I think I'll walk to the office this morning.

245
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:27,660
 - What time you haven't walked to the office in six years?

246
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:28,660
 - Well, of course I have.

247
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:31,540
 I walked a couple of times just this last summer.

248
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:32,540
 It made me feel great.

249
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:34,340
 I'll get you top coat for you, Father.

250
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:35,340
 My coat?

251
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:36,340
 The coat?

252
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:37,340
 Why would I want a coat?

253
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,340
 Well, I can at least get your hair.

254
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:39,340
 Goodbye, Alice.

255
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:40,340
 Goodbye.

256
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,340
 Goodbye, son.

257
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:42,340
 Goodbye.

258
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:44,700
 Mother, do you have any idea where my blue and white tie is?

259
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:45,700
 You're a blue and white tie?

260
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:46,700
 No, dear.

261
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,700
 And sit down on each of your brackets.

262
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:48,700
 But, Mother, I've got to find it.

263
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,900
 There'll be plenty of time to find it after you've eaten.

264
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:52,900
 Turn around.

265
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:53,900
 What's the matter?

266
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:57,300
 I think you want to have those shoulders on that coat taken in a little.

267
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,300
 Taken in, Mother?

268
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,380
 You just want to throw your money away?

269
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:01,620
 They'll be filled out in 26--

270
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,020
 I mean, before you know it.

271
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:05,060
 Henry, dear, please sit down.

272
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:06,500
 I want to ask you something.

273
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,340
 What about?

274
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:09,100
 What in the world is the trouble?

275
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:09,540
 The trouble?

276
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:10,580
 The trouble?

277
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:11,780
 Gee, I don't know of any trouble.

278
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:13,340
 But you want yourself, dear.

279
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:16,140
 And when anyone speaks to you, you're way up in the air.

280
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,300
 When I'm up in the air, mother, I may be a little upset

281
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,740
 because I can't find my blue and white tie.

282
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,340
 But otherwise, I feel fine.

283
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:22,740
 Then why not eat your breakfast?

284
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:23,300
 I'm going to eat it.

285
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,260
 I'm going to eat it.

286
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:27,860
 How's Nancy Adams these days?

287
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:29,500
 Nancy Adams?

288
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,340
 Mother.

289
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:31,060
 Oh, I asked this.

290
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,260
 How is she?

291
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:33,260
 You see this book here, Mother?

292
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:34,020
 You see this book?

293
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:34,520
 Yes.

294
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,020
 Well, that gives you an idea of what little interest

295
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:37,300
 I have in Nancy Adams.

296
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,220
 What about the book?

297
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,740
 I borrowed it from her two weeks ago.

298
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:40,240
 Well--

299
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,260
 I'm returning.

300
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:41,900
 Well, that's fine.

301
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:42,540
 I'm returning it.

302
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,180
 I'm returning it.

303
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:43,700
 That's all.

304
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,260
 That's as far as I go.

305
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:47,420
 She asked me whether I'd like to keep it and finish it.

306
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,260
 I'll tell her I'm not even slightly interested.

307
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:49,900
 Well, that's fine.

308
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,100
 Do you not drink your milk?

309
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,060
 You know what else?

310
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:52,580
 What?

311
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:53,060
 That's all right.

312
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:53,540
 Never mind.

313
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:55,220
 But if her folks can't afford a better ice box

314
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:58,780
 The one they have, she was, do you like Bill Turner?

315
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:00,500
 Bill Turner, I hardly know him.

316
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,860
 She is, he got a lot to learn.

317
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:04,260
 He just goes around, you know what he thinks.

318
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:07,380
 Henry, what's your ambition in life?

319
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:08,700
 My ambition, Mary, what do you mean?

320
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:09,420
 That's all.

321
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:12,700
 I just wondered whether you wanted to be a man or a mouse.

322
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,820
 Mary, I haven't any time for small talk.

323
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,180
 Have you seen my blue and white tie?

324
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:18,620
 No, but I'd love to see your chest expansion.

325
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,140
 Not Mary.

326
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,100
 That's what I say, Mother.

327
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:22,420
 But, Mother, all I was going to ask him

328
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:25,680
 was if he was going to take the short course of the 26-week course.

329
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,120
 Mary, will you please give Henry that letter?

330
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:28,680
 A letter?

331
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,680
 I don't think it's for you, though, Henry.

332
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,760
 Mary, give me that letter.

333
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,720
 Are you, Mr. Harold, Aldrich?

334
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,840
 Mary, you come back with that.

335
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,480
 Do you realize that United States may help?

336
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:36,960
 Mary?

337
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,560
 Mother, it says right on the envelope.

338
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,160
 Maybe open for inspection.

339
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,680
 Mary, if you don't give me that--

340
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,520
 [LAUGHTER]

341
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,040
 Oh, we won't break anything.

342
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,480
 I'm just helping Henry develop.

343
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,120
 Now, listen, Mary, you're only going to make me late for school.

344
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,960
 - Do you wanna take it with you and show it to Nancy Adams?

345
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:56,400
 - Mary, if you breathe one word about this to her out,

346
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,560
 Mary, Mary, come back down here with that.

347
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,140
 (upbeat music)

348
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:11,000
 - What are you writing, Henry?

349
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,560
 - Henry, what are you doing?

350
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,640
 - Homer, is there a class in this room next period?

351
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,000
 - Sure.

352
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,120
 Henry, what are all those questions you're filling out?

353
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,720
 Nothing Homer, nothing important.

354
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,080
 It's just some information I've got to send away.

355
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:29,160
 Could you measure my chest just once more please?

356
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,280
 It's pretty hard with this ruler.

357
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,120
 Well,

358
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:35,120
 (audience laughing)

359
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,320
 well, just go around me real slow.

360
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:40,840
 It's exactly two and a quarter.

361
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,360
 Two and a quarter?

362
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,320
 Two and a quarter rulers.

363
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,120
 That's 27 inches.

364
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,240
 27 inches for my chest.

365
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,360
 Don't you think I better take off a half inch

366
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,360
 for where I went around the corner?

367
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,920
 (audience laughing)

368
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,000
 The only thing is Homer, my thigh was 27, too.

369
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,880
 You mean my thigh is as big as my chest?

370
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,320
 It is.

371
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,800
 Boy, Homer, I don't want to mislead anyone.

372
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,720
 Listen, Henry, what is it you're sending for?

373
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,560
 Nothing, Homer.

374
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,640
 Gee, what is, why would I...

375
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,360
 Do you know whether Nancy Adams has a class

376
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,200
 in her next period?

377
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,320
 Sure.

378
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,920
 I thought you were ignoring her.

379
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,440
 Oh, yeah, that's why I'm waiting to return this book.

380
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,640
 When I hand it to her, it's going to end everything.

381
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,540
 Let me see that letter, just for a second.

382
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:19,640
 Will you, Henry?

383
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,820
 Homer, don't you see what's printed right at the top of it?

384
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,280
 Strictly confidential.

385
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,340
 What is that question at the bottom mean?

386
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:26,220
 What question?

387
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,740
 Do you have flat feet?

388
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,020
 (audience laughing)

389
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:30,500
 Now listen, Homer, that just shows

390
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,020
 how your imagination works.

391
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,260
 Well, what did it say then?

392
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:34,100
 Keep quiet, Homer.

393
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,300
 Ms. Watson just came into the room.

394
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:36,140
 Ms. Watson?

395
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:38,780
 Well, boys, you certainly look busy.

396
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:40,180
 We are, Ms. Watson.

397
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:42,260
 You working on your biology?

398
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:44,780
 Well, you know, what do we are?

399
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:46,700
 Now isn't that fine?

400
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:50,380
 You know we're going to start working on mice next week.

401
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:51,380
 We are?

402
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:52,820
 On mice?

403
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:55,260
 Yes, we're going to compare their development

404
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:56,580
 without a man.

405
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:58,340
 What's that?

406
00:12:58,340 --> 00:12:59,060
 Come on, Henry.

407
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:00,220
 That's the end of the period.

408
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:01,420
 There's a class coming in.

409
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:02,180
 Hello, Henry.

410
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:03,540
 What are you doing in here?

411
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:06,220
 Well, well, and, Nancy, I've been waiting--

412
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:08,300
 I've been filling out--

413
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:08,900
 I've been--

414
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:11,260
 Henry, you're getting ink all over yourself.

415
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:11,940
 I am.

416
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,940
 Here's a blotter.

417
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:17,100
 Well Nancy, I just wanted to tell you how much I enjoyed this book.

418
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:21,200
 Oh, I'm awfully glad you were turned at Henry, because Bill Turner is anxious to get it.

419
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,200
 He is?

420
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,400
 Are you sure you're through with it?

421
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,400
 Oh yeah.

422
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:28,120
 After all, even if I weren't through with it, naturally a Bill wants the book.

423
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,680
 Where have you been for the last week?

424
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,180
 Just around.

425
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,180
 Just around every place.

426
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,480
 Hey Henry, come on!

427
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,480
 You go ahead Homer.

428
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,320
 I may be held up here a second.

429
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,320
 Quietly.

430
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,680
 Oh you better go Henry.

431
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:41,080
 I just wanted to tell you though how much I enjoyed your book.

432
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,080
 Henry Aldrich.

433
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,080
 Don't you have a class this period?

434
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,080
 Yes, Ms. Watson. I'm on my way right this minute.

435
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,080
 Goodbye, Henry.

436
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,080
 Goodbye.

437
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:51,080
 Boy, is Nancy a good-looking girl, Henry.

438
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,080
 Do you think she's so good-looking? I think she's terrific.

439
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:57,080
 Well, the way I think of her, she's good-looking, but I wouldn't ever want to...

440
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:00,080
 Henry, let me have a look at that letter, will you?

441
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,080
 What letter?

442
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,080
 About your flat feet.

443
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,080
 Now Homer, listen.

444
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:06,080
 Homer, who is that letter?

445
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,080
 I haven't got it.

446
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,080
 I put it in this Latin book.

447
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,380
 I put it right here in the Appleton of Absolutes section.

448
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:13,460
 Well, don't look at me.

449
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:15,380
 I didn't even touch your letter.

450
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:17,380
 Do you suppose I put it in Nancy's book?

451
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:18,300
 You did.

452
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:21,580
 Well, why would she be interested in your flat feet?

453
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:23,260
 Oh, I didn't know I put them there.

454
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:24,500
 I mean, the letter there.

455
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,580
 I was just talking to her, and I may have just stuck it in there.

456
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:28,460
 Well, Homer, I've got to get that letter.

457
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:29,020
 Why?

458
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:31,620
 I think I want a thing like that to be read publicly by Nancy.

459
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,500
 Well, you certainly can't get it now, Henry.

460
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,860
 Maybe they haven't started class yet.

461
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:36,300
 Well, I'm not going in with you.

462
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,820
 I don't want the whole class to look at me, you quiet, Homer.

463
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:42,060
 going back in and get that letter.

464
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:45,420
 Will you all get your pencils, please?

465
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:47,300
 I bet your part in Henry Always is there

466
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,900
 something we can do for you?

467
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:52,340
 Why, if Miss Watson, I'm starting to interrupt your lesson

468
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:54,700
 like this, but I just returned Nancy to a book.

469
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,140
 [LAUGHTER]

470
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:58,620
 I mean, the Nancy's desk has something in it

471
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:01,220
 I'd like to want.

472
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:01,980
 I mean, me.

473
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:04,220
 Well, is it anything you can't do without for the rest

474
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:04,900
 of the period?

475
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:05,340
 Well, yes.

476
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:06,780
 Am I just have to have it?

477
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,540
 Well, if it won't take more than a second,

478
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,340
 you may go to a desk and get it.

479
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,340
 Thank you, Ms. Watson.

480
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:13,580
 In the meantime, when all of you be copying,

481
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,140
 what's written on the board here?

482
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:17,620
 [LAUGHTER]

483
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:19,820
 It's like, by the way.

484
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:20,820
 Nancy.

485
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,300
 Henry, what on earth is it you want?

486
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,780
 I'd like to borrow that book again.

487
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:25,580
 But Henry, it didn't have to come all the way back

488
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:27,020
 into class and embarrass me.

489
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:28,500
 But I just happened to remember.

490
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,580
 I haven't finished it.

491
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:31,140
 I thought you said you had finished it.

492
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:32,500
 All the giants, like I don't know all.

493
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,900
 Henry, will you hurry, please?

494
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:34,900
 Yes, Ms. Watson.

495
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:35,400
 You're Henry.

496
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,220
 Thanks very much.

497
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:41,180
 Henry, may I ask what book that is?

498
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,820
 This book I just got from Nancy?

499
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:43,660
 Yes.

500
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:45,860
 Well, it's just a book.

501
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:48,620
 What is the title?

502
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:49,620
 Rita's Revenge.

503
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:52,780
 [LAUGHTER]

504
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:56,460
 And that is the book you were in so much of a hurry to get.

505
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:58,540
 Well, I'll tell you, it isn't a story I'm so anxious to get.

506
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:01,100
 Yeah, I have a book, please.

507
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:01,900
 The whole book?

508
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:04,300
 The whole book.

509
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,460
 Wouldn't I take just one look?

510
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,660
 Please don't open it.

511
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:07,500
 No?

512
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,940
 - May I have it please?

513
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,020
 - Yes, Ms. Watson.

514
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:12,500
 - And I should like to see Nancy Adams

515
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,060
 immediately after class.

516
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:17,980
 - But Ms. Watson, will you please leave this classroom?

517
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:18,980
 - Yes, Ms. Watson.

518
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:22,380
 I'll go.

519
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:25,220
 (audience laughing)

520
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:27,800
 (upbeat music)

521
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:36,460
 - Welcome back to the Aldridge family in just a moment.

522
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:39,900
 Sundays on this station are really full of top radio shows,

523
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:42,020
 but I'd like to tell you about just one of them,

524
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:43,980
 "Theta Guild on the Air."

525
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:45,540
 For seven seasons, "The Theta Guild"

526
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,180
 has been bringing you the brightest stars

527
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:49,340
 of Broadway and Hollywood and some of the world's

528
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,900
 greatest plays.

529
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:53,020
 Tonight, the comedy attraction is Ring Lardner's

530
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:55,540
 baseball story, "Elmer the Great."

531
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:58,220
 Your stars are Eddie Bracken and Wanda Hendricks.

532
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:00,380
 Now, the play concerns Elma Kane, a pitcher

533
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:03,020
 with the best right arm and the three-eye league,

534
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,740
 but a brain which has failed to vibrate

535
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,820
 with a clear thought since birth.

536
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:08,820
 Now Elmer refuses to leave Gentry Villalenoy

537
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:11,540
 for the big league because he's in love with Nelly Poole,

538
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:14,660
 owner of the grocery where he drives the delivery wagon.

539
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:17,380
 But Nelly guesses his secret and fires Elmer.

540
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:20,020
 Well, from then on, it's all ring-lard and a fun.

541
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:22,580
 So check your newspaper for broadcast times

542
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:26,140
 and tune to NBC tonight for "Theta Guild on the Air."

543
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:29,140
 You'll enjoy Elmer the Great.

544
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:31,720

545
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:38,720
 [Music]

546
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,720
 And now getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldrich.

547
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:45,720
 Henry has decided that he needs a course in physical development.

548
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:49,720
 And after filling out the rather intimate questions on the application blank,

549
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:53,720
 he discovers that he has left the blank in a book belonging to Nancy Adams.

550
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:56,720
 The scene opens in Henry's school at the close of a period.

551
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,720
 Listen, Henry, this will make two classes I've missed just because of you.

552
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,720
 All you have to do is just walk up to Miss Watson's desk there,

553
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,720
 pick up Nancy's book, and walk out with it.

554
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,720
 It's as easy as pie.

555
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,720
 Are you sure Miss Watson isn't in there?

556
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,720
 No one's in there. There isn't a soul in there now.

557
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,720
 You like pie? Why don't you go in and get it?

558
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,720
 Well, she was Homer. I was going to stand here in the door,

559
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,720
 and people watch for you.

560
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,720
 Well, if anyone does come along, Henry, give me a signal.

561
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,720
 Clear your throat.

562
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,720
 Sure, I'll sort of cough.

563
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,720
 Okay, I'll go.

564
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,720
 That's it.

565
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:33,720
 That's it. Just walk right up as though you own the place.

566
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:36,720
 Which book is it? The one your hand is on.

567
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,720
 This isn't it. Sure it is. Isn't that book blue?

568
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,720
 Sure, but it's the advanced essence of poetry.

569
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,720
 It must be there Homer.

570
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,720
 Come here and show it to me.

571
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,720
 Alright, wait a second. I'll close the door part way.

572
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,720
 If it was here, it would be here.

573
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,720
 Homer, I'm almost positive Miss Watson didn't take it with her.

574
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,720
 Alright, show it to me.

575
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,320
 It's a book with a blue cover.

576
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,720
 A blue cover?

577
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:00,720
 Oh, this must be it.

578
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,720
 Yes, Ms. Watson.

579
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,220
 Henry, someone's out in the hall.

580
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:04,720
 Well, I'm glad to hear that.

581
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,220
 Quick, Homer, Doc, have you got it?

582
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:07,220
 Where are we done?

583
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:09,720
 Get down here beside our desk.

584
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,720
 Did they come in, Henry?

585
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,220
 No, they just closed the door.

586
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,220
 Well, come on.

587
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,220
 Let's get out of here.

588
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16,220
 And that's so fast, Homer.

589
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:17,220
 It won't tell you they've gone down the hall.

590
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:19,220
 But, Henry, I've got to get to my next class.

591
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:20,720
 Quiet.

592
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,220
 Open the door easy.

593
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:24,220
 I'm going to.

594
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,720
 You must be stuck.

595
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,720
 Let me try it.

596
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:33,720
 Henry, this is all your fault.

597
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,720
 Now don't get panicky Homer, we'll get it open.

598
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,720
 Oh, it's locked.

599
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,720
 You are crazy. Why wouldn't anybody lock a door and draw a daylight?

600
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:45,720
 All we have to do is throw ourselves against it.

601
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:48,720
 Okay. One, two, three.

602
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:54,720
 Don't you stand there Homer? Help me up.

603
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,720
 I guess they locked it all right.

604
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:00,720
 You mean we're locked in and I can't get to solid geometry?

605
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,720
 Well at least they didn't see us Homer.

606
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,720
 But Henry I'm weak in geometry as it is.

607
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,720
 Well all we have to do is climb out that window.

608
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:10,720
 But what good are we going to do? We're way up in the third floor.

609
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,720
 Homer stop arguing. Give me that book and let's go.

611
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:29,680
 If you're quite sure you won't let this book interfere with your studies anymore, you may have it.

612
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,680
 Yes, Miss Watson.

613
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,680
 I'm sorry you let Henry Aldrich have it.

614
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:37,680
 After all, he has much more important things to attend to than Rita's revenge.

615
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:40,680
 Yes, Miss Watson. He's a very nice boy, Nancy.

616
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,680
 At least he has his good points.

617
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:48,680
 But I do wish you'd become more interested in someone who takes things just a bit more seriously than Henry does.

618
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,680
 Yes, Miss Watson.

00:20:51,680 --> 00:21:05,600
 Be careful, Homer.

621
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,600
 Do you want to knock me off this fire escape?

622
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,800
 Well, gee whiz, Henry, we have to get out of here somehow.

623
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,080
 Don't you realize this fire escape

624
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,280
 goes right past all the second floor classrooms?

625
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,920
 It never goes below the second floor?

626
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,280
 We'll keep quiet, Henry.

627
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,400
 Suppose somebody should see us out here.

628
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,720
 Let's close the window.

 Make all the noise you can.

633

 All we have to do now is go up the fire escape to the roof.

634
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:32,080
 And then I suppose we just jump off.

635
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,720
 It's bound to leave to something, Homer.

636
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,600
 Come on.

00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,600

00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:40,840
 What?

00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,280
 This is Nancy's book.

 There's a report book.

00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,600

 But you should have looked, Homer.

 Boy, if we get caught with this, we can even be expelled.

652
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,080
 Just for having a report book?

653
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,080
 Sure.

654
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:02,120
 Well, you can be the one that takes it back, Henry.

655
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,840
 All we have to do is open the window.

656
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,600
 And be sure no one's in there, Henry.

657
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,840
 No one's in there.

 Lift, Henry.

 I am lifting, Homer.

00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,960
 Move back so I can get some leverage.

00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:14,920
 What's the matter, Henry?

663
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:15,960
 Are you weak?

 Well, gee, as maybe I do need--

665
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,640
 wouldn't you think I could at least open a window

 when it's an emergency?

00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,840
 Boy, you're really in a fix.

668
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,640
 You've got Ms. Watson's reports, and Nancy's

669
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,640
 got your measurements.

670
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,800
 Sure.

671
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,920
 And probably by this time, Nancy's read the whole thing.

 What are you doing up there?

 Boys!

679
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:46,520
 - Why, we just kind of opened a window, Mr. Bradley.

 - Don't you know the rules about going out

681
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,600
 on the fire escape?

682
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,520
 - Are there any special rules, Mr. Bradley?

683
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,120
 - What are your names?

684
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:57,040
 - Henry, Aldrich.

685
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:57,880
 - Oh.

686
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,720
 - Homer, Brown.

687
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,960
 - Oh.

688
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,560
 - Henry and Homer.

689
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,200
 - All tricks and brown?

690
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,040
 - Yes, sir.

691
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:06,880
 (audience laughing)

692
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,720
 - Of an adult and fire estate,

693
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,680
 then report to my office at once.

694
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,720
 - Yes, sir.

695
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:15,720
 How would you like to have us get there, Mr. Bradley?

696
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:19,720
 Any way you can.

697
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,720
 The only trouble is, Mr. Bradley.

698
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,720
 What's that?

699
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:26,720
 Nothing. We'll get down.

700
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:40,720
 And how long have you been a student in this school, young man?

701
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,220
 About three years, Mr. Bradley.

702
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:43,880
 And this other young man?

703
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,080
 About three and a half, Mr. Bradley.

704
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,180
 But that was on account of the mumps right on top of the measles.

705
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:51,160
 I see.

706
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:55,860
 And you both know those fire escapes were placed there for emergency use only?

707
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:57,260
 Well, the fact is, Mr. Bradley...

708
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:59,700
 It wasn't enough that you were out on a fire escape.

709
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:04,740
 You climbed in a window and broke right into the middle of Professor Vanderhoof's French class.

710
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:07,980
 Well, you see, Mr. Bradley was the only way we could get off the fire escape.

711
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,840
 Professor Vanderhoof's window was open...

712
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,520
 Homer, must you lean on my desk?

713
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,400
 No, sir, excuse me.

714
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,600
 I thought you were through with us.

715
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,520
 I don't know whatever gave you that impression.

716
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:21,040
 Excuse me, but can I interrupt you, Mr. Bradley?

717
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,880
 You're Bill Turner, aren't you?

718
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,600
 Yes, I'm the one that carried three men over our goal

719
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,320
 Saturday.

720
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,600
 And what were you sent in here for?

721
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,120
 Well, I suppose I shouldn't have been reading this book

722
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,800
 during study hour, Mr. Bradley.

723
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,360
 What's the title?

724
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,400
 Readers revenge.

725
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,800
 Readers revenge.

726
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,400
 I see.

727
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,900
 - Hey, Henry. - Yes, Mr. Bradley.

728
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,820
 What do you think of a boy who would spend his time

729
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:44,340
 reading a book like that?

730
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:47,340
 Well, I guess it's pretty bad, Mr. Bradley.

731
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:48,620
 That's what I say.

732
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:49,460
 I see.

733
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:53,340
 Do you know what I think all three of you boys need?

734
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:54,180
 No, sir.

735
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:56,820
 Suppose you wait here, all of you,

736
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:59,020
 while I step out and get your records.

737
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:00,020
 Yes, sir.

738
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:01,860
 Bill, what did you get that book?

739
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:04,100
 From Nancy, and what business is it of yours?

740
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:05,940
 Listen, Bill, could I borrow it a second?

741
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:08,660
 Nancy's book, all I wanna do is take it for just one second.

742
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:10,160
 I just want to...

743
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,600
 I just want to...

744
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,000
 Can't you even let me look at it?

745
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 Keep your hands off.

746
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 Let me have that.

747
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 People, wait, do you hear me?

748
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,500
 Hey, Henry, look at what fell out of it.

749
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,000
 There's your letter right in the floor.

750
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 Gee whiz.

751
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 Phil, turn to you, take your foot off that.

752
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 You make me.

753
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 Do you hear me?

754
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 Take your foot off that letter.

755
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 Henry, somebody's coming.

756
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 I don't care.

757
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,840
 Mr. Bradley, Ms. Watson asked me, Henry.

758
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:30,840
 Hello, Nancy.

759
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:31,840
 Close the door.

760
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:32,840
 Let go of my leg, Aldrich.

761
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,840
 You look like you're like, do you hear me?

762
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:35,840
 Let's go.

763
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:36,840
 Boy, stop.

765
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,500
 Lift his leg, Henry.

766
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,100
 - I need more leverage.

767
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,500
 - Hey, Bill, cut it out.

768
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,540
 You're twisting my hand.

769
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:45,380
 - Yeah?

770
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:46,660
 - No, turn it, you stop that.

771
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:48,020
 - Tharn you, Bill.

772
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:49,940
 ( (audience laughing)

773
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:50,780
 - There.

774
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:53,420
 - Henry, Gee, Henry, you knocked him out.

775
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:54,260
 - Oh boy.

776
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:56,420
 - You lifted him right off the floor.

777
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:58,340
 - Hey, what happened?

778
00:25:58,340 --> 00:25:59,220
 - He's all right, Henry.

779
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:01,100
 Pick him up before Mr. Bradley comes in.

780
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:01,940
 - Come on, Homer.

781
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:03,340
 Let's lift him out of the couch.

782
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:04,740
 - Ugh.

783
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:07,340
 Listen, Alders, why did you hit me with?

784
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:08,980
 I just used my bare hands.

785
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:10,340
 Didn't I, Nancy?

786
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:12,500
 Now then, young man,

787
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:15,940
 Turner, did anyone invite you to lie down in that pouch?

788
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:19,260

789
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:20,420
 Oh, Mr. Bradley.

790
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:22,060
 I'll help him out, Mr. Bradley.

791
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:23,820
 Don't you think he can get up himself?

792
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:24,980
 Well, I'm up.

793
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:27,020
 Well, young lady.

794
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:29,140
 Miss Watson asked me to bring her keys down here.

795
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:30,740
 I'll take them in one moment.

796
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:32,620
 Turner, here's what I want you to do.

797
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:37,100
 I want you to spend a part of each lunch hour for the next 10 days picking up the papers

798

 And as for how did Miss Watson's report book get here on my desk?

 On your desk, Mr. Bradley.

803
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:51,900
 Nancy, would you see that she gets it back?

804
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:52,900
 Yes, sir.

805
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:54,940

00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:55,940
 Yes, Mr. Bradley?

 Move them?

811
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:07,260
 Yeah, tell me.

812
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:09,260
 Aren't there quite a few, Mr. Bradley?

813
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:13,260
 There are 350. It will take every afternoon for the next two weeks.

814
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:18,260
 Gee whiz! That's alright Homer. You heard what Mr. Bradley said.

 They need a couple of huskies like you and me.

 Aldrich, what's that you're tearing up?

 Nothing. It's just sort of a letter I've decided I won't need anymore.
