 And now the Jell-O family presents...

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,740
 Henry... Henry O'Rish!

4
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:18,940
 Coming, Mother!

00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:23,340
 [Applause]

6
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:28,420
 Yes, it's the Aldrich family based on characters originated by Clifford Goldsmith

7
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:32,900
 and starring Ezra Stone as Henry with Jackie Kelka's horror.

8
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:37,240
 And yes, it's the Jell-O family with its three famous desserts.

9
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,880
 Jell-O in those six delicious flavors,

10
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:43,400
 Jell-O puddings with that old-fashioned homemade flavor,

11
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,520
 and Jell-O tapioca puddings,

12
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,720
 a miracle of goodness, a marvel of speed.

 J-E-L-L-O!

17
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:08,080
 And now for the Aldridge family.

18
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:25,680
 All the happenings in a typical day of a teenage boy can never be diagram.

19
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:29,180
 There aren't enough zigzag lines for that.

20
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:32,180
 You simply start a day with a boy like Henry Aldrich,

21
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:35,180
 cross your fingers, and hope for the best.

22
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:37,680
 The scene opens in the school cafeteria.

23
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,680
 It is noon, partner.

24
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,180
 Why don't you like Charlie Clark, Henry?

25
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,680
 Well, I like him, Nancy. I like him.

26
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:48,180
 But she was... I thought we were going to have lunch alone.

27
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:49,680
 Well, I didn't invite him.

28
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,180
 He just happened to ask who I was eating with, and I said, "Just Henry,

29
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:56,360
 And my goodness, I couldn't be rude and tell me wasn't welcome.

30
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,420
 I know, but...

31
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:00,060
 Gee, was he ruins my appetite.

32
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:02,860
 Henry, you've already had three sandwiches.

33
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:04,900
 Sure, but I'm forcing myself.

34
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,620
 Here you are, Nancy. Here's your milk.

35
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:07,940
 Oh, thank you, Charlie.

36
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:10,100
 Say, Hank, would you mind moving your chair a little?

37
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:10,860
 What for?

38
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,300
 Well, so I can slip mine in next to Nancy's.

39
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,940
 Now listen, Charlie Clark.

40
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,140
 But I just wanted her to take a bite of this sandwich.

41
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:20,780
 It's made from a can of Patty de Foygras, my Uncle Harris, Senes.

42
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:21,900
 Patty what?

43
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,300
 Foy gras, Foy gras, G-Wiz.

44
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,400
 French chopped liver, Henry.

45
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,000
 Oh, Foy gras!

46
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,700
 Boy, Charlie, do you speak a broken French?

47
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,400
 Is that your Uncle Horace Clark who's in Congress?

48
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,800
 Sure, and the mayor of a French village gave him six cans of this stuff

49
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,900
 as a token of how his whole country felt toward my uncle.

50
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:46,700
 Jean Nancy, did you ever hear a story like that near a life story?

51
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,100
 Listen, Henry, have you ever heard of Lewis and Clark?

52
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:49,600
 Who?

53
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:53,160
 Lewis and Clark who practically discovered the rest of America.

54
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:57,860
 Listen Charlie, you trying to make us believe that that Clark was your relative to?

55
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,460
 Figure it out for yourself Henry.

56
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:00,900
 Figure it out for yourself.

57
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:01,720
 Hey Henry!

58
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,280
 Oh gee whiz it's Willie.

59
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,940
 Henry you have to get me out of a spot.

60
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:08,260
 Willie, can't you see I'm having lunch with Nancy?

61
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:12,040
 But all you have to do is tell Mr. Bradley I'm the wrong one to speak in assembly.

62
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,520
 Willie, you're speaking in a family?

63
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,860
 Nancy, I'm just as shocked as you are.

64
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,320
 How did it happen?

65
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,420
 I volunteered.

66
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:21,420
 What? What?

67
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:24,020
 How did I know they only paid outside speakers?

68
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:25,820
 You expected to get paid?

69
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:30,220
 Sure, and if you ask me, they've got no right to discriminate just because I'm a minor.

70
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:36,220
 So Henry, wouldn't you be willing to point out to Mr. Bradley that every time I open my mouth, I make a fool of myself?

71
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:38,920
 What makes you think he doesn't know already?

72
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,820
 Well, I can't possibly talk to Mr. Bradley now.

73
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:46,320
 But Henry, if you really have to help, well, I don't mind finishing up with Charlie.

74
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:46,820
 What?

75
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,520
 Sure, run along.

76
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,220
 Oh no, how rude do you think I am?

77
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:53,020
 But Henry, I can't memorize!

78
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:54,520
 I'm sorry, Willie.

79
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:57,220
 Say isn't Cynthia Harris related to Mr. Bradley?

80
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:58,220
 I think so!

81
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:59,220
 Hey, Cynthia!

82
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:01,920
 Willie, I thought you hated the way she popped her gum.

83
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,720
 I do, but right now I'm desperate.

84
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,520
 Hi, Cynthia!

85
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,020
 My goodness, poor Willie!

86
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:12,520
 Speaking of memorizing, did I ever tell you about my uncle who had a photographic memory?

87
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,620
 Listen, Charlie, who are you kidding?

88
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:15,520
 Kidding?

89
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,320
 Henry, did you ever hear of Socrates?

90
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,520
 I suppose he was a Clark too.

91
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:22,920
 No, but my uncle memorized his complete works at one sitting.

92
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,020
 Ha! Gee Nancy, did you hear that?

93
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:28,320
 Can we, if Charlie said he did, the least we can do is believe it.

94
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,320
 That's okay, Nancy. He's just jealous.

95
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,880
 Jealous? Listen, Charlie, it might interest you to know that there were just as many famous

96
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,120

97
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:37,720

 How much?

108
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:48,660
 $50.

109
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:49,320
 $50?

110
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,700
 You want to make it a million?

111
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:51,300
 OK.

112
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,020
 OK, why?

113
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:52,500
 A million.

 You're a witness, Nancy.

 You're Uncle Horace.

 My Uncle Horace.

123

 Did you know he delivered one of the longest

 filibusters on record?

125
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:07,380
 My goodness, he did.

126
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:11,300

 Oh, this was Henry.

00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:25,260
 Why, he went out right after dinner, Sam.

130
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,260
 Yes.

131
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:29,900
 He said there was something in the library he wanted to look up before they closed.

132
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,060
 He went to the library?

 Yes, dear.

 Yes, Sam.

139
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:41,420
 Really?

140
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:44,580
 Fine, and doing very well in his job.

141
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:46,580
 And he asked for some pictures of us.

 - Father!

 - My goodness, Henry's back from the library fair.

 have a book that's more complete.

 - The library mother.

 Of famous people, the book they had

152
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,620
 didn't mention a single Aldridge.

153

 Henry, what have I told you about betting?

161
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,060
 He was.

162
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,340
 I couldn't admit in front of Nancy

163
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:28,620
 that our entire family was nondescript, could I?

164
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:31,180
 Henry, our family's hardly that.

165
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:33,180

00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:06,960
 (audience laughs)

182
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,800
 - Well, gee, there was,

183
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,040
 there wasn't one of us worth talking about.

184
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,400
 Let me tell you something, Henry. I don't know Nancy.

185
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,880
 For all I know, she may be a very nice girl.

186
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,920
 But if she's only interested in you because of your ancestors,

187
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,320
 then I've looked at her again.

188
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,680
 I have, Father.

189
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,480
 Legafarden.

190
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:24,680
 And she's one of the prettiest girls in the whole school.

191
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,160
 And Father, would you mind moving your feet

192
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,120
 so I could get at the encyclopedia?

193
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:28,960
 Hey, Henry!

194
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,920
 Boy, this is a fine time for Willie to show up.

195
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,880
 Henry, if he's back selling second-hand Christmas cards,

196
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,280
 I'm not interested.

197
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,080
 You know what, Henry?

198
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,600
 You know what, Cynthia Harris hasn't got a bit of influence

199
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,860
 with Mr. Bradley.

200
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,300
 - Willie, what's that on your tie?

201
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,940
 - Bubble gum, Mr. Rawlidge.

202
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:46,620
 I just stood too close to Cynthia when she popped.

203
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:47,660
 (audience laughing)

204
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:50,060
 So now I'm stuck with a charge of the light brigade.

205
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:51,380
 - The charge of a light brigade?

206
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:53,420
 - That's what I have to recite and assembly.

207
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:54,940
 Here, Henry, hold the book while I see

208
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,940
 how much of the first stands I've memorized.

209
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:59,220
 - Willie, I can't, I'm going through Abba-to-Azo.

210
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:00,040
 - What?

211
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:03,300
 Abba-to-Azo, Abba-to-Azo, in the encyclopedia.

212
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,740
 - Willie, don't you think you'd be happy

213
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,500
 or if you memorized at home?

214
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,340
 - I was doing that,

215
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:11,340
 But my father decided the acoustics were better over here.

216
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:12,340
 You don't say it.

217
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,940
 Mr. Roberts, would you hold the book?

218
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:16,900
 Oh, Willie, I'd be willing to pay it for it, Mr. Alberts.

219
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:19,180
 I don't need money that badly.

220
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:22,300
 I don't just take a second here.

221
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:25,860
 The charge of the light brigade by Alfred Ward Tennyson.

222
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:29,700
 Carefully, carefully, carefully onward.

223
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:32,460
 How's that so far, Mr. Alberts?

224
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:33,300
 It's perfect.

225
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,460
 It is?

226
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:35,700
 What comes next?

227
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,500
 Boy, the Valley of--

228
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,740
 Oh, boy, Father, I found one.

229
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:43,100
 Cyrus, Aldridge, 1810 to 1875.

230
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:45,580
 A well-known general in the Civil War.

231
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:46,540
 In the Civil War?

232
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:47,060
 Well.

233
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:49,140
 Oh, boy, excuse me.

234
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:50,220
 Where are you going, Henry?

235
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:51,460
 To phone somebody.

236
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:52,780
 Oh, in the Valley of-- what did you

237
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:53,860
 say was the role of this?

238
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,260
 Dead.

239
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,220
 Number three.

240
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,660
 Elm, 424.

241
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:00,140
 Hey, Willie, could you bring that encyclopedia in here,

242
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:00,660
 please?

243
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,380
 But I'm tied up with your father.

244
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:04,380
 I can spare you.

245
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:05,220
 Hello?

246
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,980
 Hello Nancy, this is Henry.

247
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:09,100
 - Who? I can hardly hear you.

248
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,100
 - Henry, Henry, who ordered?

249
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,460
 - Oh, Henry, hold on a second while I see

250
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:15,300
 what I can do about all the noise.

251
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,060
 - Henry, here's your encyclopedia, thanks.

252
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:19,300
 Well, what else does it say about Cyrus Aldrich?

253
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:24,300
 - Cyrus Aldrich, 1810 to 1875, a well-known general

254
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:27,420
 in the Civil War who gained notoriety

255
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:29,060
 at the Battle of Crookers Creek

256
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:31,420
 when he fell off his horse and missed the ferry.

257
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:32,260
 - What?

258
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:33,340
 (audience laughing)

259
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:38,340
 From then on, he was laughingly referred to as the general who missed the boat.

260
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:40,340
 [Laughter]

261
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:42,340
 Henry, you really want to tell Nancy about that?

262
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:43,340
 Hello.

263
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:44,340
 Why?

264
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:45,340
 Hello, Nancy.

265
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,340
 I'd better go back.

266
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:48,340
 I left your father right in the middle of the valley of death.

267
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,340
 I couldn't hear you.

268
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:52,340
 Charlie was playing the piano so loud.

269
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:53,340
 Charlie was playing?

270
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:54,340
 Yes.

271
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,340
 A lovely song.

272
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:56,340
 His aunt wrote.

273
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:58,340
 Why did you want to tell me, Henry?

274
00:09:58,340 --> 00:09:59,340
 Right.

275
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,340
 Well, Gee was, Nancy.

276
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:02,340
 When you come right down to it, it's not a person's...

277
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:05,740
 Well, it's not who a person's ancestors were.

278
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:07,040
 It's who he is.

279
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:07,880
 - What?

280
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,980
 - Well, that is, I mean, well,

281
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:12,220
 if you can take a person for a person,

282
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:14,380
 we certainly ought to look at each other again.

283
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,020
 - Well, my goodness, Henry Orridge,

284
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:18,020
 I didn't make any bets about who the Orridge is.

285
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:18,860
 Where are you there?

286
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:19,700
 - Sure.

287
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:22,360
 - And I'm certainly sorry you consider me that show.

288
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,860
 - But, but Nancy.

289
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:24,860
 - But Nancy.

290
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:26,940
 She was.

291
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:29,400
 - Henry dear, may I have that snapshot of you

292
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,300
 on your dresser?

293
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,540
 - My snapshot?

294
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:34,040
 My mother, that's the one with my dog, Smoothing.

295
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,240
 There, Smoothing ran away three years ago.

296
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,040
 Sure, but suppose he comes back.

297
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:43,540
 Well, how he feel he finds out I gave away my only picture of him.

298
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:46,040
 Suppose I ask Lionel to send it back.

299
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,540
 Send it back?

300
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:50,040
 Is this Lionel reliable?

301
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:53,040
 Henry, he's your own father's cousin's boy.

302
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,540
 Mother, I've somehow lost confidence in our whole family.

303
00:10:56,540 --> 00:11:01,540
 Well, I think you can trust a man who works for the Royal Canadian Mounted.

304
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:04,540
 The Royal Canadian Mounted?

305
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:05,540
 Yes, for you.

306
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:09,540
 Those guys and the red coats always bring back their man even if they die first.

307
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:11,540
 And there's one in our family?

308
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:12,540
 Yes.

309
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:16,540
 Oh boy, will I get my hands on Charlie Clark?

310
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:17,540
 What for?

311
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:21,540
 What for mother? What for? Gee whiz, he owes me a million dollars.

312
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:31,540
 [Music]

313
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:32,540
 Agnes, wait!

314
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:33,540
 Hi, Nancy, going in England.

315
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:34,540
 Agnes, did you hear?

316
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:35,540
 Did you hear?

317
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:38,540
 Henry's cousin, Lion, Noah's coming to town.

318
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:39,540
 Hey, yes.

319
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,540
 The Aldrich has got a telegram that his vacation says

320
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:43,540
 "We can be stopping by for a visit."

321
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:44,540
 Oh, boy.

322
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:45,540
 When's it coming?

323
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:46,540
 Today!

324
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,540
 Henry's meeting his train right after school.

325
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:49,540
 Oh, boy.

326
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:56,420
 I imagine having a guy in center bill who practically captured nearly six criminals dead or alive all by himself

327
00:11:56,420 --> 00:12:01,900
 He did I heard it from at least three different kids in school. Oh my goodness. Oh boy

328
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:08,520
 I can't wait to see it hard. He's bringing it with him. They never go anywhere without their horses. Really?

329
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:11,260
 They practically sleep together

330
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:18,400
 I wonder how my big sister always will feel about that. She's even baking your cake with red and blue icing

331
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,400
 What for?

332
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:23,400
 To go with Lionel's uniform when he comes to dinner at our house tomorrow night.

333
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,400
 He's coming to dinner.

334
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,840
 My sister Eloise has been dying to meet him.

335
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:30,040
 She hasn't had a date with a man in uniform since the war.

336
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,400
 Invite me, Nancy.

337
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,400
 Invite me.

338
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,400
 Oh, I'd love to, Agnes.

339
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:38,720
 But frankly, if I invited all the kids who wanted to meet Lionel, I'd have to hire a

340
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,720
 banquet hall.

341
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,720
 Hey, Agnes.

342
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,720
 I have to go into class, Agnes.

343
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:46,160
 Nancy, are you sure you couldn't squeeze me in providing I bring my own phone?

344
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,160
 I'm sorry.

345
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,000
 - I'm sorry.

346
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,040
 - Agnes, would you hold this book for me?

347
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:50,880
 - What for?

348
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,120
 - Well, don't you realize the assemblies

349
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,120
 that they have to tomorrow?

350
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,960
 And I haven't memorized a single line except half-a-lee,

351
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:56,800
 half-a-lee?

352
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,400
 - Well, you know what they say, kid.

353
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,280
 Half-a-lee, better than none.

354
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,120
 (groans)

355
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,920
 - Oh, boy.

356
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,760
 - Agnes, this is no time for jokes.

357
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,240
 - Look, Willie, you're a friend of Henry.

358
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,120
 Can you fix it for me to meet his cousin?

359
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,880
 - Agnes, I've got problems in my own.

360
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,560
 - Oh boy, if that tobe Smith down there,

361
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,120
 maybe he'll speak to Henry.

362
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,680
 Hey, Toby, wait for me!

363
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,680
 Oh boy, yes Mr. Bradley.

364
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,180
 Were you calling someone?

365
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,180
 What?

366
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:23,180
 Yes sir, Toby Smith.

367
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:25,180
 I see, and where is he?

368
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,180
 At home?

369
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:29,180
 You mean I was raising my voice.

370
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:32,680
 Raising it is hardly an adequate description.

371
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,680
 Please remember, this is the school.

372
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,680
 Yes sir, I'll try not to lose my head in the future.

373
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,180
 No, who you do?

374
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,180
 And I'll run along.

375
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:43,180
 Yes sir, it's been nice talking with you Mr. Brad.

376
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:44,680
 The pleasure is all mine.

377
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,580
 Mr. Brad, could I have a word with you?

378
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:47,660
 Certainly, Willie, what about?

379
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,700
 Well, I'm reciting an assembly, Friday.

380
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,260
 See, you are?

381
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:52,100
 Yes, sir.

382
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,000
 Reciting?

383
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:53,780
 Yes, sir.

384
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:55,860
 Well, that's fine, Willie.

385
00:13:55,860 --> 00:14:00,300
 I'm sure it'll be an assembly we'll remember for a long time.

386
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,660
 That's just it, Mr. Bradley.

387
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:02,820
 I'd like to be excused.

388
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:03,660
 Excused?

389
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:04,820
 Well, isn't that what I don't want to,

390
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:09,140
 but gee, was I have a head that nothing seems to stick into?

391
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,820
 Yeah.

392
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:13,300
 So couldn't we get someone else to take my place?

393
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:13,980
 Who?

394
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:14,940
 Why--

395
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:15,440
 Why?

396
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,940
 You know, other student is prepared and we don't have the money for outside speakers.

397
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:20,340
 Oh boy!

398
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:21,040
 I beg your pardon?

399
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,640
 Oh boy, why didn't I think of him before?

400
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:26,740
 Mr. Bradley, I've got just the person to take my place.

401
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:39,740
 Henry, dear, please stand back from the track.

402
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:40,440
 Yes, mother.

403
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,840
 Father, are you sure this is Lionel's train?

404
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,840
 I believe it is.

405
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,180
 Be on the lookout for a man in a red jacket.

406
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,500
 Sam, there's a red jacket.

407
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,500
 Where? Where?

408
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,200
 Down at the end of the platform.

409
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,600
 Alice, that's a porter.

410
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,600
 Oh.

411
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,600
 Oh, man.

412
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,600
 Who's calling?

413
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,400
 My little fat man, the Derby.

414
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,600
 Is he waving at us?

415
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,500
 You can't be. I never saw him before in my life.

416
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,200
 You're Mr. and Mrs. Oldridge, aren't you?

417
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,440
 Why, yes.

418
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,080
 I recognize you from your pictures.

419
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:04,880
 Hello.

420
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,680
 Cousin Sam? Cousin Alice?

421
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,280
 I...

422
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,480
 I'm Lionel.

423
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,480
 You?

424
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,280
 You?

425
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,040
 You...

426
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:11,880
 Are?

427
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:12,720
 Yes.

428
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,160
 I guess this is Henry. I didn't recognize you without your dog.

429
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:21,120
 Well, it's very nice to have you with us, Lionel.

430
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,820
 Yes, yes. When did you leave them out?

431
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:26,720
 Oh, I haven't left them. No.

432
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,520
 Whatever gave you the idea I had.

433
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,420
 But where's your uniform?

434
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:31,320
 Henry.

435
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,520
 I'm sorry, Henry, but I don't have one.

436
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,520
 They only come up to size 38 and...

437
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,520
 Well, I'm a 44.

438
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,920
 Oh, boy.

439
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,120
 Besides, nobody in our office wears one.

440
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,260
 - Office.

441
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:45,020
 - You working in office?

442
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:49,220
 - Well, well, shall we be getting home, Sam?

443
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:51,420
 I imagine Lionel would like to wash up.

444
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:52,900
 - Yes, thanks I would, cousin Alice.

445
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:55,060
 - Are the cars parked over this way, Lionel?

446
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:56,380
 - Henry, aren't you coming?

447
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:58,580
 - Mother, I have to phone Nancy Adams first.

448
00:15:58,580 --> 00:15:59,420
 - What for?

449
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:01,140
 - Can I call off that dinner date?

450
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:02,300
 - Henry Aldry.

451
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,120
 - Mother, if Lionel's seen in public,

452
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,740
 I'll be the laughingstock of the whole school.

453
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:10,660
 - Henry, Henry, I must say you're not behaving at all well.

454
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:12,580
 Henry, I got wonderful news for you.

455
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:14,420
 - Well, out of my way, I have to make a phone call.

456
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:15,940
 - But guess who I taught Mr. Bradley

457
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:18,060
 in the letting take my place in the assembly tomorrow?

458
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:18,900
 - Well, I don't have time to--

459
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:19,880
 - But it's Lionel!

460
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,380
 - I don't care who?

461
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:22,780
 - Lionel!

462
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:25,900
 Mr. Bradley said it was the best idea I've--

463
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,340
 - Henry?

464
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:29,460
 Henry, why are you staring at me like that?

465
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:31,580
 Henry?

466
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:32,900
 Mrs. Allridge, come back!

467
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,940
 I think Henry's had him attack!

468
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:37,700
 (dramatic music)

469
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:49,700
 [Music]

470
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:57,700
 And now while Henry is speechless, it's time for a few words from Meredith Wilson and his talking people.

471
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:00,700
 Are we the intermission, Meredith?

472
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:06,700
 The intermission? Well, yes, you might say so. We are the intermission and the high lariest adventures of the Aldrich family

473
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:09,100
 family brought to you by the jello family

474
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:13,300
 in the theaters during the mission of all you do you have the island

475
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:13,700
 yet here

476
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:17,100
 programs

477
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:19,500
 yeah that's right

478
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,980
 we like to do a little young too about the jello family of dessert i don't

479
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:23,700
 blame you

480
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,780
 you never tasted anything better

481
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:26,980
 there's tell

482
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:29,780
 the world's most famous shimmering dessert yes

483
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:31,700
 and there's yellow pudding

484
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:32,700
 like that means

485
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:33,700
 move

486
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:34,700
 That's right.

487
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,700
 And it's jello tapioca pudding.

488
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:39,700
 Full of personality and dimples and three wonderful flavors.

489
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:44,700
 Yellow vanilla tapioca, jello chocolate, tapioca, yellow orange, coke, golden, that's it.

490
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:47,700
 They taste all downright delicious.

491
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:51,700
 You'll hurry to order Murray just to learn to dance with tapioca polka.

492
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:58,700
 Yellow chocolate tapioca, yellow chocolate tapioca, yellow orange.

493
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:04,700
 That means orange, coconut jello, the melodepioca,

494
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:09,700
 jello chocolate, the pepioca, jello orange.

495
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,700
 That means orange, coconut.

496
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:15,700
 And now the jello family returns you to the Aldrich family.

497
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:29,140
 [Music]

498
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:33,040
 Yes, getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldridge.

499
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:36,880
 Henry's second cousin Lionel of the Royal Canadian Mounted

500
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,760
 has turned out to be a severe disappointment.

501
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,600
 And to make matters worse,

502
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:46,600
 Willie has volunteered Lionel's service as a speaker at Central High School.

503
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:51,100
 It is the day of assembly. The scene opens outside the school's main office.

504
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:56,100
 Willie, you'll just have to go into Mr. Bradley's office here and volunteer to recite your poem again.

505
00:18:56,100 --> 00:19:02,100
 But Henry told you, "Lionel steps on that stage, well, I'll be the laughing stock of the entire school."

506
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,600
 Henry, things aren't that bad.

507
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:08,600
 But you should see him, Willie. He's short, he's fat, and he doesn't have a uniform.

508
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:12,600
 And he can't stay on a horse any better than General Cyrus Aldridge could.

509
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,600
 Well sure.

510
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,600
 And to top everything, do you know what he had for breakfast this morning?

511
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,600
 What?

512
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,600
 Cream pups?

513
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,600
 No kidding.

514
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,600
 Three of them.

515
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,600
 Well, Henry, things aren't completely hopeless.

516
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,600
 Maybe the assembly will be canceled.

517
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,600
 Cancel?

518
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,600
 Sure.

519
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,600
 Remember the one that got called off last month?

520
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,600
 What about it?

521
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,600
 Wasn't it because the bell somehow didn't ring?

522
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,600
 Well, well...

523
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,000
 - Well, earlier, you suggest-- - Well, naturally not,

524
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,280
 but you happen to be in the janitor's room,

525
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,760
 and somehow your elbow happened to hit the switch

526
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,720
 that worked the bells,

527
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,360
 and they didn't happen to ring for assembly when--

528
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,920
 - Will he for the last time,

529
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:52,000
 will you recite the charge of the light brigade?

530
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,280
 - You wanna definite answer?

531
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,120
 - Yes, no.

532
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:55,960
 (audience laughing)

533
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,920
 - Once I get past the valley at death, where am I?

534
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:00,040
 - Okay, okay.

535
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:03,200
 If that's your attitude, I'll volunteer myself

536
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,280
 in place of Lionel.

537
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,480
 You to do what?

538
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,680
 Play my cello.

539
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,880
 Harry, you can.

540
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:08,480
 Why not?

541
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,880
 You're terrible.

542
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,960
 Willie, I played it once before an assembly,

543
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,520
 and nothing happened.

544
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,800
 Step aside.

545
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,400
 Oh, then.

546
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,320
 Well, good luck, Ken, old time.

547
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,280
 Oh, it's you, Henry.

548
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:20,920
 Come here.

549
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,120
 Yes, sir.

550
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,480
 Henry, I've never seen Mr. Dutenbody so excited

551
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,880
 about any assembly before.

552
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:26,720
 Well, about that.

553
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,280
 Are we your cousin, D, in his uniform?

554
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,320
 No, sir.

555
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,800
 He's a 44.

556
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,400
 What?

557
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,660
 He doesn't have one.

558
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:36,640
 - But it really doesn't matter.

559
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,920
 How would he like me to introduce him?

560
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:41,240
 - Well, Mr. Bradley, about that, he's gonna be nervous.

561
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,640
 He is a member of my own family, you might say.

562
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,640
 - Yeah.

563
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:48,560
 - Well, how would you feel if I...

564
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:54,000
 Mr. Bradley, wouldn't you care to sit down

565
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,960
 before I suggest this?

566
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,040
 - Henry, it isn't necessary to explain.

567
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:58,880
 - It isn't?

568
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,640
 - No, if you think your cousin Lionel would feel more

569
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,240
 comfortable if you were to introduce him.

570
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,080
 - Introduce him.

571
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,420
 Naturally I would mind.

572
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:04,920
 Why?

573
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:07,080
 Just be up on the stage before assembly begins

574
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,880
 and we'll make the necessary arrangements.

575
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,880
 But you see, I...

576
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,920
 You know, Henry, for a moment I was afraid

577
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,560
 you were going to suggest that I allow you

578
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,120
 to play your cello again.

579
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,700
 (upbeat music)

580
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:35,180
 [APPLAUSE]

581
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:36,980
 Thank you.

582
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:39,580
 Thank you very much.

583
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:43,620
 That was our own orchestra playing William Tell,

584
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:45,940
 a number which Miss Wheeler tells me they've

585
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:48,460
 been working on for some time.

586
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:53,020
 I'm sure we all found their performance quite spirited,

587
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:55,180
 especially in the brass section.

588
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:57,220
 [LAUGHTER]

589
00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:04,180
 Now, in connection with the assembly bell ringing 15 minutes earlier today,

590
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:06,780
 I regret to say it was no accident.

591
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:12,420
 I just learned that two boys were seen running from the janitor's room immediately after it happened.

592
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:18,540
 And when we discover who they are, I can assure you they will be severely punished.

593
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:26,440
 Oh, I see our principal speaker hasn't arrived yet, so I'm sure we'll all enjoy hearing

594
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:29,400
 months again from the orchestra Miss Wheeler.

595
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:33,400
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

596
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:43,400
 Boy, Willie, boy, you and your idea.

597
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,080
 Me?

598
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,840
 Was it my fault that the bells went on instead of off

599
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,360
 when you pulled the lever down?

600
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,720
 Why, Willie.

601
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:52,280
 Step out here in the hall.

602
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,280
 Henry!

603
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,520
 Oh boy, it's Nancy.

604
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,860
 I've been looking all over for you, Henry.

605
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:59,560
 Do you know who's sitting in the background?

606
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,400
 - We wish I was.

607
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,560
 - My sister, Ella, we just couldn't wait

608
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,280
 to see what Lionel looks like.

609
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,120
 - Oh boy.

610
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,480
 - And you know what, she bought an honor

611
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,800
 of this coming to dinner tomorrow?

612
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,200
 A pair of shoes with sex and cheer.

613
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:13,040
 - Nancy, do you think she ought to get her hopes up that high?

614
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,880
 (audience laughing)

615
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,040
 - Oh boy.

616
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,040
 - Who's that?

617
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,160
 - I'm sorry I'm late.

618
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,680
 I was all over town looking for some things

619
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,040
 I need for my talk.

620
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:24,360
 (upbeat music)

621
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,440
 Henry, have you heard from him yet?

622
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,800
 Why, yes, Mr. Bradley.

623
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,640
 I've heard from him.

624
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:34,040
 Mr. Bradley, this is my cousin Lionel.

625
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,040
 (audience laughs)

626
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:35,880
 What?

627
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,320
 What?

628
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,840
 Of the Royal Canadian Mountain.

629
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,880
 Oh my goodness.

630
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,120
 How do you do, sir?

631
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:47,160
 Well, welcome to Central High.

632
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:51,440
 Henry, suppose you go out and introduce Henry.

633
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,520
 Well, whether you're suppose he disappeared too.

634
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,100
 (upbeat music)

635
00:23:56,100 --> 00:24:06,520
 - Patrick, is that you?

636
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,960
 - Yes, Father, it's I or I.

637
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,760
 - Well, how did the assembly go?

638
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,240
 - How did it go?

639
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,520
 It went, Father.

640
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,880
 (audience laughs)

641
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,280
 As a matter of fact, I didn't even stay.

642
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,120
 - Oh.

643
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:21,600
 - And Father, Father, can I ask a big favor of you?

644
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,440
 - Favorite?

645
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:27,680
 I do. I want you to keep in mind that I intend to go to work and pay part of my tuition.

646
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,680
 What tuition?

647
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,640
 To Abbott City High.

648
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,040
 Abbott City? What's wrong with Central High?

649
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:37,640
 It's the kids, Father. I don't know.

650
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:42,440
 Well, then, Gee, was it isn't who you are? It's who your ancestors were.

651
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,640
 So you want to change?

652
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:46,840
 Yes, I think it'd be better all the way around.

653
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:51,640
 And, Ray. And don't you think you ought to be a little ashamed of yourself?

654
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,640
 I followed.

655
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:57,240
 You are feeling sorry for yourself because Lionel isn't something you pretended that

656
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,240
 he was.

657
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:02,880
 But tell me the truth Henry, have you ever met a nicer person than Lionel?

658
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,880
 Why, no.

659
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:04,880
 Of course you haven't.

660
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:09,720
 He's just pleasant, well-mannered, and charming a person if you'd ever want to meet.

661
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:13,320
 You should have every reason to be proud of him instead of feeling that you were betrayed.

662
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,320
 Gee, Father.

663
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,920
 Gee, I didn't look at it that way.

664
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,520
 I didn't think you did.

665
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,520
 Oh, please answer the phone, Henry.

666
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:23,520
 And you know what about Abbott City High?

667
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,520
 What?

668
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,520
 I'm sorry I mentioned it.

669
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:27,520
 Hello?

670
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,520
 Hello Henry, this is Nancy.

671
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,520
 Oh.

672
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:33,520
 Before you start Nancy, let me tell you one thing.

673
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,520
 If you're expecting an apology, you're wasting your time.

674
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,520
 An apology for what?

675
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,520
 You're right.

676
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,520
 Boy, I've never met a more pleasant, a more...

677
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:45,520
 She was who cares if he can't stay on a horse anyway.

678
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,520
 Henry, I agree with you.

679
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,520
 What?

680
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:51,880
 I think Lionel is divine and so is my sister Eloise.

681
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,080
 Whoa, Gee whiz.

682
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:55,080
 She's even going down to buy a pair of flat heels.

683
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:57,080
 That's how divine she thinks he is.

684
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,080
 [LAUGHTER]

685
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:01,000
 And you should have heard the hand the kids gave Lionel.

686
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:01,960
 They gave him a hand?

687
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,460
 Yes.

688
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:05,080
 And Mr. Bradley said it was the most interesting assembly

689
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,360
 talk he ever heard.

690
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,200
 Nancy, what did Lionel talk about?

691
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,280
 His work with the Rock and Hadeon Mountains

692
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:12,760
 in the scientific crime detection bureau.

693
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:13,260
 What?

694
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:14,160
 Yes.

695
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,680
 He showed us how he always gets his man without even

696
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,840
 leaving his desk.

697
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,840
 Will I be John?

698
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,840
 And Charlie Clark certainly lost that bet.

699
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:23,840
 Hey, hey, hey, hey.

700
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,840
 Excuse me, Nancy. Will he just walked in?

701
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,840
 All right. Don't forget dinner tomorrow night.

702
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,840
 Yeah, I won't.

703
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:34,840
 We're having saddle of lamb and Lionel's honor.

704
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,840
 Goodbye.

705
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:37,840
 Goodbye, Nancy.

706
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,840
 Will he? I'm in here.

707
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,840
 Boy, Henry, boy. Darn that Lionel anyhow.

708
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,840
 Oh, you haven't heard. Lionel was a big success in assembly.

709
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:50,660
 I know he was I know he was I was there you were sure and he was such a big success

710
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:54,380
 You know what he offered to do what come back tomorrow and give a practical demonstration

711
00:26:54,380 --> 00:27:00,660
 He's gonna track down a criminal by scientific method. No kidding boy. I sure like to see that

712
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:07,860
 That's what you think you know who he's tracking now. No, the two guys who rang the assembly back

713
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:11,700
 You certainly have one fine family

714
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:14,700

715
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:25,700
 Hi, Willie, all kid.

716
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:26,700
 Hi, Henry.

717
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:27,700
 Hi, Agnes.

00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:28,200
 Hi.

719
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,200
 Henry, guess what?

720
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,300
 Your cousin line will come over to my house

721
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:31,800
 Sunday night.

722
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,800
 Bye.

723
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,980
 For Agnes, what about our date for the B's you?

724
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:36,900
 And next to well western, where the hero

725
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:39,200
 chases the robbers over an entire mountain?

726
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,300
 Set tires to most stuff.

727
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:46,580
 From now on I'd like to see him copy easy way, like cousin Lionel does a sitting in a chair.

728
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:48,100
 Bye!

729
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:53,140
 Well ladies, you'll always catch him the easy way when you serve your family jello for dessert.

730
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:56,600
 Yes, jello and any one of those six delicious flavors.

731
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:00,100
 Strawberry, raspberry, cherry, orange, lemon or lime.

732
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:04,100
 Every jello flavor is rich with that famous locked in goodness.

733
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:10,300
 Flavor sealed right in by a special process, so it can't get out till your first delectable spoonful.

734
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:14,500
 And that's why Jell-O is America's favorite gelatin dessert.

735
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,980
 Look for those big red letters on the box.

736
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:20,740
 They spell Jell-O and Jell-O spells a treat.
