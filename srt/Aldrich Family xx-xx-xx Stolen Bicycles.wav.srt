 Yes, sure. I looked every place.

 We left them both lights there by that tree.

 Sure, that's why they can't be very far away, Homer.

 After all, we just went down the corner store for ten minutes.

 Henry, look, isn't that Mary coming down the street?

 Yeah, sure. But don't say anything to her about her losing them, Homer.

 You don't have to worry, Henry.

180
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:44,060
 And in the future, it seems to me that Charlie should

181
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:46,980
 be a little more careful himself about jumping at conclusions.

182
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:49,140
 But Mrs. Orridge, as Charlie said,

183
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:51,660
 that Henry said that Charlie could get bicycles.

184
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,380
 That's just what I mean, Mrs. Clark.

185
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,820
 You can see for yourself how ridiculous it sounds.

186
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,340
 - Can me? - Yes, Mother.

187
00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:00,500
 Mrs. Clark is on the phone and I want to ask you something.

188
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,860
 I don't think I can talk for an hour, Mother.

189
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:04,580
 Dear, all I want to know is,

190
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,780
 didn't I see your bicycle out there on the lawn

191
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,220
 under the tree this morning?

192
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,580
 - Why?

193
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:10,420
 - Yes.

194
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:12,780
 - And did Charlie Clark take it at any time?

195
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:13,620
 - No.

196
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,020
 No, he didn't take it.

197
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,900
 Charlie has a long bicycle.

198
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:17,940
 - Mrs. Clark?

199
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,100
 - Hello? - Hello.

200
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,900
 - Mrs. Clark, if you tell Charlie

201
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,980
 to please go back and look very promptly

202
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:25,460
 he'll see that he has his own bicycle and not Henry

203
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:27,820
 yes of course he has

204
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,700
 then i don't see what the bus is all about

205
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:34,700
 and this is part of the story but i have a pie in the oven

206
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:41,700
 [Music]

207
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,700
 [Music]

208
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,820
 I'll need help you carry a line and tackle Will

209
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:46,740
 no thanks Sam

210
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,100
 I can carry it alright

211
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:51,300
 Because if you're having any trouble, I'd be glad to at least carry that fish.

212
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,300
 No, thanks.

213
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:55,400
 About how much farther you think it is out to where we left our bicycle?

214
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,100
 Oh, not too far, Will.

215
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:00,500
 Ah, did you ever feel better in your life, Sam?

216
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,700
 No, sir.

217
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:04,700
 Been a good day, good fishing, and good everything.

218
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:05,900
 Here's the road, Sam.

219
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:06,400
 Huh?

220
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:06,900
 Already?

221
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:07,900
 Now then.

222
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,200
 Under which bush?

223
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,200
 Under which bush?

224
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:10,800
 What's that?

225
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,300
 Well, what are you stopping here for?

226
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,700
 This is where we left our bicycle.

227
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:15,500
 Well, what are they?

228
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,900
 That's what I want to know.

229
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:19,900
 I put Homer's right here and you left Henry's left.

230
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,940
 Well, that's strange.

231
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,180
 Are you sure this is a play?

232
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:24,620
 Of course it is, Sam.

233
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:25,820
 Somebody stole them.

234
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:26,660
 No, they didn't.

235
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:27,700
 We're just a little mixed up.

236
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,820
 All we have to do is look around and do is find them.

237
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:40,660
 But Ed, I think you ought to have a talk with Charlie.

238
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:42,980
 I'm perfectly willing to have a talk with him, Will.

239
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,900
 But why don't you just let the whole thing drop?

240
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,700
 Ed, Charlie Clark is your boy.

241
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:50,600
 just as much as he is lying and I've never, never been so embarrassed as when I

242
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:54,540
 told Mrs. Olga. What did you say to her? Well, at first I told her I'd into it and

243
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:58,260
 even when he said Henry was right there at the house and had even seen Charlie, I

244
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:03,100
 practically insinuated she was lying to me. Yeah? Well, whatever made Charlie cook up

245
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:06,800
 a story like that. I don't know, dear, but I suppose he was afraid to come home

246
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:11,380
 with his hands torn and Henry was the first person to have him. The origins are

247
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:15,540
 really nice people and I think Charlie ought to be punished. All right, I'll tell

248
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,940
 He's telling me to go to bed for the rest of the day.

249
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:22,740
 The only thing is, he promised to take some girl to the movies this afternoon.

250
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:25,740
 All right, all right. I'll let him go over and tell her he can't take her.

251
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:28,140
 But we're going to teach Charlie to be a gentleman.

252
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:29,740
 Give us the last thing we do.

253
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:41,540
 Hello? Hello?

254
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,740
 Hello? Hello, is this all, Rich?

255
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:48,340
 This is police headquarters. I'm calling about that bicycle. It's missing.

256
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:50,940
 - My goodness, the bicycle. - Yes, ma'am.

257
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,740
 Now here's the way things stand, lady.

258
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:56,340
 - But just a minute. We don't have any bicycle missing. - You know what?

259
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:58,940
 I'm sorry that the whole thing isn't a third mistake.

260
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:02,540
 A mistake? Oh, no. I've got a report here under the name of Aldrich.

261
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:04,140
 Two bicycles stolen.

262
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:06,340
 But that guess goes to kill how long it is.

263
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:10,340
 In the first place, Henry doesn't own two bicycles. He's never owned more than one.

264
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:13,140
 Yeah? Well, how would you account for a mistake like that?

265
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:18,140
 I had no idea. Only I do hope that sooner or later we can get this whole thing straightened out.

266
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:20,140
 We'll take care of it, lady. Don't worry.

267
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,140
 Good night.

268
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:23,140
 Hey, Captain. Can I have a talk with you?

269
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:25,140
 You can. Only first.

270
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:32,140
 Didn't we get a report a little while ago that a state trooper picked up a couple of bicycles out on the edge of the woods near the big lake, is we?

271
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:33,140
 I didn't know. Sure we did.

272
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:37,140
 I thought they answered the description of two bicycles lost by all of us.

273
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:40,140
 What's happening? It's the all reach bicycles that I wanted to talk to you about.

274
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,780
 I think I just picked one of them up.

275
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:42,520
 Where is it?

276
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,420
 In the next room.

277
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:44,880
 Um, come in here, sonny.

278
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,920
 What is it you want?

279
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,120
 I'm a captain here.

280
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,960
 What it is you say your name is.

281
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,260
 It's Charlie Clark, but this isn't Henry older.

282
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:52,760
 She's bicycle. It's my own.

283
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,060
 What were you doing with it?

284
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:57,100
 Nothing. I was going over to tell my girl I can't take her to the movies

285
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:59,500
 because I'm not a gentleman.

286
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,800
 [laughter]

287
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,500
 Okay, then take your bicycle and go tell her.

288
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,040
 Now then, what are we going to do with those other two bicycles?

289
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,540
 [cheering]

290
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:10,300
 (dramatic music)

291
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:17,340
 - Do you see anything of them, Will?

292
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,180
 - No, Sam.

293
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:20,680
 If you asked me, those bicycles have been stolen,

294
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,580
 and we're lost.

295
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,780
 - No, we're not that south right over there.

296
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:24,620
 - No, it isn't.

297
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:25,540
 South is this way.

298
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:26,380
 - Which way?

299
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:28,180
 - Where I'm pointing with this fish.

300
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,380
 - Will, I still don't understand

301
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:30,700
 why you didn't wrap that fish,

302
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:31,940
 while we still had some paper.

303
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:33,380
 - I hated to cover it up, Sam.

304
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:35,500
 It was such a nice color.

305
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,980
 - How about the boy's bicycle, Will?

306
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:38,440
 Suppose we don't find them.

307
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,820
 I mean, what are we going to tell Henry and Homer?

308
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,380
 That's what I've been wondering, Sam.

309
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:45,180
 If we don't find those bicycles, I'm not going home.

310
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:47,020
 Even if we find our way out of here.

311
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:50,020
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

312
00:11:50,020 --> 00:12:01,180
 Don't you think that's a good idea, Homer?

313
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,180
 I mean, going down here to this bicycle shop

314
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,020
 and asking whether anybody tried to sell them

315
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:06,140
 two bicycles today?

316
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:07,640
 I agree with you.

317
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:12,640
 Only don't you realize when somebody tries to sell a bicycle a stolen, they usually...

318
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,640
 Hey, Henry, lookin' back of it.

319
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,640
 Those come.

320
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,140
 It's our father's. It's our father's.

321
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:20,140
 What are we gonna tell him, Henry, if they ask us where our bikes are?

322
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:22,140
 Do they see us? I don't think so.

323
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:23,140
 They stop.

324
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:25,140
 And they're looking in the store window.

325
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:26,140
 Oh, boy.

326
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,140
 What's fuckin' the value here?

327
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:29,140
 Look out, Henry. Let me in first.

328
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:31,140
 Well, D, would you don't have to show me against a brick wall.

329
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:33,140
 Come on, stop pushing.

330
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:34,140
 Well, right.

331
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:36,140
 Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

332
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:38,140
 It's all right, Sam. The boy's gone.

333
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:42,140
 Do you think they saw it?

334
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:43,140
 No.

335
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:46,140
 You know, well, we've walked 15 miles if we've walked a foot.

336
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:50,140
 Do you know why I think no one would give it the right, Sam, because of this fish I'm carrying?

337
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:55,140
 I told you you should have left it back there, but no. You were too anxious to have everybody see it.

338
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:58,140
 I didn't know I was going to have to carry it all day, though.

339
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:00,140
 Wait a second. Wait a second.

340
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:01,140
 What do you see?

341
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:03,140
 Isn't it the bicycle shop we're going right by here?

342
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:06,140
 - What do you think we step in and see whether they don't have to use one for sale?

343
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:07,140
 - That's an idea.

344
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:11,140
 And while you're doing that, I'll be down to the office and phone my brother-in-law

345
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:13,140
 and see whether he'd be willing to sell his daughter's bicycle.

346
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:14,140
 - You think you might?

347
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,140
 - Well, you can't tell.

348
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,140
 The girl's bicycle.

349
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:20,140
 But if Homer says anything, I'll just ask him whether he doesn't know there's a war on.

 Hello there, Mr. Sparrow.

 I'm in thought of a jam, and I wondered whether you could help me out.

00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,200
 Alice!

534
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,100
 Yes, Sam.

535
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:24,200
 Someone at the front door and walk to see you.

536
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,000
 Who is it?

537
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:25,840
 Mr. Clark?

538
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:26,660
 No, dear.

539
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,040
 The man from the bicycle shop.

540
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:28,640
 What's that?

541
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,400
 The bicycle shop?

542
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:29,920
 Yes, dear.

543
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:32,120
 And he says he has something you'll be very glad to get.

544
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:32,760
 He has?

545
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,440
 He has?

546
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:33,880
 He has?

547
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,000
 He's had a load off my mind.

548
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,800
 Alice is what I've been meaning to tell you.

549
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,840
 but somehow I couldn't.

550
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,600
 Sam, I think you better go to the front door.

551
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,880
 Yes, Alice, but here's what happened.

552
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,400
 I borrowed Henry's bicycle and lost it.

553
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,160
 You what?

554
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,320
 But Alice, don't you understand?

555
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,320
 The fellas found it, and they didn't think the worry about it.

556
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,280
 Well, where did he find it?

557
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:48,960
 I don't know.

558
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,040
 That's what I'm going on at Naskybs.

559
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,080
 Hello, there, Mr. Sparrow.

560
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,520
 I'm gently glad to see you.

561
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,160
 Well, here you are, Mr. Olrich.

562
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,600
 And you thought you'd lost it.

563
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,200
 At that?

564
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,000
 What is it?

565
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:58,680
 It's your face.

566
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,120
 I put a newspaper around her.

567
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,600
 [LAUGHTER]

568
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,560
 I make her pardon.

569
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,120
 You left it right in my window.

570
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,120
 As the darndest time find not where the smell came from.

571
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:11,800
 Well, thank you. Thank you very much.

572
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,520
 That's okay. Hope you enjoy it.

573
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,320
 Yes.

574
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,800
 Sam, is it in good condition?

575
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,720
 Well, apparently it smells a little.

576
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,320
 Can I re-find it?

577
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,760
 Now, you tell me exactly how the whole thing happened.

578
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,360
 Well, there's going to be a lot about it

579
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:27,720
 that you find hard to believe, Alice, but first, here, take this.

580
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,680
 Sam, what is it?

581
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,720
 A fish. Riot for Henry's dinner.

582
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,680
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

583
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:38,780
 Hello.

584
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:40,220
 Hello.

585
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:40,780
 Hello, Sam.

586
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:41,420
 How are you speaking?

587
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:42,560
 Oh, hello, Mr. Allrich.

588
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,800
 This is police headquarters.

589
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:44,300
 Yes?

590
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:46,460
 I am calling about that bicycle, Mr. Allrich.

591
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:48,020
 About the bicycle?

592
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:49,660
 Is Mr. Clark report that?

593
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:50,820
 Oh, Mr. Clark.

594
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:52,140
 Is Mr. Clark down there with you?

595
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:53,020
 Oh, no, sir.

596
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:54,220
 Why, here's what I want to tell you.

597
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:56,140
 Before you tell me anything, let me tell you something.

598
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:58,100
 The whole thing with just the case of mistaken identity.

599
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:58,860
 But Mr. Allrich--

600
00:22:58,860 --> 00:22:59,540
 I am a lawyer.

601
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:02,540
 a new tell that part of the he wants to sue to come on and serve the paper that

602
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:06,420
 isn't one thing he can prove what's that but Mr. Orange and Mr. Orange

603
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:20,500
 hello say if these are by second who's early you know what I've decided to do

604
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:24,300
 homework why I'm gonna tell my father the whole thing and get it off my chest

605
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:28,260
 listen to me if you tell your father he'll tell my father and I don't want to

606
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:31,260
 I'm going to get it off my chest until I get this week's allowance.

607
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:33,260
 Just the flame I'm going to tell him.

608
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:34,260
 Hey!

609
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:36,260
 Oh, well, look, Henry, I'm going outside.

610
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:38,260
 Henry, have you seen your father anyplace?

611
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:39,260
 No, mother.

612
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:41,260
 As a matter of fact, I was just going to look for him.

613
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:42,260
 You were?

614
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:43,260
 Uh-uh.

615
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:45,260
 You said I'm right here, and Henry wants you for something too.

616
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:49,260
 Well, mother, I did want to see him, but I sort of came for him and I'll see him a little later.

617
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,260
 Uh-uh.

618
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:51,260
 Yes, Sam.

619
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:52,260
 Right here, dear.

620
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:57,260
 I've been taking things over, and it seems to me that sooner you tell Henry what happened the better.

621
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:59,140
 Alice, can't you tell him for me?

622
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:01,540
 Frankly, I'm gonna feel like two cents saying Henry,

623
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:03,380
 I'm sorry, but I lost your bicycle.

624
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:04,500
 - Say I'm on a shame debut.

625
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,180
 - Alice, I'm not afraid to tell the boy.

626
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:09,180
 I just don't want to upset him just before dinner.

627
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:11,260
 Why not sit down and have a good meal?

628
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:14,020
 And then tomorrow morning, right after breakfast,

629
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:15,940
 or maybe when I get home from church tomorrow noon,

630
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:17,540
 I'll come right out and tell him.

631
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:21,220
 - Sam, did you ask Henry that you could borrow his bicycle?

632
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:22,140
 - You mean I should have?

633
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:22,980
 - Father!

634
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:24,380
 - Alice, is that Henry calling me?

635
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:25,220
 - Father?

636
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:27,100
 - Yes, Henry, your father's right here.

637
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,900
 Oh, my ears.

638
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,700
 Well, she was...

639
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:32,260
 Hello, Father.

640
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:33,460
 Hello, Henry.

641
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:35,060
 Did you...

642
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:37,540
 Did you have a nice, baby offer?

643
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:38,980
 Well, pretty good.

644
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:39,800
 That is, I...

645
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,060
 Well, that's the offer, exactly.

646
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:42,780
 No, that's quite true.

647
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:44,900
 Henry, I'm gonna have to go out and get Dennis started,

648
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,340
 and I'm sure your father has something he wants to say to you.

649
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:48,180
 But Alice...

650
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:50,020
 Well, as a matter of fact, Father,

651
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:52,420
 I've been thinking things over and...

652
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:54,380
 I'd like to make a confession.

653
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:55,460
 You were?

654
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:58,460
 As a matter of fact, Henry, there's something I feel I should say to you.

655
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:00,660
 But first, Father, could you please just let me finish?

656
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:02,660
 Henry, I know exactly what you're going to tell me.

657
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:03,460
 You do?

658
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:08,860
 If you were busy with other things today and didn't have time to touch the backyard, it's quite alright with me.

659
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:10,060
 Did he?

660
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:12,260
 How much was I going to pay you an hour for that?

661
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:15,260
 Well, 15 cents, you usually pay me.

662
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:18,060
 15? Only 15? You want to make me pay you 20.

663
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:20,060
 Just to clean up a backyard when I didn't?

664
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,060
 There's two dollars. I'll run along and forget it.

665
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:24,260
 But, Father, that isn't what I was going to talk to you about.

666
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:24,860
 It isn't.

667
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:26,100
 No, sir.

668
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:30,420
 This morning, Father, what were you going to tell me?

669
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:31,380
 Who I?

670
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:32,340
 Oh, yes.

671
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:33,780
 Yes, Father.

672
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:39,100
 Well, Henry, this morning, that is what I mean to say as--

673
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:41,500
 Father, do I smell fish?

674
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,500
 Fish?

675
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,820
 Yes, you certainly do.

676
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:45,900
 One of these days you and I are going fishing together.

677
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:46,980
 Yes, Father.

678
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,860
 But how about this morning?

679
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:50,460
 How about it?

680
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:51,860
 Oh, I'm very busy.

681
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:53,380
 I'm very busy.

682
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:55,880
 Oh my God, my father's going to give me a lecture.

683
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:58,580
 Henry of Homer wants you the thing to do is go and see what it's about.

684
00:25:58,580 --> 00:25:59,480
 Now?

685
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,480
 Yes, of course.

686
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,080
 Henry, I'm coming!

687
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,280
 Homer G. Webb!

688
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:05,580
 Dad, what did Henry say when you told him?

689
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:07,080
 Well, tell you, Alan.

690
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,080
 Homer, what is it?

691
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,080
 Come on, Alan.

692
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:11,080
 Can we just look like I'm the friend of ours?

693
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,580
 Homer G. Webb, weren't you got a bicycle?

694
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:15,280
 The police just drove up with him.

695
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,380
 And boy, were they sure about something.

696
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:18,480
 They were sure.

697
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,380
 All these would throw them on the grass there and then they drove away.

698
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:22,180
 Edward!

699
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,080
 Listen, we're quick.

700
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,580
 - Hey, come around the back, what's for?

701
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:26,620
 - He was my father's got something on his mind.

702
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:27,660
 Then I don't want him to lecture me

703
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:29,660
 about leaving my bicycle on the front lawn all day.

704
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:32,500
 - Okay, Henry, I'll take him around.

705
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,340
 - Henry!

706
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:34,180
 - Yes, father?

707
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:36,220
 I'm out here on the porch.

708
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:38,900
 - I've just been talking with your mother, Henry.

709
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:41,980
 And she thinks, what I mean is I think

710
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:44,140
 I better get the whole thing off my chest.

711
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:45,460
 - Yes.

712
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:49,060
 - Son, your bicycle is pretty important, isn't it?

713
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:51,420
 I guess if you lost it, you would know what to do,

714
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:52,260
 would you?

715
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:56,660
 If I ever lost my bicycle, yeah, I'd just never forget myself.

716
00:26:56,660 --> 00:27:01,800
 Well, if you couldn't have your bicycle anymore, what would you like in place of it?

717
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,960
 Oh, yeah, I'd never be willing to sell it.

718
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,860
 I wouldn't even let Alrigroj for a million dollars.

719
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:09,060
 But suppose it isn't in the garage.

720
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:10,460
 But it is, Father.

721
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:11,960
 Oh, you think it is?

722
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:15,560
 Well, that brings us around to what I wanted to talk about.

723
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,460
 Henry...

724
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:17,260
 What, Homer?

725
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:20,560
 I just took my bicycle out of the garage and I'm going home.

726
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,460
 Your bicycle?

727
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:23,460
 So long, Mr. All-

728
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:25,460
 Wait a minute, wait, you get that.

729
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:27,460
 There are any bicycles out of the garage?

730
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:29,460
 Yes, there are, Mr. All-

731
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:31,460
 I didn't mean to have to earn mine was there a minute ago.

732
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:33,460
 Father, you didn't think for one minute, I'd be so careless that-

733
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:35,460
 No, just a minute.

734
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:37,460
 What wasn't you were going to say, Father?

735
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:40,460
 Uh, not a thing, not a thing.

736
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:43,460
 You know, you used a note I found around and back for you.

737
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:46,460
 For me, I happen to see it tied to the Ray Campbell.

738
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:47,460
 Oh, she went.

739
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:48,460
 Oh, well, here, give me that.

740
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:50,460
 But Father, this notes for me.

741
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,340
 You have enough to worry about without this note.

742
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:53,400
 Hey, Sam.

743
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,420
 Oh, gee, what here comes my father.

744
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:56,780
 Sam, I got one of them.

745
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:58,540
 Well, bro, where'd you get that bicycle?

746
00:27:58,540 --> 00:27:59,180
 It's Henry.

747
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:00,980
 I took it away from Charlie Claus.

748
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:01,980
 [LAUGHTER]

749
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:03,980
 Oh, I'm sorry.

750
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:06,080
 Has anyone ever had the iodine?

751
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,420
 And now wait a minute.

752
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:09,220
 Oh, ma, where did you get that bicycle?

753
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:09,720
 This?

754
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,980
 Don't you remember, father?

755
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,780
 You gave it to me two years ago.

756
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:13,980
 [LAUGHTER]

757
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:15,340
 Sam, you wanted on the telephone.

758
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:17,100
 Mr. Clark wants to talk to you again.

759
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:19,100
 [LAUGHTER]

760
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:22,100
 [audience applauding]

761
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:25,100
 [audience applauding]

762
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:28,100
 [audience applauding]

763
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:31,100
 [audience applauding]

764
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:34,100
 [audience applauding]

765
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:36,100
 [audience applauding]

766
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:40,100
 - Callie, I want you to stop sitting there feeling sorry for yourself and eat your dinner.

767
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:42,100
 - All of it, Father? - All of it.

768
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:46,600
 - But Father, I don't like this. - Callie, the Aldrichs were kind enough to send that fish over just for you.

769
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,600
 Now set up an eight!

770
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:51,760
 (audience applauding)

771
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,920
 (audience applauding)

772
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:57,920
 (audience cheering)

773
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:00,760
 (breathing heavily)

774
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:03,000
 (buzzing)
