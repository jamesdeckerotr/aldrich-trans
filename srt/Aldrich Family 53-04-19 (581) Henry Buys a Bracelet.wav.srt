1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 They are free men.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 The ambulance convoy, eight of them, United Nations ambulance is with red coffees,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 standing at the far side of the tent, ready to come up at any moment.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 Everything has gone very smoothly.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 The last of the men, the litic cases, came in last.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 They're being checked by the doctors right now.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 The men are getting coffee and cigarettes and a few comfort items.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,500
 The convoy that came down from the other end of the neutral zone came in six dilapidated

9
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,500
 looking ambulances.

10
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,500
 Some were pointy, some gray.

11
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,500
 They had red crosses painted on them.

12
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:44,740
 The prisoners wore a blue-headed great coat, blue denim hat, and most of them found all

13
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:48,500
 blankets, blue in the shape of a horseshoe.

14
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:54,500
 Now we have the name of that first man, Bob's Hairpoint can tell you more about it.

15
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:58,900
 The first man, the first American to be turned over to what?

16
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:05,300
 Was Private Carl Sertkausen from Washington Heights, New York.

17
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:09,620
 He suffered from cross-pipe in both seats.

18
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:12,420
 He was with the Third Division when he was captured.

19
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:16,420
 He seems to be in pretty good spirits right now as do most of the other

20
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:19,220
 prisoners who so far been returned.

21
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:23,060
 All together we've gotten in a distance in the health arena,

22
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:29,060
 A number of cities, a couple of Filipinos, a place in the South African and 14 Americans.

23
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:34,060
 I just talked with the recent games, the training, who was handling this first part of the operation,

24
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:37,060
 and he said everything is going very well.

25
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:45,060
 The men are now being processed, and they should be on their way to freedom village in just a few moments.

26
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:50,060
 This is Bob's viewpoint at Hanwan Jump, and now back to the United States.

27
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:56,260
 We repeat that name again for you. The first American prisoner turned over to you and authorities in Korea.

28
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:59,220
 He is private Carl W. Kirchhausen of

29
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:06,940
 214 Audubon Avenue Washington Heights, New York City. Meanwhile the names of 13 more American prisoners in tonight's exchange

30
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:09,660
 are expected to be released at 8 30 p.m.

31
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:18,380
 NBC will broadcast the names of all American prisoners released in the current exchange. Stay tuned your NBC station for the later news.

32
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:23,380
 Henry, Henry, Old Rich, coming mother.

33
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:26,380
 [applause]

34
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:31,380
 Yes, it's the Old Rich family of franchise, written by Clippett Goldsmith.

35
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:34,380
 [music playing]

36
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:50,380
 In every plan, there is always allowed a margin for error.

37
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:54,380
 Also, in any day with a typical teenage boy like Henry Aldrich in it,

38
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:59,380
 there's always a margin for error, or for excitement, or the unexpected.

39
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,380
 The scene opens in the Aldrich living room.

40
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:04,380
 But, Mother, you don't see my point of view.

41
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:08,380
 Henry, that's the trouble. I do see your point of view, but I don't think you're trying to see mine.

42
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:12,380
 Yes, I am sure I am. I've tried very hard to see your point, but geez.

43
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:14,380
 I just can't see it.

44
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:17,540
 Well, in the first place, Eleanor will misunderstand the whole thing.

45
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:19,540
 Why should she misunderstand?

46
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:23,180
 Look, Mother, why don't you try and see it from my point of view?

47
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:27,740
 Henry, I realize you want to give Eleanor something nice for her birthday, but this...

48
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:30,860
 Well, Henry, I still pay your entirely too young.

49
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:32,000
 Too young, Mother?

50
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,820
 You spend $18.5 an hour on that iron?

51
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:36,620
 Don't you see my point of view?

52
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:41,460
 Henry, for the last time, when a young man gives a young lady an extensive piece of jewelry,

53
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:43,900
 it usually carries some meaning with it.

54
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,980
 What meaning you mean she'd be insulted because it isn't gold I

55
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:52,200
 Mean dear. I think you should take it back to the jewelry store where you bought it and get something else

56
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,760
 Mother they haven't anything else in there, but jewelry

57
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:59,460
 That's an electric percolator and don't you think if I gave her a thing like that she's really misunderstand?

58
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:12,820
 My own oh wait a minute

59
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:15,820
 Oh, hello Homer. I didn't recognize you with a hat on.

60
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,820
 She was up and calling you for three blocks.

61
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:20,820
 You mind if I walk along with you? No.

62
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:23,820
 Oh, you hear this is your birthday. Many happy returns.

63
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:26,820
 Thank you, Homer. How did you know about it?

64
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:30,820
 Oh, I get around. I'll even happen to know one of the presents you're going to get.

65
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,820
 You do, Homer? Yeah, but I can't tell you.

66
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:36,820
 Oh, how do you happen to know so much? I got to use. I got to use.

67
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:41,820
 Who's giving it to me? Well, I can't tell you that either. I'm sworn to secrecy.

68
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,220
 Did you know you're two months older than Henry?

69
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,220
 I am.

70
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:47,220
 Yeah, it's not too bad.

71
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,820
 Maybe that's why he's buying you such a swell--

72
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:52,820
 I mean, is it Henry that's giving me something?

73
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,820
 Well, to be frank, yes.

74
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:56,820
 And I don't think it'll be too big for your wrist.

75
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:57,820
 I mean--

76
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:58,820
 But for my wrist?

77
00:04:58,820 --> 00:04:59,820
 She wish.

78
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,820
 You shouldn't have tried to guess the whole thing.

79
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,820
 Oh, I haven't the slightest idea of what it is, though.

80
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:04,820
 Well, sure you have.

81
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,820
 You just said yourself it was a bracelet.

82
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:07,820
 I did?

83
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:08,820
 Sure.

84
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,820
 And I'll bet you even know what kind it is.

85
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:16,900
 It's a silver bracelet and it has a padlock on it the shape of a heart with a key one of those homework

86
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,160
 I saw one in the store just the other day and

87
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:25,980
 Homer Henry is really giving me one of those bracelets. Yeah, but when you open the package be surprised fall right over

88
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:36,700
 Hello hello

89
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:40,900
 Yes, I heard you, Alice, but I still don't see what you're worrying about.

90
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:43,400
 Well, of course you don't, dear. You're a man.

91
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:48,500
 But, Sam, suppose Eleanor is crazy about Henry, and he gives her that very expensive bracelet.

92
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,500
 Well, there's only one thing she can think.

93
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,500
 What?

94
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,700
 Oh, Sam, you're simply being perverse.

95
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:56,600
 Well, I've just been talking with Harriet, and she agrees with me.

96
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:00,400
 Alice, right this minute, I'm busy. Can you call me back in half an hour?

97
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,000
 But what isn't clear about it?

98
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,100
 That isn't what I mean. I'm in a conference right now, and I haven't time to discuss Eleanor Wentworth's birthday.

99
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,700
 Well, very well then, dear, goodbye.

100
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,260
 Goodbye.

101
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:12,260
 Now then, Mr. Roberts, I'm sorry we were interrupted.

102
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:15,260
 Mr. Alberich, what I want granted is a complete right of weight.

103
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:16,460
 I agree.

104
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,060
 But I think they should give you something.

105
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:20,260
 They should give you--

106
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:22,820
 did you ever give a girl a piece of jewelry?

107
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:25,220
 You mean besides my wife?

108
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:26,500
 Well, let me put it this way.

109
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,860
 Have you any children?

110
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:28,700
 No, sir.

111
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,860
 I'm sorry to say we haven't.

112
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:30,980
 What's your problem?

113
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:32,500
 Well, we have a son in high school, see?

114
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,780
 And he's apparently trying to give some girl.

115
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:35,700
 She's a very nice girl.

116
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,960
 I'll say that for him an expensive bracelet.

117
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:38,900
 Yes.

118
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,860
 Diamonds?

119
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:41,700
 Diamond?

120
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,860
 No, I don't think he went as far as diamonds.

121
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,860
 Then it rated cost around $18.

122
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:48,020
 And you feel you all think of us something better?

123
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:50,780
 Oh, no, Mrs. Always feel it's too much.

124
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,940
 That is, and proportion to--

125
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:58,620
 to-- well, now getting back to that right of weight.

126
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,420
 Oh, yes, yes.

127
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,700
 Well, when you draw up the papers, Mr. Alwaysch,

128
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:05,020
 I wanted made clear in the first paragraph

129
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:10,020
 But just what is it that's troubling your wife, Mr. Albridge?

130
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:12,020
 (audience laughs)

131
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:14,020
 Do you think a girl would assume she would engage

132
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,020
 if she received a bracelet?

133
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,020
 Well, why would she?

134
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:18,020
 That's exactly what I told my wife.

135
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,020
 Where do women get these ideas?

136
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:22,020
 But getting back to that right away, Mr. Albridge.

137
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:26,020
 (lively music)

138
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:36,020
 But, Mother, I don't even think you've tried to see my going to be alone.

139
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:39,020
 Eleanor, for the last time, I think you'd be making a great mistake.

140
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:42,020
 But, Mother, Homer says it's just an innocent...

141
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:45,020
 An innocent Facebook with a padlock of shape of a heart,

142
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:47,020
 and I've always had my heart set on fire.

143
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:50,020
 Well, dear, perhaps someday your father, now I'll get you one.

144
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:52,020
 Overcoming from Henrietta, so much more!

145
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:54,020
 That it's just the pulling. Mother, where are you going?

146
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:57,020
 Into the living room and have a talk with your father.

147
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:59,020
 And the piece doesn't all right for me to accept it, may I?

148
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:02,020
 That's a very foolish question, dear, because you know very well

149
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:03,620
 Your father's going to say no.

150
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:05,820
 Betty, I'm going to say no to what?

151
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:08,120
 Bob, do you know what home is told, Eleanor?

152
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,700
 Henry is coming over here this evening

153
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:12,100
 to give her a very expensive silver bracelet.

154
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:12,940
 Yeah?

155
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,580
 Wonder where he got the money.

156
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:17,060
 Do you think that's the main thing for us to worry about?

157
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:19,420
 Don't you realize we have to assume a little responsibility

158
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,500
 in raising our daughter?

159
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,180
 Ah, there's nothing wrong with Eleanor.

160
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:24,740
 And besides, do you realize the front doorbell is ringing?

161
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:25,860
 I'll answer it.

162
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:28,620
 But dear, I can cook three meals a day for this family

163
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,260
 and make all decisions, too.

164
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:33,760
 Elizabeth, don't you think we ought to see the bracelet before we decide any time?

165
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,660
 I do not.

166
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:36,160
 I'll see who's at the door, mother.

167
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:36,860
 I'll see who it is.

168
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,460
 Eleanor, have you been crying?

169
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:39,660
 No, mother.

170
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:41,460
 My goodness, my eyes are just tired.

171
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:43,860
 Here, I think you were making him tired too much of it.

172
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:53,260
 Oh, hello,

173
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,860
 I want to ask you something.

174
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:57,060
 Don't mention the fact that it was on a bracelet, will you?

175
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:57,760
 Why not?

176
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,760
 Well, she wants one and I haven't got the money.

177
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,760
 [audience laughter]

178
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,260
 Say, have you been crying?

179
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:04,260
 C'mon!

180
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,760
 Of course I haven't!

181
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,760
 Oh.

182
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,260
 What is it, Sunburn?

183
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:09,260
 No.

184
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:10,260
 Would you mind going home, Homer?

185
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:11,260
 No?

186
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,260
 Yes, please.

187
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,260
 Get down off this porch.

188
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,260
 I mean, I said something I shouldn't have.

189
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:15,760
 I didn't say you said anything.

190
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,760
 Only can't I be alone if I want to.

191
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:28,760
 [music]

192
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,520
 Who are you going, Henry?

193
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,360
 Henry, can't you tell me where you're going?

194
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,360
 Homer, will you please stop bumping into me?

195
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,360
 She was just shoving me all over the sidewalk.

196
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,440
 All right, Henry, all right.

197
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,760
 If you're not interested.

198
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,000
 I was just going to tell you something

199
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,440
 that died important.

200
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,440
 What about Eleanor?

201
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,040
 But never mind, that's all right.

202
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,800
 What about Eleanor?

203
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,680
 Don't you think she saw it a moody?

204
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,200
 Whoo, Eleanor?

205
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,480
 Listen, Homer, Eleanor has one of the most cheerful

206
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,280
 dispositions of any girl I've ever known.

207
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,720
 Sure, I agree with you.

208
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,080
 Then the next minute she can kick you right off her front porch.

209
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,760
 Listen, Homer, let's have an understanding.

210
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,840
 Right here at this corner. Which way are you turning?

211
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,880
 Which way are you? I'm going right down the street here.

212
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:04,880
 All right, I'll come along.

213
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,040
 Are you going to the Santa Fe jewelry store?

214
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,080
 How do you know I am?

215
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,160
 Well, she always, I just recognized that package.

216
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,320
 - What are you going in there for? - Never mind. Just never mind.

217
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,640
 Are you taking Eleanor's bracelet in to have it engraved?

218
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,840
 Listen, who told you I got her a bracelet?

219
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,120
 I get around, Henry.

220
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:25,920
 Do you know where I could buy one for Agnes for less than $18.5?

221
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,320
 How do you know this one cost about much?

222
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,520
 I get around, hand me.

223
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:32,820
 Listen, where did you get $18.5?

224
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:35,020
 I tried to borrow a quarter from you yesterday.

225
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:37,520
 Homer, for the last time with you, please run along,

226
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,020
 I'm going into this store.

227
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:40,520
 Don't you want me to come in with you?

228
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,520
 No, now go away. Go on away, Homer.

229
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:45,020
 You know, Henry, you're moody in an Eleanor.

230
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:47,520
 And don't hang around outside that window.

231
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,820
 You something I can do for your young man?

232
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,620
 Yes, sir. I want to have a little talk with you.

233
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:52,620
 Yes, sir.

234
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:56,320
 Oh, you're the young fellow who bought that very beautiful silver hand

235
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,660
 I'm robbed of bracelet.

236
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:58,860
 Yes.

237
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,420
 Could we step back here a ways?

238
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:01,480
 I beg your pardon?

239
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:05,020
 Well, I brought this bracelet back because you see.

240
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:06,580
 There's something wrong with it?

241
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:07,900
 Oh no, there's anything wrong with it.

242
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:10,740
 But when I got home, my mother--

243
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,340
 whether she has some bad news for me.

244
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:13,900
 You mean your mother doesn't want you to keep her?

245
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:14,940
 Oh no, no, it isn't back.

246
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,740
 You see, my girl--

247
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:19,260
 you see, well, it's this way.

248
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,340
 Doesn't she like it?

249
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:21,540
 She hasn't even seen it.

250
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,100
 Oh, she's gone away?

251
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,740
 Well, in a way, she has.

252
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:27,140
 Well, that place will be a nice surprise for her.

253
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:28,540
 I'll wrap it up and send it to her.

254
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:30,040
 Oh, no, no. You can't do a thing like that.

255
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,540
 Why not? It's too late.

256
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:33,040
 My mother says the way things are now,

257
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,740
 it wouldn't be right for me to give it to her.

258
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:37,440
 Oh, she's marrying someone else, huh?

259
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,440
 Well, why not give it to her and call it a wedding present?

260
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,740
 A wedding present?

261
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:44,740
 Or how about that percolator up there for three more dollars?

262
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:45,740
 Oh, no.

263
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:48,140
 Oh, I think I'd just like to get my money back.

264
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,340
 Your money back?

265
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:51,940
 Well, before we do anything as rash as all that,

266
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:54,140
 have you seen these ladies ring?

267
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:58,340
 They look just like diamonds, imported precious stones from Denver.

268
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:01,740
 And I challenge you to tell the difference between these and real diamonds.

269
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:03,740
 But wouldn't I just have my money back?

270
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:16,140
 - You have some celery, Ethel? - No, thank you, Gary.

271
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:18,740
 Now, what was it you stopped to tell me about Mr. Aldrich?

272
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:22,740
 Well, I was in his office today, seeing his wife calls and she's all upset.

273
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:28,340
 They've got a boy in high school who wants to give his girls some kind of a piece of jewelry and she didn't think he should.

274
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:30,140
 Then I certainly agree with her.

275
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,240
 You agree with her?

276
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:34,240
 What's wrong with the boy giving his girl a birthday present if he wants to?

277
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,940
 That's because you've never had any children.

278
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:38,440
 What do you mean, I've never had any children? You've never had any either.

279
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,440
 But I'm a woman!

280
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,440
 [laughter]

281
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,840
 And Gary, it isn't necessary for you to point that story at me.

282
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:49,140
 I'm not pointing it at you. I just want to know what's wrong with a kid doing it.

283
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:50,340
 What's wrong with it?

284
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:51,940
 It just isn't done that, though.

285
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:54,440
 Who said so? Past the law that said it isn't done.

286
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:58,840
 Gary, in the first place, any present from a boy means a great deal to a girl, let alone jewelry.

287
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,040
 Why shouldn't it mean anything?

288
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:03,640
 Don't you remember on my 16th birthday when you gave me some handkerchiefs?

289
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,240
 Angerchiefs? What's that got to do with it?

290
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,640
 Well, we got married, didn't we?

291
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,640
 Always. That what did it?

292
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,940
 No, no, no.

293
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:14,440
 Gary, for the last time, stop shaking that sewing in my face.

294
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,040
 Oh, Mary. What do you say, Henry?

295
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,640
 Well, look, could you keep something under your hat and not bother mother about it?

296
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,640
 Didn't you pass on all your subjects this month?

297
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:31,840
 Oh, yeah, sure. But I was downtown just now in this salesman.

298
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,240
 I mean...

299
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:37,440
 How would you like to buy a nice $18.5 bracelet cheap?

300
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,840
 Why Henry, how rich? Where did you get that?

301
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,840
 Mary, don't wave it around where everyone can see it.

302
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:45,240
 Listen, I'll sell it to you for $17.

303
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,040
 I haven't got $17.

304
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,040
 We got $16?

305
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,440
 No. How about $15?

306
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,740
 Henry, I haven't got $15 on broke.

307
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,540
 But she whiz.

308
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:55,040
 Well, look, as long as you can't buy it, Mary.

309
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,000
 Do you see anything against my giving a thing like this

310
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,400
 is a present?

311
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:01,940
 I hadn't read that awfully sweet of you.

312
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:02,840
 Now, wait a minute, Mary.

313
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,640
 Give it back to me.

314
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,940
 I didn't mean--

315
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:08,040
 Mary, I was just asking you a hypothetical question.

316
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,840
 You mean you're taking it back?

317
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,600
 I don't even got $14.

318
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,240
 Mary?

319
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,080
 Yes, mother?

320
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,720
 Will you please come here a minute?

321
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,640
 Why?

322
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,480
 Oh, yes, you're in just a second.

323
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,980
 Mary Holbeast, aren't they?

324
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:22,380
 Henry, I want you to bring that bracelet with you.

325
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:23,780
 The bracelet?

326
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:24,980
 How did you...

327
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:27,180
 Oh, look, Mother, I'm not disobeying you.

328
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:30,480
 I just thought Mary would like to buy it and keep it in the family.

329
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,480
 Dear, I thought you told me you'd return that bracelet.

330
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,680
 Oh, no, Mother. What I told you was I took it back down to the jewelry store.

331
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,480
 But the fella was so nice to me.

332
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,180
 He said he thought I was making a great mistake and not keeping it.

333
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,680
 But did you tell him I said you would have got your money back?

334
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,680
 Oh, yeah, sure.

335
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:48,180
 And he said you probably meant very well, but you didn't know what was going on in the world.

336
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,180
 He said what?

337
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:52,680
 She mother, he said, "Powers give girls presents like this every day in the year."

338
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:58,180
 Henry, I want you to take that bracelet and go downtown to that jewelry store and get your money back at once.

339
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:01,180
 And let them think our whole family doesn't know what's going on anyplace?

340
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:04,180
 I don't care what he thinks. Now, please start.

341
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:05,680
 Yes, mother.

342
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,680
 And as a matter of fact, I think he took advantage of you.

343
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:11,680
 Of me? How could anyone take advantage of me?

344
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,180
 - All right. - Yes, ma'am?

345
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:15,180
 Mrs. Markle was just on the phone.

346
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,680
 Oh, Villy, what did she want?

347
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:21,240
 She said she didn't like to butt in, but she thought she had a solution to some problem we have.

348
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,040
 You mean about the bracelet?

349
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,040
 The bracelet.

350
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,320
 Alice, have you been spreading that all around town?

351
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,160
 Now, Sam.

352
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:30,720
 Mother, Mother, could you consider this from just one other angle?

353
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,560
 Henry, stop.

354
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,720
 Yes, Mother.

355
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:44,840
 Homer, will you give me nine dollars for us?

356
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:47,280
 I have to pay the whole nine dollars in cash in me.

357
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,280
 You mean you want a little time on it?

358
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,180
 Well, she with the stores are closing in an hour home,

359
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:53,180
 and I got to get something for Eleanor for her birthday.

360
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:54,080
 I can't just--

361
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,240
 Well, as a matter of fact, Kim, she

362
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:58,240
 may be pretty disappointed if she doesn't get this bracelet.

363
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,280
 Well, she doesn't know anything about it,

364
00:15:59,280 --> 00:15:59,780
 home.

365
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:01,720
 I haven't so much as mentioned to her.

366
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,920
 No, I know you haven't.

367
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,560
 But I have a hunch.

368
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,840
 I mean, something tells me that this bracelet is what

369
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,920
 she's looking forward to.

370
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:08,520
 Just the same.

371
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,360
 Will you give me $6 for it?

372
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:10,800
 $6?

373
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,520
 I guess it would be crazy about it, Homer.

374
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,000
 I know.

375
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,240
 But you know what the guy at the jewelry store

376
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,840
 told me when I took it back the second time he said there won't be another bracelet

377
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:23,160
 like this one around until crawl even then they may not make them why that isn't

378
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:27,620
 the point Homer he said with any year this bracelet will double in value it will

379
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:30,800
 well sure and then a fagnes gets mad and gives it back to you look at the

380
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,640
 profit you've made

381
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,000
 - Alice? - Yes, sir?

382
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,840
 Did Henry get the bracelet thing settled?

383
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,540
 Yes, dear, apparently he did.

384
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,940
 He said he's going that downtown in just a few minutes

385
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:53,340
 and see whether he can find a nice present for Eleanor for $6.

386
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:56,940
 Yes? I don't know, but what I agree to that part of it,

387
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:59,540
 although I still say the whole thing's a tempest in a teapot.

388
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:03,340
 - Now, Sam... - Alice, all the boys in town are apparently doing it.

389
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:05,040
 Didn't Henry tell you about Homer?

390
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,240
 He's giving Agnes a bracelet exactly like the one

391
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,840
 Henry was going to give Eleanor.

392
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:11,340
 Really? And Homer's folks don't object?

393
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:15,060
 No. Will Brown agreed with me. What's wrong with it?

394
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:17,140
 Well, don't get Henry all upset again.

395
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:20,940
 He's come around to our point of view and taking the whole thing very nicely.

396
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,940
 That's more than his Aunt Harriet did.

397
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:25,740
 It's just what voted she said when she phoned Sam.

398
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:28,860
 She said she'd disgust the whole thing with her bridge clap.

399
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:31,940
 And they all agreed Henry shouldn't give Ellen another bracelet.

400
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:33,500
 Really?

401
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:37,060
 And when I asked if they took a standing vote on it, she hung up.

402
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:40,660
 I bet anything Aunt Harriet called back to say they've taken a vote.

403
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,660
 You better let me take a stand.

404
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:43,940
 Hello?

405
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:44,860
 Hello?

406
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:46,180
 Is this Mrs. Orridge?

407
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:46,780
 Yes?

408
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:48,180
 Mrs. Apple-Robot.

409
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:50,260
 Oh, yes, Mrs. Robert. Hello.

410
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:53,820
 Mrs. Orridge, my husband was down at your husband's office this morning and...

411
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,860
 I know you think it's none of my business.

412
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:59,260
 But Gary and I have just thought of something that may interest you.

413
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:00,500
 Really? What is it?

414
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:04,980
 Well, we have come friends who have a boy and they had exactly the same problem you have.

415
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:09,180
 He wanted to spend every cent he could on a pair of earrings for some girl.

416
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:11,740
 And do you know how his parents went away from it?

417
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:12,740
 Oh.

418
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:14,780
 They sent him on a trip to the Canadian Rockies

419
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:16,780
 and hired a guy who took him into the woods

420
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:19,580
 and he didn't even see a girl for a month.

421
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:20,780
 You don't say so.

422
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:22,900
 And when they came out, he'd gotten all about the girl

423
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,660
 and was crazy about the guy.

424
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:25,660
 Really?

425
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:28,100
 And instead of the hearing, he sent this girl

426
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:31,260
 a lovely dear's head with Adler.

427
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:32,740
 Really?

428
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,980
 Of course you cast him, Henry that saw.

429
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,900
 Vacation hadn't even started.

430
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:41,300
 But many men always define some thick wood near home where we could go and forget.

431
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,300
 Yes.

432
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,300
 Well, thank you very much.

433
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,300
 I was in crime all right.

434
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,300
 And do let me know how everything comes out.

435
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:48,300
 Out of the woods?

436
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:49,300
 Oh, well, I know.

437
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:52,300
 I suppose in one way that's where we all are in this.

438
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,300
 Yes, aren't we?

439
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,300
 Well, good-bye.

440
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,300
 Good-bye.

441
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,300
 What was that, Alice?

442
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:59,300
 Well, somebody else, Sam, worrying about Henry.

443
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:03,300
 Now do you see how this town would have talked if we let him go ahead?

444
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,300
 Goodbye, Mother.

445
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,300
 I'm going downtown to see what I can find.

446
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:06,300
 Oh, just a minute, dear.

447
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,880
 a minute here.

448
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:11,740
 Sam, how much would a nice deer's head cost?

449
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:12,900
 A nice what?

450
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,660
 Well, I don't mean anything fancy.

451
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:16,220
 No antlers.

452
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:17,860
 A deer's head, Morgan?

453
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:19,060
 Yes, Henry.

454
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,660
 You mean one of stone?

455
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:21,820
 No, Sam.

456
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:23,020
 Only stuffed.

457
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:24,980
 Alice, what are you talking about?

458
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,500
 My goodness, if that's somebody else

459
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,020
 trying to tell us how to--

460
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:30,180
 If they can't suggest anything better than a deer's head,

461
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:31,180
 hang up.

462
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:33,060
 [LAUGHTER]

463
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:33,560
 Hello?

464
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,300
 Hello, Mrs. Al, would you tell me there?

465
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,380
 Oh, yes, Homer. He's right here by the phone.

466
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:38,980
 Oh, Dr. Meemaw, but she whizz.

467
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:39,980
 Hello?

468
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,660
 Hello, Henry. My mother says it's all off.

469
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:42,660
 What's that?

470
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:44,300
 When I told her I was going to get back to that place,

471
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:45,580
 but she nearly hit the ceiling.

472
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:48,100
 I want my $6 back.

473
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,700
 Didn't you tell her what I told you to?

474
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,700
 Sure. And she said, "Am I giving back to the fact

475
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,140
 that you have for mine for life?"

476
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:55,500
 Homer, she's faunpy that narrow-minded.

477
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,140
 Look at what you're doing to me.

478
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:58,140
 [LAUGHTER]

479
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,140
 [APPLAUSE]

480
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:00,140
 Thank you so much, Homer.

482
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:02,140

 [applause]

485
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:12,920
 We'll return to the Aldrich family in just a moment.

486
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,580
 Tonight, Thea DeGilles on the air will present

487
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:18,740
 the Petrified Forest by Robert E. Sherwood, starring

488
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:20,300
 Jerome Power.

489
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:23,260
 This is another performance by some of the superb actors

490
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:26,660
 that Thea DeGilles has teamed up with the outstanding plays

491
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:28,460
 of the past and present.

492
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,660
 Of course, no Sunday would be complete without a visit

493
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:32,860
 to those two happy householders,

494
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:35,000
 Phil Harris, now it's safe.

495
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 Then your two regular NBC thrillers,

496
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,500
 Dragnet, Barry Craig,

497
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:42,340
 confidential investigator, come along next.

498
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:45,600
 So for the Pops in Sunday night radio entertainment,

499
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,040
 stay tuned to NBC.

500
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,620
 (lively music)

501
00:20:50,620 --> 00:21:02,620
 [Music]

502
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:05,620
 Now getting back to the troubles of Henry Audrey.

503
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:10,620
 Henry has been trying unsuccessfully to get his money back on a bracelet that he bought for Eleanor,

504
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:14,620
 and that his mother felt was famous, understood as a gift.

505
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:16,620
 The scene opens in Eleanor's living room.

506
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:19,620
 But Mother, I still don't understand your point of view.

507
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:23,620
 Well, I know your father and I were both seven years older than you and Henry before he gave me anything.

508
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:26,620
 And even then, do you know what his first present was?

509
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:27,620
 What?

510
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:30,620
 It was simple and it was in good taste, but it was very nice.

511
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:31,620
 What was it?

512
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:34,620
 Another bound volume of poems by Lord Tennyson.

513
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:35,620
 Lord Tennyson.

514
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:40,620
 With good edge pages and that booklet more than me than anything I've ever owned.

515
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:41,620
 Really?

516
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:45,620
 And on the fly, maybe inscribed so many worlds, so much to do.

517
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:48,620
 So little done such things to be.

518
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:52,620
 But mother, the lock on the bracelet looks just like a padlock.

519
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:54,620
 Homos, you can even open it with a key.

520
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:55,620
 Ellen, haven't you been listening?

521
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:58,620
 Betty, are you still worrying about that bracelet?

522
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:00,620
 Bob, I'm not worrying about it.

523
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:02,620
 I'm simply trying to show her all the way to you.

524
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:05,620
 Now, Betty, why not look at the whole thing this way?

525
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:08,040
 (jazz music)

526
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:20,620
 - I don't think you understand me.

527
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:22,800
 All my friend wants me to do is give you this bracelet

528
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,260
 and get his money back for him.

529
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,180
 - I see.

530
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,740
 - So could I have it please.

531
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:30,660
 - How about this string of genuine jade beads for $10?

532
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:32,420
 - Well I wouldn't be bad.

533
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:34,260
 Would they be classified as jewelry?

534
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:40,940
 Jewelry don't be foolish why would be be classified as jewelry the only thing is he said I should get his money back

535
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:46,420
 He's in a very embarrassing situation. I know all about it. His girl is marrying someone else. Yes

536
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:49,340
 You mean she ever oh

537
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:53,460
 Oh, well gee, it's worse than that what happened she died

538
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:55,940
 die

539
00:22:55,940 --> 00:23:00,100
 Oh, well, yes, sir, and he's gonna get us something else. I mean he wants his money back

540
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:02,620
 He doesn't want to get something nice for himself.

541
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:04,020
 He wants his money back.

542
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:06,100
 And look, I've got a phone this girl right this minute.

543
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,180
 I thought she was there.

544
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:08,540
 She is, but I want to warn her.

545
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:10,060
 I mean, her family.

546
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:12,580
 I don't want a family that she isn't going to get--

547
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:14,860
 I mean, it's very bad news.

548
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:17,020
 How about a pen and pencil set?

549
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:20,540
 Well, Calvin, I made it clear he wants his money back.

550
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:23,260
 Listen, I've got a brother that's got a store off the street.

551
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:25,380
 Now, how would you like to take a look at what he's got?

552
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:28,380
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

553
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:30,960
 (upbeat music)

554
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:38,940
 Eleanor, I don't think it's very nice

555
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:40,900
 if you just saw it on your birthday.

556
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:42,380
 I'm not talking, mother.

557
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:44,060
 I just don't feel like talking to anybody.

558
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:46,460
 Betty, what were all those phone calls

559
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:48,460
 you've been taking for the last couple of hours?

560
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:50,420
 Thankfully, Bob, they were all friends of ours.

561
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:52,380
 Why do you know if we were really going to let Eleanor

562
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:54,140
 accept that bracelet? (gasps)

563
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:54,980
 Oh, my goodness!

564
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:55,820
 Now, Eleanor!

565
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:57,660
 The girl's right, it's nobody's business but ours.

566
00:23:57,660 --> 00:24:00,700
 As a matter of fact, I think it shows a very healthy interest.

567
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:03,460
 And incidentally, Agnes Lawson's mother calls.

568
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:08,460
 Why? They heard this afternoon somehow that Homer's planning to give Agnes an expensive bracelet too.

569
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:09,860
 What stand are they taking?

570
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:13,260
 What to tell the truth, Bob? The Lawson family is split wide open.

571
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:15,760
 Which are they against? The bracelet or Homer?

572
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:20,060
 Oh my goodness, that won't be heavy right now.

573
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:22,960
 Now remember, Eleanor, about everything else you are a lady.

574
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,860
 Mother, won't you please change your mind.

575
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:25,860
 Now be here.

576
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,560
 Eleanor, don't run to the door.

577
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,960
 Walk like a lady.

578
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,560
 I'm walking, Father.

579
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,640
 Hi, Eleanor.

580
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,280
 I'm a many happy return to the day.

581
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,720
 Thank you, Henry.

582
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,840
 Who wants to come in?

583
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,360
 OK.

584
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,880
 Hi.

585
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,880
 Are your folks home?

586
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,480
 Yeah.

587
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,560
 Mother and Father just went out into the kitchen.

588
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,280
 Shall we go in the living room?

589
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,640
 All right.

590
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,480
 I've got a little present here for you.

591
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,680
 For me, Henry?

592
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,400
 The only thing is, before I give it to you,

593
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,440
 I want to tell you something.

594
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,720
 Well, Henry, first before you tell me anything,

595
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:59,080
 I feel I ought to say something to you.

596
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,320
 You do? What about?

597
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,320
 About that present you have there.

598
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:07,520
 Henry, frankly, it was awfully sweet of you to get in your bracelet.

599
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,520
 I mean...

600
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,720
 Well, look, Eleanor, do you mind if I tell you something?

601
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,120
 Because here's the way everybody feels about it.

602
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,520
 Eleanor, yes, Mother.

603
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,320
 Will you step on here to the front hall, please?

604
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,720
 Yes, Mother. Only I think you're on never-sarily worried

605
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,720
 because I gave you my words.

606
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,920
 Excuse me, Henry.

607
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,520
 Sure.

608
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,320
 Eleanor, I haven't accused you of anything.

609
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,820
 I simply want to speak to you.

610
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:27,020
 What about, Mother?

611
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:28,360
 Your father and I have just been talking

612
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,120
 with Agnes Lawson's mother again.

613
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,360
 Since she, your parents,

614
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,360
 raise random and Agnes,

615
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:34,560
 accept her bracelet from Homer.

616
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:37,260
 I guess we'll have to let you keep Henry.

617
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:38,400
 Oh, Mother!

618
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,860
 But you explained that it isn't

619
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:41,100
 a single thing,

620
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:43,100
 that at best it's only a birthday present.

621
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:44,240
 Oh, yes, Mother!

622
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,640
 You understand the circumstance.

623
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,640
 Oh, yes, Mother!

624
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,000
 Of course I do.

625
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:48,840
 Oh, Henry!

626
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,240
 Yes, O'Nore.

627
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,140
 Thank you, Mother.

628
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:52,140
 Thank you, very much.

629
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:53,180
 Don't beg me.

630
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:56,180
 I'm awfully sorry to keep you waiting like this.

631
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:59,180
 Henry, what was it you were going to say about that present you have?

632
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:02,180
 I'll tell you. Why don't we just wait?

633
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:04,180
 Oh, we don't have to do a thing like that. Henry?

634
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:07,180
 Well, Henry, sometimes when a boy gives a girl something,

635
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:10,180
 it's completely misunderstood. You know what I mean?

636
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:14,180
 It is. But it's a girl that's sensible and realizes that it's just a present.

637
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:16,180
 Well, without any special transmit connection.

638
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:20,180
 Just the same element. I think... No, no, I don't think I better give you this.

639
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:21,180
 I better give you this.

640
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:24,180
 I know you're excuse me, I've got to make you give that to me.

641
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:26,180
 You mean you're going to take it away from me?

642
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:28,180
 Henry, I can hardly wait to open it.

643
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:29,180
 I don't think you're going to like it though.

644
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:31,180
 Oh yes I am.

645
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:32,180
 And I know what you've done.

646
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:35,180
 You put it in this big box of booming.

647
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:37,180
 But that was already in the bracelet.

648
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:40,180
 It isn't.

649
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:44,180
 You mean it couldn't possibly be a bracelet?

650
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:46,180
 Nope.

651
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:47,180
 You want to give it back?

652
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:48,180
 No.

653
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:50,940
 My goodness, if the girl was sensible about what a person gives,

654
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:52,140
 it really doesn't make any difference.

655
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:53,440
 What it is, only...

656
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,440
 I don't understand how I've done this thing.

657
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,180
 You can go ahead and open it, if you'd like.

658
00:26:58,180 --> 00:26:59,680
 All right.

659
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,680
 My goodness, what is it?

660
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,180
 It's a...

661
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:05,180
 It's a book.

662
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:06,180
 A book?

663
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:07,680
 Well, isn't that nice?

664
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,680
 It's leather.

665
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,680
 Leather.

666
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,180
 Oh, hang it.

667
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:13,680
 It's "Tannison."

668
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,680
 The poems of Lord Tennyson.

669
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:18,640
 Sure. The bookstore was the only store still open.

670
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,940
 Oh, Henry. Of all the things you could have given me.

671
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:27,040
 Anything else? Well, it would have just been another present, but...

672
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:31,760
 Lord, Tennyson, do you know what happened to my mother?

673
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,020
 You like it?

674
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,200
 You mean you really like it?

675
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:39,720
 Henry, as long as I live, it's going to mean more to me than anything I own.

676
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,840
 Would you like something on the fly, please?

677
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,200
 Sure. Oh, my handwriting isn't very good.

678
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,360
 Oh, that part is important.

679
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,600
 Just take your fountain can and write.

680
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,760
 Don't worry, so much to do.

681
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:53,040
 So little done, such things to be.

682
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:57,400

 Mr. and Mrs. Aldrich are house Jameson and Barbara Robin.
