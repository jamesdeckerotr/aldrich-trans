1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 Now it's the Aldrich family on NBC.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 [MUSIC]

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 Henry Aldrich, coming mother.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 [APPLAUSE]

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 Yes, it's the Aldrich family, it's transcribed, written by Clifford Goldsmith.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 [Music]

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 The wonderful thing about the teenage time of your life

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 is the fact that you can experience it twice.

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 Once in your own growing up, and more or less continually thereafter,

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 the misadventures of your own are your neighbors Henry Aldridge.

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,300
 The scene opens in the Aldridge living room. The time this evening.

12
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:02,300
 Sam, I don't think you're looking at this from Henry's point of view.

13
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:03,800
 You're quite right, I'm not.

14
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:07,200
 I'm looking at it from Mr. McCalls or whatever his name is point of view.

15
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,100
 And if you'll remember Alice, I'd buy it, Henry, in the first place not to take that job,

16
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,800
 unless he was sure he could stick to it.

17
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,600
 Well, dear, that's the whole point.

18
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,700
 Henry isn't working tonight because he isn't supposed to work.

19
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,600
 He's taking yellow note of the spring dance of the country club.

20
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,000
 Yeah? Only what's all the fuss about.

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,720
 Well, there isn't any fuss.

22
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,720
 Mr. McCall, down at the drugstore, phoned a few minutes ago and wanted to know where the bicycle is.

23
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:30,800
 A what?

24
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,680
 The bicycle Henry delivers packages on.

25
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,920
 You mean he's lost it?

26
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,320
 No, no, Sam. Of course he hasn't.

27
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,680
 The bicycle is right out on the front porch.

28
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,840
 Well, what's wrong with that?

29
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,400
 Well, nothing to hear.

30
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,040
 Except that Henry didn't understand that he was to return it tonight.

31
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:50,480
 And don't you think Mr. McCall could be reasonable and let him bring it back tomorrow?

32
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:53,280
 Because there isn't any other way to get it back.

33
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,880
 Is there?

34
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,680
 Alice, you...

35
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:03,520
 You want by any chance leading up to the suggestion that I take the bicycle back, are you?

36
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,520
 Why, dear, that hadn't even ended my head.

37
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,720
 Would you want to?

38
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,400
 I would not.

39
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,160
 Can Alice, if his employer wants that bicycle, Henry should take it to him no matter how far it is?

40
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:21,240
 But, dear, do you think his employer realizes that Henry is only young once?

41
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:25,240
 And that this is one of the most important dances the club is having all season?

42
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,440
 No, I don't imagine he does.

43
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,840
 Do you?

44
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,340
 Do I want?

45
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:33,840
 Yes, I realize a boy is young only once,

46
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,640
 and a man reaches my age only once.

47
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,640
 And I'm going to sit in this chair and read this paper and not deliver any bicycle.

48
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,040
 Mother, Mother, are you supposed to fix my necktie, please?

49
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,040
 No, Henry.

50
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,440
 Sit down on the arm of this chair while I straighten it.

51
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,440
 Okay.

52
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,140
 Did I just hear you and Father talking about Mr. McCall's bicycle?

53
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:52,140
 You did.

54
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,840
 Well, look, Father, be sure to remember this.

55
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,440
 When you first push back on the break, your feet will go all the way around once, but the second time around you'll stop.

56
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:02,040
 [laughter]

57
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,240
 At least you'll usually stop.

58
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,240
 I won't stop at all.

59
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,240
 You won't?

60
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,440
 You mean Mother didn't have a chance to explain things to you?

61
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:14,740
 Henry, if I gave you the impression that I was going to ask your father to take that bicycle back for you,

62
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:17,380
 I'm afraid you misunderstood me.

63
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:19,820
 I'm going to ask Mary to do it.

64
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:20,700
 Mary?

65
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,820
 Mary isn't even here.

66
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:22,460
 Well, she will be.

67
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:23,740
 She'll be back any minute.

68
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:24,380
 Why, you sure?

69
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:27,180
 Because I feel very responsible for that bicycle.

70
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,100
 And onor.

71
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:28,820
 And the dance.

72
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,660
 Well, you haven't one thing to worry about.

73
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:32,460
 Now, you run upstairs and put your coat on.

74
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:33,260
 Yes, mother.

75
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:33,760
 Sure.

76
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,820
 Thanks very much.

77
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:35,980
 Oh, Sam, did you see that?

78
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:36,900
 Did I see what?

79
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,460
 How can't she and you see his?

80
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:41,180
 Well, he wouldn't even put his coat on until I assured him

81
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:43,260
 that Mary would take care of the bicycle.

82
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:46,620
 Alright, Alice, just so Mr. McCall gets it back tonight.

83
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:49,420
 You, Sam, you talk as though returning a bicycle

84
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:51,320
 with the most awful problem in the world.

85
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,720
 Mother!

86
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,360
 Oh, yes, Mary, I'm coming.

87
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,300
 My goodness, Mother, look at what I've just done

88
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:58,220
 to my brand-new stockings.

89
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:00,100
 Mary Orridge, how did you do that?

90
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:03,180
 I'm that old bicycle out on the front porch.

91
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:05,260
 And, Mother, I was planning to wear these stockings

92
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:07,260
 to the dance tonight.

93
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:10,260
 Well, Mary, you didn't tell me you were going to the dance.

94
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,380
 Well, Mother, don't you remember?

95
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:13,100
 I told you at breakfast this morning,

96
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,180
 and I'm late as it is.

97
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,020
 - Well, you mean you haven't timed two?

98
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:17,860
 - Two.

99
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:19,180
 - I haven't timed two what?

100
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:21,820
 - Nothing, dear.

101
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:25,420
 You're only young once, go on up and get your clothes changed.

102
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:27,180
 I've gotta put in a phone call.

103
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:28,380
 - Number please.

104
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,740
 - Elm 232.

105
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,860
 - Elm 232.

106
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,340
 - Mother, don't you think it'd be all right

107
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:36,340
 if I tell Henry he has to pay for these stockings?

108
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:38,700
 - Mary, Henry only earns 50 cents

109
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,660
 for a whole afternoon's work

110
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:43,020
 and those stockings cause 98.

111
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:45,420
 No, Mother, they cost a dollar fifteen.

112
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:48,220
 Well, that makes it worse, aren't you, shame?

113
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:49,820
 Hello, Mrs. Brown speaking.

114
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,420
 Oh, hello, Elizabeth. This is Alice.

115
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:52,520
 Is Homer there?

116
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,120
 Why, just a minute, Alice.

117
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,620
 Homer, you're one of the kind of phones.

118
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:59,120
 Alice, why is it only way down, I want to ask you.

119
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,020
 Did you know about the Alice's party?

120
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,920
 The Alice's? Are they giving a party?

121
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:06,120
 Yes, dear. I understand they've invited scads of people.

122
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,220
 Really? When is it?

123
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:08,320
 It's tonight.

124
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,820
 Tonight, Elizabeth?

125
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:10,920
 Well, aren't you invited?

126
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,420
 No.

127
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:14,220
 You mean you want either?

128
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,620
 Well, no.

129
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,220
 No.

130
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,920
 Well, I guess you and I just aren't included.

131
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,420
 Well, isn't that terrible?

132
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,320
 I'm not surprised about myself, Alice,

133
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,720
 but after all, you'll be entertained, the Alice.

134
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,820
 Well, that's the way things are, Elizabeth.

135
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:28,720
 You never know.

136
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,720
 Oh, just a minute, Alice.

137
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,520
 Here's Homer.

138
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,820
 Hello.

139
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:33,720
 Why can't you say hello, Mrs. Orange?

140
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,320
 I didn't know it was Mrs. Orbridge.

141
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,120
 Hello, Mrs. Orbridge.

142
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,120
 Hello, dear.

143
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,520
 Mother, could you be lacing my shoes?

144
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,320
 How are you, Mrs. Orbridge?

145
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,280
 Homer, how would you like to earn a little money?

146
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,280
 Some money? Boy.

147
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,680
 Well, it won't be very much, but it'll probably come in very handy.

148
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:53,080
 Okay, sure. When do you want me tomorrow morning?

149
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,360
 No, dear, tonight.

150
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,360
 Tonight?

151
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,600
 Yes, dear. You can do the whole thing tonight.

152
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,360
 Well, I'm not working tonight, Mrs. Orla.

153
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,520
 Do you want me to act in the country club?

154
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,520
 You're going to the dance?

155
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,800
 Well, are you sure you wouldn't like to do just one little errand?

156
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,440
 Oh, do you know I've got to save myself to dance?

157
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:14,440
 Well, I suppose you're only young once.

158
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,440
 What's that?

159
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,440
 Nothing, Homer.

160
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,440
 Goodbye, dear.

161
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,440
 Mother!

162
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,440
 Oh, come here, Henry.

163
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,440
 I'm afraid I have something I have to tell you.

164
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,440
 You have, Mother?

165
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,440
 Boy, how do I look?

166
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,440
 How do you like my hair this way, huh?

167
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,440
 Henry.

168
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,440
 I can't begin to tell you how much I appreciate you're fixing things up for me.

169
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,440
 Are you sure, Mary?

170
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,440
 I'll be back in time.

171
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,440
 Mary's already back.

172
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,440
 The only thing is...

173
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:35,440
 Boy, Mother, there isn't another guy in this town who has a mother that...

174
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,440
 You know what I mean?

175
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,440
 Henry, you don't have to hug me quite so tight.

176
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,440
 Oh.

177
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,440
 What was it you wanted to say to me?

178
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,440
 Why...

179
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,440
 Nothing, dear.

180
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,440
 You go right on and have a good time.

181
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,440
 Okay, good night, mother.

182
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,440
 Good night, and don't stay out late!

183
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,440
 Okay, and you explain to me how responsible I feel about that bicycle.

184
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:07,440
 Well, hello there, Mrs. Aldrich.

185
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,040
 Don't tell me you're out wheeling a baby this time of night.

186
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,540
 Good evening Mrs. Hooper.

187
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,140
 No, this is a bicycle.

188
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,140
 A what?

189
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,640
 A delivery bicycle.

190
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,940
 It has a sidecar.

191
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,440
 Oh, yes.

192
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,240
 Well, I recognize your face, but I couldn't place the sidecar.

193
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:26,240
 [LAUGHTER]

194
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,740
 I'm just bringing it over here to Mr. McCall's drugstore.

195
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,740
 It was very good exercise.

196
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:35,840
 Yeah, something I can do for you, madam.

197
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,040
 - Why, yes. Are you Mr. McCall? - Yes, ma'am.

198
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:42,640
 - Well, I've just returned your bicycle for Henry Aldrich. - Oh, yes.

199
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,840
 Well, where is Henry? I got a couple packages for him to deliver.

200
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,840
 Tonight? Well, I didn't know he was supposed to...

201
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:53,440
 Why did you think I wanted the bicycle? I understood the boy was responsible.

202
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,640
 Mr. McCall, let me make one thing clear.

203
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:58,640
 Henry feels most responsible about his work here.

204
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:03,040
 Yeah. All right. Can you get him on the phone and tell him to come down here?

205
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,540
 I'm sorry, but he left the house before I did.

206
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:07,040
 Yeah, you assist him.

207
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,040
 The sister? Why, I'm his...

208
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,040
 Do I really?

209
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:15,040
 Yeah, look, I've got a new story here.

210
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:18,040
 And I am trying my best to please my customers.

211
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:21,040
 A couple orders come in and I promise them and then your brother lets me down.

212
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,040
 Now, what am I going to do?

213
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:26,040
 Well, Henry's going to be put in the position of...

214
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:29,040
 You mean I really look like...

215
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:32,040
 Where did the packages go?

216
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:35,040
 You mean you take them out for me?

217
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,040
 Well, I'll...

218
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:40,040
 There's a dollar forty-two on this ice cream and ninety cents on this cough, man.

219
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:43,040
 And look out for the break on the bicycle.

220
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:46,040
 The bicycle? Oh, you don't mean I have to ride it?

221
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,040
 Do you?

222
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,040
 Ladies, you realize how far you have to take those packages?

223
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:53,040
 Oh, my goodness!

224
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,040
 Hello, McCall's Pharmacy.

225
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:00,040
 This is Mrs. Allison. May I ask about my ice cream?

226
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:08,040
 This is who Mrs. Allison over on North Street and I have a whole dining room full of gas waiting for that ice cream you promised to send over.

227
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:12,040
 Yeah, oh yes Mrs. Allison the girl just left with it.

228
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:24,040
 Gee, I don't know if this sure is a swell dance.

229
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,040
 Boy am I having a good time.

230
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:29,040
 So am I Henry. I never had a better time in my life.

231
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,040
 - Hi Eleanor. - Hello Homer.

232
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,720
 Can I have the next dance with you?

233
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,120
 Oh I'm sorry, Homer, but I promised it to Henry.

234
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,360
 You have? Boy, am I having a bum time?

235
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,400
 - What's the matter, Homer? - Agnes, Agnes.

236
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,920
 You know what she did? She was so anxious to get here,

237
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:46,040
 she ran out of her front door and rolled right down the steps.

238
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:50,000
 So she had to go back and change her clothes all over again.

239
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,040
 - Really? - I'll see you later, Homer.

240
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:56,960
 - Hello, Mary. - Mary? My sister?

241
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,540
 Yes, there she is.

242
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,540
 Was she coming here?

243
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:00,540
 Hello, Eleanor.

244
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:02,240
 Oh, Mary, do you have any trouble with that break?

245
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,040
 Well, what break?

246
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,820
 Well, didn't you notice how your foot flips off the pedal

247
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,340
 the first time?

248
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:07,540
 My foot what?

249
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,440
 Mary, don't you know the bicycle?

250
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,040
 I certainly do know about it.

251
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,040
 I tripped right over it.

252
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,740
 And you owe me a brand new pair of stalking.

253
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:15,540
 I do?

254
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,740
 Just for taking it back to Mr. McCall?

255
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:18,840
 For taking what back?

256
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,440
 The bicycle.

257
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,140
 The bicycle.

258
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,040
 Didn't mother tell you?

259
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,040
 She didn't even mention it, Henry.

260
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,240
 Oh, boy.

261
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,540
 Henry, where are you going?

262
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:27,540
 I'll be right back, Eleanor.

263
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,880
 Just as soon as I get something straight now.

264
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,300
 Homer, hey Homer.

265
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,140
 - What, Henry?

266
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:33,860
 - As long as you're waiting around for Agnes.

267
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:36,100
 How would you like to earn 50 cents?

268
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:38,680
 (upbeat music)

269
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:47,520
 - Alice.

270
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,380
 Alice, are you upstairs?

271
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:51,820
 (phone ringing)

272
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:52,660
 Alice.

273
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,420
 Hello, Sam always speaking.

274
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:58,320
 Sam, this is Alice.

275
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,420
 What's that Alice? When did you leave the house?

276
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:03,220
 Why, you're quite a while ago, dear.

277
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:06,220
 And dear, I hate to bother you when I know you're reading your papers,

278
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:09,020
 but I'm afraid you'll have to come over and get me.

279
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:09,820
 Get you?

280
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:13,120
 Yes, I have a flat tire.

281
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,520
 You mean you took the car?

282
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,620
 Oh, no, dear. I am.

283
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,220
 Well, I took...

284
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,020
 Well...

285
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:19,820
 You what?

286
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,820
 And nothing, Sam. Just forget it.

287
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:22,920
 Goodbye, dear.

288
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,920
 Dennis, what are you talking about?

289
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,920
 Alice, where are you?

290
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:38,920
 Hello, can you hear me, Mother?

291
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:43,920
 Yes, Humma, and I'm sorry, but your father says he absolutely won't help you out.

292
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,920
 But Mother doesn't he understand what's happened?

293
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:50,920
 Henry gave me 50 cents, provided I go over to his house and get a delivery bicycle he has

294
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,120
 and take it to McCall's drug store, see?

295
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:53,960
 - Yes.

296
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,480
 - And just after I took the 50 cents

297
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,720
 and bought some punch with it,

298
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,360
 who do you think showed up?

299
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,200
 - Who?

300
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,160
 - Agnes with a different dress on.

301
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:04,200
 And before she'd even dash, she had to have some punch.

302
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,440
 Boy, she went right through 20 cents.

303
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,360
 (audience laughs)

304
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,560
 And I wondered where the father

305
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,840
 wouldn't be willing to deliver that bicycle for me.

306
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,400
 Provided I'd give him part of next week's allowance.

307
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,760
 - You're afraid Agnes will be hurt if you leave.

308
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,680
 - Well sure, wouldn't you be?

309
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,440
 - Well, do you know, I'll have a talk with your father.

310
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,740
 Only he has his shoes off and you know what that means.

311
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,740
 But mother, you know how to handle him.

312
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:27,180
 She was all you have to do is talk to him the way you do

313
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,180
 and you can get him into his shoes.

314
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:30,180
 [LAUGHTER]

315
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:31,620
 Don't worry.

316
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,300
 You go on when you're dancing.

317
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,300
 After all, you're only young one.

318
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,300
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

319
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:48,860
 Get over on your own side of the street.

320
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:52,540
 Suppose you get over on your side, you big...

321
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:57,180
 Alice, oh, could you set you on that machine?

322
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,180
 Harriet!

323
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:58,940
 Aah!

324
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:00,220
 Look out, I'll run over you.

325
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:02,180
 What's the matter, can't you stop?

326
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:04,700
 Not the first time I back up my seat!

327
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:09,300
 There.

328
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,940
 Now help me off.

329
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:14,580
 Alice, Colbridge, may I ask what you're doing?

330
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:16,540
 Harriet, you're just the person I want to see.

331
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:20,040
 Could you take this package of ice cream into the Allison's house here?

332
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,740
 What are you doing?

333
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:23,320
 Delivering packages.

334
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,640
 Packages?

335
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,740
 For the poor?

336
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,940
 Harriet.

337
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:33,040
 The Allysons are giving a party in there, and I have got their ice cream, and I haven't been invited.

338
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:33,840
 And...

339
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,740
 Well, so you'll just have to take it in for me.

340
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:38,740
 But, Allison, I'm late for a bridge party over at the Anderson's.

341
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:40,340
 But don't you understand?

342
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:42,940
 Dress the way I am. I can't go into the Allysons.

343
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:46,640
 Frankly, you're the canines and only think I'm trying to crash their party.

344
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:53,340
 Now, Harriet, do you remember on your 13th birthday when you were too bashful to ask Bill Townsend to your party

345
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:58,940
 and I did it for you and you swore you'd do anything in the world for me any time I asked you?

346
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:00,240
 No.

347
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,240
 Harriet, you did not?

348
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,640
 Well, anyway, you're going right over by Maple Street.

349
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:08,640
 Could you at least leave this bottle of course here at the 227?

350
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,940
 Who is it important?

351
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:10,940
 It's very important.

352
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:13,500
 And you see, Mr. McCall just started a new drugstore,

353
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,340
 and Henry's trying to help him out.

354
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:16,940
 Well, all right.

355
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,860
 And Alice, if you don't want to see the Alice's,

356
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:21,260
 why don't you just leave the ice cream on the front porch,

357
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,580
 ring the bell, and run?

358
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:24,860
 Because there's $1.40 on it.

359
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:27,900
 Oh, and there's $0.90 on the coalf syrup.

360
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:30,220
 And don't lose it in the bridge game.

362
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:36,240
 (upbeat music)

363
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:46,500
 - Hello, my car's pharmacy.

364
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:49,320
 - Oh, lady, I sent that call, sir,

365
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,780
 about nearly 40 minutes ago.

366
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:52,720
 I've got a new delivery girl, see?

367
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,080
 And she is.

368
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,440
 - What?

369
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,760
 What's that?

370
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:59,400
 - Oh, yes, well, when the girl gets there,

371
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,680
 you give her the other bottle you want refill,

372
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,940
 and tell her to bring it back here.

373
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:04,880
 (laughs)

374
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,040
 Forget it, no trouble at all.

375
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,380
 Come by.

376
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:09,220
 - Good evening.

377
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:10,880
 - Yo, hey, hey, yes, good evening,

378
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,080
 something I can do for you.

379
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,980
 - Well, could you tell me,

380
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,180
 have you seen my wife this evening?

381
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:17,520
 - Your wife.

382
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,920
 - Isn't this where Henry Aldrich works?

383
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,320
 - This is where he's supposed to work.

384
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,300
 - Well, what I mean is,

385
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:25,800
 did my wife bring a bicycle down here?

386
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,200
 - Oh, you, Henry's brother-in-law, how do you do?

387
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,600
 (audience laughs)

388
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,440
 - I beg your pardon?

389
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:33,000
 I don't want to complain about your wife, sir,

390
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,840
 but I sent her out with some packages nearly an hour ago.

391
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,560
 Some packages?

392
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,400
 And I've got some more for her to take out,

393
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,360
 and she hasn't come back yet.

394
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,600
 You mean, Alice, by wife?

395
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,160
 And what I want to know is what you're

396
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,760
 going to do about it.

397
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,240
 What I'm going to do about it--

398
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,680
 I thought your family was the kind that could be relied on.

399
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,480
 We are the kind that can be relied on.

400
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,000
 That's why we're helping you out.

401
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,080
 What do you mean by we?

402
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,520
 I haven't seen you do anything yet.

403
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,200
 What, sir?

404
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,600
 Listen, I'm going out and delivering

405
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,940
 a couple of these orders myself.

406
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,680
 You stay here and take care of the store.

407
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:03,520
 - What's that?

408
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,880
 - And if there's anything you can't find just that.

409
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,340
 - That's, that's cool.

410
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:10,920
 (upbeat music)

411
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:19,840
 - Eleanor, do you mind if I suggest something?

412
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:20,680
 - What Henry?

413
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,440
 - Well let's hit this next dance out.

414
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,280
 - All right.

415
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,120
 - As a matter of fact,

416
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,320
 let's go out in the porch and get some air.

417
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,160
 - All right.

418
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,320
 - Boy, do I feel good.

419
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:32,480
 Ever since I got home we're lined up to take that bicycle back for me.

420
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,560
 It just goes to show.

421
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,800
 What goes to show?

422
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,040
 I mean, you've got a job, see, and you're conscientious about it.

423
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:40,800
 It pays.

424
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,120
 Now I was just talking to Mr. Scott a few minutes ago

425
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,560
 and he asked me whether I wouldn't like a job working for him.

426
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,520
 Really?

427
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,720
 Provided I can give him some good references.

428
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,440
 Gee, I wouldn't hesitate a minute,

429
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,120
 ask you Mr. McCall for one.

430
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,320
 Henry, isn't that Agnes Lawson?

431
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,000
 Where?

432
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,800
 At the end of the porch there in the moonlight.

433
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,520
 You know who you suppose that boy is.

434
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,180
 Hey, let's walk down and see.

435
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:03,360
 Wait until I tell Homer.

436
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,120
 Just wait until I tell Homer.

437
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,920
 Now listen, Hannah, you keep away from here.

438
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,920
 Homer, is that you?

439
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,600
 Come on, Max.

440
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,680
 Let's get away from her.

441
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,840
 Yeah, but then Homer, how about my bicycle?

442
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:16,640
 And don't you realize my whole reputation's at stake?

 Tonight, Theatre Guild on the air

448
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:37,640
 raises the curtain again on another fine dramatic presentation.

449
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:42,640
 George Orwell's 1984 starring Richard Whitmark.

450
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,640
 This is another performance by some of the superb actors

451
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:49,640
 Theatre Guild has teamed up with the outstanding plays of the past and present.

452
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:56,640
 Of course, no Sunday would be complete without a visit to those two happy householders, Phil Harris and Alice Fay.

453
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:04,640
 This curly-headed wonder of the airwaves can usually get himself involved in something that requires Alice's talented hand to unravel.

454
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:12,640
 And then your two regular NBC thrillers, Dragnet and Barry Craig, confidential investigator, come along next.

455
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:17,640
 Barry, played by William Gargon, clears up a real thrilling mystery.

456
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:24,640
 While Dragnet with Jack Webb as Sergeant Joe Friday offers another case history from the files of the Los Angeles police.

 Now getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldridge.

460
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,640
 Because she's decided her son is young only once,

461
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,640
 Mrs. Aldridge has consented to run an errand for Henry

462
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,640
 in order that he may go to the country club dance.

463
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,140
 The scene opens in the Aldrich front hall.

464
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:04,340
 Homer Brown's father is on the phone.

 Elizabeth, this is Will.

00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,640
 Who?

 Will, your husband.

470
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,140
 I can't find that bicycle of Henry's.

471
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:15,640
 Oh, did you look all over there, your aunt?

472
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:19,140
 I walked into every tree out there and there's still no sign of it.

473
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:21,140
 Well, where are you now?

474
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:22,640
 I'm in the Aldrich front hall.

475
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,140
 And Elizabeth, I'm in my house slippers and I'm standing in water.

476
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,140
 In water?

477
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:31,140
 Well, I can't be responsible if they aren't more careful where they put their faces of flowers.

 Well, me, you just got to find that bicycle.

480
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:39,140
 Always says Henry was very much concerned about it being taken back.

481
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:43,140
 And he won't enjoy the dance one bit if he knows who fallen down on him.

482
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,140
 Well, I'll give him ten more minutes, and then I quit. Goodbye.

00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:46,140

 - And what was this you, Father? - Homer, where are you?

494
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:02,340
 - This isn't Homer, it's Henry. - Oh, it is. Well, there's Mr. Brown.

00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:05,940
 Mr. Brown, she was hot. I get the wrong number. Goodbye, Father.

00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:24,740
 Excuse me, but could you give me some information?

00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:26,140
 What is it you'd like to know, lady?

500
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:30,240
 Well, have you any idea where number 227 Maple Street would be?

501
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,440
 Let's see now. Isn't it this house right here?

502
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:35,540
 No, I was just in there and they haven't had a cold all year.

503
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:36,640
 What's that?

504
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:42,740
 227 Maple Street ordered this cough syrup and I'd like to get rid of it so I can go to a bridge party.

505
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:43,940
 How about the house next door?

506
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:47,840
 Oh, I tried that one too. They said they don't think there is any 227.

507
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,240
 Let's see the address on your pack.

508
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,240
 Here you are.

509
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,140
 That's 227, all right.

510
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,840
 Or 277.

511
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,440
 - Is what? - And that certainly says maple.

512
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,480
 Or is it marble?

513
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,040
 Marble Street!

514
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:01,640
 Don't get discouraged, lady. You're on the right track.

515
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:13,720
 Now then, I'm sorry to keep you waiting, lady.

516
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,280
 Is there something I can do for you?

517
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,720
 Yes, sir. I'd like a chocolate swab.

518
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:22,040
 A chocolate swab?

519
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,280
 - Prostance. - Oh.

520
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,800
 That's something to drink, isn't it?

521
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:29,440
 - Certainly is. It's made with chocolate syrup, milk, and ice cream.

522
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:33,400
 - Yes, and that's all? - Yes, and then you put in that mixer.

523
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,240
 - Here's what that sounds easy, enough.

524
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,800
 Now then, lady, we'll get a glass.

525
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:41,560
 Ah, here we are. - Oh, isn't that a Sunday dish?

526
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:44,800
 - Oh, I see. You want a big drink? - That's right.

00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:48,480
 - Well, now, here, how's this size?

528
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,120
 - Oh, my goodness. Do I get one that thick?

529
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,880
 I think this is a drinking glass.

530
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,120
 Couldn't be just an ornament, good, eh?

531
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,600
 [LAUGHTER]

532
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,520
 Now then, let's see.

533
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:01,080
 I guess the logical thing would be to start with the chocolate.

534
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,880
 Chocolate.

535
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,040
 Chocolate.

536
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,600
 You would miss it in strawberry, would you?

537
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,160
 No, I don't.

538
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,120
 I got strawberry right here.

539
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,520
 A lemon?

540
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,880
 That's parilla.

541
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,880
 Maybe they keep the chocolate in one of these bowls.

542
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:18,200
 No, that's the cherries.

543
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,080
 Don't you like to have me throw a cherry in?

544
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,640
 No, thank you. How about that other bowl?

545
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,540
 This one?

546
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:26,000
 Yes, that's a good one.

547
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,320
 Well, I never saw anything like that before. It's sort of a lather.

548
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,680
 Isn't that whipped cream?

549
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:39,320
 Oh, so it is. It's been a long time since I've seen any whipped cream.

550
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:42,720
 We're both wrong. It's mayonnaise.

551
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,920
 That chocolate right here.

552
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:46,880
 Oh, yes. Good for you, lady.

553
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,880
 Well, here we go.

554
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:52,140
 (barking)

555
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:56,680
 - My goodness, this is not quite a lot of chocolate.

556
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,880
 Are you gonna have room for the milk?

557
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,600
 - And if we don't, we'll get another glass

558
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,920
 and I'll drink part of it.

559
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,160
 (audience laughing)

560
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:05,640
 - Have you ever done this before?

561
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:08,400
 - Not as a general rule.

562
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,000
 Actually, I'm a lawyer.

563
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 - Oh, and you have to take this job night.

564
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,880
 (audience laughing)

565
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,800
 - Well, I have to take it tonight, anyhow.

566
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,920
 Now then, let's see.

567
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,000
 Here's the ice cream.

568
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,400
 I wonder what they take it out with.

569
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,840
 Wasn't there a scoop?

570
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:27,200
 No, and I certainly don't want to use my hand.

571
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,840
 My goodness, no.

572
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,160
 Oh, here's the scoop right here.

573
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,840
 Is that vanilla?

574
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,720
 Oh, yes.

575
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,840
 You can't fool me on vanilla.

576
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:39,760
 Well, the ice cream won't come out of the scoop.

577
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,000
 Well, all you have to do is squeeze that little jigger

578
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,200
 and it drops right out.

579
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,440
 Yes, I realize that.

580
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:51,120
 But for some reason, for some reason, would you excuse me a minute

581
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:54,280
 while I go out and back and see whether I can find a screwdriver?

582
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,760
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

583
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:59,760
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

584
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:08,320
 Good evening.

585
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,000
 Good evening.

586
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,600
 Are you Mrs. Allison's maid?

587
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,920
 I am.

588
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,960
 Don't tell me that's our ice cream.

589
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:14,840
 I'm afraid it is.

590
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,340
 I was a little delayed on the way.

591
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:17,600
 You were delayed?

592
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,560
 Well, isn't that you I saw standing right out

593
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,920
 in front of the house for the last 15 minutes?

594
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:22,680
 Yes.

595
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:25,560
 I was trying to get some boy to--

596
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,640
 that is, I'm sorry.

597
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,360
 But here's your ice cream if you don't want it,

598
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,240
 you don't have to take it.

599
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,240
 Thank you.

600
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,040
 And there's $1.40 due on it.

601
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,040
 All right.

602
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,440
 Now wait right out there.

603
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:37,280
 That's just what I intend to do.

604
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,040
 Oh, Amy.

605
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:38,960
 Yes, Mrs. Dallas.

606
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:39,960
 And he's finally here.

607
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:42,720
 And they want to collect $1.40.

608
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,760
 All right.

609
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,600
 Tell a boy I'll be right out and pay him.

610
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,160
 It isn't a boy, it's a girl.

611
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:47,960
 A girl?

612
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,600
 Yes, ma'am.

613
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:53,140
 Now then, young woman, here's your $1.40 and $0.10

614
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:54,080
 for yourself.

615
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,760
 Although you've been so long getting here,

616
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,680
 you certainly don't--

617
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:00,680
 Oh, my goodness, is that you, Mrs. Aldrich?

618
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,560
 No, oh, yes, yes.

619
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,960
 Good evening, Mrs. Allison.

620
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,680
 Where's the young woman I'm supposed to give this to?

621
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,600
 The young woman?

622
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,120
 The one who brought the ice cream.

623
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:09,960
 What did she do?

624
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,440
 Going back to the store?

625
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,840
 Well, I... Well, yes, yes.

626
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:14,960
 Yes, I guess you must have.

627
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,080
 I'm so glad you decided to come.

628
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,440
 Where's Mr. Aldridge?

629
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,280
 Well, come in.

630
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,920
 Oh, no, I couldn't think of coming in.

631
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,840
 Why not? We'd love to have you.

632
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,760
 You're just in time for ice cream.

633
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:25,960
 No, thanks, Mrs. Allison.

634
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:28,560
 As a matter of fact, I don't know why I came over at all.

635
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,280
 Was there something you wanted, dear?

636
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,080
 Oh, no, no, just forget the whole thing.

637
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:32,920
 Goodbye.

638
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:33,760
 Goodbye.

639
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,600
 (loud clattering)

640
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,600
 My goodness.

641
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,360
 Did you hurt yourself, Mrs. Aldridge?

642
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,400
 No, no, I just fell over my bicycle.

643
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:44,400
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

644
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:53,120
 Say, isn't anybody in charge of this store?

645
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,040
 Of course, just went around and back again.

646
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,000
 Oh, yeah?

647
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,440
 He's been mixing in your chocolate

648
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,480
 frosted for the last half hour.

649
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,920
 You ran into the little trouble.

650
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:01,760
 Oh.

651
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,160
 Mr. McColl, hello there.

652
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,240
 I'll be right out.

653
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,080
 Only half a minute.

654
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,400
 I've got to get back home.

655
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,800
 Now, then, what can I do for you?

656
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,000
 But here's what I want to ask.

657
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,640
 That bicycle.

658
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,320
 Sam Ulrich.

659
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,360
 Hello, well, Brown.

660
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,760
 What are you doing in that apron?

661
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:18,160
 Why, Sam, I can't find Henry's bicycle anywhere.

662
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,000
 Where is it?

663
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 Oh, that's all right, Alice, has it?

664
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,560
 Alice has it.

665
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,680
 She's out delivering.

666
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,440
 She's what?

667
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,600
 Listen, Sam, have you bought this drug store?

668
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,280
 Mr. McCall, Mr. McCall.

669
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:32,920
 Oh, my Sam Ulrich.

670
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,320
 Harriet, where did you come from?

671
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,720
 Sam, I finally found 227 Maple Street.

672
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,840
 But the lady says I can't have my 90 cents

673
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:41,440
 until I get this bottle filled for them.

674
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,280
 - What's it for?

675
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:45,880
 - I don't know, but I've got a bridge game waiting.

676
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:48,400
 - For just a minute, Harry.

677
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,320
 Hello, McCall's pharmacy, good evening.

678
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,720
 - Oh, Mr. McCall, this is Henry.

679
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,560
 - This is who?

680
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:55,680
 - Henry, all but remember, I've called up the Say I resign.

681
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,680
 - Henry, this is your father.

682
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,720
 - Is that your father?

683
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,160
 He was how to get the wrong number, goodbye.

684
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,960
 (audience laughing)

685
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,520
 - Henry, Henry.

686
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,920
 - What is that, Mike, last in chocolate?

687
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:09,220
 Just a minute, lady. I'll be right with you.

688
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:11,620
 Here, we'll get behind the counter here and give me a hand.

689
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:12,620
 Who? What?

690
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:13,620
 Mr. McCall.

691
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:14,620
 Mr. McCall.

692
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:15,620
 Is that you, Alice?

693
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:16,620
 What?

694
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:17,620
 Sam Paul, Richard.

695
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:20,120
 How did you have to leave the house in the dirty apron?

696
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:25,020
 You want me to get chocolate all over my suit?

697
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:27,320
 Dear, if you've got a dollar for me because if you have,

698
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:30,020
 give it to Mr. McCall right away because I'm quitting.

699
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:31,020
 You're what?

700
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:34,420
 Hello, McCall's pharmacy. Good evening.

701
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:35,420
 Is this McCall?

702
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:36,420
 It is.

703
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:40,020
 - Mr. McCall. - Henry, don't you know your own father when he speaks to you?

704
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:43,020
 Listen, Father. I thought you said this was McCall.

705
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:45,420
 How do I keep getting the wrong number? Goodbye.

706
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:48,020
 Henry! Wait!

707
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:49,420
 Yes, Father, do you want me?

708
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:51,020
 Why are you quitting your job down here?

709
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:52,820
 Because I've got a swell one with Mr. Scott.

710
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:55,820
 - Doing what? - Oh, it's nice outdoor work mixing cement.

711
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:57,620
 Don't you think mother would want me to thank you?

712
00:27:57,620 --> 00:28:00,820
 Henry, you're not getting your mother mixed up in any cement.

713
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:13,660
 [applause]

714
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:18,060
 The years of World War II are beginning to fade in many memories in America.

715
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:24,460
 Children are growing up who don't remember the names that made the rest of a shutter like Pearl Harbor, Iwo Jima, Anzio.

716
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:26,820
 It's easy to forget over here.

717
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:29,900
 But in Europe, the scars of World War II are still raw.

718
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,460
 Hunger still stalks the land.

719
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:35,160
 Children are starving, and old people are dying from malnutrition.

720
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:39,180
 There is one organization that helps in the battle against the war-born hunger,

721
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:41,440
 Care, C-A-R-E.

722
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:46,900
 Care prepares scientifically selected and packed food parcels for distribution overseas.

723
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:52,200
 Delivery is guaranteed, and mass purchasing and planning provides the greatest economy.

724
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:55,980
 Care is the best way to send parcels to relatives of friends abroad.

725
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:59,540
 For those who wish to help care, select families abroad to receive

726
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:02,340
 parcels donated for anonymous recipients.

727
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:05,620
 If you want to aid the fight against Tonga, send your dollars and

728
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:08,420
 dimes to Care, New York.

729
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:12,700
 And if you have people in the war-torn lands, remember, show them

730
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:14,860
 you care through care.

731
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:18,360
