00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 In just a moment, enjoy the Aldrich family.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 But first, the Election Day is almost here.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 Studio 8H here is a place of feverish activity.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 For NBC's combined radio and TV coverage

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 are the biggest political event in 20 years.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 A staff of 250 men will relay the latest news.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 15 of the top commentators will analyze the results.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 The network newsmen will have the Monrobot,

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 the electronic brain to compute important trends

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,200
 trends as ballots pour in from 48 states.

11
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,180
 Yes, Tuesday, NBC will be the nation's headquarters

12
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:36,160
 for election returns.

13
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,720
 Now it's the Aldrich family on NBC.

14
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,720
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

15
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:48,360
 Henry, Henry, all great.

16
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,360
 Coming, mother.

17
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:57,480
 Yes, it's the Aldrich family of franchise.

18
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:04,480
 written by typical

19
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:15,560
 even though everyone knows him because he lives in your house or next door

20
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,360
 or somewhere in your memories

21
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:22,040
 no one has yet been able to define the typical teenage american boy

22
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:26,240
 all you can say is that he exists in the person of henry all rich

23
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,740
 And when you say that, you cross your fingers.

24
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:30,340
 The scene is the Aldrich Hallway.

25
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,380
 The time is just before breakfast.

26
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:33,680
 Hello, Toby.

27
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,880
 Toby, are you listening?

28
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,540
 Yes, Henry, but I'm thinking.

29
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:37,920
 Well, never mind thinking, Toby.

30
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,320
 Didn't you say you'd pay me back?

31
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,720
 I'm going to, just as soon as I get some money.

32
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,720
 But, Toby, I'm going to a party Saturday night.

33
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,920
 And if you don't pay me the 50 cents,

34
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,420
 I can't get the trousers I need.

35
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:48,080
 Henry, just a minute, Toby.

36
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:48,760
 What, Homer?

37
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,520
 Tell him if he doesn't pay you'll sue.

38
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,720
 Sure. Listen, Toby.

39
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,160
 Henry, would it help you any if I loaned your pair of trousers?

40
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,700
 Oh, how would that help?

41
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:59,500
 I've ordered a brand new pair of slacks and I need that 50 cents before I can pay for them.

42
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,400
 Well, suppose we made some kind of business arrangement.

43
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,900
 What business arrangement?

44
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:07,700
 Well, would it help you any if I paid you five cents every week on what I owe you?

45
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:08,500
 No.

46
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,100
 Go on, Henry. Tell him you'll sue.

47
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:12,900
 Yeah, Toby, if I don't get that money, you can expect to be sued.

48
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,500
 Look, Henry. I'll call you back in just a few minutes.

49
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,300
 You'd better.

50
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,700
 Okay, you wait right there by the phone. I'll see what I can do.

51
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:19,500
 Okay.

52
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,000
 So long, Henry. Thanks for calling.

53
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,100
 So long. What do you say, Henry?

54
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:25,500
 What's a nice thing, Homer? That's a nice thing.

55
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:29,800
 Henry, did you know that when you're in a position like the one you're in, you can get a bill collector?

56
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,500
 You can? Sure.

57
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,200
 My father will give you the names of two or three you could get.

58
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,900
 - Henry! - Yes, Father?

59
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,400
 I just put a letter for you on the living room table.

60
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,900
 Well, Gee, where's it from?

61
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:40,800
 I didn't notice.

62
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,100
 Homer, come on into the living room.

63
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:44,900
 Why don't you get a collector and scare the daylights out of Toby?

64
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,100
 I'd certainly like to.

65
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,100
 Henry, your breakfast is getting cold.

66
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,500
 I'll be right there, Mother.

67
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,900
 You asked for three eggs, you know.

68
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 Yes, mother, I'm practically starved this morning.

69
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 Is your letter from a girl, Henry?

70
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 Oh, Gee whiz.

71
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 Oh, who's it from, Henry?

72
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 Oh, Gee whiz.

73
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 What does the letter say?

74
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 Oh, boy.

75
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 Is it bad news, Henry?

76
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 Will you please stop breathing on me?

77
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 But who's the letter from, Henry?

78
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 The public library.

79
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 Oh, the library.

80
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 They want you to join?

81
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 Well, not exactly.

82
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 I borrowed a book there, see?

83
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 Now, suddenly it's overdue.

84
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 But when did you take it out?

85
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,960
 last December they say. She was home. I think they made a mistake. I could almost

86
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:29,540
 wear it wasn't until last January. Are you sure? Sure I'm sure. I remember

87
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:33,020
 distinctly that in December I didn't feel like reading on a count of Christmas.

88
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:40,500
 Oh boy. And they charge two cents a day. January, February, March. Oh, we're up to

89
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:45,100
 November. It'll be more than five dollars. Five dollars. Just for one copy of

90
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:48,820
 Huckleberry Finn that I didn't even read. Well why didn't you return it after two

91
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:53,260
 weeks I told you I hadn't finished it that's what I get for trying to improve

92
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:59,500
 my mind five dollars how much do you have well just enough to pay for my slacks

93
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:03,340
 provided Toby pays what he owes me then forget about the book the thing for you

94
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:07,860
 to do Henry is to crack down on Toby what about the library book all the

95
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:12,820
 public library will ever do send you letters no one harm can that do you really

96
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:17,380
 think so home sure they can't afford to get too tough they don't want to lose you

97
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:22,020
 - Henry? - After all, they hardly ever go as far as they did with George Vigolo.

98
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:26,380
 - What did they do to George? - They called on his mother and father and went to see the principal.

99
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:30,980
 - Oh, boy. - Henry, I want you to come in here and eat your breakfast.

100
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:35,380
 Mother, I don't think I want any breakfast. - What's the matter?

101
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:39,380
 - I couldn't eat a thing. - [music playing]

102
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:47,380
 (music)

103
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:49,380
 What are you doing Henry?

104
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,380
 I'm just looking for something Mary.

105
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:53,380
 Oh my goodness you don't have to tear the bookshelves all apart do you?

106
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:55,380
 Don't worry I'll put everything back Mary.

107
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,380
 Has any phone call come for me this morning?

108
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,380
 Not that I know.

109
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,380
 It was not strange.

110
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:02,380
 Every time I've called Toby the line was busy.

111
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:04,380
 I thought you were just talking to him.

112
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,380
 It wasn't Toby, I was talking to the Senator Bill and Porium.

113
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:07,380
 What about?

114
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:10,620
 Well, I cancel the pair of trousers I happen to have ordered.

115
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:13,180
 Well, Mother says you should get ready for lunch right away.

116
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,180
 All right.

117
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,180
 Very, you know Miss Crawford.

118
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,180
 Miss Crawford?

119
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:18,180
 At the library.

120
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:20,780
 Oh, my goodness, Miss Crawford!

121
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:21,780
 She scares me.

122
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,180
 Henry, she has the most terrible temper.

123
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:25,180
 Is that right?

124
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:27,180
 Henry, you want it on the telephone?

125
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:29,180
 Well, gee, was it about time.

126
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:31,180
 Henry, don't let your lunch get cold!

127
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:33,180
 I want to tell that Toby a thing or two.

128
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,180
 Hello?

129
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,180
 Now listen, Toby.

130
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:37,180
 Is this Mr. Henry old, Rich?

131
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:37,680
 What's that?

132
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,880
 I'd like to speak to Mr. Henry Aldrich.

133
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,880
 This is I?

134
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,380
 This is the Centerville Emporium.

135
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:44,280
 Oh. Oh!

136
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,880
 I'm very sorry, but our manager says it's too late to cancel your trousers.

137
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,880
 What?

138
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,680
 But, but, Gee, whiz, I don't want them.

139
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:53,480
 I'm sorry, but those trousers have been altered to your measurements.

140
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,980
 But I can't use them.

141
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,580
 Another use has come up through my money.

142
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:57,380
 I see.

143
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:00,180
 And, and in this case, though, I'd warn them you still got them.

144
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:01,880
 We even got all your cut off the bottom.

145
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,380
 I see. Well, I'll tell our Mr. Sweeney.

146
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,980
 Well, thank you very much.

147
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:09,220
 and tell them that if I see anybody my size I'd be very glad to send them in.

148
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:09,980
 Thank you, Miss Drool.

149
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:11,380
 We're just finally related to it.

150
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:11,980
 Thank you.

151
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:12,480
 Good-bye.

152
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,980
 And ready?

153
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:14,980
 Yes, Mother?

154
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:18,480
 Henry, did I just hear you canceling your order for those new trousers?

155
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,480
 Yes, Mother.

156
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,780
 But why, dear?

157
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:24,280
 Well, boy, you know how it is with new trousers.

158
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,780
 I'm afraid I don't.

159
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:29,380
 Well, she was after a while you get tired of looking at them.

160
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,580
 And I'd wear them to the party Saturday night when it's over.

161
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:33,580
 What use would I have for them?

162
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:35,080
 You know what I mean, Mother?

163
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,580
 No, dear, but I'm sure you're being very sensible.

164
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,480
 Now, please run out and get ready for lunch.

165
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,980
 I have something I made just specially for you.

166
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:44,080
 Well, I've got to answer the phone first.

167
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,080
 Hello, Toby.

168
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,080
 Hello.

169
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,580
 Oh, Homer? Listen, Homer.

170
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:48,580
 This is Mr. Sweeney.

171
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:49,580
 Who?

172
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:51,580
 Mr. Sweeney from the Emporium.

173
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:52,580
 Oh.

174
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:55,080
 Did your girl tell you I explained everything?

175
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,080
 If she did.

176
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,580
 And we tried to treat our customers fairly.

177
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:01,580
 But, young man, do you understand what a business transaction is?

178
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:03,080
 I can't use the trousers.

179
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,080
 Neither can we.

180
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,080
 You can't?

181
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:08,080
 Well, look, do you know Huckleberry Finn?

182
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,080
 No, but we have a great many customers, and I can't be expected to know all of them.

183
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:17,080
 Well, see, I've been a very embarrassing position with those trousers.

184
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,080
 You'll be much more embarrassed without them.

185
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:24,080
 What I mean is they were altered especially for you.

186
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,080
 Will you please call for them?

187
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,080
 Didn't I make it clear? I can't use them.

188
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,080
 Why not?

189
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:33,080
 Well, I'm not very fond of light blue.

190
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,720
 Would you please ask your father to come to phone?

191
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,860
 My father your father well

192
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:42,480
 He isn't here right now, then may I speak to your mother?

193
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:45,700
 Well look come to think of it. I am fond of light blue

194
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:52,560
 I'll be down to get them and when can we expect to see you but tomorrow be too late? That'll be fine. Thank you, sir

195
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,160
 That's all right. Goodbye. Goodbye. I

196
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:59,200
 Think it was the Emporium

197
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:02,020
 Listen, Mary, could you loan me a few dollars?

198
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:04,080
 Provided I pay it back a little each week.

199
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,640
 What's the matter with your own money?

200
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,940
 It's all tied up.

201
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:08,280
 You might sing in debts.

202
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,280
 I'm sorry, Henry.

203
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,880
 I just spent everything I had on a dress for the party, Saturday night.

204
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,920
 It's the most beautiful blue.

205
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,360
 Yeah?

206
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,680
 They call it Huckleberry Blue.

207
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,160
 Huckle?

208
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:19,820
 Huckle?

209
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:20,880
 Yes.

210
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,420
 Are you ready for lunch, children?

211
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:23,920
 Right away, mother.

212
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,720
 How about you, Henry?

213
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:29,320
 Well, G-mother, I'm sorry, but I could need a thing.

214
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:39,320
 (music)

215
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,320
 Hello, is this Dr. Bennington?

216
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,320
 Yes, Mrs. Ulrich.

217
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:47,320
 I don't like to bother you, Dr. But Mr. Ulrich and I just a bit worried about Henry.

218
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,320
 Something wrong with him?

219
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:53,320
 Well, he's simply not himself. He hasn't eaten more than a bite in two days.

220
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:56,320
 That's pretty serious for Henry. Does he have a rash?

221
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,320
 No, I have noticed any.

222
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,320
 He just sits and mopes all day, and he's extremely nervous.

223
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,320
 Well, I'll phone the drugstore and have a tonic put up for him.

224
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:10,320
 For Dr. We've always had a great deal of trouble getting him to take any tonic. He fights it.

225
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,320
 Well, maybe the exercise will give him an appetite.

226
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:17,320
 You tell Henry that if he takes this, all of his troubles will be over.

227
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,320
 All right. Thank you for calling Mrs. Always.

228
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,320
 Thank you, Dr..

229
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,320
 Good day.

230
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,320
 Mother!

231
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,320
 Yes, Mary?

232
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,120
 Mary. Have you forgotten Dennis?

233
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:26,640
 Ready?

234
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,640
 Han coming.

235
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,740
 We went right ahead.

236
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:29,400
 Mother.

237
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,240
 Yes, Henry.

238
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,760
 Wasn't told me that just called wasn't.

239
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,400
 And no, dear.

240
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,680
 It was a call I'd put in.

241
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,360
 Did you see Toby today, Henry?

242
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:35,920
 No, Father.

243
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,840
 I haven't been able to get in touch with him.

244
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,680
 Well, you're not the only one.

245
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,600
 What do you mean, Father?

246
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,000
 After trying to get his father on the phone all day,

247
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,400
 I stopped in there on the way home tonight.

248
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,680
 We discovered that somebody had plugged the phone

249
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,760
 so that it only gave a busy signal.

250
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,760
 Is that right?

251
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,400
 Is that right?

252
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:57,680
 Henry, you must eat something. If you don't, you certainly aren't going to any party Saturday night.

253
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,120
 Mother Eleanor Wentworth expects me. She invited me personally.

254
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,080
 Eleanor Wentworth? You're going over to the Wentworth Saturday?

255
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,440
 Yes, sir. That's where the party is.

256
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,080
 Alice, did you hear about Mr. Wentworth? Quite an honor.

257
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,120
 What about him, Sam?

258
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,160
 He was just elected chairman of the board at the public library.

259
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,480
 At the what was he?

260
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:19,120
 The Mr. Wentworth was?

261
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:19,440
 Yes.

262
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,580
 Mr. Wentworth.

263
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,980
 He's chairman of the library.

264
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:25,540
 Do you have any objection?

265
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:26,540
 Me?

266
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:27,740
 Well, gosh, no.

267
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:31,380
 I was just surprised to hear that with all his other work.

268
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,580
 Why would he want to be that?

269
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:36,380
 I think he'll find some way to work it out.

270
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:39,140
 Henry, turn around and let me look at you.

271
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:40,420
 Something the matter with me?

272
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:43,860
 Sam, don't you think we ought to have the doctor come over and see Henry?

273
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:46,220
 If you think it'll amuse him.

274
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:48,220
 Dear, I'm serious.

275
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:52,220
 Now, mother, if there's one thing I don't want to see, it's a doctor.

276
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:56,220
 Well, I certainly think we ought to drop into his office tomorrow.

277
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:59,220
 Tomorrow? But I have a job that I'm beginning tomorrow.

278
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:01,220
 With whom? With Mrs. Hoffman.

279
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:04,220
 She was just a program alright. I'll eat some dessert for you.

280
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,220
 Mary, how about the dessert?

281
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,220
 I'll bring it right in, Father.

282
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:09,220
 Well, please hurry. I have a guest coming.

283
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:10,220
 And Mary?

284
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:11,220
 Yes, Mother.

285
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,220
 I want you to give Henry an extra large portion.

286
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:15,220
 Sure. What do we have in?

287
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:17,220
 -Huckleberries. -Huckleberries.

288
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:20,220
 I... good ol' huckleberries.

289
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:22,220
 -Huckle? -Huckle?

290
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:26,220
 That reminds me, Henry, if you ever read "Huckleberry Finn"?

291
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:29,220
 -Whoa! -If you haven't, you ought to get it out of the library sometime.

292
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,220
 -Yes, sir. -Dear, weren't you reading it last winter?

293
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:34,220
 -Well, I was, Mother, but I... -Well, you're very, Henry.

294
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:37,220
 -Thank you, Mary. -Who's coming over tonight, Father?

295
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:39,220
 -Mr. Wentworth. -Mr. Wentworth?

296
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:41,220
 -[coughing]

297
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:44,220
 -And my, what's the matter with you? -He's choking on his huckleberry!

298
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:46,220
 Mary, come on the back.

299
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:54,220
 I'm glad you dropped in, Mr. Wentworth.

300
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:56,220
 Sorry I can't stay any longer.

301
00:11:56,220 --> 00:12:00,220
 You can count on Mrs. Aldrich and me to do everything we can for the library.

302
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,220
 It's very good of you, Mr. Aldrich.

303
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:07,220
 Incidentally, if you want to raise more funds, why not get some of the young people interested?

304
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:08,220
 You think they'd help?

305
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:11,220
 Well, of course. Let's get Henry down here. He's usually pretty good at all.

306
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:14,760
 well of course let's get henry down here is usually pretty good at organizing

307
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:17,320
 things

308
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:21,320
 or and we

309
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,640
 was here right after dinner

310
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:25,740
 well as i'm dropping my office on the i'd like to have a talk with them i'd

311
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,200
 have to do that

312
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,440
 where you dropped in

313
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,560
 incidentally i don't know if you think it's a great deal of henry well you know

314
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,680
 how henry feels about elana

315
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,960
 he's looking forward to coming over to her party saturday night

316
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,960
 good night mister wednesday

317
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:42,200
 Sam, did Henry say anything to you about going out?

318
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,200
 Not to me.

319
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,960
 Well, dear, I'm really worried.

320
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,960
 Oh, no, Alice.

321
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,200
 Henry's a reasonably normal, healthy boy.

322
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,960
 There's nothing to worry about.

323
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,960
 Father--

324
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:52,960
 Henry, is that you?

325
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,840
 What are you doing?

326
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,240
 I'm talking to your mother.

327
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,280
 You're talking to anybody else besides, mother?

328
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,240
 No.

329
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,960
 You just missed Mr. Wentworth.

330
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,960
 Oh.

331
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,800
 Well, I'm certainly sorry to hear that.

332
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,680
 Henry, where have you been?

333
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:11,680
 Well, just out in the garage, I just thought I'd go out and see whether the car needed washing.

334
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,680
 At this time of night?

335
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,680
 Gosh, if everybody knows the best time to wash your cars when the sun's down,

336
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:20,680
 uh, m- Mr. Wentworth isn't coming back, is he?

337
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,680
 No, dear.

338
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:26,680
 No, that reminds me, Mr. Wentworth said if you have time tomorrow, he'd like you to drop into his office.

339
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,680
 He wants to have a talk with you.

340
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,680
 With I?

341
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,680
 What for?

342
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,680
 It's regarding a matter pertaining to the library.

343
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,680
 It is?

344
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:35,680
 Some money they're trying to collect.

345
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,680
 You know father, you think I'll be going to bed.

346
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,680
 Henry, it's nowhere near your bedtime.

347
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:45,680
 I know, but I think mother's right.

348
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,680
 Maybe I am coming down with something.

349
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:58,680
 Yeah? Someone at the door?

350
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,680
 It's Henry orders Mrs. Hoffman. I'm reporting for work.

351
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,680
 Oh.

352
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,160
 Oh, I'm sorry.

353
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,560
 Dear, I'm afraid it's too wet for you to rake the leaves this morning.

354
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,720
 She was Mrs. Hoffman.

355
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,320
 I need her and some money.

356
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,040
 Well, I have several errands you might run for me.

357
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,480
 Come in while I answer the phone.

358
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,000
 Yes, ma'am.

359
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,560
 I'd be glad to do anything.

 [KNOCKING]

361
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,280
 Hello?

362
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,000
 Oh, not at all.

363
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 I'll be very glad to call you.

364
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:25,440
 Henry?

365
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,280
 Yes, Mrs. Hoffman?

366
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,480
 No, Mother wants to speak to you.

367
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,880
 She says it's quite important.

368
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:29,880
 Oh.

369
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:30,800
 Hello, Mother.

370
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,900
 Henry, can you be through with Mrs. Hoffman's by three o'clock?

371
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:34,500
 Why?

372
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,200
 I made an appointment for you to see Dr. Bennington.

373
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,100
 Dr. Bennington, mother Dr. Bennington?

374
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:39,700
 Yes, dear.

375
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,700
 He's to give you a thorough going over.

376
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:44,000
 But mother, I might be busy here all day.

377
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,600
 I haven't got time to be gone over.

378
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,100
 You'll be through by noon, Henry.

379
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,100
 You what, Mrs. Hoffman?

380
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,800
 And remember near three o'clock.

381
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,500
 Do you hear me?

382
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,200
 Yes, mother.

383
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,900
 Good-bye.

384
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:54,900
 Now, here's what I want you to do first, Henry.

385
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:55,600
 Yes, ma'am.

386
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,200
 This book goes back to the library.

387
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,300
 Yes, Mrs.

388
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,300
 For the library?

389
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:04,860
 Goodness, look at this. My, my, my. It's two days overdue.

390
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:07,800
 Well, I don't know what Miss Spawfrigle think of me.

391
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,600
 Two days?

392
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,100
 Well, you just have to apologize for me.

393
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:14,700
 I understand that since Mr. Wetmirth has been made chairman of the board,

394
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:17,500
 there's sort of a campaign about overdrawn books.

395
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,300
 They are?

396
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:22,500
 After all, you can't blame them. Some people keep a book out for as much as a month.

397
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,500
 Look, Mrs. Hoffman, my son's coming out.

398
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:29,300
 Couldn't I do something else for you instead of going down to the library?

399
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,300
 I'd much rather you write down to the library.

400
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:36,300
 And please tell Miss Spoppard that if she has a copy of a book called "Climb and Punishment"

401
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,300
 I'd love to read it.

402
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:41,300
 "Climb and Punishment"?

403
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,300
 Yes, and hurry, won't you?

404
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,300
 Yes ma'am.

405
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:47,300
 But are you sure you don't want me to do something constructive instead?

406
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:58,300
 We'll return to the Aldrich family in just a moment.

407
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:05,300
 But right now I'd like to give you some inside information on the NBC shows to be heard over most of these same stations later this evening.

408
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:14,400
 First off, we're all going to go over to the Harris-Fayhouse Hall to visit with that suave sophisticated Phil Harris and his long-suffering wife Alice.

409
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:23,000
 And then we go from the laughable to the supernatural for a theater guild on the air, which brings you John Patrick's comedy, "Low and Behold."

410
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,800
 Your stars this week will be Anne Blithe, Basil Rathbone, and Jeffrey Lin.

411
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:34,800
 With the elections coming up, NBC's coverage makes it the nation's headquarters for election news.

412
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:39,800
 As a regular Sunday feature, you can listen in on America's only public press conference.

413
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,800
 When Martha Roundtree and Lawrence Bivax meet the press,

414
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:47,800
 offers you a chance to hear the answers given by one of the personalities in the news,

415
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:52,800
 to questions posed by a panel of newsmen and prominent public citizens.

416
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,800
 There is a whole world of radio entertainment that's yours for the dialing

417
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,880
 tuned to this NBC station later tonight.

419
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:10,320
 Now getting back to the troubles of Henry Olga.

420
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,440
 Henry has just been notified that he's

421
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:15,280
 neglected to return a library book which he drew out

422
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:19,080
 last December, which he is now unable to find.

423
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,320
 Hoping to earn enough to pay part of the find,

424
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:24,640
 he takes a job with Mrs. Hoffman, whose first request

425
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,440
 is that Henry return a book of her own to the library.

426
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,720
 The scene opens into Haven's drugstore.

427
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,800
 The time is a half hour later.

428
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,600
 Homer, won't you please help me out?

429
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,520
 Won't you please do it for me?

430
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,160
 But Henry, I'm busy.

431
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,680
 I've got some pretty important things to take care of.

432
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,240
 Like what?

433
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,360
 Like what?

434
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,040
 Well, I've got a date with Willie Marshall

435
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:47,280
 to watch that new building they're putting up a third main.

436
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,520
 Boy, Homer, and you call yourself a friend.

437
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,560
 Have you ever in your whole life asked me to do anything

438
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,960
 and I turned you down?

439
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,460
 Sure, last week.

440
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:57,460
 You wouldn't lend me your binoculars.

441
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:57,960
 Well, she would.

442
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,360
 You don't have to remember every little thing.

443
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,800
 I thought we were friends.

444
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,760
 We are friends, Henry.

445
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,960
 Well, if you can't do a simple little thing,

446
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,560
 like going to the library and returning a book

447
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,560
 and maybe getting another.

448
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,240
 All right, I'll do it.

449
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,960
 Homer, you'll never regret it.

450
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:11,760
 Where will I meet you?

451
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,660
 Right here in the drugstore.

452
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,060
 Buy this telephone booth.

453
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:16,160
 I'll be calling Eleanor while I'm waiting for you.

454
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,860
 Why are you calling Eleanor?

455
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:19,860
 I'm taking you to the movies tonight.

456
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,160
 I think it'd be better if I met her someplace

457
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,560
 besides your house.

458
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:28,060
 Oh, here Homer, all you have to do is give this book to Miss Crawford and apologize for Mrs. Hoffman's keeping it over two days.

459
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:31,160
 Should I tell you'll bring in Huckleberry Fenn as soon as you find it?

460
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:37,760
 No, Homer! Don't worry about that. Just give it this and ask her for... for what?

461
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:41,560
 Well, I think the name of it is... "Crying Doesn't Pay."

463
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:57,400
 Did you like the movie, Henry?

464
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,400
 Well, I didn't care for it so much, Eleanor.

465
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,720
 Oh, I did.

466
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,960
 I thought it was beautiful.

467
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,320
 The way as long as he lived his conscience bothered him.

468
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,240
 Did you like that part?

469
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,840
 And all he'd stole when he was a boy was an ordinary bottle

470
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,120
 of milk.

471
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,080
 Why, but didn't he suffer though?

472
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:16,280
 Well, I guess the suffering was pretty evenly divided.

473
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,080
 Now, would you mind walking up this street toward Homer's house?

474
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,000
 What for?

475
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,360
 Well, I waited at the Haven's drugstore for nearly three hours a day,

476
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,600
 and he never did show up.

477
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,240
 Now, I bet you wouldn't do a thing like that to a person.

478
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:27,960
 Who me?

479
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,800
 That's the first impression a person gets of you.

480
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:34,120
 But you're dependable, and reliable.

481
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,200
 Oh, gee, I don't--

482
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,560
 Well, you take a person that--

483
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,360
 Whoa.

484
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,640
 What, Henry?

485
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:46,280
 What I was going to say is you take sometimes, don't I guess a person can't help it?

486
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,840
 Hell what?

487
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:48,840
 Anything.

488
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,920
 You're awfully understanding of others, Henry.

489
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:54,040
 Well, I do study people a lot.

490
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,440
 They kind of read their character.

491
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,520
 And that's what I like about you, Henry.

492
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,080
 You're so intelligent.

493
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,240
 I'll bet you do a lot of reading.

494
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,160
 Well, I like some books.

495
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,920
 I'll bet you, probably go up and collect books.

496
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,160
 I'll get over it.

497
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,160
 I mean...

00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,160
 [audience laughter]

499
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:12,040
 Oh boy, who's that coming down the street?

500
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:12,860
 Where?

501
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:14,360
 Right under the street lamp.

502
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,120
 Oh, it's Mrs. Foster.

503
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,120
 Miss Crawford from the library.

504
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,120
 Is Crawford?

505
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,120
 Do you know her?

506
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,120
 Only what you might call professionally.

507
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,120
 Look, Eleanor, I'm still going to Homer's.

508
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,120
 Why don't we go down this way?

509
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,120
 By Johnson's Candy Kitchen.

510
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,120
 Did you want to stop him?

511
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,680
 Well, I think it might be a good idea.

512
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,240
 Let's walk real fast.

513
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,240
 Oh my goodness.

514
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,600
 Look who's right ahead of them.

515
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,600
 Who is this?

516
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,600
 Isn't that Mrs. Hoffman?

517
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,600
 Mrs. Hoffman.

518
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,600
 Oh boy.

519
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:39,120
 Look, Eleanor, why don't we go across the street to Tillman's hamburger?

520
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,120
 It's a lot better.

521
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,120
 All right.

522
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,120
 Oh, let's hurry.

523
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,120
 Why?

524
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,120
 Father's right over there.

525
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,120
 We can walk with him.

526
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,120
 He is.

527
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,120
 Henry.

528
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,120
 Henry?

529
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,120
 Why, Henry?

530
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,120
 Why, Henry?

531
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,120
 Why, Henry?

532
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,120
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

533
00:20:53,120 --> 00:21:07,120
 What did he say, Alice?

534
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,680
 the doctors doesn't seem to know what the trouble is.

535
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,180
 No.

536
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:12,220
 There wasn't anything wrong with his eyes

537
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:14,920
 and the dentist x-rayed every tooth in his head.

538
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,720
 Well, that should put your mind at ease.

539
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,460
 No, dear, it doesn't.

540
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:21,660
 Dr. Bennington says sometimes something very mysterious

541
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:23,260
 can happen to a boy.

542
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:26,660
 And no matter how hard they try, they can't find what's wrong.

543
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:29,540
 He simply goes into a complete decline.

544
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:30,900
 And when a thing like that happens,

545
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:33,900
 Sammy says there's only one safe thing to do.

546
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:34,540
 What's that?

547
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:36,940
 Take a trip to Arizona.

548
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:38,940
 All right, I'll take it.

549
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:39,940
 No!

550
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:40,940
 Hey, Brie!

551
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:49,940
 Henry, what's in the bar?

552
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:52,940
 Just a pair of trousers, Mary. See?

553
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:53,940
 Oh, they look all thing nice.

554
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:56,940
 We implore you, Maithem. It's still to order, you might say.

555
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,940
 You better hurry if you're going to the party.

556
00:21:58,940 --> 00:21:59,940
 I'm not going.

557
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:00,940
 Why not?

558
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:01,940
 Because I'm not.

559
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:04,940
 Do you think I'd be wearing my new trousers if I were going?

560
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:06,940
 Well Henry, you don't have to jump at me.

561
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:08,940
 Jump at you? When did I jump at you?

562
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:10,940
 That's what mother and father were talking about.

563
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:12,940
 They said you've turned so cross, they don't know you.

564
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:16,940
 Listen, Mary, I'm in one of the most terrible predicaments I've ever been in in my life.

565
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:19,940
 You know where I can lay my hands at a copy of Huckleberry Finn?

566
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:21,940
 Sure. You do? That's wonderful. Where?

567
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,940
 At the public library.

568
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,940
 She and Wiz, Mary.

569
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:26,940
 Henry!

570
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:27,940
 Yes, Mother?

571
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:29,940
 Have you taken your atomic since dinner?

572
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:32,940
 Well, she was. I've taken it five times today.

573
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:36,540
 That doesn't make any difference. You're supposed to take it as to dinner too.

574
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:41,020
 All right. Listen, Mary. I had a letter from the library today, see?

575
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:42,020
 Another.

576
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:43,740
 Don't you know I had any?

577
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:45,740
 I keep my eyes open.

578
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:51,380
 Well, Mary, all Miss Crawford says in this letter is that if I pay the library the price of a new copy of Huckleberry Finn,

579
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:52,900
 they'll forget the rest that's due.

580
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:56,140
 Well, I'm sorry. I can't lend you anything, Henry.

581
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:56,740
 Henry?

582
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:57,580
 Yes, mother.

583
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:58,740
 Homer's down here.

584
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:00,100
 He is? Homer's here?

585
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:00,860
 Sure.

586
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:03,740
 - Well, Gee whiz, Homer, where you been for the last two days?

587
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:05,300
 - I was delayed, Henry.

588
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,700
 (audience laughs)

589
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:07,940
 Delayed by what?

590
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:09,380
 - Well, first it was the bulldozers,

591
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:11,100
 then it was the steam shovel.

592
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:13,060
 But don't worry, I got Mrs. Hoffman's book

593
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:15,220
 to the library the first thing this morning.

594
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:16,780
 - Boy, it's about time.

595
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:17,820
 - Well, hurry up.

596
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:18,820
 Aren't you going to the party?

597
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:20,020
 - No, I'm not.

598
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:20,860
 - Why not?

599
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:22,420
 - Because of Mr. Wentworth.

600
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:24,580
 - Well, Mr. Wentworth isn't gonna be there.

601
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:25,420
 - He isn't?

602
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:28,020
 - I think somebody said he's gonna be out of town.

603
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:30,100
 - But you're not sure he's going to be.

604
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:31,600
 I'm partly sure.

605
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,000
 Well, come on Homer, come on.

606
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,960
 Aren't you gonna put on your new pants?

607
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,840
 Well, I'll bring the box along with me.

608
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:38,680
 What?

609
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,000
 Homer, there's no sense of putting them on

610
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:40,920
 and giving them wear and tear

611
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,680
 unless I'm absolutely sure I'm going to the party.

612
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:46,100
 (jazz music)

613
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:57,280
 - Henry, what are you doing out here on the floor?

614
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,160
 - Hello Eleanor.

615
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,000
 - Hello Homer.

616
00:23:59,000 --> 00:23:59,840
 - Hi.

617
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,840
 Oh no, we won't be disturbing your father, will we?

618
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,840
 Oh no, he isn't even in town.

619
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:05,840
 He isn't?

620
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:06,840
 What are you doing? That's too bad.

621
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,840
 Did I tell you Henry? Let's go in.

622
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:09,840
 Come on Henry!

623
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:10,840
 Okay.

624
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,840
 There isn't anyone here but I'll tell you.

625
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,840
 And a few others and this is Crawford.

626
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:15,840
 Miss Crawford?

627
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:16,840
 Yes, you know her, don't you?

628
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:17,840
 Oh yes, yes.

629
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,840
 Sure, Miss Crawford from the library.

630
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,840
 Oh no, I just happened to remember.

631
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:22,840
 What?

632
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:23,840
 Well, my mother's home, all alone.

633
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:24,840
 She is Henry.

634
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,840
 Oh, why don't you ask her to come over?

635
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,840
 No, I think I better go home.

636
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:31,840
 Oh, Henry, you can certainly come in for just a while.

637
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,840
 Would you like to go on, but when my mother's alone, she likes to have me with her.

638
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,840
 Oh, just a day for one game.

639
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,840
 In just a minute, we're going to play a literary game.

640
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:39,840
 A literary game?

641
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:40,840
 A literary game?

642
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:41,840
 Yes!

643
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,840
 I just happen to think my mother's alone, too.

644
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,840
 Oh, but it may be a thing in the world.

645
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:49,840
 Miss Bofford asks the questions, and you answer.

646
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:50,840
 And they're a prize?

647
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,840
 Well, I just couldn't enjoy winning a prize.

648
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,840
 And now is my mother home alone.

649
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:55,840
 Please, Henry.

650
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:56,840
 No!

651
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:57,840
 Henry!

652
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,540
 Henry, I'm not gonna let you go.

653
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,340
 You're coming in if I have to pull you in.

654
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:03,340
 Please, Elle Dore.

655
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:04,540
 Hey, Henry, let go of me.

656
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:06,540
 If I'm going in, you are too.

657
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:20,540
 Quiet, everybody, please.

658
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:22,240
 Shh, quiet!

659
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,340
 Miss Boffin is almost ready for the final part of the game.

660
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:26,840
 Shh.

661
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:32,380
 The last three remaining in the literary contest are let me see who our name is father

662
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:40,040
 Dad go be Smith. Oh, be Smith. Oh my bra. Oh my bra. Now. Let me see who was the third who's not Henry. Oh, yes

663
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,760
 Henry Orridge

664
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,280
 now

665
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:50,900
 Three of you boys will stand in the middle of the room facing me. Yes ma'am. Yes ma'am. Yes ma'am in each of these packages is a prize

666
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:53,840
 Yes ma'am. Yes ma'am. Yes, ma'am. This bar for anyone take my place

667
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:58,000
 I'm very sorry Henry, but you will have to take your own turn in answering.

668
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,360
 No, then Toby.

669
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:03,280
 In order to win, Watson, this box I hold, you will have to answer a question.

670
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,280
 Yes, ma'am.

671
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:09,640
 Now tell me, what character in literature said to be or not to be?

672
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,080
 To be or not to be?

673
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,080
 Yes.

674
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,080
 Is that the end of a sentence?

675
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,080
 That's the end of the question.

676
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,080
 Who said it?

677
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,080
 Shakespeare?

678
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:21,080
 Well, that's close enough.

679
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:25,080
 Here's a box of... why, I believe it's six linen hankage.

680
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,680
 Well, thank you very much.

681
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,680
 They're exactly what I've always wanted.

682
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,080
 [audience laughing]

683
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,580
 Now then, Homer.

684
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:37,080
 Homer, can you tell me who was the leading female character in Ivanhoe?

685
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:39,580
 - In Ivanhoe? - Yes.

686
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:44,080
 - She has to be female? - I'm afraid not.

687
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,580
 [audience laughing]

688
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:48,580
 In Ivanhoe.

689
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:50,580
 Rebecca? - That's right.

690
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:55,580
 What? And here is a lovely color box for you.

691
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:58,580
 Look so cute. Now then Henry.

692
00:26:58,580 --> 00:26:59,580
 Oh, Gee whiz.

693
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:04,580
 I want you to tell me the name of the author of the book in this last package.

694
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:08,580
 Yes, Miss Boffrey. It is Huckleberry Finn.

695
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:10,580
 Huckleberry.

696
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:12,580
 Henry!

697
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:13,580
 She was Miss Boffrey.

698
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:14,580
 She's very big.

699
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:15,580
 Great somebody. Get something cold.

700
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:17,580
 You rub some ice cream on her.

701
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:18,580
 Oh, I've been faffing here.

 He went to the book. Just as he went down his last words were marked away.

703
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:27,580
 Mrs. Barford, why don't you just keep the book? I've got a feeling you're going to get it back anyway.

704
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:40,580
 All Americans have always stood behind our fighting forces through all the years of our country's history.

705
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:45,580
 Today the need is for blood donations for members of our armed forces in Korea.

706
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:52,580
 Today, with the reserve of blood plasma virtually exhausted by GI requirements, an emergency exists.

707
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:57,280
 The Department of Defense is therefore calling for an immediate stepping up of blood collections.

708
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:01,780
 This is your opportunity to help save the lives of our fighting men in Korea.

709
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:06,380
 Call your Red Cross chapter, a local blood donor center, for an appointment.

716
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:50,820
 Listen again next week, same time, same station, for another sparkling half hour with the Aldrich family.

717
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:51,980
 Good night, everybody.

718
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:55,140
 (audience applauding)

719
00:28:55,140 --> 00:29:09,660
