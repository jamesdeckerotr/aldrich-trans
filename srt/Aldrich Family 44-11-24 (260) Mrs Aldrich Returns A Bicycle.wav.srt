 [Music]

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 Henry! Henry Oldridge!

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 Coming, Mother!

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 The Aldrich family, a special rebroadcast for you soldiers, sailors, and Marines of the United Nations.

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 [Music]

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 And now for the Aldrich family with Dick Jones as Henry and Jackie Kalk as Homer.

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 The wonderful thing about the teenage time of your life is the fact that you can experience it twice.

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 once in your own teenage and continually thereafter in the misadventures of your own or your neighbor's Henry Aldrich.

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 The scene opens in the Aldrich living room. The time is evening.

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,500
 Sam, I don't think you're looking at it from Henry's point of view.

11
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:14,000
 You're quite right. I'm not. I'm looking at it for Mr. McCalls or whatever his name is, point of view.

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,500
 And if you'll remember, Alice, I advised Henry in the first place not to take that job unless he was sure he could stick to it.

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,600
 Then that's the whole point. Henry isn't working tonight because he isn't supposed to work.

14
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,800
 He's taking Kathleen to a very nice dance at the country club.

15
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,000
 Yes? Well then what's all the fuss about?

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,500
 Yeah, there isn't any fuss.

17
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:36,000
 Mr. McCall, who hires him, phoned a few minutes ago and wanted to know where the bicycle is.

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,600
 That what?

19
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,000
 The bicycle that Henry delivers packages from the drugstore on.

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,100
 You mean he's lost it?

21
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,900
 No, Sam, of course he hasn't.

22
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,600
 The bicycle is right out on the front porch.

23
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,500
 Henry didn't understand that he was to return it tonight.

24
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:52,260
 And don't you think Mr. McCall could be reasonable and let him bring it back tomorrow?

25
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:54,640
 Because there isn't any other way, is there?

26
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:00,080
 Alice, you aren't by any chance leading up to the suggestion that I take it back, are you?

27
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,480
 Sam, that hadn't even entered my head.

28
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,320
 Would you want to?

29
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,980
 I would not.

30
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:11,160
 And Alice, no matter how far Henry has to take that bicycle, if his employer wants it, he should have it.

31
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,920
 But do you think his employer realizes that Henry's only young one,

32
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:18,720
 And that this is one of the most important dances the club is going to have all seasons.

33
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,520
 No, I don't imagine it does.

34
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,420
 Do you?

35
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:22,420
 Do I want?

36
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:25,720
 Yes, I realize a boy is young only once.

37
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,220
 And a man reaches my age only once.

38
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:32,320
 And I'm going to sit in this chair and read this paper and not deliver any bicycle.

39
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,920
 Mom, are you too busy to fix my necktie, please?

40
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,720
 No, Henry, sit down on the arm of this chair while I straighten.

41
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,720
 Okay.

42
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,320
 Did I just hear you and Father talking about Mr. McCall's bicycle?

43
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:42,920
 You did.

44
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,080
 Well, look, Father, be sure to remember this.

45
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:48,560
 When you first push back on the break, your feet will go all the way around once.

46
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,800
 But on the second time around, you'll stop.

47
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,760
 At least you'll usually stop.

48
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,360
 I won't stop at all.

49
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,320
 You won't.

50
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,800
 You mean Mother didn't have a chance to explain things to you?

51
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:02,840
 Henry, if I gave you the impression that I was going to ask your father to take that bicycle back for you,

52
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,800
 I'm afraid you misunderstood me.

53
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,680
 The one I'm going to ask there is Mary.

54
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,640
 Mary? Mary isn't even here.

55
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,600
 She will be. She'll be back any minute.

56
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,960
 Are you sure? Because I feel very responsible for that bicycle.

57
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,520
 And Kathleen, in the dance.

58
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:19,060
 You haven't one thing to worry about. Now run upstairs and put your coat on.

59
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:20,940
 Yes, Mother, sure. Thanks very much.

60
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,100
 Sam, did you see that?

61
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:22,900
 Did I see what?

62
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:27,660
 How conscientious he is about it. He wouldn't even put his coat on until I assured him Mary is going to be here.

63
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:32,140
 All right, Alice. But remember, Mr. McCall has to have that bicycle.

64
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:36,300
 Sam, you top-jest as though returning a bicycle were the most awful problem in the world.

65
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,220
 Mother!

66
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:38,620
 He is Mary, are you back?

67
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:42,120
 Yes, and my goodness, mother, look at what I've just done to my brand-new stocking.

68
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,020
 Mary Aldrich, how did you do that?

69
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:46,420
 On that old bicycle, what's out on the front porch?

70
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:49,320
 Mother, I was going to wear these stockings to the dance tonight.

71
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,820
 Mary, you didn't tell me you were going to the dance.

72
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:55,920
 Mother, don't you remember? I told you at breakfast this morning, and I'm late as it is.

73
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,120
 You mean you haven't timed a...

74
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,720
 Haven't timed a what?

75
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:02,020
 Nothing, dear. You're only young one.

76
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:03,920
 Go on up and get your clothes changed.

77
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,320
 I'm going to put in a phone call.

78
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,120
 Hello?

79
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:07,920
 Number three.

80
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,320
 M232.

81
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,820
 M232.

82
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:15,120
 Mother, don't you think would be alright if I tell Henry he has to pay for these stockings?

83
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,520
 Mary, Henry only earns 50 cents for a whole afternoon's work, and those stockings cost 89.

84
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,420
 No, Mother, they cost a dollar eight.

85
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:24,820
 And that makes it worse, aren't you a shame?

86
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,420
 Hello, Mrs. Brown speaking.

87
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:29,220
 Hello, Elizabeth. This is Alice Aldrich. It's Homer there.

88
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:33,220
 Why, I just a minute, Alice. Homer, you're one of the telephone.

89
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:35,320
 Alice, why are you in the way I want to ask you?

90
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,420
 Did you know about the Alice's party?

91
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:39,420
 Alice, are they giving a party?

92
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:42,420
 Yes, dear. I understand they've invited scabs of people.

93
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:43,420
 Really? When is it?

94
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,420
 It's tonight.

95
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:46,420
 Tonight, Elizabeth. Aren't you invited?

96
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,420
 No. Aren't you invited?

97
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:51,420
 No. No, I guess you and I aren't included.

98
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:57,420
 Isn't that terrible? I'm not surprised about myself, Alice, but after all, you were made to tame the Alice.

99
00:04:57,420 --> 00:05:00,420
 Well, that's the way things are, Elizabeth. You never know.

100
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:02,420
 Oh, just me, Alice. He is Homer. Hello.

101
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:04,420
 Oh, but can't you say hello, Mrs. Aldrich?

102
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:06,420
 I didn't know it was Mrs. Aldrich.

103
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:07,920
 Hello Mrs. Aldrich.

104
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,920
 Hello, dear.

105
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,920
 Why the could you be lacing my shoes?

106
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,920
 How are you Mrs. Aldrich?

107
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,420
 Homer, how would you like to earn a little money?

108
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:16,420
 Some money?

109
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:17,420
 Boy.

110
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:20,920
 It won't be very much, but it'll probably come in very handy.

111
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,920
 Okay, sure.

112
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,920
 When do you want me tomorrow morning?

113
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,420
 No, dear, tonight.

114
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:26,420
 Tonight?

115
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:28,920
 Yes, dear. You can do the whole thing tonight.

116
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,920
 Wait. I'm not working tonight, Mrs. Aldrich.

117
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,420
 I'm meeting Agnes at the Country Club.

118
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:37,500
 Are you sure you wouldn't like to do just one little errand?

119
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,700
 Gee, no, I've got to save myself to dance.

120
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:43,500
 Well, I thought you were only a young one.

121
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,500
 What's that?

122
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,140
 Nothing, Homer, goodbye.

123
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,140
 Mother!

124
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:48,140
 Come here, Henry.

125
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,140
 I'm afraid I have something I have to tell you.

126
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:51,140
 You have, Mother?

127
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:52,140
 Boy.

128
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,140
 How do I look?

129
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:54,140
 How do you like my hair this way?

130
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:57,780
 Henry, I can't begin to tell you how much I appreciate your picking things up for me.

131
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:58,780
 Are you sure, Mary?

132
00:05:58,780 --> 00:05:59,780
 You'll be back in time?

133
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:00,780
 Mary's already back.

134
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:01,780
 The only thing is...

135
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:02,780
 The only thing is...

136
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:04,780
 I'm carrying this town that has a mother that...

137
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:05,780
 You know what I mean?

138
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,780
 Henry, you don't have to hug me quite so tight.

139
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:09,780
 I was just giving you a little squeeze.

140
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:11,780
 What was it you wanted to say to me?

141
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:13,780
 Nothing there. You go right on and have a good time.

142
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:15,780
 Okay, good night, mother.

143
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:16,780
 Don't stay out late.

144
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:20,780
 Okay, and explain to Mary how responsible I feel about that bicycle.

145
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:33,780
 [Music]

146
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:36,780
 Why, hello there Mrs. Aldrich!

147
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:39,780
 Don't tell me you're out wheeling a baby at this time and I.

148
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:42,780
 You're good eating Mrs. Hopper. No, this is a bicycle.

149
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:43,780
 Oh, why?

150
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:45,780
 A delivery bicycle. It has a sidecar.

151
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:49,780
 Oh, who years? Yeah, I recognized your face, but I couldn't place the sidecar.

152
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:50,980
 What's that guy called?

153
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:54,380
 I'm just pushing it over here to Mr. McCall's drugstore.

154
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:57,480
 Very good exercise.

155
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:02,280
 Something I can do for you, madam.

156
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,280
 Why, yes. Are you Mr. McCall?

157
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:04,880
 Yes, ma'am.

158
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,780
 Well, I just returned your bicycle for Henry Oldry.

159
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:09,280
 Oh, yes. Where's Henry?

160
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,380
 I've got a couple of packages for him to deliver.

161
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:14,080
 Tonight, I answered the phone, Mr. McCall,

162
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,880
 and I don't remember your saying anything about it when you called.

163
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,880
 And why did you think I wanted the bicycle?

164
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,540
 I understood the boy was responsible.

165
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,640
 I didn't go to him about the job he came to me.

166
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,820
 Mr. McCall, let me make one thing clear.

167
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:27,580
 Henry feels most responsible about his work here.

168
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:28,280
 Yeah?

169
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:28,920
 All right.

170
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,020
 Can you get him on the phone and tell him to come right down here?

171
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:33,920
 I'm very sorry, but he left the house before I did.

 She was so anxious to get here.

 She ran out of her front door and rolled right down the steps.

 She had to go back and change her clothes all over again.

 Actually, I'm a lawyer.

531
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:54,620
 Oh, and you have to take this job night.

532
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:56,660
 Oh.

533
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:59,260
 Well, I have to take it tonight, anyhow.

534
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:02,260
 Now let's see, here's the ice cream.

535
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:04,660
 I wonder what they take it out with.

536
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:06,060
 Isn't there a scoop?

537
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:09,660
 No, and I certainly don't want to use my hands.

538
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:11,660
 My hands? No.

539
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:13,660
 Oh, here it is right here.

540
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:15,460
 Now then.

541
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,660
 Is that vanilla?

542
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:19,660
 No, yes, you can't fool me on vanilla.

543
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:21,660
 Well...

544
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:23,260
 All you have to do is pull that little jigger

545
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:24,860
 and the ice cream drops right out.

546
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:26,940
 Yes, I'll realize that.

547
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:30,660
 But for some reason, for some reason,

548
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:32,860
 would you excuse me a minute while I go out and back

549
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:34,860
 and see whether I can find a screwdriver?

 - I am.

555
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:54,580
 Don't tell me that the ice cream you have.

556
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:58,980
 I'm afraid it is. I was delayed a little on the way and you were delayed.

557
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:03,180
 Wasn't that you? I saw standing right out in front of the house for the last 15 minutes.

558
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:08,380
 Yes, I was trying to get some boy. That is, I'm sorry, but here's your ice cream.
