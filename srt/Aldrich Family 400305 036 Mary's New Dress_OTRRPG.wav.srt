00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,920
 The Special Service Division presents a rebroadcast of...

3
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,680
 Henry Henry Oldridge.

4
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:20,480
 Coming, mother.

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,440
 [Applause]

6
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,960
 For all you men and women in the armed forces of the United Nations,

7
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,720
 here's the Aldrich family.

00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,080
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

9
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:49,560
 Teenage boys like Henry Olrich go on forever and ever.

10
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,320
 They go on getting into all sorts of complications

11
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,040
 and sometimes out of them.

12
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:58,560
 They go on creating memories for everyone to look back upon.

13
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,480
 The time has sattered in noon.

14
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,560
 The scene opens and the Aldrich dining room.

15
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,640
 Have some more--

16
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,120
 what is this, Alice?

17
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,440
 That's macaroni, Sam.

18
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,160
 Macaroni?

19
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,200
 Oh, yes.

20
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,200
 Henry, would you have some?

21
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,200
 No, thank you, Father.

22
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:12,700
 Mother?

23
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:13,400
 Yes, Mary.

24
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,560
 Will you ask Henry to please pass me the salt?

25
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,120
 Here he's sitting right across from you.

26
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,440
 Why can't you ask him yourself?

27
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:19,240
 Never mind.

28
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,480
 Mother, do you want me to tell you

29
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,040
 why she won't ask me for it?

30
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,160
 She isn't speaking to me.

31
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,400
 Mother, would you like to have me go out

32
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,880
 to the kitchen and get some more muffins?

33
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:26,960
 If you please, Mary.

34
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:27,840
 Yes, Mary, please.

35
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,640
 - Kenley, I wasn't speaking to you. - You did them though.

36
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,080
 Didn't she, mother? Didn't she, father?

37
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,440
 Never mind, Henry.

38
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,240
 Now, that's what's gotten into Mary, anyhow.

39
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,760
 She's simply in a mood, Sam.

40
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,760
 She doesn't like that new dress I bought her.

41
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,320
 No? Well, frankly, I can't blame her.

42
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,280
 Now, Sam, that's a serviceable dress.

43
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,280
 And it's a nice dress.

44
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,800
 And I don't think we're going to gain anything

45
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,280
 by you saying you don't like it.

46
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,760
 I didn't tell her I didn't like it. I told you.

47
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:52,560
 No, I know, dear, but you didn't tell her you did like it, did you?

48
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,440
 No.

49
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,040
 I told her I liked it, mother.

50
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,680
 I told her just like you said I should.

51
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:00,440
 Yes, Henry. She was. I even said she looked like a new person in it.

52
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:04,080
 No, she won't speak to me. Mother, do you want me to fix the dessert?

53
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:08,280
 I'll fix it, Mary. Sam, when she comes in, you tell her how nice she looks in it.

54
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,200
 Now, Alice, what's the difference?

55
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,800
 Well, Sam, it did cost $20. And it can't be exchanged.

56
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,240
 Oh, well...

57
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,520
 Mother, did you say you'd fix it?

58
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,640
 I'll take care of it, Mary. I'm going right out there.

59
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,760
 Father, would you please ask Henry whether you would like one of these muffins? I'm holding under his nose.

60
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,880
 She was, Mary. You don't have to put them right down my neck. Oh.

61
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,780
 Father, would you like one?

62
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,660
 Mary, isn't that...

63
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:30,940
 Mary, turn around a minute.

64
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:32,040
 What's the matter?

65
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:32,960
 Hmm...

66
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,240
 Very nice.

67
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,320
 Isn't that a new dress?

68
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,360
 Father, did Mother tell you to say that?

69
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,360
 What's that? What do you mean that she tell me to?

70
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,560
 She was, Mary. Don't you believe anyone anymore?

71
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,860
 Well, I certainly don't believe you, Henry Aldrich.

72
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:46,500
 Making up some awful story about a soldier.

73
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,760
 Mary, I didn't say it was a soldier.

74
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,140
 I said it was a sergeant.

75
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:51,400
 What about a sergeant?

76
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:55,640
 Father, I just happened to tell her that I was down in the Haven's drugstore this morning

77
00:02:55,640 --> 00:03:00,500
 when she came in with that dress on and when she went out some sergeant said she

78
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:04,660

00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:09,940

80
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:15,180

00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:24,500
 kitchen

85
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:31,380

86
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:32,300
 to meet her

87
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,620

88
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:34,940
 and mary didn't i

89
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:38,020
 but didn't i mention that you never even thought of it until father just

90
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:38,840
 mentioned it

91
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:44,180
 why mary all right all right what was his name and why you know why you see that

92
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:48,100
 henry and i'll wait a minute you're just driving it out of my head what was

93
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,540
 his name was

94
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:50,820
 as sergeant berg

95
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,660
 that's right henry joe berg

96
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:55,060
 What father? Sergeant Joe Burch wasn't it?

97
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:57,460
 Yes sure for a minute I didn't understand.

98
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:59,060
 I still don't believe a word of it.

99
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:00,360
 Mary looked me straight in the eye.

100
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,060
 No I won't.

101
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:02,660
 All right then I'll tell you anyhow.

102
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:04,760
 He said dark brown was his favorite color.

103
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,860
 Oh no I know you're making it up.

104
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:08,660
 Mary aren't you going to finish your lunch?

105
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:09,660
 Not at the table with you.

106
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:10,760
 I'm not.

107
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,660
 Henry you shouldn't have said that about his favorite color.

108
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:16,060
 You've got to know when to stop in a thing like this.

109
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,960
 Father how about my going to the phone

110
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:20,760
 and asking Homer to phone Mary and say he's Sergeant Bert.

111
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,680
 Now Henry, remember what I just told you?

112
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,680
 She'd recognize Homer's voice the minute she heard it.

113
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,460
 Ready for your dessert, everybody?

114
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,180
 Sam, where's Mary?

115
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,720
 She left the dining room, Alice.

116
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,520
 What's that?

117
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,960
 We like to dress so much she won't eat with us.

118
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:33,880
 Now Henry.

119
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,720
 Alice, we told her she looked wonderful

120
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,160
 and she stopped right out of the room.

121
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,840
 The girl's completely unreasonable.

122
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,080
 Well, my goodness.

123
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,880
 Mary, I'll put a stop to that.

124
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,720
 Mary?

125
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,160
 Henry, I know how we can settle this whole thing.

126
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,000
 How?

127
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,040
 Come on with me out to the hall.

128
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,040
 What are you going to do, Father?

129
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,560
 I'm going to put on a phone call.

130
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,560
 I'm going to teach her to believe people when they tell her something.

131
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:57,560
 - Number please. - Operator, I want Elm 232.

132
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:01,560
 Elm 232. Father, I thought you said we shouldn't call Homer Brown.

133
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,560
 Hello, well brown speaking.

134
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,560
 - Oh, hello, well, this is Sam. - Father, is that Homer's father?

135
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,560
 Yes, Henry, keep quiet. Say, well, when you talk, can you sound like a sergeant?

136
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,560
 - What's that? - I want you to telephone Mary in a few minutes and tell her your Sergeant Joe Burch.

137
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:18,560
 - What's that? - Your Sergeant Joe Burch.

138
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,860
 Who is this? I thought it was Sam Aldrich.

139
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:24,060
 It is, it is, and Will has all I want you to do.

140
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:37,260
 Father. Father.

141
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:37,960
 What can I do?

142
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,560
 Is Mary still talking to Mr. Brown on the telephone?

143
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,060
 No, I think she's hung up.

144
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,960
 Boy, did you hear?

145
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,760
 Right up to the end, she kept calling him Sergeant Burge.

146
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,760
 And then just before she hung up she said, "You buy Joe."

147
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,760
 Oh boy!

148
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,760
 Oh, hello Henry.

149
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,760
 Well, how are you?

150
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,760
 I'm fine, Mary.

151
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,760
 Hello Father.

152
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,760
 What's that?

153
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,760
 Oh, hello Mary.

154
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:02,760
 Henry, could you please step to one side so I can look in the mirror for a second?

155
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,760
 Oh, sure, excuse me.

156
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,760
 Thank you Henry, that's enough.

157
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,760
 Mother!

158
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,760
 Yes Mary.

159
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,760
 Mother, I don't think I'll have to change the neck on this new dress.

160
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,760
 The more I look at it, I don't know.

161
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,760
 What's that, Mary?

162
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,360
 And Henry, I have an apology to make to you.

163
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,360
 So why, Mary?

164
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,760
 To you and Father both.

165
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,560
 Because, to be honest, Joe just called.

166
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,560
 Joe?

167
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,560
 Joe?

168
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,560
 Don't you remember?

169
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,360
 Sergeant Joe Birch, the one who saw me down into Haven's jokes, darn.

170
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,360
 Well...

171
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,360
 Ben is Mary in there.

172
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,360
 Yes, Mother.

173
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,760
 Are you and Father going to be using the living room this evening?

174
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,760
 Why, no.

175
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,760
 Why do you ask?

176
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,960
 Well, Joe's coming over.

177
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,960
 Who?

178
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:37,960
 What?

179
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:38,960
 Joe.

180
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,960
 Sergeant Joe Birch.

181
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:40,960
 Yes, Henry.

182
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,960
 He's coming here.

183
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:42,960
 Yes, Father.

184
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,960
 Why, he's just a friend who likes... like, he's awfully nice, mother.

185
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:47,960
 Mary, where did you meet him?

186
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,960
 Well, uh, Henry saw the introduced us.

187
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,960
 Is he nice, Henry?

188
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:52,960
 Why?

189
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,960
 Nice, mother.

190
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,960
 He's awfully bashful.

191
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,960
 He didn't dare ask to see me, and when I asked him if he wouldn't like to come over tonight, he just stuttered.

192
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,960
 Who did? Well, Father Joe!

193
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,960
 That's what I mean.

194
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,960
 How did I happen to say "well"?

195
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:04,960
 Well, isn't that nice, Mary?

196
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,960
 Yeah, isn't that nice? Yeah, yes, that's fine.

197
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:11,960
 Mother, I'm going out and turn on the iron and press this dress.

198
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:12,960
 Sam.

199
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:13,960
 Yes, Alice.

200
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,960
 What are you looking at me like that for?

201
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:16,960
 What do you mean, dear?

202
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,960
 I was just going to ask you whether you think it's alright for Mary to have a boy come here.

203
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,960
 She hardly knows.

204
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:22,960
 Alice, I agree with you.

205
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,960
 Why don't you go to Mary and put your foot down?

206
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,960
 And tell her she can't have him over?

207
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,960
 Yes, that's the only sensible thing to do.

208
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,960
 Yes, Jim, mother.

209
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:30,960
 That's what I say.

210
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,960
 When Mr. Brown walks in, what's that?

211
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,960
 Did I say Mr. Brown?

212
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:37,960
 You said Mr. Brown, and a few minutes ago your father said will.

213
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,960
 Sam, what's that look on your face?

214
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:45,960
 - What's going on around here? - Alice, I didn't know Mary was going to invite him over.

215
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,960
 Girls didn't know things like that when we were hurries.

216
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,960
 - Sam Aldrich. - She was, Mother. It was just a joke.

217
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,960
 - A joke, dear. - Alice, what is there to worry about?

218
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,960
 All we have to do is tell Will to phone and tell Mary he can't come.

219
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,960
 - Sure. He has to go back to camp or something.

220
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,960
 - Well, I still do. - Alice, that dress cost $20, didn't it?

221
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,960
 And she likes the dress now, doesn't she? - Yes.

222
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,960
 - But if you mind, if I get a few bottles of ginger ale to serve tonight?

223
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,500
 serve tonight. Well Mary I don't mind mother I'd like to make some sandwiches

224
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:17,960
 for Joe. Well Mary first of all first of all what mother. Are you sure you'd rather

225
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:21,860
 not go to the picture show with me this evening. Yes that's a good idea. That's

226
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:25,580
 what I say and she was Mary it's a swell show tonight. But I've got someone

227
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:29,360
 coming over. Don't you realize what that means. Well all right dear if you aren't

228
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,960
 here when he comes your father will explain to you. Oh no mother I don't know

229
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:36,440
 why not look forward to anything so I never dreamed anything like this could

230
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:40,460
 happened to me I didn't either and right you realize that nearly every boy that I

231
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:45,080
 really like is in the army and I haven't spent an evening with a goodness just

232
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:49,580
 think he's a sergeant oh I know dear but how do you know you're gonna like him

233
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:53,000
 my goodness mother and Julie call I didn't realize how long so I've really been

234
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,800
 oh and now right out of a clear sky you know what I think I'll do I think I'll

235
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:04,460
 go down the hairdresser well Sam only now Alice don't don't how was I to know

236
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,660
 Oh, she felt this way.

237
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,460
 - See, I don't think I've ever been so upset

238
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:10,180
 with you and my life of all the childish of all of them.

239
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:12,140
 - Now, Alice, I told you once the only reason

240
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:13,660
 I did it was to help you out.

241
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:15,780
 - To help me out, to help me out,

242
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,900
 to have my own daughter break her heart.

243
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,740
 - Couldn't we have old Mr. Kilmer come in

244
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:22,300
 from next door and play cards with her this evening?

245
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,540
 She's very fond of him.

246
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:25,340
 - That would be a fine thing to do.

247
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:27,700
 - Yes, Henny, where do you get these ideas?

248
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,700
 - Sam, do you realize what's gonna happen to Mary

249
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,460
 this evening when she gets all dressed up

250
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:34,180
 and sits in the living room and waits and waits and waits?

251
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:35,420
 I realize that, Alice.

252
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:37,460
 I don't see how you can ever face her again.

253
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:38,220
 What are you going?

254
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,780
 I have nothing more to say to you.

255
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:42,060
 Well, Alice, there's just one thing I want to say.

256
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:44,380
 I don't like that brown dress and it do well myself.

257
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:58,860
 Henry, would you mind that walking so fast?

258
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,420
 I've got to, Homer.

259
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:03,060
 Don't you realize Sergeant Burch is calling on my sister

260
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,060
 It's after five now.

261
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:07,060
 I thought you said there wasn't any Sergeant Bert.

262
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:08,060
 There isn't.

263
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:09,060
 That's why I'm out trying to...

264
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:12,060
 But trying to find somebody who will say Sergeant Bert.

265
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:14,060
 And you haven't been able to find anyone?

266
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:16,060
 No, I haven't even found a Sergeant.

267
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:18,060
 Oh. Oh.

268
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:20,060
 Have you looked down at the Empire Bowling Alley?

269
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:23,060
 Yes, Homer. The place was just full of girls.

270
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:25,060
 Well, Gee, why don't you give it up, then?

271
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:28,060
 Oh, no. Don't you realize how mad my father is at me?

272
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,060
 Why?

273
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:32,060
 I told you three times, Homer, because my mother's mad at him.

274
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:36,060
 And boy, I'm going to find a sergeant and surprise them.

275
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,060
 Yeah.

276
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:38,060
 How about--

277
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:39,060
 How about what?

278
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,060
 How about the jukebox?

279
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:41,060
 Found the candy kitchen.

280
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,060
 I was in there, too.

281
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:45,060
 No, I could find was a couple of lieutenant's eating banana splits.

282
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:46,060
 Oh.

283
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:48,060
 Wouldn't Mary be interested in one of them?

284
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:51,060
 Homer, we promised her a sergeant and it's got to be a sergeant.

285
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,060
 Name Bird.

286
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,060
 Name Bird.

287
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:55,060
 And he's got to like Dark Brown.

288
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:56,060
 Right!

289
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:58,640
 (upbeat music)

290
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:07,540
 - Hello?

291
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:11,400
 Hello, is this Brown's residence?

292
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,400
 Elizabeth, this is Will.

293
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,480
 Will Brown, your husband?

294
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,720
 Say Elizabeth, Sam, Alders and I are downtown

295
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,020
 trying to dig something up,

296
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:21,760
 and I may be a little late for dinner.

297
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,160
 We're trying to find a Sergeant Burge.

298
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,040
 No, no, he's not missing.

299
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,040
 We're just... we're just...

300
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,040
 Elizabeth, how about your nephew Ed that enlisted?

301
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,040
 Isn't he a sergeant? Where can I lay my hands on him?

302
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:35,040
 Oh, Solomon Islands, eh?

303
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,040
 No, I know his name isn't budged.

304
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,040
 Goodbye!

305
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,040
 Sam!

306
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,040
 I'll be right there, Will.

307
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,040
 I was just talking to that soldier over there at the fountain,

308
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,040
 and he said he'd be glad to help us out, only he's got a date.

309
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,040
 Yes, couldn't he bring her along?

310
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,040
 Well, I suggested it, but he said what good would that do?

311
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,040
 And I guess he was right.

312
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,040
 How about... how about... how about what?

313
00:11:53,040 --> 00:12:01,140
 How about what my calling Mary and telling her I've just received orders to leave for Italy now will I've made up my mind tonight at eight o'clock a sergeant

314
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:06,160
 Birch is going to call on my daughter. Yeah, and nobody is going to be more surprised than my wife

315
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:16,680
 Possibly it's Henry Sam. How about that fellow over there at the counter? Oh, yes. Hello there soldier. Oh, yes. Hello there. So do you have

316
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:20,140
 Would you be interested? Are you married?

317
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,840
 What's that?

318
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,500
 Mr. Aldrich here means do you have a date for tonight?

319
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,200
 Sorry, but I do.

320
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,400
 Oh, you do?

321
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:31,800
 Well, so, do you know of anybody who'd like a good time?

322
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,200
 No.

323
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,800
 Oh, there's a kid in the back room there all along.

324
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,000
 Yes, back this way?

325
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 Yeah, I was talking with him a few minutes ago.

326
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,600
 He just got a letter from his girl.

327
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,300
 Yes?

328
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,700
 It's pretty blue, too.

329
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,100
 I think his girl turned him down.

330
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,100
 Yes?

331
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,000
 Anyhow, she's getting married, I know.

332
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,500
 Yes?

333
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,500
 To a sailor.

334
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,200
 Man, is he sunk.

335
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,120
 She didn't like the way he looked in his uniform.

336
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:52,820
 Is that right?

337
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:53,800
 He's sort of blue, eh?

338
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,280
 Yeah.

339
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,080
 Come on, Sam. That sounds like army.

340
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:56,920
 Thank you, soldier.

341
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:57,920
 That's okay.

342
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,640
 Hey, Jimmy, what's time I love you?

343
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,720
 Well, do you see him? Which table is he sitting at?

344
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,440
 There he is. He's over in the corner.

345
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,280
 He's reading a letter.

346
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,520
 Oh, yes.

347
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,360
 But well, look, he's a private.

348
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,720

 Once there is no such young man, Henry has gone out to try to find someone who will say

 he's Sergeant Birch.

478
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:33,200
 I know, but you're not going to need a hat and glove just to sit in your own living room, are you?

 Of course you can, Mary, but wouldn't you like to have me go to the door with you?

526
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,400
 Mary, come back here.

527
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,840
 You can't do a thing like this after all I... I mean...

528
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,200
 Now Mary, don't be childish.

529
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,400
 May I open the door then?

530
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,280
 Yes, dear.

531
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,120
 Yes, Mary.

532
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,920
 And will you please all go away?

533
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,000
 Henry, get out of here.

534
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,240
 Are you coming too, Father?

535
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,040
 Yes, of course I am. Come on, Alice.

536
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,600
 Well, Sam, you don't have to push me.

537
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,800
 Well...

538
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,440
 Hi.

539
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,440
 Hello.

540
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,000
 I guess you're Sergeant Burge.

541
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,880
 Well, well, first, do you marry Orich?

542
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:36,880
 Yes.

543
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,240
 Won't you come in?

544
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,240
 Sure.

545
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,880
 Let's go into the living room.

546
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,520
 You know, I would have known it was you,

547
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:49,680
 Just from your voice from my voice. Yes. You thought it just the way you did on the phone this afternoon. Oh, I

548
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:53,880
 Don't you remember? Oh, yes. Was that this afternoon? Oh

549
00:20:53,880 --> 00:21:00,940
 Won't you sit down? Thanks. I am I hope you don't mind my still wearing the same dress

550
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:06,240
 Oh, what's that? I guess you'll begin to think it's the only dress I've got well the only one I've ever seen you in

551
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,880
 Isn't it?

552
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,680
 My goodness, I wonder why nobody answers the doorbell.

553
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,880
 Isn't your father here?

554
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,880
 Because as a matter of fact, I want to see...

555
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,880
 I want to see...

556
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,880
 Henry!

557
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,380
 Would you excuse me for just a minute while I go find my little brother?

558
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:21,380
 Sure, that's okay.

559
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:22,380
 Henry!

560
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:24,380
 Yes, Mary? I'm out in the kitchen.

561
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:26,380
 Will you please come out here in the front hole?

562
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:27,880
 What for? What's the matter?

563
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,380
 Can't anybody in this house answer the front door?

564
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:33,380
 Or don't you want Sergeant Birch to think we're even civilized here?

565
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:35,380
 Oh, is Sergeant Birch here?

566
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:36,380
 Yes, Henry, of course he is.

567
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:37,380
 Whoa.

568
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:38,380
 How do you like him?

569
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,380
 Henry, will you please answer the door?

570
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:43,380
 Sure. Oh, you don't have to talk to me like that, Mary.

571
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:45,380
 There's a lot of somebody you're going to thank me for.

572
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:46,380
 Well, then, please answer it.

573
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:48,380
 Sure. That's what I'm doing.

574
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:49,380
 Hi.

575
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:50,380
 Oh, gee, where?

576
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:51,380
 Am I late?

577
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:53,380
 Aren't you in the living room?

578
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:57,380
 Oh, is that where I go? I just walk in the living room and say, "I'm Sergeant Joe Burch."

579
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:59,380
 And now, wait a minute. Wait a minute.

580
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:00,380
 You mean your sister changed her mind?

581
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:04,380
 No. No, only, frankly, could you step upstairs.

582
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:06,380
 I mean, could we go down?

583
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:08,060
 Could you go in the dining room there?

584
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:09,740
 Oh, she's in the dining room.

585
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:11,340
 No, not yet.

586
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:12,540
 Let's just wait in there.

587
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:14,060
 Oh, you want a surprise?

588
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:15,100
 Yes, in a way.

589
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:15,820
 Henry!

590
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:17,100
 Yes, mother!

591
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:19,020
 Listen, could you go on through the dining room

592
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:20,380
 and out to the kitchen?

593
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:21,340
 Out to the kitchen?

594
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:21,740
 Yes.

595
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:22,540
 Henry!

596
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:24,540
 There's a fellow by the name of Homer out there.

597
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:26,620
 He'd be very glad to see you.

598
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:27,980
 Well, what is this, anyhow?

599
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,820
 Henry, why didn't you come when I called you?

600
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:31,580
 Well, I was just...

601
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:32,700
 It's not the doorbell.

602
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,140
 Yes, dear. Never mind bothering now.

603
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:35,180
 I'll take care of it.

604
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:36,140
 That's fine, mother.

605
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:38,780
 Because I want to go out to the kitchen and take care of something.

606
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:40,940
 Good evening.

607
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:43,260
 Oh, Mrs. Aldridge. Here I am.

608
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:44,540
 Oh, my goodness.

609
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:46,380
 Well, don't you remember me?

610
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:48,380
 I'm supposed to be Sergeant first.

611
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:50,340
 I know, but I thought you were in.

612
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:53,300
 Well, this is very nice of you.

613
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:55,820
 Won't you step into the dining room?

614
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:57,500
 Oh, we're going to eat right away.

615
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:00,220
 Why? The chicken has already come right along.

616
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:02,060
 Certainly anxious to meet your daughter.

617
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:04,740
 Yes, and I'm sure she's anxious to meet you.

618
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:06,500
 Yes, Homer.

619
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:09,420
 Henry wants me to ask, oh gee whiz.

620
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:10,080
 Hello, Homer.

621
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,860
 This is-- this is--

622
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:12,780
 Sergeant Birch.

623
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:13,540
 It is.

624
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:15,020
 I mean you are.

625
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:16,260
 Oh boy.

626
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:19,220
 Homer, could I speak to you out in the hall a minute, please?

627
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:20,140
 With me?

628
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:23,140
 Oh, there's something I think I ought to tell you, Mrs. Aldrich.

629
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:24,300
 Sergeant, you just sit there.

630
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:25,260
 We'll be right back.

631
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:26,460
 Sure, OK.

632
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:28,100
 Homer, just step out here, please.

633
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:31,460

 - Wait, just a second.

667
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,020

00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:20,020

 - Goodbye! - Bye!

671
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:36,560
 Well, then I think I'll start carrying some of the things out to the kitchen.

672
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:39,560
 - Ah, those are nice boys. - Yes, all of them.

673
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:42,560
 Here you are, everybody. Anybody want some ginger ale?

674
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,560
 Henry, they've all gone. They've gone.

675
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:48,560
 Yes, Henry. And you know that was almost the nicest evening I think I ever had.

676
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:51,560
 She was... You mean I have to drink all this ginger ale myself?

677
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,560
 Mary, will you answer the door?

678
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:56,560
 My goodness, is that... Is that someone at the door?

679
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,560
 Hello, Mary.

680
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,560
 Oh, hello.

681
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,560
 I just came back to ask you something.

682
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,560
 Yes.

683
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,560
 Do you mind if I drop into Maronite when there aren't any other guys around?

684
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,560
 I know.

685
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:10,160
 No matter a fact, I got five dollars here I didn't really expect to have and I wondered

686
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,560
 whether you'd like to go to the movies with me.

687
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,560
 Why, yes, I'd love to.

688
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,560
 And I've got something else I think I ought to tell you.

689
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,560
 What?

690
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,560
 I'm not really a sergeant.

691
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,560
 I'm a private.

692
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,560
 I knew you were.

693
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,560
 Huh?

694
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,560
 You did it?

695
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,560
 Well, I got something else to tell you.

696
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,560
 What is it?

697
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,160
 My real name isn't Joe Burch.

698
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,560
 I know it isn't.

699
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,560
 How'd you know?

700
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,560
 I found this letter you must have dropped,

701
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:33,560
 and naturally I knew here.

702
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,560
 Oh, thank you. You didn't read it, did you?

703
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,560
 Oh, no.

704
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,560
 But there's something I would like to tell you.

705
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,560
 What?

706
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,560
 I think you look very nice in your uniform.

707
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,560
 Yeah?

708
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,560
 And tomorrow night when we go out,

709
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,560
 I'm gonna wear the same brown dress.

710
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,560
 Yeah?

711
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,560
 Well, it's a nice dress.

712
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,560
 Only do you have anything in light blue?

713
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,560
 Oh, light blue?

714
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,560
 Yes.

715
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,640
 Light blue is my favorite color.

716
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,240
 Good night.

717
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,640
 Good night.

718
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,440
 Mother, father.

719
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,080
 What, Mary?

720
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,920
 You suppose we could afford--

721
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:03,360
 well, first of all, I want to tell you something.
