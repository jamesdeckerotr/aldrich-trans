 Youth is so wonderful a thing.

 It's a shame to waste it on the young.

 But grown-ups can always recapture some of their teenage

 Henry, you're too impulsive, especially when it comes to girl.

00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,280
 But she was already sitting when I came over to your table.

23
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,280
 You should have waited till she stood up.

24
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,680
 Sure, that's easy enough to say now, Homer.

 When she has them on, I mean.

00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,260
 Now, wait a minute, Homer.

54
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:51,560
 Are you insinuating that Helen's eyelashes come on and off?

70
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:37,880
 about it? That'd give you at least three inches. Sure. Well what happens when I

71
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:42,880
 take it off? You don't. You mean I keep it on all evening? My father wouldn't mind.

72
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:47,040
 Listen Homer, how would you like it if you were a girl and the fella kept his

73
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:55,360
 Derby on all evening. Okay. How about? No. What? How about what? I was gonna suggest

74
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:01,040
 you go to a beauty parlor and get them to fix your hair so it stood up straight. That's

75
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:09,200
 silly. Yeah. Sure. We never last all evening. Suppose what? Suppose we planned the date

76
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:14,840
 so you never had to stand up all during. Huh? Look, you phoned Helen just before you're

77
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:19,400
 supposed to pick her up on Saturday and tell her it's going to be very crowded at the movie.

78
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:23,960
 So you're going to hurry over there and hold two seats and she can meet you inside.

79
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:29,560
 Then you're already sitting when she gets there. Sure! But how do we get out of the movie without

80
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:37,240
 her seeing me stand up I mean. Oh let's see. When you see the part coming where you came in

81
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:42,840
 you ask her what flavor ice cream she likes. Suppose it's caramel delight. Yeah. You say that

82
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:47,840
 The dehaven structure always runs out of caramel delight very early on Saturday night.

83
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:48,340
 Yeah?

84
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:51,240
 So you're gonna rush over there and reserve some.

85
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,140
 By the time Helen gets there, you're sitting again.

86
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:55,740
 I don't know, Homer.

87
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:56,940
 Why not?

00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:01,340
 So far, you're two-thirds through the date and she hasn't seen it your full length once.

89
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:02,740
 That's true.

90
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:08,040
 Although, actually, I'll be spending most of the date running away from her, won't I?

91
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,940
 Not necessarily, him.

 Oh, that's nice.

 Never mind, Agnes.

 - Helen sees a friend at another table,

136

 so she turns around a wave to her in the minute of dancing.

137

 That's the worst thing in the world under the circumstances.

 I'm sorry, Helen, but it never occurred to me that Henry might be shorter than you.

00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,600
 That's all I've worried about since we made the day.

 Oh my goodness, yes.

 Well, I guess that's what makes horse racing.

 What should I do, Agnes?

151
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,000
 You want me to call him and cancel a dance?

152
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 No, he'll guess why and hate me for him.

 Oh no, he'll hate me every minute he's dancing with me.

 Let me see you walk again.

 Can you tell?

163
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:53,880
 If I weren't with you while you had it done, him, I'd never know.

 How did you do it, Mr. Bridges?

165
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,880
 Why, I just built his shoes up on the inside.

 How do they feel, Henry?

 That's because most of the build-up is in the heel. You'll get used to it.

00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,880
 Yeah, that-- oops, not too far.

177
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,880
 How much?

178
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,880
 Come forward again.

179
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:35,880
 Little more, more, more. Hold it. Okay. How does he look to you now, Mr. Bridges?

180
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:39,880
 Why, you look fine, Henry. Fine. In a few minutes you'll feel as though you've been wearing

181
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:45,880
 them all your life. Sure. Well, thanks a lot, Mr. Bridges. Goodbye. Fine, Mr. Bridges.

00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:50,880
 Goodbye, boys. How does it feel, Hen? Very comfortable.

183
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,480
 No, I mean up there.

184
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:58,880
 Oh, I think this air is a little cleaner.

185
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:03,480
 Yeah, no one to tall people are healthier than short people.

 Gee whiz, I'll marry you.

187
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,080
 I only built them up an inch.

188
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,440
 Well, you never--

00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,760
 Wait a minute.

00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,520
 Come on, Henry.

193
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,880
 Homer, you won't say anything to her about--

194
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,080
 you know what, will you?

195
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,160
 Of course not.

196
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,480
 Gee whiz, what do you think I am, a cad?

197
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,320
 Listen, homie.

198
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,060
 I know I don't like to be kept waiting.

199
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:25,060
 - Hi, Henry.

200
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:27,120
 - Hi, Agnes.

201
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,280
 Well, I'd better get home, Homer.

202
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,160
 See you later, kids.

203
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,000
 - Sure.

204
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 Sure.

205
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,320
 - So long, Hen.

206
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,960
 Oh, what I wanted to talk to you about, Agnes.

207
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,680
 Why are you looking at me like that?

208
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,680
 - You know something, Homer.

209
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,680
 - Why?

210
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,480

 Alice, you know where Henry is?

213
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:05,080
 Not exactly, Sam. He said he had a problem to work out, something about a charity.

214
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:09,180
 Oh, that's nice. I'm glad to see he's getting interested in civic affairs.

215
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:13,780
 By the way, dear, that reminds me. Are we going to the charity dance at the club this Saturday?

216
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:16,680
 Oh, let's not, Alice. I'm too tired.

217
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,240
 My goodness, Sam, what's the matter with you lately?

218
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:23,560
 You haven't done a stitch of exercise in two months, I'd say.

219
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,440
 That's not true.

221
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,320
 just to-- is it really two months?

222
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,400
 At least.

223
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,240
 And dear, you're beginning to barge.

224
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:32,920
 Barge?

225
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:33,480
 Me?

226
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,520
 Where?

227
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:37,160
 Oh, besides I'm not as young as I used to be.

228
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:40,640
 That's exactly why you should be getting some exercise, dear.

229
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,560

237
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:15,080
 Skates father, I don't have in my skates, huh?

238
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:18,080
 Oh, well, what in the world was all that?

239
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,080
 Henry.

240
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,080
 Yes, father?

241
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:25,080
 Are you wearing your trouser belt a little higher, these days?

242
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,080
 She was, no.

243
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:30,080
 Oh, it seemed to me.

244
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,080
 Oh.

245
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,080
 May I go upstairs now?

246
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,080
 Well, yes, yes, certainly.

247
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,080
 See you later.

248
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,080
 Yes.

249
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,080
 Hello?

250
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,080
 Yes, dear.

251
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:45,080
 What were you just saying about a person shriveling up?

252
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:57,080
 But father, why can't I have it done?

253
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:00,080
 Because, home, there's nothing wrong with you as you are.

254
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,080
 Nothing that build up shoes could help that is.

255
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:05,080
 But how would you like it if your girl called you a shrimp?

256
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,720
 Now dear, you just eat your spinach and you'll get to all that.

257
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,880
 Spinach isn't what made Henry tall.

258
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,680
 Do as your mother told you, Homer. Eat your spinach.

259
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,240
 But why can't I have my shoes built up?

260
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,320
 Because spinach is cheaper than leather.

261
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:20,920
 I don't like spinach.

262
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:23,400
 It's good for you. Here, have some of mine.

263
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,160
 Well, you eat your spinach too.

264

 Why? I'm tall enough.

00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,280
 Now, will.

00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,960
 What do you mean by a statement like that?

267
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,040
 Father, you're not so tall either.

268
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:32,760
 What?

269
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:35,160
 All I meant in our family are shrimp.

270
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,160
 Is that so?

271
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,160
 Sure, look at Uncle Harry.

00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,660
 He's a head and a half shorter than an Amy.

273
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:43,060
 And Amy is an exceptionally tall woman.

274
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,960
 Oh, you really think so, Will?

275
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:45,960
 What?

276
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,960
 Well, I'm a good four inches taller than Uncle Harry.

277
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,560
 Well, at least three inches.

278
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,360
 To winch it?

00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,360
 Listen Henry, how much longer are we gonna wait for?

280
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,080
 I saw her go into Agnes's house almost an hour ago.

281
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,560
 She's gotta come out soon.

282
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,920
 Okay.

283
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,160
 What makes you think an inch isn't enough?

284
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,640
 Well, I caught a glimpse of Helen at school today,

285
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,320
 standing next to Charlie Clark.

286
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,960
 And from where I was standing,

287
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,400
 she seemed about an inch taller than Charlie.

288
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,320
 No kidding.

289
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,160
 Sure.

290
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:26,400
 And a little later I saw Charlie talking to Francine Lita.

291
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,600
 He looked about two and a half inches taller than Francine.

292
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,480
 That's who you should have made the date with.

293
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,320
 Charlie?

294
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,320
 Oh, Francine.

295
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,120
 She doesn't excite me.

296
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:39,200
 Anyway, just for the fun of it, I went over to talk to Francine.

297
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,240
 It seemed to me I was about three inches taller.

298
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:42,800
 So?

299
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,960
 So don't you see?

300
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,880
 If I'm three inches taller than Francine,

301
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:48,080
 who's two and a half inches shorter than Charlie, who's

302
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,780
 an inch shorter than Helen, that still makes me about a half

303
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:52,400
 inch too short.

00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,160

 - That high?

316
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,760
 Seemed to me it was closer to down there.

 trying to build himself up to the exact height of the girl he

354
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:14,820
 has to date with for a dance.

355
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:18,940
 So far, he's succeeded only in making Mr. Ulrich apparently

356
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:20,180
 shriveled.

357
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,100
 But singing his Agnes' house.

358
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,700
 The time is the following day.

359
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:26,700
 - But a few in Henry go to the church supper.

360
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:29,060
 Helen all after dance, every dance went home.

361
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:31,740
 - I'm sorry Agnes, but at a supper you sit.

362
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:32,580
 - Hello?

363
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:33,940
 - Hello, is this Henry Aldrin?

364
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:34,780
 - Speaking.

365
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:36,020
 - This is Helen Henry.

366
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:39,220
 - Oh, please, I mean, hello.

367
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:42,260
 - Henry, the church is having a supper this Sunday night.

368
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:43,100
 - Really?

369
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,740
 - Uh huh, and I thought you might prefer going to that.

370
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:46,580
 - Why?

371
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:49,460
 - Well, uh, uh.

372
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:51,160
 Oh, you mean...

373
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,460
 Uh...

374
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:54,460
 Yes.

375
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:57,460
 Well, if you think...

376
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:59,460
 Helen, wait!

377
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:01,460
 One minute, Henry. What is it, Agnes?

378
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:03,460
 Did you see what it says in the ad for the church supper?

379
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:04,460
 No, what?

380
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:07,460
 It's a buffet supper you have to eat standing.

381
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,460
 Oh, and there's square dancing afterwards!

382
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:10,460
 Oh, my!

383
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:14,460
 Hello, Henry. You don't really want to go to the church supper, do you?

384
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:15,460
 Do you?

385
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:29,460
 Up, two, three, four. Down, two, three, four.

386
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:30,460
 But dear.

387
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:31,460
 Up, two, three, four.

388
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:34,460
 Oh, they at the gym are now these weights at home.

389
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:36,460
 I thought you wanted me to exercise.

390
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:38,460
 Yes, but not as a full-time job.

391
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:41,460
 Two, three, four. Up, two, out.

392
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,460
 For what happened?

393
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:46,640
 I think something gay Sam old rich that's enough for today

394
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,740
 Maybe you're right Alice

395
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:55,340
 Do I look any less shriveled much dear? Well, I feel a lot better

396
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:58,580
 Would you mind helping me to the couch? I think I'll lie down

397
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:09,340
 In here Homer, how you mr. Oldrich great? That's nice worse Henry in his room there. Thanks. See you later mr. Oldrich

398
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:11,420
 I'll be right here Homer flat on my back

399
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:17,420
 Hi, him. Hi, Oliver. I ran over as soon as I got your missu-

400
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:26,420
 Boy, Mr. Bridges certainly went to town on your shoes this time. He added another soul and double heel.

401
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:30,420
 Oh boy. I mean, I don't think I'm tall enough yet.

402
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:35,420
 What? Listen, Homer Helen phoned me a little while ago. What for? I think she's worried too.

403
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:38,020
 Yeah, well what'd you want me for?

404
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:43,620
 Well, I figure I'll know exactly how much build up I need if I can get someone to find

405
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,120
 out her exact height.

406
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,420
 Oh no, not me.

407
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:50,820
 Homer, let's go downtown and have a soda.

408
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:51,820
 Unmea.

409
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:54,620
 And I'll tell you just what I have in mind.

410
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,020
 Well, okay.

411
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:59,920
 Boy, you think you've got troubles.

412
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:00,920
 Look at me.

413
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,020
 If you can see that far down.

414
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:06,380
 Listen Homer, being this high up has its disadvantages too.

415
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,180
 Like what?

416
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:09,020
 Like doorknobs for instance.

417
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:10,140
 What about doorknobs?

418
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:11,340
 I keep missing them.

419
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:13,180
 Overshooting.

420
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:14,620
 No kidding.

421
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:16,060
 Sure.

422
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:20,140
 It's going to be even worse with this new build up on top of the old build up.

423
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:20,940
 She...

424
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:23,260
 Now just relax Sam, try to rest.

425
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:24,860
 Hello mother, hi father.

426
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:25,580
 Hello, Henry.

427
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:27,020
 Oh my.

428
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:28,300
 Father, what's the matter?

429
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,100
 Sam!

430
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:32,940
 Up two three four down two three four.

431
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:41,940
 [MUSIC]

432
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,760
 Agnes, are you sure you don't mind

433
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,440
 learning me your eyelashes for Saturday?

434
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,060
 >> Of course not.

435
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,120
 >> Hi Agnes.

436
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,060
 >> Wow.

437
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,520
 >> Hello, Helen.

438
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,380
 >> Hello Homer.

439
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:52,680
 >> What do you want?

440
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:58,420
 >> I just happened to be passing by and I didn't know you had company Agnes.

441
00:19:58,420 --> 00:19:59,780
 >> Well now you know.

442
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:00,140
 >> Yeah.

443
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:03,140
 And what we're talking about is strictly private.

444
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,640
 I think I better go.

445
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,860
 Whoa.

446
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:08,700
 So long every.

447
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:12,420
 Boy, that's a beautiful pin you have on Helen.

448
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:13,420
 Oh, thank you, Homer.

449
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,260
 Can I see it?

450
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:15,700
 I was thinking of buying one.

451
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:16,820
 Let him see it, Helen.

452
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:17,740
 For my mother.

453
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:19,040
 Goodbye, Homer.

454
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,940
 (audience laughing)

455
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:21,780
 Goodbye.

456
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:23,060
 So long.

457
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:24,900
 So long.

458
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:25,740
 Homer.

459
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:26,740
 Yes, Agnes?

460
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:27,660
 Beat it.

461
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:30,100
 By the way, Helen, have you heard about the newest answer

462
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:34,540
 doing the girl stands up and the boy stands with his back to the girl like

463
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:37,100
 this and turns his head all the way around as far as...

464
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:54,480
 -H

465
00:20:54,480 --> 00:21:00,680
 Well hello there Will. Oh hello Sam. How are you doing sitting here on a fire hydrant waiting for a bus?

466
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:06,400
 No, no, I just had my shoes my feet hurt a bit. I thought I'd sit down and rest a while

467
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:12,620
 Oh, well come on. I walk you home exercise. I'll do us both good sure. Let's go

468
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:16,160
 As a matter of fact talking about exercise

469
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:19,420
 You know you're leaning forward a bit well

470
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:25,940
 I am. How's that? That's better.

471
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:29,940
 Talking about exercise, I noticed that...

472
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:33,180
 What's the matter, Sam? Why are you looking at me like that?

473
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:38,460
 Nothing. Nothing. Oh. By the way, Sam, I think there's a

474
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:44,620
 speck of dust down there on the top of your hat. There it is. I don't see it.

475
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:47,620
 Well, maybe you just looked like it from up here.

476
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:48,620
 Oh.

477
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:52,620
 Uh, well, do you mind walking home by yourself?

478
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:53,620
 Why, where are you going, Sam?

479
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:54,620
 Back to the gym.

480
00:21:54,620 --> 00:22:08,620
 Can't you walk a little faster than the girls are waiting?

481
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:13,620
 I'd like to see you walk down steps any faster on stilts practically.

482
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:14,620
 Practically.

483
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:18,500
 Maybe you shouldn't have put on two pair of sweat socks in.

484
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:22,020
 Maybe the three cardboard in our soles would have been enough.

485
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:23,020
 Maybe.

486
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:26,220
 Who measured himself against Talon and said I needed another wrench.

487
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,860
 Boy, my ankles are killing me.

488
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:29,860
 There.

489
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:32,500
 Is it easier on level ground, Hen?

490
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,500
 A little.

491
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:34,500
 Mother, we're going...

492
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:38,500
 Dear, are you sure your father said you could have the car?

493
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,500
 Positive.

494
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,860
 What exactly did he say?

495
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:42,860
 Nothing.

496
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:56,060
 looked up at me and handed over the keys. Oh well have a nice time boys. Henry the phone is probably for you. Oh thank you. Hello? Henry. Yes Father hold it I'll get mother. I know Henry I want to speak to you. Oh you're

497
00:22:56,060 --> 00:23:08,180
 gonna so kill me. What is it Father? I want you to come and get me. What? Where are you? Down at the Y. All the way down there? Father how about taking a bus home? The girls are waiting for us.

498
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:10,880
 Girls can wait, Henry, they don't have sprained back.

499
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:11,880
 Do you, Father?

500
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:12,880
 In three places.

501
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,880
 Well, how about a taxon?

502
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,880
 Poor an ambulance.

503
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,880
 Henry, this is partly your fault.

504
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,880
 My fault and what way, Father?

505
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,880
 Never mind, just come down and pick me up.

506
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:22,880
 Yes, Father.

507
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:37,280
 Henry said for me to pick up you on Hell and then heat me to share it today.

508
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,280
 Where is he?

509
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,280
 I don't know.

510
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,280
 She'd have been here by now.

511
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,080
 She better come to look at poor Helen.

512
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,080
 She's been sitting there since we got here.

513
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,080
 Yeah.

514
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,960
 By the way, Agnes, what happened to her?

515
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:48,960
 What do you mean?

516
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,880
 Well, she doesn't seem to be as high off as she used to.

517
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:53,880
 Oh, that.

518
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,360
 Homer, can you keep a secret?

519
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,360
 You know me, Agnes.

520
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,480
 Yeah, but I'll tell you anyway.

521
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:02,760
 Would you see Helen thought Henry was too short for us, so she's wearing her hair as

522
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:05,760
 flat as possible in the lowest heels she could find.

523
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:11,680
 Oh boy, but Henry spent the whole week building up his shoe so he'd be tall enough hours.

524
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,680
 No kidding.

525
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:15,080
 Sure, he's gonna tower over and now.

526
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,600
 Homer, hello, Mar.

527
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,920
 Someone wants to see you outside.

528
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,920
 Me?

529
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:19,920
 That's right.

530
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:20,920
 Excuse me, Ag.

531
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:21,920
 With pleasure, excuse me, Mar.

532
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:22,920
 My dad's being tall.

533
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:23,920
 Pssst.

534
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:30,360
 Homer, over here, behind the bush.

535
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,600
 Henry, what's the matter?

536
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,600
 Listen, Homer.

537
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,600
 A terrible thing just happened.

538
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,600
 Why?

539
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:39,200
 I was downtown helping my father into the car, see?

540
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:39,700
 Yeah.

541
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:42,520
 And in the struggle, my foot got caught on the running board,

542
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,300
 and one of my heels came off.

543
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,800
 [LAUGHTER]

544
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,560
 Just look at me.

545
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,760
 Henry, you shrunk.

546
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,320
 Completely.

547
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,840
 Couldn't you put it back on?

548
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:53,680
 No.

549
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,320
 It rolled down the sewer.

550
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,840
 [LAUGHTER]

551
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,840
 Boy, that's great.

552
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,800
 Homer, I thought you were a pal.

553
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,480
 You don't understand him.

554
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,120
 Helen's much smaller now.

555
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:04,560
 What?

556
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,960
 She's wearing her head and shoes flat.

557
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,260
 Really?

558
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:11,760
 Sure, you'll be just right for her now.

559
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,460
 Oh boy!

560
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:16,360
 Humber, where are you?

561
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,760
 Coming Agnes, look who's here.

562
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:21,160
 Henry, will I'm glad to see...

563
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,960
 Homer, I thought you told me he was...

564
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,860
 He was, but now he is.

565
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:27,960
 Come on, let's go in. I'm dying to dance.

566
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:28,760
 Where's Helen?

567
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,260
 Oh boy!

568
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:31,660
 Agnes, what's the matter?

569
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:33,060
 Homer, you told...

570
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:34,660
 So I told Helen...

571
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:35,660
 And why?

572
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:39,060
 She went home to get her high heel shoes again!

573
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:41,060
 Well, Gee, you were...

574
00:25:41,060 --> 00:26:00,260
 Why, how many of you have a child dance?

575
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:01,660
 Or anyone who knows something else?

576
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:02,460
 What, Agnes?

577
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:04,460
 Where'd I get the idea you were a shrimp?

578
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:06,460
 Tonight you seem much taller.

579
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:07,460
 I do.

580
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:10,460
 Yes, and lots stronger too, homeroal kid.

581
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:11,460
 What a man!

582
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:12,460
 She is.

583
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:14,460
 I am sure.

584
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:17,460
 Now when you step on my feet, I can feel it.

585
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:22,460
 Well, ladies, there is one time when appearances are never deceiving.

586
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:26,460
 That's when you serve colorful, shimmering, jello for dessert.

587
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:29,460
 Because jello, with that tempting fruit-like goodness,

588
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:31,460
 always tastes as good as it looks.

589
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:36,460
 In any of those six delicious flavors, strawberry, raspberry, cherry, orange,

590
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:41,460
 lemon, or lime, every jello flavor is a special treat in itself,

591
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:43,460
 rich with that famous locked in goodness.

592
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:48,460
 Flavors seal right in by a special process, so it can't get out to your first

593
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:52,460
 delectable spoonful. Look for it on your grocery's dessert shelf tomorrow.

594
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:55,460
 Look for those big red letters on the box.

595
00:26:55,460 --> 00:27:00,460
 Those big red letters stand for the jello family of yum yum desserts.

596
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:01,460
 desserts.

597
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:20,460
 Hey Henry, guess what? You've won a prize. A prize? No kidding. Sure. Go ahead Henry.

598
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:27,660
 The Downey Donut Award. Huh. Presented to Ezra Stone as Henry Aldridge as the boy who

599
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:35,660
 typifies the nation's ideal teenage donut donut donker. Boy that's wow. The only thing is him. Why?

600
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:39,660
 Don't I get anything? Sure homie you'll get to carry it.

601
00:27:56,660 --> 00:28:05,160
 The Aldrich family starring Ezra Stone is Henry with Jackie Kalka's Homer is written by Frank Tarlov with music by Jack Miller.

602
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:09,160
 Ms. Grinn Mrs. Aldrich, our house Jamison and Catherine Rod.

603
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:15,660
 And this is Dan Seymour in New York saying, "The Aldrich family is brought to you by the Jell-O family."

604
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:20,660
 Oh, the big red ladder stand for the Jello family.

605
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:24,660
 Oh, the big red ladder stand for the Jello family.

606
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:26,660
 That's Jello, yum, yum, yum.

607
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:28,660
 Jello pudding, yum, yum, yum.

608
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:32,660
 Jello tap, b-y-o-ka pudding, yam, sari.

609
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:40,660
 New as new as a square egg.

610
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:42,660
 Amazing, the only one of its kind.

611
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:44,060
 That's minute rice.

612
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:46,660
 Minute rice for magically quick, quick meals.

613
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:49,060
 You've never tasted such true rice flavor.

614
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,760
 You've never seen rice so light, white, and fluffy.

615
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,560
 And all you do is drop it in water and bring to a boil.

616
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,960
 No washing, rinsing, draining, or steaming.

617
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,160
 Minute rice is quicker to fix than potatoes.

618
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:03,160
 You'll want to use it in all sorts of combinations for quick, quick meals.

619
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,460
 Remember the name "minute"?

620
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:06,960
 Minute rice in the red, white, and blue box.

00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:27,960
 Quick George, Patchessy Kase. We've got a New York on the rocket ship.

624
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:28,960
 What?

625
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,960
 The engineer in the control room says we're going from coast to coast in 40 seconds.

626
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:36,200
