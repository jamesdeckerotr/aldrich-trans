 and Jackie Calcas-Homer.

9
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:47,360
 There's one secret a teenage boy like Henry Aldrich never

10
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,440
 knows.

11
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:52,120
 The troubles he can get into are familiar to all grownups.

12
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:55,800
 His mishaps of today are his memories of tomorrow.

 Look at her.

17
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,600
 Oh boy, is she good-looking?

18
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,440
 Oh boy, Henry.

19
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,680
 That's a loud Homer.

20
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,160
 Look at her.

21
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,600
 She must be coming to visit the Clark.

 Oh boy, Henry.

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,840
 What are you supposed to name this?

24
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,080
 How should I know what her name is?

25
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,720
 She's kissing Charlie Clark's mother.

26
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,880
 Oh boy.

27
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,880

 Oh.

00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,080
 Listen, Homer, close your mouth.

32
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,920
 Look, Henry, they're putting her in the car

33
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,320
 and driving off with you.

00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,680

 Hey, Charlie, your friend dropped something.

00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,080
 Hey, Charlie, come back.

00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:55,920
 Here it is.

41
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,760
 It's an envelope.

42
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,600
 An envelope?

43
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,440
 Is it for me?

44
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,440
 No, Homer.

 Do you suppose that's her name?

50
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,400
 Is there anything in the envelope?

00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,240
 No.

00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,320
 Listen, give me that.

 - Come on, Henry.

59
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:30,140
 This next block down there is where Charlie Clark lives.

60
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:33,100
 Boy, wait 'til I ever ask Charlie to do me a favor again.

00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,340
 You just wait, Homer.

62
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:35,940
 - Did he hang up when you asked him

63
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,100
 if you could meet Dorothy?

64
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,340
 - Sure he did.

65
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,300
 Look out, I'm gonna start limping.

66
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,100
 - Henry, that's no way to do it.

67
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:44,500
 You mean you're just gonna limp in and meet Dorothy?

68
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,260
 Why not?

00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,420
 Henry, you've gotta do it right.

71
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:49,900
 You've gotta fall down right in front of the car town.

72
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,600
 For sure.

73
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,340
 You mean, just walk along and then all of a sudden fall down?

74
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:54,940
 No.

75
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,460
 You start running, see?

76
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,820
 And then I'll trip you, and then I'll carry you in.

77
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:01,260
 Now listen, Homer, I'm not gonna do anything like that.

78
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:03,260
 I can fall down without your help of me.

79
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:05,060
 Come on, we'll just be jogging along.

80
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,060
 OK.

81
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,660
 And just as you fall, Henry, be laughing.

82
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:11,700
 Well, here I go, Homer.

83
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:15,060
 Now listen, Henry, what did you do this to me for?

84
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,740
 Did you fall down too, Homer?

85
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:17,740
 You can't get up.

86
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:18,940
 I can't get up.

87
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:21,340
 Homer, you didn't fall any harder than I did.

88
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:22,540
 Come on over here and pick me up.

89
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:25,180

90
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,540
 Oh, no, you didn't.

91
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,700
 I know you, Homer.

92
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,700
 You're just trying to get Dorothy's sympathy.

93
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:30,620
 Now, come on.

94
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,220
 I've got a lie here until you pick me up.

95
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:35,620
 Well, hold up your head so I can get a hold of you.

96
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:36,980
 Easy now, Homer.

97
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:37,660

00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,380

101
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:46,220
 Can I stop trying to show off and give me some cooperation?

 Oh, no, I don't.

00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:59,420
 I stay right there with you.

00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:08,100
 Hello there, boys.

00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:19,820
 Why, I tell you, Mr. Clark, Homer, I mean, I just fell down.

117
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,520
 Didn't anyone see me out the window?

118
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,020
 Oh no, did you hurt yourself?

119
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:27,720
 Well, just as soon as I get in on the sofa, Mr. Clark, I think I'll be all right.

120
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,720
 Well, if you hurt your leg pretty bad, you just put your arm around my shoulder and let me lead you.

121
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,220
 See, that'd be swell, Mr. Clark.

122
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,720
 All right, here we go.

123
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,520
 But Mr. Clark, we're going down the steps.

124
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:39,820
 That's right, I've got my car out here, now it's just on my way downtown and now.

125
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:42,420
 But Mr. Clark, we were on our way inside.

 Well, Homer, you get around the other side of Henry.

00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,820
 Yes, sir. But where are we going?

128
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,820
 Down to the hospital. I'll have him there in two minutes.

 I'm sure I'm home, Homer. Who's in jail over here?

 Nobody. I just thought I'd come over and see how...

 Listen, Henry, what happened at the hospital?

 Nothing, Homer. Nothing at all.

141

 They didn't do anything.

 From Mr. Clark was trying to get someone to take care of me,

 I sneaked out and ran home.

00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,900
 She is. And he doesn't know where you are?

145
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,380
 No. How could he?

146
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:30,700
 Well, listen, Henry. You know that envelope of Dorothy's you picked up?

147
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:33,740
 Yeah. Well, why don't we call her up and tell her we found it?

148
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:36,740
 Homer, you're crazy. Why would she want with an empty envelope?

149
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:37,940
 She probably threw it away.

150
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:40,820
 Alright, alright, then let's not tell what it is.

151
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,820
 We'll just say we've got something of hers,

152
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,820
 and would she like to have us bring it over?

 Now wait a minute, Homer, did Nysh your first?

155

 Did Nysh pick up the envelope?

156
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,180
 Isn't this my phone?

 But sure, Homer, of course you are.

166
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:10,580
 That's why I'm gonna ask Dorothy whether she doesn't have a friend who would like to meet you.

167
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:16,980
 Oh no you're not. Every time anybody meets a pretty girl they say can she get a friend someplace behind her?

00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:47,740
 You mean you're going to call her? Charlie?

181
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,740
 Is he going to hit me? Is he going to?

182
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,740
 Sure he's going to. He can't bluff me, Homer.

183
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:55,140
 I'll say he can. That's the only way to handle Charlie.

184
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:57,540
 Just talk right up to him and put him in his place.

185
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:59,940
 Hello? Oh. Hello.

186
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:02,940
 I... I...

187
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,940
 Is that you?

188
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:06,940
 Yes?

189
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:09,940
 Well, yeah, I guess you wonder...

190
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:11,940
 I'm Henry Orr, you see, and...

191
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:14,940
 Probably Charlie hasn't told you, but...

192
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,940
 I play center on a basketball team.

193
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:17,940
 Yes, I know!

194
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,940
 You know?

195
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,940
 Is that a ride?

196
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:24,940
 Did you happen to know about the track meet I was in last spring?

197
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:28,940
 I mean, well, I didn't win in the first, but I got two-thirds,

198
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:31,940
 and I might have won the poll vote if I hadn't broken my poll.

199
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:32,940
 Yes, I know how about it!

200
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,940
 Is that a ride?

201
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:37,940
 Well, I guess I know almost as much about you too.

202
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:39,940
 I saw you downtown this morning.

203
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:40,940
 You did?

204
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:41,940
 Down by the station.

205
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:44,940
 Boy, the man I saw you.

206
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,940
 Boy.

207
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:48,940
 The station? I wasn't down at the station today.

208
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:51,940
 Sure you were. And you dropped something.

209
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:53,940
 Wouldn't you like to have me bring it over?

210
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:54,940
 Is this Henry Aldridge?

211
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,940
 Sure, isn't this Dorothy Hopkins?

212
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,940
 No, it's Geraldine Love.

213
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,940
 How'd you know I was over here at Charlie Parks?

214
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,940
 Geraldine?

215
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:03,940
 Geraldine, not Dorothy?

216
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,440
 You're Geraldine Long.

217
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,440
 Henry, all, should you think you were talking to Donnie Hopkins like that?

218
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,940
 How'd you get on the phone?

219
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,940
 Charlie told me you wanted to speak to me.

220
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:15,940
 And if you're that hot-up to me, if you're clean as of any girl that happens to come into town,

221
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:17,440
 Henry, would you go after her?

222
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,940
 He never mind. Just forget the whole thing. Goodbye.

223
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:21,940
 Come on, Henry. Shall we start over?

224
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:24,940
 No, Homer. I think we'd better just rock the whole thing.

225
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:25,940
 whole thing.

226
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:36,940
 (Music)

227
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:37,940
 Hello Mr. Allerich speaking.

228
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:39,940
 Hello Mr. Allerich this is Mr. Clark.

229
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:40,940
 Oh yes Mr. Clark good morning.

230
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:43,940
 I'm sorry to bother you but I'm down at the hospital and I need some advice.

231
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:44,940
 Yes?

232
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:45,940
 Have you been in an accident?

233
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:46,940
 Well no not exactly that.

234
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,940
 Well whatever it is I'll be glad to help you out.

235
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:49,940
 What's the trouble?

236
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:50,940
 Well I don't know how to begin.

237
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,940
 Have you heard from Henry?

238
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:55,940
 A man, Ray? No. No, why would I hear from him?

239
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,940
 Well, I guess I better tell you the whole thing, Mr. Aldrich.

240
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:00,940
 I don't want to upset you, but he fell down in front of our house, eh?

241
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,940
 Yes. And he's over at the hospital?

242
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:06,940
 Well, he was here, but when I stepped out of the receiving room for a minute, he disappeared.

243
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:08,940
 He disappeared? What became of it?

244
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:14,940
 Well, that's what we don't know. I have phoned your house a couple of times. The line was busy, but let me assure you there ain't anything to worry about, Mr. Aldrich.

245
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:15,940
 I just think you should know about it.

246
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,940
 Yes, of course. Was he able to walk?

247
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:22,620
 to walk by yes yes at least I helped him in another car and nobody's only the

248
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:25,860
 hospital so we think he must still be around here yes well I'll be right down

249
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:28,740
 and Mr. Clark all I have to do is call the courthouse and cancel two hearings

250
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:31,260
 well how you about it Mr. Aldrich could you call my secretary and tell me to

251
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:33,780
 cancel all my appointments for this morning well that's very kind of you

252
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:35,140
 Mr. Clark I'd be glad to call her

253
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:48,320
 Now listen Charlie Clark, go on, get away from in front of our house.

254
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,980
 You make me Henry, you make me.

255
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,360
 Henry come on, close your window and ignore him.

256
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,760
 Homer stop pulling on my shirt.

257
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,420
 They know how to handle Charlie.

258
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:57,320
 Charlie I want to tell you something.

259
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,660
 You're standing out there on my father's front lawn.

260
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:02,060
 And he spent a lot of money on grass seed last fall.

261
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:05,460
 And if none of it comes up next summer, I'm going to tell him who's the cause of it.

262
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:07,220
 And let me tell you something.

263
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:09,420
 What is it you've got that belongs to Dorothy Hopkins?

264
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:10,600
 And why should I tell you?

265
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,620
 Because she's my cousin and she told me to come over and get it, that's why.

266
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:14,620
 Is that so?

267
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,620
 Well, in the first place, I don't even have anything.

268
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,420
 Oh, yes you have. Oh, yes you have.

269
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,020
 And what's more, I know what it is.

270
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,420
 All right, then what is it?

271
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:22,520
 What is it?

272
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,620
 Never mind, never mind.

273
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:26,620
 But you've got to throw it down to me right away.

274
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:29,020
 And I want to tell you another thing, a bit breaks when you throw it.

275
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,020
 You're responsible.

276
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,120
 Is that so?

277
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,520
 That shows you how much you know.

278
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,120
 Hey, Henry, keep him there a second.

279
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,120
 Will I go get a glass of water to throw it?

280
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,920
 [LAUGHTER]

281
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,620
 Only instead of just a glass full, get a lot.

282
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,620
 Henry, for the last time, do you hear me?

283
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:44,120
 Yes, I hear you.

284
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,660
 So you want me to throw something down to you, huh?

285
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:47,460
 Yes, I do.

286
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,460
 Well, come up here under the window

287
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:50,660
 so you can really catch it.

288
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:51,400
 Why?

289
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,380
 Charlie, I hope you don't think I'm gonna throw anything

290
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:55,020
 as valuable as this to your way out there

291
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,460
 and have you miss it.

292
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:58,860
 All right, then I'm standing closer.

293
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,780
 That isn't close enough.

294
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:02,820
 Come a little closer.

295
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:03,980
 How about this?

296
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:04,740
 Here you are, Henry.

297
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:05,740
 Here's the water.

298
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:06,900
 What can I have got in here?

299
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:07,980
 Oh, she's risen.

300
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,980
 What would you do, fill a bathroom waste basket?

301
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:10,820
 (audience laughs)

302
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,740
 Hurry up, I can hardly carry you.

303
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:13,580
 Here, let me have it.

304
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,940
 Oh, no, Henry, I can shoot straight of the new can.

305
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,860
 OK, but wait until I tell you to.

306
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,380
 Oh, Charlie, hurry up.

307
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:20,460
 I'm hurrying.

308
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:22,500
 I just want to explain one thing.

309
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,380
 When you see Dorothy, be sure you have tarred.

310
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:25,380
 You asked for it.

311
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:26,540
 Stand back, Henry.

312
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:27,380
 Henry?

313
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:29,220
 Oh, she was, mother's at you down there.

314
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,020
 Henry, look out.

315
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,180
 Oh, don't throw it.

316
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:33,020
 What are you doing up in that window, Henry?

317
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:33,580
 Right.

318
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:35,180
 Just getting some fresh air, mother.

319
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:36,020
 I'm closing it.

320
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:41,900
 Now listen Henry, look what you make me do.

321
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,100
 Oh boy, you homework.

322
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,740
 Yes, but all over my room.

323
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:46,100
 All over your room.

324
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,380
 All over myself.

325
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:48,540
 Look at her.

326
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,460
 Well, don't stand there looking at yourself.

327
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:53,140
 Come on, help me mop it up before it leaks through to the living room.

328
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,660
 What do I mop it up with?

329
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:55,420
 Here.

330
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:56,500
 Here, use my pajamas.

331
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,260
 Have one of them for a week anyhow.

332
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,500
 Come on.

333
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,220
 Charlie Clark's still out there.

334
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,820
 I don't know, and I don't care.

335
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,180
 Oh, yes, mother?

336
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,980
 Is that you downstairs?

337
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:06,580
 Hello.

338
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:08,940
 - Will you come down here right, isn't it, Katie?

339
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:10,580
 - Yes, mother, sure.

340
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:11,860
 Do you notice anything leaking?

341
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:14,500
 I mean, it's everything all right down there.

342
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,660
 - What?

343
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,100
 - Hey, Mom, what's the idea of mopping up

344
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,820
 and ringing it right out on the floor again?

345
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:19,820
 (audience laughing)

346
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:21,740
 - I'm ringing it, Mrs. Bazbear.

347
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:22,860
 - Can't wait!

348
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:25,500
 - Yes, mother, don't bother to come all the way up here.

349
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,700
 You saved yourself.

350
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:27,700
 I'm coming down there.

351
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,020
 - Then please hurry.

352
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:31,100
 - Oh, you mean, you wanna have a talk with me

353
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:31,940
 about something?

354
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:34,380
 - Yes, dear, and I want you to sit down here.

355
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:35,220
 - Yes, mother.

356
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:39,220
 I've just been having a talk with Charlie Clark and to say the least Henry, I'm surprised.

357
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:40,220
 You're surprised?

358
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,220
 Yes.

359
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:45,220
 And don't keep looking up at the ceiling. Please look at me and let the ceiling take care of itself.

360
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:48,220
 Oh, excuse me. What did Charlie Clark say?

361
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:54,220
 Now what do you think he said? He said you stole something that belongs to a cousin of his named Dorothy Hopkins.

362
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:57,220
 He said that? He said I stole something from her?

363
00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:00,220
 Yes, dear. And I don't think Charlie would say a thing like that if he didn't have a reason, would he?

364
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:04,220
 But, Mother, I give you my word. I don't steal things. Not from anybody.

365
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:10,220
 Remember, the only time I ever stole anything in my life was that pocket full of candy out of a box in your bureau drawer

366
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:15,220
 about five years ago, and I got caught, and it made me sick. And the site I didn't like it.

367
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:18,220
 Ben, do you know why Charlie said you took comfort?

368
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:22,220
 Well, all I can say is he certainly got a powerful imagination.

369
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:26,220
 He told me that what you have of this Darth is extremely valuable.

370
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:28,220
 He said that. He said that.

371
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:33,220
 He certainly did, and he's going all around town saying you stole it, and I'm going to do something about it.

 I've had a talk with all the nurses. I've just had a talk with the gentleman at the head of this hospital.

380
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:54,220
 And what did he say?

381
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:58,220
 He said Henry couldn't possibly be here. He's never had anyone disappear in his hospital before.

382

 And that's cooperation for you.

383
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:02,260
 for you. Oh he's doing all he can and Mr. Clark I want you to stop feeling that

384
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:05,140
 this is all your fault. Mr. Orange I don't want to worry you but I've been

385
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:08,540
 thinking when I first picked Henry up he was talking about his leg and maybe it

00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:11,940
 was but but what you don't think he could have hit his head too do you.

 Now getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldrich.

432
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:56,340
 In his efforts to meet the new girl that's in town,

433
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:59,060
 Henry first tried to make out he heard his leg.

434
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:02,940
 Next he let her to believe that an empty envelope, which he dropped at the station,

435
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:05,500
 is really something of considerable value.

436
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:09,900
 As the scene opens at Charlie Clark's house, the young lady in question is speaking.

437
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,620
 Oh, I don't blame you, Charlie. I agree with you entirely.

438
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:14,420
 And I'm glad to hear you say that, Dorothy.

439
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:18,540
 Charlie, I wonder what it could be of mine that Henry Aldrich has.

440
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:20,380
 You mean you're having any idea what it is?

441
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:22,340
 I can't think of anything.

442
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:24,180
 Unless it could be my wristwatch.

443
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:26,220
 Oh, your wristwatch. You've lost it?

444
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:31,100
 Well, I haven't lost it exactly. I thought I left it at home on my bureau.

445
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,860
 Because the catch was broken on the stress.

446
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:34,540
 But it still might be your watch, my nit?

447
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:38,740
 Well, tell me, after he refused to throw it out, what did you say?

448
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:42,540
 I said, listen, Henry Aldrich, I don't intend to have any cousin of mine that says,

449
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:45,740
 "Find a young lady as Dorothy Hopkins is, insulted like this."

450
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,940
 Oh, really? Then what did he say?

451
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:51,540
 He didn't say anything. He thought I was going to climb up the side of the house and beat him up,

452
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:52,740
 so he closed the window.

453
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:54,340
 You scared him? You really did?

454
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:57,140
 Sure I did. I even told his mother on him.

455
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:00,740
 Well, frankly, I don't blame Geraldine Muff for getting mad at these bad kind of a boy.

456
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:03,140
 And did you see Geraldine stuck out of here and beat it home?

457
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:05,060
 She said she was never going to speak to Henry again.

458
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:08,060
 I know. And did you notice she was sort of mad at me too?

459
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:10,380
 It wasn't my fault he took my watch.

460
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:13,300
 You mean he did take it? I thought you said he didn't take it.

461
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:18,300
 Well, Charlie, the more I think about it, the more I think about it,

462
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,780
 maybe I didn't leave my watch at home.

463
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:23,860
 Maybe I did put it on just absent-mindedly,

464
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:26,580
 and when I got off at the station, that's where I dropped it.

465
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,300
 Sure you did, of course you did.

466
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,580
 What do you suppose that is?

467
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:32,180
 I don't know, but I'd be willing to make a bet as to who it is.

468
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:33,080
 It's probably Henry.

469
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,780
 Really? Do you think you're really scared

470
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:35,980
 in the debris in my watch bag?

471
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:36,980
 Sure I did.

472
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:39,280
 You should have heard me talk to him, Dorothy.

473
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,680
 How do you do, Charlie? This is Mrs. Aldrich.

474
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,780
 Oh, how do you do?

475
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:44,280
 Is your mother in, Charlie?

476
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,080
 No, ma'am, she isn't Mrs. Aldrich.

477
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,180
 Are you quite sure?

478
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:47,980
 Yes, ma'am.

479
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:49,880
 She got word that my father's down at the hospital,

480
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,980
 so she went down there.

481
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:51,880
 Oh, really?

482
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,080
 I didn't know your father had gone to the hospital.

483
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,880
 Oh, I'm terribly sorry to hear it,

484
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,580
 especially at a time like this.

485
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:59,680
 Did you bring Dorothy's watch over Mrs. Aldrich?

486
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,280
 Her watch?

487
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,080
 Yes, ma'am.

488
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,680
 Didn't Henry confess to you?

489
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:18,080
 You know, Henry, the more I think about it, the more I wonder.

490
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,580
 The more you wonder what?

491
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:23,580
 Whether we shouldn't come right out and tell the truth.

492
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:27,480
 But all we picked up was an empty envelope with Dorothy's name on it.

493
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,680
 Homer, you're crazy.

494
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:31,020
 Do you think if we did say that, anybody'd believe us?

495
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:31,940
 Why wouldn't they?

496
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:34,540
 You'd say, "Why did we pick up an empty envelope?"

497
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:36,700
 As a matter of fact, why did we?

498
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,200
 Don't you remember Homer?

499
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,980
 Dorothy's a darn good looking girl.

500
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:43,880
 I know, Henry, but no girl's worth what we're going through.

501
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,580
 That's no way to talk, Homer.

502
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:48,140
 I don't mind being persecuted like this for her sake.

503
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:49,900
 As a matter of fact, my mother will probably straighten

504
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,020
 the whole thing out.

505
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:52,060
 She's over there right now.

506
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:54,660
 Boy, will she make a fool out of Charlie?

507
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:55,940
 Of course she will.

508
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:58,140
 And do you know what I have a good mind to do?

509
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:00,840
 I think I'll call a Clark's house and if both the answers I'll say.

510
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,840
 Dorothy, could you deliver a very important message to Charlie?

511
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,540
 Who you may think is a gentleman but I happen to know a couple of things about him.

512
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:08,240
 I wouldn't tell him how much you paid me.

513
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,840
 Because I'm not the kind that goes around talking about people.

514
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,440
 Boy, that'll hold him.

515
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,340
 Sure.

516
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:14,940
 What's the message?

517
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,140
 What message?

518
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:18,140
 She was there, she is right now.

519
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:19,140
 She's calling me Homer.

520
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:20,140
 I'll answer it, Henry.

521
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:22,640
 Now listen, Homer, she probably wants to call me and apologize.

522
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:26,140
 But Henry, why don't you let me answer it and make out you don't want to talk to her?

523
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:27,040
 Why would I do that?

524
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,800
 Then she'll be all the more sorry. She tweeted you like a dog

525
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:37,840
 Hello, hello is this Elm 303 wait, yes, sir. Homer is that you yes, sir? Is that you father?

00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:43,540
 It is not this is mr. Allridge. Oh, excuse me. Did you want me to go home?

527
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:51,080
 Wait, I'm just sitting here reading a good book mr. Allridge

528
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:55,200
 Where's Mrs. Allridge? She's going over to the clerks mr. Allridge over to the clerks

529
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:02,000
 Then she knows about it about why about Henry. Oh, you know too if she comes in tell her I'm on my way home

530
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:08,240
 I'm just trying to get in touch with Henry. Goodbye. He's right here. Mr. Aldrich. Mr. Aldrich does Dorothy want me homework?

531
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:14,180
 No, your father's looking for you anyone should have come right home now. Listen I am home

532
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:17,160
 She wins and what do you suppose he wants?

533
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:22,580
 Yes, mother did you straighten everything out over Charlie's? I'm afraid I did not in fact

534
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:26,080
 Dear, you and I are going to have the one of the most serious talks we've ever had.

535
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,080
 What about that watch, dear?

536
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,080
 That watch?

537
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,080
 What watch?

538
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,080
 That belongs to Dorothy Hopkins and you won't get back to her.

539
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,080
 Why?

540
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,080
 Now, dear, I realize you probably don't appreciate how extremely serious this is.

541
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:42,080
 But keeping a piece of expensive jewelry, Henry, that belongs to somebody else, just as a souvenir,

542
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,580
 is not as funny as you apparently think it is.

543
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:46,580
 But, mama, I don't even know what you're talking about.

544
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:48,580
 Mrs. Aldrich, may I say just one thing?

545
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:50,080
 You may not, Homer.

546
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,080
 Were you with Henry when he took the watch?

547
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,080
 Yes ma'am. No ma'am.

548
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,080
 What, why?

549
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,080
 - How about... - Yes ma'am.

550
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:00,080
 - May I have a word for you? - Yes ma'am, but please go in the dining room.

551
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,080
 I want to have a talk with you in there.

552
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,080
 And Henry, you're to stay right here. Yes, mother. But mother.

553
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,080
 I don't want to talk to you now.

554
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:10,080
 Listen, Henry, has something happened today that you haven't told me about it?

555
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,080
 Sam, I'm awfully glad you came home.

556
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,080
 No, Alice, I know how upset you must be about Henry, but let's not go all to pieces.

557
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,080
 Then you know about Henry?

558
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:20,080
 Of course I know about him. Mr. Clark and I have been downtown working on it all afternoon.

559
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,480
 - Really? - But everything's going to be alright, Alice.

560
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,080
 He's reported it to the police.

561
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,880
 - Stand the police!

562
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,880
 Mr. Clark went to the police about it.

563
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,680
 - I'll admit, I didn't know he was going to do it,

564
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,880
 but sooner or later, that would have known about it anyhow, Alice.

565
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,880
 - But dear, it does seem to...

566
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:37,680
 My goodness, Sam, do you realize it'll probably even be in the paper?

567
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,480
 - And what if it is?

568
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,080
 Don't you think the public should be warned in case they see him?

569
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:43,880
 - Yeah, I can't believe I only hear.

570
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:44,880
 - That's the phone.

571
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,080
 - I'll answer it. You sit down. You look tired.

572
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,280
 In fact, you must be tired.

573
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,880
 You wouldn't have let a thing like this happen.

574
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:50,880
 I am trying.

575
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,480
 Well, just as soon as I get through with this,

576
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,880
 I'll try and get some lunch for you.

577
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,680
 Though personally, I couldn't eat a thing.

578
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,040
 I'll add you the phone for you, mother.

579
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:57,880
 You will?

580
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:58,720
 That's for me.

581
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,240
 I'm in no condition to speak to anyone.

582
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,360
 She had to be glad to do anything

583
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,120
 that would make you feel better.

584
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:03,960
 12.

585
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:04,780
 Hello?

586
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:05,600
 This is police headquarters.

587
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,120
 I'm calling about Henry Orange.

588
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:07,960
 About who?

589
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,120
 Henry Orange.

590
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,840
 But please, is that right?

591
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:12,720
 How did you--

592
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,360
 I mean, oh boy.

593
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,320
 Henry, can you say police?

594
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,320
 Who is this, me?

595
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,760
 Well, let me explain how the whole thing happened.

596
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,820
 I happen to be down by the station this morning and the star good looking girl.

597
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:26,920
 I mean we didn't see anything of a watch. It was just an empty envelope.

598
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,840
 What? What about his hand?

599
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,320
 What's that?

600
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,760
 I'll choose that right the amnesia.

601
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,680
 Who? What kind of a watch?

602
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,600
 Look maybe I better come up there and talk with you.

603
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,720
 She was you don't have to come up here. It was only an empty envelope.

604
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,480
 Hello? Hello?

605
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,040
 Who? She who is?

606
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,200
 Henry is that you?

607
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,280
 Yes Father, are you home?

608
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,640
 May I ask what you're doing here?

609
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,480
 Wait, I was just answering the telephone.

610
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,480
 I mean, were you looking for me?

611
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,520
 Henry, what happened to you?

612
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,520
 Wait.

613
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,240
 Here's the whole story, Father.

614
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,080
 I was going by the clerks this morning, see?

615
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,080
 Yes.

616
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,920
 And you fell down, didn't you?

617
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,920
 Oh, yes.

618
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,720
 I've forgotten all about that.

619
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:04,080
 Do you mean you don't remember what has happened since?

620
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,000
 Well, an awful lot has happened.

621
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,280
 I think I remember it all, but it doesn't seem to fit together.

622
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,680
 And it's all mixed up?

623
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,480
 Yes.

624
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,000
 At least I can't understand it.

625
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 Henry!

626
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,880
 Did someone here that wants to see you?

627
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:16,720
 He's a police.

628
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,600
 No, Henry, it's Dorothy Hopkins.

629
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,440
 Who?

630
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,800
 And I just wanted to say that I phoned over to Addison City,

631
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,720
 and my walk has been home all the time.

632
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,400
 So you couldn't possibly have it.

633
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,240
 I know it.

634
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,360
 I never said I did.

635
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,960
 You said you had something very valuable of mine.

636
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,280
 Well, I did.

637
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,080
 But it's only valuable to me.

638
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:35,960
 I mean, you wouldn't even run it.

639
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,280
 It's only this empty envelope.

640
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,600
 My goodness, Henry, where did you find that?

641
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,440
 Now, at the station--

642
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,360
 Well, that's very valuable to me too.

643
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,640
 I need that address on the back.

644
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:46,040
 Yes, the address of the boy I'm engaged to.

645
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,640
 That you're engaged to?

646
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,840
 And I do thank you for saving it for me, Henry.

647
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,140
 And I'm awfully sorry to have caused so much trouble.

648
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:53,440
 That's all right, Dorothy.

649
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,140
 It was certainly nice of you to come over, wasn't it, Sam?

650
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:57,140
 What's that?

651
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:59,640
 Oh, yes, yes.

652
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,640
 Alice, may I ask one?

653
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,840
 And Dorothy, before you go, how is Mr. Clark?

654
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:03,640
 Mr. Clark?

655
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,240
 Yes, isn't he down with the hospital?

656
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,440
 The hospital?

657
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,640
 I'm glad you mentioned it, Alice.

658
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,440
 Where's the telephone?

659
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,440
 Goodbye, Henry.

660
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,240
 So long, Dorothy.

00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,640
