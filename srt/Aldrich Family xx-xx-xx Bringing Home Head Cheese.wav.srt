 Tonight we offer as a curtain raiser that most nostalgic form of entertainment

13
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,120
 From the good old days.

14
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,320
 The barber shop quartet.

15
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,420
 Are you ready, man?

16
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:09,220
 He is more to be pretty than special.

17
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:17,520
 When he ought to like me, clear up on right, far and high.

18
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,120
 I play in just one of those lagging.

19
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:25,820
 Far home, half-decast isn't right.

20
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:28,820
 No, not right

21
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:33,820
 Do not spawn in this world's path for my need

22
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:38,820
 Do not laugh at this world, be gone fake

23
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,820
 Mmm, ooh, fake

24
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:45,820
 What you need is some helpful instructions

00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:49,820
 On the facts that apply to this case

26
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,820
 Those facts, friends, are big

27
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,820
 Even can drink coffee without any facts

28
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:57,820
 There are many others who spend the wakeful night every time they touch coffee.

29
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:03,820
 Now, there is a mealtime drink which is capping pretty, stimulant drink.

30
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:08,820
 It cannot keep anybody awake, and it has a perfectly grand flavor.

31
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:12,820
 So to those of you who are affected by coffee, we say...

32
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:16,820
 You're not dally, but stop making possums.

33
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:20,820
 In our rich hands, I must see this drink.

 Epidol's teenage boys have an explosive but genuine point of view on their own,

41
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:10,820
 which grown-ups can appreciate but rarely understand.

42
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:12,820
 Every old rich knows that.

43
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:16,820
 But she opens on a business trade in front of a busy store.

44
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:18,820
 Henry's sister is she.

45
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,820
 But Henry, mother is working for it.

46
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,820
 That doesn't make any difference, Mary.

47
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:25,820
 I'm not gonna go down mainstream doing anything of foolish about it.

48
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:28,820
 Alright then, Henry, if you know I take mother her cheese, alright.

49
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:31,820
 But if she asked me why she didn't get it, I'll dress power.

50
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,820
 But, Mary, it isn't a cheese, I mind.

51
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:36,820
 Why do I have to carry your darn obelor in your pocketbook, too?

52
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:39,820
 Henry, I told you exactly 12 times I'm going over to play tennis with me.

53
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,820
 You know, we play tennis with the Anderson.

54
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:44,820
 Put the Mary in the first place, that's a green and yellow umbrella.

55
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:47,820
 And you're drawing pocketbooks practically as big as a suitcase.

56
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:51,820
 Oh, I can. Oh, you're all mothers waiting for cheese to put on a dish

57
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:54,820
 and fixing for your own dinner. And there she's wasting the kitchen

58
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:57,820
 wondering where the cheese is and who's then collecting a crowd.

59
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,820
 She's waiting for her and your candy.

60
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:02,820
 How about Father Garnish so when he comes home and finds those shoes on anything?

00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:03,820
 How are you going to play Tim?

00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,820
 Don't marry not too loud. I'll take it.

 Well, thanks, Kevin. You're coming to your senses.

00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:11,320
 Here's the tea. You can hear the pocketbook in the umbrella.

66
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,320
 But now, wait a minute, Mary.

67
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,320
 I haven't got time, Henry. Just take it home.

68
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,320
 But, Mary, why can't at least take your own grow-up?

69
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,820
 Listen, Agnes.

70
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:21,320
 How many ways you guys just deal with her?

71
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,320
 None of your business.

72
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,820
 She was cut out of my way.

00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,320
 I never mind.

 He didn't too act.

85
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,320
 He won't even open now.

86
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,320
 I bet it will too.

87
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,320
 Go ahead, open it up.

88
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,320
 Yeah.

 I did not.

00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,320
 Yes, Harriet. That's what I want to know is, what's become of Mary?

102
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,320
 Mary, are you expecting her?

103
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:29,320
 Yes, of course. She said she'd bring the cheese right home, and I can't put this macaroni in the oven until it gets here.

104
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,320
 But don't you think that's revealing, Alice?

105
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,480
 I mean what I was telling you about that book.

106
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,000
 What book about people having complexes?

 Now you take the barseg or your wrong maple string.

108
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,720
 You spoke for just finding out why he's always been afraid of water.

109
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,600
 Why has he?

110
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:47,320
 Well, once when Jimmy was just a baby, his mother left him alone in a bathtub and he got scared.

111
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:50,760
 And so today naturally, he's afraid of all water in general.

112
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,240
 - Nancy, sir. - I love there are lots of young people

113

 who have complexes about something or a shame or a sensitive.

114
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,880
 And nobody knows why.

115
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,320
 Don't you think that's increasing?

00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:02,620
 Yes Harriet, but all I want to know is where is my cheese?

 What about it?

 That's as far as I go for a dime.

 In the first a while, where were you? Here you go, Henry. Boy, you see, we got back and hid the pants off. Oh, no, homie. Oh, no. Okay, Henry. Let's cross the street before the light changes.

 Wait a minute stop pulling me

160
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:18,380
 No, but why do we have to run

161

 We just gotta cross and turn let's go down this way well

 First could you wait a second for why I just want to wait here on the corner until

163
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:40,500
 Isn't that strange? I wanted to kill looking for nothing. I just wanted you on the corner until oh

164
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:42,460
 Oh boy.

165
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:47,960
 Now Sam don't be upset, it isn't my fault.

 I'm not upset, don't you were having dinner early tonight, so I came to...

167
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,960
 You can't hold my cheese, and I've been holding everything until she gets here.

 Alice, I'm not complaining.

169
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:58,960
 And that saying seems to me that in a family this time you ought to have some distance.

170
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:02,960
 And Sam I tried to, but I certainly didn't know you'd get home before the cheese.

00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,160
 Alice, in your area?

172
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,460
 It's Sam's still upset.

173
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:08,960
 Well, I'm too thinking you are letting sit down at the table, even if dinner isn't entirely ready.

174
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,320
 Harry, why would we do a thing like that?

175
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,520
 Listen, didn't I just hear Mary come in with a cheese?

176
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,220
 Mary! Mary!

177
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:16,220
 Henry!

178
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:17,820
 Mother, are you calling I?

179
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:18,820
 Henry, is that you?

180
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,060
 Will you come here to here?

181
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,660
 Mother, has anybody been here?

182
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,160
 Has anyone been here? No.

183
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,160
 Not anyone?

184
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,660
 Has anyone asked for a dime?

185
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:26,360
 What's that?

186
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,760
 Well, he might have asked for 15 cents,

187
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,060
 but I hope he didn't give a choice.

188
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:30,560
 Henry, what are you talking about?

189
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,460
 Well, I'll tell you, Aunt Harriet.

190
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:33,760
 Has anyone seen Mary?

191
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,460
 No, Henry, I'm just gonna ask you whether you've seen her.

192
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:37,960
 So why is she here?

193
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:41,660
 Why, uh, I didn't see her. You saw her handling where?

194
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:44,760
 Why, I think it was downtown in front of the Emporium.

195
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,360
 -How are you? -What's him?

196
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:50,260
 I don't want to appear to be rushing you, but I'm all washed in a time you're done and ready.

197
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:52,160
 Then Mary disappears with the cheese.

198
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,360
 -She's what? -She's telling.

199
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,760
 I mean, look, mother, why don't you advance me part of week after next allowance?

200
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,260
 Let me run out and get yourself.

201
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:01,760
 Now dear, I can think of no reason why you should pay for it.

202
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:06,960
 Why not? After all, you pay for the first fee, and this fee's handling is going to come right out of Mary's pocket.

203
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,960
 You mean over here?

204
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:10,560
 Yeah, Henry, take this money and get some cheese and bring back the cheese.

205
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,560
 Yes, Father.

206
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,560
 You found the ration points out in the kitchen.

207
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,560
 Mother!

208
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,560
 Oh, boom.

209
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,560
 Mary, is that you?

210
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,560
 I'll go out the kitchen door and come to the back way to the store.

211
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,560
 Henry, come back!

212
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,560
 Mary, here!

213
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,760
 It's too late, I will see you gone.

214
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,160
 Mother, I'm sorry, I'm a couple of minutes late, but I'll do all the dishes for you.

215
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,160
 Thank you, dear.

216
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,160
 That's very kind of.

217
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,160
 You, I'm sure.

218
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,160
 What's that?

219
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,160
 Never mind apologizing, Mary.

220
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,160
 Why did you take your cheese to play tennis?

221
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,160
 What's that, Father?

222
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,160
 Where's the cheese?

223
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,160
 Where's the cheese?

224
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,160
 Father, didn't Henry bring it home?

225
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,160
 Who?

226
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,880
 Mary, I didn't send Henry for it. I said you for it.

227
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,920
 Yes, Mother, I meant to make sure it got here. I sent Henry home with it.

228
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,160
 Oh, that's how worried I was about it.

229
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,600
 Where's my pocketbook? Your thoughts? My pocketbook and my umbrella?

230
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,440
 You mean you left them someplace? Mother, what did he do with them? What did he do with them?

231
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:58,440
 [MUSIC]

232
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:02,960
 Excuse me, but could you give me some ideas for some of the things you carry in the store?

233
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,460
 Stationary writing papers.

234
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:05,260
 Pencils?

235
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:06,660
 Well, do you carry cheese?

236
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:07,760
 Cheese!

237
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,460
 Boy, every store I've been to is closed in my farm.

238
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:13,460
 Have you seen a boy about this tall with a green and yellow umbrella?

239
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:14,660
 A green and yellow farm?

240
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:17,860
 He was just a little kid about so high as when the traffic lights changed.

241
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:20,960
 Do you know of any way of cooking macaroni without cheese?

242
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,360
 Macaroni without pork?

243
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,060
 Sure, it's my father's favorite dish.

244
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:24,560
 Hm.

245
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,160
 Well, do you have a triflex with tomato sauce or bread crumbs?

246
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,660
 Tomato sauce or clums?

247
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:29,960
 Not an idea.

248
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,760
 Look, would you mind foaming my mother and telling her how I fix it, please?

249
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,360
 No, but if she asks for me, don't tell her you're seen me.

250
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:46,600
 Mrs. Org, you mean to say he didn't even come home for dinner?

251
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,580
 No, Homer.

252
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:50,520
 Oh boy, he promised to go to the movies with me tonight.

253
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:53,040
 And boy, if he doesn't get here soon, we're gonna be late.

254
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:57,720
 Oh boy, do you mean to say Henry doesn't even know the name of the boy he gave in their his pocketbook and umbrella too?

255
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,880
 No, Mrs. Org.

256
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,880
 He came up to a bar here on me.

257
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:06,680
 And he had pants in the sweater on, and he came out of a clear sky and disappeared into a clear sky.

258
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,680
 Ahh!

259
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,680
 Yes, Sam!

260
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:12,180
 May I have to pray you ever got the idea of putting crumbs on my corona?

261
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:15,680
 The year someone phoned me just before dinner and told me about it, men hung up.

262
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,680
 And I'm so surprised I just went ahead and did it!

263
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,180
 [laughter]

264
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:19,680
 Eh?

265
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,180
 Well, don't ever do it again!

266
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:25,180
 Boy, if Henry's much lighter, look and I have to sit right in the front row.

267
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:27,180
 And will I have a stiff necked mark?

268
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,180
 Mother!

269
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,380
 Henry is actually...

270
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:31,380
 He was Henry where have you been?

271
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:35,380
 Well, Mother Henry, where is Mary's pocketbook and umbrella and your father's keys?

272
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,380
 That's what I want to try to tell you.

273
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:39,380
 First, Henry, may I ask something?

274
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:41,380
 Homer, would you please wait out in the halls?

275
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:42,380
 Yes, Mrs. Orridge.

276
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:44,380
 Only when do you think we can start for the movie?

277
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:47,380
 Not my sister's ministry and now please leave the room.

278
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:48,380
 Yes, Mrs. Orridge.

279
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:52,380
 Only the last time I had a stiff neck it lasted a couple of days.

280
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:55,380
 Homer, don't you realize my mother's trying to give me a...

281
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,380
 Not Mary.

282
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:58,380
 I'm making up a list of all the things that ran my pocketbook.

283
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:01,740
 in my pocketbook, and I'm very much afraid I'm gonna have to hold you responsible for

284
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:02,740
 nothing.

285
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,740
 Well, I happen to know there wasn't any money in it.

286
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:06,380
 He means it's not I suppose your little son went through it too.

287
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:08,220
 Mary, he was not my little friend.

288
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,220
 Then who was he?

289
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:11,060
 He was just someone that was carrying it for me.

290
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:14,060
 Then I phone half a dozen different people to find out whether any of them knew who the

291
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,060
 kid was.

292
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,620
 Well, I certainly couldn't get all out during the next two years.

293
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:18,620
 Mary, if it was...

294
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:19,620
 Well, cheer y'all, Penny.

295
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:20,620
 It's all a promise.

296
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:23,620
 We'd increase the 20 cents a week beginning next October.

297
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:24,620
 Me and me.

298
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:25,620
 They're telling us not to.

299
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:30,040
 Homer Henry appreciate your wanting to take him, but I'm afraid you'd better go with Alvin

300
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:34,440
 Okay Henry, I'll keep my eyes open around the theater for any kid with an umbrella

301
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,440
 Goodbye!

302
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,440
 Where are you?

303
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,440
 Where are you?

304
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,440
 Where are you?

305
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,440
 Hello, Henry!

306
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,440
 You mind that, Harriet?

307
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,440
 Good night!

308
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,440
 Where are you going to bed this early?

309
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,440
 Right, yes I feel a little tired.

310
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,920
 Harriet, I've never been so completely confused in my life.

311
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,920
 I don't know what's confusing about it.

312
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,120
 He's got a complex just the way everyone else has.

313
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,120
 He has pot?

314
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,120
 Alex?

315
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,520
 This has problems, but I've been building up in him for years.

316
00:13:54,520 --> 00:14:00,280
 Didn't he tell Homer the reason he gave that boy Mary's umbrella and pocketbook and cheese was because he just couldn't carry it himself?

317
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:03,920
 Yeah, and there you are. But Harry had a complex about what?

318
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:10,400
 He's Alice. He's never like it. He's always for it. And today it's just got the best of him. That one little piece of cheese.

319
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:15,520
 Now Harry, Alice, I'm going to send that book over to you. It awaits you up to a lot of things.

320
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,840
 No, the way you think it's happening. Mary, what do you sound like saying?

321
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:22,360
 You know, Mother, I was sitting in the other room trying to think who that boy was and Harry doesn't seem to know anything about.

322
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:27,360
 And finally I went to the phone and called Mrs. Johnson and, oh my goodness, mother, she jumped right down my throat.

323
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,360
 She walked Mary.

324
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,360
 And Harry, I didn't know my word.

325
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,360
 All I said was, Mrs. Johnson could have been your boy that took my pocketbook.

326
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,360
 What's wrong with that?

327
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,360
 And she was rude to you?

328
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,360
 Well, of course she was. Mary, you stepped right on her complex.

329
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:42,360
 I did what? Mary isn't that the telephone idiot? Oh my goodness, mother.

330
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,360
 I'll go answer it.

331
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,360
 Mother, if it's Mrs. Johnson calling back, tell her I'm very sorry, I didn't realize she was sick.

332
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,360
 Hello?

333
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,360
 Hello.

334
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,360
 Mrs. Allitt, Mrs. Miller.

335
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:56,660
 I don't want to seem to be trying to talk him into letting Henry go to the movies, but I think you wanna know something.

336
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:57,460
 What about?

337
00:14:57,460 --> 00:15:02,460
 It's raining, cats and dogs, Mrs. Aldrich, and everybody in terms out with their own balance.

338
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:04,860
 And the Henry's missing a great opportunity.

339
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:20,440
 [

340
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,440
 I'm sorry to say that you're saying your question did.

341
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,440
 Here, take the phone.

342
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,440
 Well, thank you.

343
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,440
 Flow?

344
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,440
 Can I have that, you?

345
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,440
 Yeah.

346
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,440
 Well, this is Homer.

347
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,440
 I'm talking to you from a booth in the theater, Henry.

348
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,440
 But where?

349
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,440
 You been a guy on your clothes and come right down here.

350
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,440
 Why?

351
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,440
 Well, they just put on a couple of hats, see?

352
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,440
 And there's a guy that walks a tightrope with an umbrella.

353
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,440
 She lives with a dog, kid?

354
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,440
 No, but it's umbrella, yellow, and green, Henry.

355
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,440
 And it might be the kid's father.

356
00:15:46,440 --> 00:16:03,440
 [Music]

357
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,440
 Now getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldrich.

358
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:10,440
 Rather than carry his sister's pocketbook and umbrella right out on the main street,

359
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:13,440
 Henry hired a small boy to carry it for him.

360
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:18,740
 In trying to cross out a busy intersection, Henry's slave disappeared.

361
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:22,440
 The scene opens the next morning in the oldish dining room.

362
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,440
 Alice!

363
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,740
 Sir, am I such a good city's friend?

364
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:25,540
 Who's long ago?

365
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:28,740
 I have, I have, but before I leave the office, I'm gonna have a talk with Henry.

366
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:30,940
 If you ask me, it might be time he came down to breakfast.

367
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:31,640
 And Mary!

368
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,440
 Yes, Mother!

369
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:35,040
 I guess we're falling to jail, Mr. Two-Bother, it could have been their little girl,

370
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,840
 but Henry might have mistaken for a boy.

371
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:39,540
 Here, you didn't insinuate that their daughter stole anything, did you?

372
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:42,540
 No, but my goodness, people are certainly getting touchy in this town.

373
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:45,540
 Well, go upstairs and tell Henry he used to be down here in two minutes.

374
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:46,040
 Alright.

375
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:49,940
 As telling just because I said he must have been bed last night doesn't mean he can't ever come down.

376
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:50,740
 Yes, mother!

377
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:53,040
 Mother, what's the next step?

378
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,340
 What do you mean, Sam?

379
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:56,940
 I've called everyone I can think of that might have a small son.

380
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,040
 Is his own the bin?

381
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:58,740
 Yes, darling.

382
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:02,240
 Great, last.

383
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,040
 He's suffering with something that's pretty bad.

384
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:04,840
 She said what?

385
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:05,940
 And that's what she said.

386
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,740
 And you're having an awful time here on straight.

387
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:09,140
 That's just how it's imagination.

388
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:10,240
 There's nothing wrong with Henry.

389
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,440
 He's upstairs down the street.

390
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,040
 Mother!

391
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,440
 Yes, Mary! What did you think? Now what are you saying?

392
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,840
 Mary, does Henry refuse to come down?

393
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:18,560
 No, neither he isn't even up, Mary. He's apparently dressed in lots of homes.

394
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,040
 What's that?

395
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,340
 Say, I'm hearing you going.

396
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:21,140
 I'm gonna look for it.

397
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,340
 Well, there I go along with you.

398
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:24,440
 Why goodness, Mother, do you think he's hiding in the attic?

399
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,840
 Mary, tell me something.

400
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:27,940
 Confidentially, what is it, Henry's got?

401
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:30,340
 What is he got? He hasn't got anything. That's the trouble.

402
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,840
 What's that? Look at this, Link.

403
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:36,040
 This Homer happened to be all the articles that happened to be in my pocketbook when he happened to lose it.

404
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,740
 Let's see. There it is. Homer, I'm practically ruined.

405
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:41,040
 She did you have all that in one pocket book?

406
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,240
 I certainly do.

407
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,540
 Some of those things have to be irreplaceable.

408
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:45,940
 What's this word here?

409
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:46,940
 Hecticus.

410
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:47,940
 That was the late Hecticus,

411
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,540
 how about the long July I carry it?

412
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:51,640
 And if you even had a hand and brought an initial on it?

413
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,640
 Yeah, my goodness, I got that to the phone.

414
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,040
 Number five Mary, how'd I dress up?

415
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,340
 Father, did you find anything of it?

416
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:57,340
 I did not.

417
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,340
 Hello?

418
00:17:58,340 --> 00:17:59,840
 Hello, sir, and this is Harriet.

419
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,440
 What are you doing home so late in the morning?

420
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,340
 Oh, Baba, I've just been upstairs looking for something Harriet.

421
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:05,340
 What is it you want?

422
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:07,540
 Do you realize what you've done to your son?

423
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:08,140
 To whom?

424
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:09,340
 Henry, you mean you've seen him?

425
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:10,340
 Yes I have.

426
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:12,440
 And he's in no condition to be out on the public streets.

427
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,340
 No, Harry, there isn't anything wrong with Henry.

428
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:15,940
 He's just as well as you and I are.

429
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:17,340
 Oh, you think he is?

430
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:20,340
 Well, what's the old run mean street for driving young children?

431
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:24,940
 He grabs them from a backstab and twists them around and looks at them and then runs on grabs another.

432
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,840
 You want some of them?

433
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,340
 His nerves must be all sharp.

434
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,140
 You think?

435
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:30,140
 You think?

436
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,640
 Harry and I'll be right over.

437
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,640
 * *

438
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,640
 *

439
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,640
 *

440
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:37,640
 *

441
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:45,640
 Listen, Henry, why don't you be sensible and go home and get some rent?

442
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:48,640
 Homer, it was why hereby this traffic, like it had disappeared yesterday.

443
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,640
 Oh, this is a pretty windy corner, Henry.

444
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:54,640
 Have you thought about that? It might have just lifted him right away.

445
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,640
 Look, Homer, look! Who's that boy across the street?

446
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,640
 Now listen, Henry, if you grab one more kid and twist him around, we're gonna get in trouble.

447
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:06,760

 Listen, Henry. Will you please be sensible and come home? Don't you realize you need a rest?

461
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:11,620
 Now listen, Homer, stop pushing me. Just get away, just get away. Go on home yourself.

462
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:17,120
 Well, that's a nice way to talk to me. And what help have you been? This whole thing was your fault anyway.

463
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,120
 Well, that's appreciation for you.

464
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:23,520
 She was didn't wrangle down the Senate bill's times this morning and put an ad in the paper for what?

465
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,520
 See, you're darn sister's pocketbook.

466
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,120
 I paid for it out of my own money.

467
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,520
 It cost me 50 cents.

468
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,020
 You did?

469
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:29,920
 Yes, I did.

470
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,920
 Well, see, why didn't you tell me?

471
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,420
 Why didn't you...

 Thank you.

473
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:35,920
 Thank you very much.

474
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,720
 You mean you're sorry, you're pure in public?

475
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,720
 Well, I said, "Thank you," didn't I?

476
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,820
 -Eddie-Ree!

477
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:42,320
 -She was, is that you, Father?

478
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,520
 -Eddie-Ree, what are you doing out here on the street?

479
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,320
 -Well, he's all right, Mr. Old.

480
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,820
 We can't get my eye on him.

481
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:49,420
 Oh, Mother, you please get away.

482
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:50,620
 For why?

483
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:52,420
 Yes, Homer, please go down the street.

484
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:54,020
 I want to have a talk with Henry.

485
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:55,020
 Yes, Mr. All.

486
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,020
 It's all good.

487
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:58,020
 Hey, now, what?

488
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:00,820
 Now, then, Henry, what are you doing here?

489
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:02,520
 I'm looking for Mary's pocketbook.

490
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,620
 Here on this corner.

491
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:04,120
 You're here.

492
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,620
 Henry, what's gotten into you?

493
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:07,820
 Do you realize that not only Mary is upset,

494
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:09,920
 but you have your mother upset, your Aunt Harriet upset?

495
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,520
 He's following.

496
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,020
 Excuse me.

497
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,220
 Henry, where are you going?

498
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:13,120
 Goodbye, Father.

499
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,420
 Henry, come back here.

500
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:15,420
 Henry!

501
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:19,420
 Are you sure that your sister's umbrella?

502
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:22,420
 Sure I am. Can't you see it won't come down?

503
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:24,420
 Boy, was I lucky to see that kid?

504
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:27,420
 And I certainly appreciate your recognized humor.

505
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:30,420
 But he should never have dove in tackling like that.

506
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:33,420
 I didn't hear it him Henry. I didn't run to get away from me.

507
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:35,420
 What's become of my father?

508
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:36,420
 Your father?

509
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:39,420
 Sure. I was standing right here by this traffic light home we're talking to him.

510
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:43,420
 When all of a sudden I happen to see you die for the kid way down the street in my ranch.

511
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:44,980
 And now your father's disappeared?

 He's in the living room, Harriet.

 That's the best thing in the world for him.

 It comes in two forms.

 Regular post-dom, which is ground jump-dried for pot percolator or drip-maker,

574

 or instant post-dom, which is made so easily right in the cup simply by adding boiling water.
