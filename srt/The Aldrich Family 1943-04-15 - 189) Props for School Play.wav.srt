00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,500
 Henry Olgrich!

3
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,000
 Coming Mother!

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,500
 The Olgrich family!

5
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:25,000
 A special re-broadcast for you soldiers, sailors, and Marines of the United Nations.

00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 Give a teenage boy a problem to solve, and you start what always turns out to be a wrestling match

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 with the boy and the problem alternately throwing each other.

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 Henry Aldridge, however, usually ends up victorious, but gasping.

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 You'll see no one's at the oldest breakfast table.

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 Could I have the cream please father?

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 Here you are Henry.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 Thank you.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 Boy.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 There it is necessary to eat your breakfast

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 as though you were going to some kind of a race.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 But mother I'm in a hurry.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 I've got a very full day.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 Boy.

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 Henry can't you slow down just a little?

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 Alice I don't like to undermine your discipline

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 but I happen to know Henry does have a very full day.

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 Boy I'll say.

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 He's got to empty the ashes in the cellar.

25
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 He's got to pick up the backyard.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 Father that isn't the kind of full day I was thinking of.

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 day I was thinking of I got this list.

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,300
 The what live, Henry?

29
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:26,300
 She was looking at it.

30
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:27,300
 Just look at it.

31
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:30,700
 One grandfather's plot, one for coke man's, one dining room

32
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,500
 table with chairs, one rose boy.

33
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:33,400
 Now wait a minute.

34
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,400
 What is that you're reading?

35
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,100
 My list.

36
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,000
 My list.

37
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,400
 One pound of butter with muffins, one fireplace, and

38
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,600
 a beer and cigar.

39
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,600
 What's that, Henry?

40
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,400
 A cigar mother for Homer.

41
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,000
 What's that?

42
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,100
 Oh, my smoking cigar?

43
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:44,700
 No, father.

44
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:45,600
 He doesn't smoke it.

45
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,700
 He just charges around in his pocket because he's got a lot

46
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,200
 of money.

47
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,500
 Henry, may I ask what this is all about?

48
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,700
 Is that how you mother? It's for the school play.

49
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,900
 And I've got to get all that list by tomorrow night.

50
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,100
 How about the ashes?

51
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,300
 The ashes, father.

52
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,500
 We don't need any ashes.

53
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,500
 Henry, do you mind my asking why?

54
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,300
 If the play is going to be put on tomorrow night,

55
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,900
 you haven't started to get any of these things before now.

56
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:07,900
 Because they didn't tell me until yesterday that I was to be talk man.

57
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,100
 We bought it before that and they fired him.

58
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:10,900
 They fired him?

59
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:13,100
 Sure. You wasn't good at getting anything at all.

60
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,500
 So I, so I gave him belief.

61
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,100
 Henry!

62
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:15,900
 What, Mary?

63
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,900
 Now, yes, but Mother's egg beater is doing in your lunch box.

64
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:19,700
 What's that, Mary?

65
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,320
 Now wait a minute mother I was going to tell you about that.

66
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,460
 A beer of only Mary brought it out too soon.

67
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:25,220
 I did.

68
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:27,220
 And I'm tired of you taking my egg beater.

69
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:28,500
 It's for Kathleen.

70
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,740
 She makes an instant to see from the kitchen and it shows that's where she came from.

71
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:32,460
 What's that?

72
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,660
 Kathleen's father.

73
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:34,740
 Her mother's dad.

74
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:35,740
 Kathleen's mother?

75
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:37,100
 Sure in the play.

76
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,740
 And she's keeping house for her father.

77
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:39,580
 Homer.

78
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:40,580
 The whom?

79
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:41,700
 The honer.

80
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,460
 She's Homer's unspoiled daughter.

81
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:44,260
 Kathleen?

82
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:46,660
 Kathleen Anderson is Homer Brown's daughter?

83
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,020
 What's so wrong with that Mary?

84
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:49,820
 She's only a couple months older than he is.

85
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:54,220
 And as a matter of fact, the very coach says Homer looks more like an old man than anyone in the school.

86
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:57,720
 Henry, if I let you take our egg beater, will you see that it gets back to me?

87
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,020
 Oh, sure, mother.

88
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:03,220
 Yeah, I hope you don't think I'd go and leave a personally good thing like an egg beater over the school, do you?

89
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:05,120
 Well, then I'll put it back in your lunchbox.

90
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:05,920
 Thank you.

91
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,820
 And, Mary, the next time you go searching through my lunchbox, please ask for permission.

92
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,620
 Hey, Mae, what are you doing under the table?

93
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,620
 I'm just looking at the lady's father.

94
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,720
 I'm just looking at the come off when I take it over.

95
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,020
 When you take it over, when you take one over where?

96
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:20,120
 The dining room table for the play.

97
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,020
 Henry, you are not under any circumstance

98
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,520
 is going to take this table.

99
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,320
 I can't have it, but gee,

100
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,020
 where's much more we're going to eat all for?

101
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:29,020
 May I ask what we're going to eat all for?

102
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,520
 Good morning, kitchen father.

103
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,820
 It's only for three days.

104
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,020
 Henry, do you remember last year

105
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,020
 when we loaned our sofa for the school play?

106
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,620
 Yes, father, but that wasn't my fault

107
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,620
 it fell off the back of the car.

108
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:39,820
 That isn't the point.

109
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:42,520
 This dining room table has been in this house for 20 years.

110
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,620
 If ever those in your school

111
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,420
 who have never seen a dining room table before,

112
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:48,420
 You may bring them over one at a time and let them take a look at it.

113
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:50,420
 But that's as far as I'm willing to go.

114
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:51,420
 Okay, then.

115
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:54,420
 How about... how about a fur coat? Can I borrow one of those?

116
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:57,420
 A fur coat? It has to be a man's fur coat. It's for Homer.

117
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:00,420
 He's very wealthy. See, and the fur has to be on the inside.

118
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,420
 Yes? Well, you've come to the wrong man for a thing like that.

119
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:05,420
 As a matter of fact, I'd like to get a pair of fur gloves for him too.

120
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:07,420
 And maybe a fur hat?

121
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:09,420
 Exactly where is the scene laid?

122
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:10,420
 In his dining room.

123
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:11,420
 Oh.

124
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:14,420
 Homer comes into his dining room wearing a fur coat, a fur hat,

125
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:19,420
 for a hat and for gloves and sits down to dinner. Sure. I see. You can't get any cold.

126
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:22,420
 You can't. Do you think I ought to get some? For what?

127
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:27,420
 Hi, Henry. Already for school. I'll be right here in one second, Homer. Good morning, Homer.

128
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:30,420
 What's that? You have your mouth. A piece of bubble gum.

129
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:34,420
 Alex, what was that? That was me, Mr. Alrich. Good morning.

130
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:39,420
 Homer, I wouldn't snap my gum in here if I were you. Oh, sure. Excuse me. Come on, Homer. I'll get my things on.

131
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:39,920
 Okay.

132
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,420
 Don't run, dear. I'm not running.

133
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:43,420
 Listen, Henry, I had an idea last night.

134
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:48,420
 You know that place in the play where I take a thousand dollars out of my pocket and give it to Gimme Bartlett?

135
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:52,420
 Yeah? Well, gee, I wouldn't have a whole thousand just loose in my pocket, would I?

136
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:55,420
 Why not? I'd be afraid to carry it around, Henry.

137
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,420
 Why don't I have a cash register that I take it out of?

138
00:04:57,420 --> 00:05:00,420
 A cash register? Why can you're dining room?

139
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:02,420
 Why can't I afford one? I'm rich.

140
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:04,420
 I know, but rich people have things like saves.

141
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:05,420
 A save?

142
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:07,420
 Well, I settle for a save.

143
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:10,020
 There's a matter of fact that's a very good idea.

144
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,020
 Sure Homer.

145
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,820
 Henry, you forgot something in here.

146
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:15,620
 Oh gee whiz, I know what it is, it's my darn list.

147
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:19,220
 And that, Henry, is one reason why I don't want you to borrow this dining room table.

148
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:20,620
 Father, I agree with you.

149
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:21,820
 I agree with you entirely.

150
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,820
 I've driven the dining room table right out of my head.

151
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:24,320
 Good.

152
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,420
 Now, if you could only get me a safe, I'd be perfectly happy.

153
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:31,920
 A foster, a safe mother, there's a very important place where Homer has to have a...

154
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,620
 ...has to have one.

155
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,920
 Henry, do you realize how much a safe way is?

156
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,220
 I don't mean a big safe father like in a bank.

157
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:38,620
 I mean something about...

158
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:39,620
 or about?

159
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:42,420
 Yes. Now you can just drive the safe out of your head, too.

160
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:43,620
 You mean I can't have one?

161
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,420
 Hey, Henry, we're gonna be late.

162
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:46,620
 I'm coming, Homer.

163
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:49,720
 And as a matter of fact, I'm sure I ever took this darn job.

164
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,520
 Goodbye, Henry.

165
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,720
 Goodbye.

166
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,320
 Hey, Henry, goodbye.

167
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,420
 I guess he didn't hear you, dear.

168
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:56,920
 Who's Sam?

169
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,920
 Well...

170
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:02,420
 Do you think we ought to contribute a little something more than just an egg beater to this play?

171
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:04,220
 You mean you want to let Henry have this table?

172
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:06,220
 Now dear, I didn't say this table.

173
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:08,720
 But don't you think you could at least find him a safe?

174
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,720
 Alice, are you?

175
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,220
 Are you?

176
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:13,720
 Sam, this is the first time I've ever seen Henry get so wrapped up in anything.

177
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,220
 But dear, it's the most important thing that has ever happened to him.

178
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:17,720
 But what am I going to get a safe?

179
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,220
 You love a influence, Sam.

180
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:21,720
 And if you explain it for a high school play,

181
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:25,220
 my goodness, I should think there'd be lots of people who could spare a safe for three nights.

00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:40,220
 Hello, Senator Wilkes press office.

184
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:41,220
 Yes?

185
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,220
 Have we got a what?

186
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:45,220
 Sure, we got a safe.

187
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:46,220
 Who's this speaking?

188
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:48,220
 Oh, yes, Mr. Albridge.

189
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:51,220
 Now, could you tell me again what it is you want?

190
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:53,220
 The safe to play with?

191
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:59,220
 Oh, you're in a play. Oh, I got you. Well, we got one here. Yes. We're three and a half tons.

192
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:01,220
 What's that?

193
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:13,220
 Hello, Harriet. Can you hear me?

194
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,220
 Yes, Alice.

195
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:17,220
 What we need is a nice, warm, heavy coat that's lined with fur.

196
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,220
 I see.

197
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:20,220
 It's for a rather wealthy man that's a widower.

198
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:22,220
 How about my Persian lamb?

199
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,220
 You're Persian lamb.

200
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:25,220
 Harriet, it has to be a man's coat.

201
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:29,220
 Alice, where would I ever get a man's coat, especially a furline man?

202
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:32,220
 Well, I just thought you might possibly know of someone that has one.

203
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,220
 Father?

204
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,220
 Just a minute, Harriet.

205
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,220
 Henry, are you home from school already?

206
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:38,220
 Yes, mother. Where's Mary? I think I've got a little job for her.

207
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:41,220
 Dear, I'm talking with your aunt Harriet about a fur coat for you.

208
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,220
 You are? Oh boy.

209
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:44,220
 Alice, I have another idea.

210
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,220
 Really?

211
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:47,220
 I've been one of my daughters as a leather windbreaker.

212
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:49,220
 It's mine, but it's just like a man.

213
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,580
 And it's not under rabbit.

214
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:51,420
 With rabbit?

215
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:52,580
 It hit blank, Alice.

216
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:53,980
 Just a minute, Harriet.

217
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:56,220
 Henry would rabbit down to the hips to be alright.

218
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,460
 Just with a hip smother.

219
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:59,060

 What's that, a say?

00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:22,740
 Mr. Auditor, I'm sorry, but I'm afraid I didn't hear you.

225
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,740
 Did you say you were looking for a say?

226
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,740
 For your son?

 Oh, oh, now I understand you.

00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,740
 Oh, yes, indeed, we have a very small say.

00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,740
 Can we take it away?

 Yes. Well, look. I'm not asking to let me go at myself because I like damage it.

 But I'm perfectly willing to let you do it.

 That's all right. I'm glad you dropped in.

280
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:16,140

00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,140
 What is it, there?

00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:21,140

 Steel lockers.

285
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,140
 All they have to do is move one of them on stage

286
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:27,640
 and have somebody in the art department

287
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,040
 paint a combination dial on it.

288
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,040
 Now, Sam, a gymnasium locker.

289
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,340
 Why don't the students see it? They'll simply howl.

290
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:35,940
 But Alice, do you realize I haven't touched one bit of work all day?

291
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:38,140
 The only thing I've done is call people about sates.

292
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:40,440
 There, that isn't any more than Henry's done.

293
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,140
 And Sam, where am I going to find a gold-plated chandelier

294
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,840
 with old-fashioned gas lights on it?

295
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,640
 What's that?

296
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,440
 There, we must know someone in this town

297
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,640
 who owns a thing like that.

298
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,340
 Alice, I'll do what I can to find a saint,

299
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:53,340
 But I put my foot down a gold-pated gaslight chandelier.

300
00:11:53,340 --> 00:12:08,340
 Now listen, hit me for the last turn and let them eat them.

301
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:11,340
 Homer, don't you realize that this is for the junior class flight?

302
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:13,840
 What if it is? I'm not asking to eat the oysters from me.

303
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,840
 I'm asking to eat them for the junior class.

304
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,840
 And I'm still not going to eat them.

305
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:22,840
 I knew the thing like this was gonna happen in a firm to couple of courses and top into the softballer class.

306
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:26,840
 Home and you don't have to eat the whole dozen oysters. Not even a half a dozen oysters.

307
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,840
 You just nibble it two or three.

308
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,840
 You're right, you can afford to throw some away.

309
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,840
 Well, nobody will ever know I'm rich.

310
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,840
 Not if they see the dining room table you got me.

00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,840
 Homer, nobody's going to see it's made of salt horses.

312
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,840
 I got a tablecloth purposely that comes right down to the floor.

313
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,840
 Sure, sure, it looks like a bed.

314
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,840
 Now I'll tell you one more thing, honey. I'm not gonna wear a pressure lamp.

315
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,180
 It isn't Porsche Land or my Persian Land.

 And that's a beautiful coat my internet paid a lot of money for.

317
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,760
 And what's the difference?

318
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,480
 I come under the stage wearing a woman's Persian land coat

319
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,800
 in a muff or a hat.

320
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,240
 She's standing at a saw, where I can stop to eat oysters

321
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,760
 and I can't stand.

322
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,720
 What kind of a millionaire do you think I am?

323
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,640
 All right, Homer.

324
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,360
 All right.

325
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,720
 I know what I'm going to do.

326
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,600
 I'm going to sit down and write a lot of resignation

327
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,520
 to the junior class.

328
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,760
 Can you get me a quick before you even get me some catch up

329
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,200
 for my oysters?

330
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,640
 Or is it safe for me to keep my $1,000 in?

331
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,520
 All right, Homer.

332
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,780
 So far, if I'm concerned, you can keep your money in your pot.

333
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:19,320
 Henry, here's your rose bush.

334
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,820
 I've had it all fixed for you.

335
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,020
 What's that?

336
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:24,320
 Mary, is that a rose bush?

337
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,720
 Yes, of course it is.

338
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,720
 Now listen, Mary, those are nothing but ordinary sweet peas.

339
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,620
 Sure they are.

340
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:30,420
 Sure they are.

341
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:32,220
 I've always got a notice from the last row.

342
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,420
 Very last row.

344
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,420
 I am.

345
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:36,420
 Oh, I can say it.

346
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:37,620
 Mary, that's the last row.

347
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:38,820
 That's the last straw.

348
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,220
 Well, honey, I'm not going to tear a pot

349
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:42,320
 like very best hat with roses on it.

350
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,720
 Would you be any more pleased if I got

351
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,320
 out that old hat with cherries on it?

352
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,960
 Cherry, are they canned?

353
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,960
 But that?

354
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,480
 I like canned cherry.

355
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:52,120
 Homer, will you please tell me what place there is in the play?

356
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,120
 Will you eat cherry?

357
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,920
 I could eat them instead of oysters.

358
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:55,920
 Off my hat?

359
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:56,920
 What's that?

360
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,920
 You've got a hat with oysters on this?

361
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,120
 What's a farm I can serve?

362
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,320
 I'm not eating it.

363
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:04,120
 And I hope nobody thinks I'm innocent.

364
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,920
 I'm going to resign.

365
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,120
 Well, isn't anybody going to answer the phone?

366
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,720
 Why should I answer the phone?

367
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,720
 As far as I am concerned, the junior class can send--

368
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,120
 Oh, gee, what kind of a house is this?

369
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,120
 Hello?

370
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,820
 Is this Mr. Olrich's residence?

371
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:20,220
 Yes, sir, Mr. Olrich is in here right now.

372
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:23,520
 Well, about that safety and quiet about just what kind is it he wants.

373
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,520
 That's safe?

374
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:27,020
 Wait, just nice, good size.

375
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:29,720
 Well, you know what kind of you got.

376
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,720
 You want a single or a double door?

377
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,520
 She wish you got one with a double door?

378
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,520
 That would be good. How big is it?

379
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,520
 And so big, five feet high, maybe?

380
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,920
 Gee, that sounds swell.

381
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,420
 It's got to be hauled up there, you know.

382
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:43,220
 Sure, but we've got to have it. It's for a very rich man.

383
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:45,620
 Yeah, well, then I guess he won't mind the cottage, will he?

384
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:48,720
 Oh, no. She wish he's got a thousand dollars in this pocket.

385
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,120
 He's got to do something with it.

386
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,020
 Okay, I'm going to crew on it right away.

387
00:14:52,020 --> 00:15:01,720
 Sam, I think the least you can do is go up to the high school and see that play tonight.

388
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:04,720
 Alice, do you realize in six weeks my income tax will be due?

389
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,620
 And this is one of the few evenings I'm going to have free to get a straighten up.

390
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:12,020
 Just the same there, it seems to meet it when your own son is practically putting on a place single-handed.

391
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:15,520
 Now, as far as the inkwell is supposed to be on this desk.

392
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:19,420
 The inkwell? Henry took it over to the auditorium home I had to sign a check.

393
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:21,520
 Well, that's a fine thing. Just when I...

394
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,420
 I...

395
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:25,520
 Oh, Mary, did you get the rose bush finished before Henry left, mother?

396
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:28,520
 I met a little rosewife and tied them on a pitcher wire.

397
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,020
 Really? You took them off your hair?

398
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:34,020
 Oh, no, mother. I just wired on radishes. They look beautiful.

399
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:36,620
 Now, did you notice what I did with my income tax papers?

400
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:41,300
 a tax paper and you put them up with them I don't know if I started to take

401
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:45,840

402
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:49,580

403
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:52,540

404
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:57,380
 take a will out and read it and he's gonna read my income tax you maybe

405
00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:00,380

 Now getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldrich.

456
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:18,340
 Mr. Aldrich has just discovered that Henry, without realizing it,

457
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:21,340
 has taken his briefcase containing income tax papers

458
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:23,740
 for Homer to use in the school play.

459
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:28,140
 At the scene opens, Mr. Aldrich is bringing the Anderson front door down.

460
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:36,340
 Hello there, Mr. Aldrich.

461
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:38,840
 How's it evening, Mr. Anderson? Is Henry here? I want to speak to him.

462
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:42,040
 No, I'm off the start. Henry left here nearly ten minutes ago.

463
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:45,240
 He picked up a mirror and he was going over to pick up something at the mall.

464
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,740
 At the Lawson's, thank you very much.

465
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:48,240
 Did you have anything I can do for you?

466
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,240
 No thanks, I just want to catch up with him.

467
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,240
 - Why, Miss Mother? - Just Mr. Olashir.

468
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,240
 We need more working on it, didn't say.

469
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,240
 Everything that he's trying to catch up with Henry

470
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,240
 so he can help him carry some of those things.

471
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,240
 So, I tell Father we're almost ready to start.

472
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,240
 The play begins at 8.30, and I have to be their own.

00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,240
 I'm sorry, Catherine.

474
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,240
 But your father isn't going to play.

475
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:08,240
 - He is. - In fact, your father isn't even speaking to me here.

476
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,240
 - Why not? - If you must know the truth, Catherine.

477
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,240
 He resents, I'll be giving up his gear head.

478
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,240
 - His wife? - That's near a Henry choke with a gear head on it.

479
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,240
 All that awful thing he gave you on your 10th anniversary.

480
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,240
 - Mr. Vanuysen, come play our gear head.

 Yes, honey. What's the matter?

 Is that of the whole table, Henry?

00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,880
 She was not a close shape.

488
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,400

 Kathleen, are we just standing here talking to him about...

520
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,880
 How about...

521
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,880
 He's so darn sensitive.

522
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,880
 What's been happening is my mustache on straight.

523
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,880
 It's not straight, but couldn't have gotten a better one, Homer.

524
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,880
 What's the matter with it? I paid it down for it.

525
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,320
 I didn't say I had some knife ones for 15 cents.

526
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,520
 15 cents, did you think I was a millionaire?

527
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,860
 What's that you pat in your hand?

528
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:17,860
 My egg beater.

529
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:19,460
 Oh boy, where's my briefcase?

530
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:20,620
 Where's my briefcase?

531
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:21,620
 Oh, here it is.

532
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:22,820
 You have to use that?

533
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:26,180
 Sure, don't you know why I take my will out and stand there looking at it for a minute

534
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,900
 and then get mad and tear it up?

535
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:28,900
 Oh yeah.

536
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,900
 And that reminds me, where's my will?

537
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:31,900
 Where's my will?

538
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,340
 Is there anything in the briefcase?

539
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:35,100
 Oh sure, here's some papers.

540
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,700
 Well, I've got to get family cut it for that.

541
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,620
 Remember to get one thing right for me.

542
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:52,220
 Hello.

543
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:53,540
 Hello, we just carried prior.

544
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:54,020
 Yes.

545
00:22:54,020 --> 00:23:07,520
 Harriet, it's Mr. Sam

546
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,280
 (dramatic music)

547
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:20,460
 - How's it going, Henry? How's it going?

548
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:22,320
 - You were flying, Captain, but four.

549
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,620
 Home. Home.

550
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:25,020
 - But the audience is writing it.

551
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:26,400
 - That isn't Homer's fault though.

552
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,300
 He'd forgotten his lines four times.

553
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:29,600
 And when he took his choreography,

554
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,800
 forgot the buffalo robin,

555
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,080
 and it stayed pinna-roll his neck.

556
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,080
 - My goodness!

557
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,800
 - Look at him out there, he looks like a bear.

558
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,640
 - Henry.

559
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,480
 - What's this?

560
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,300
 - Henry.

561
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,860
 Father, are you allowed to come backstage?

562
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:39,860
 It was my briefcase.

563
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:41,100
 I often forgot it, Father.

564
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:43,860
 And boy, if you know us while Miss Homer's making up things,

565
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:45,700
 he keeps going in a ratish bush.

566
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,140
 And Ray, where is the briefcase?

567
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:48,940
 We've got it, Father. There's nothing to worry about.

568
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:50,940
 And do you know what Homer did with the oysters?

569
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:52,940
 Instead of eating them, he slipped them in his pocket.

570
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:53,780
 [crowd laughs]

571
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:55,300
 And Ray, where's the briefcase?

572
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,140
 Right out there on the stage. Homer's got it.

573
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,580
 With my income tax papers.

574
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:01,140
 Oh, gee, is that your income tax he's reading?

575
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,420
 And they want to be bringing them off.

576
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:03,380
 Bring them off?

577
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:04,180
 Well, he doesn't.

578
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:06,260
 He tears them up and stores them in the fireplace.

579
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:08,260
 And they walk out there on the stage and get those papers.

580
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:08,760
 Who am I?

581
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:09,660
 Oh, no, Bob.

582
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:10,660
 In front of all those people.

583
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:12,960
 Henry, for the last time I have to have those papers.

584
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,060
 Well, Bob, all right.

585
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:14,960
 I'll try to whistle.

586
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:15,460
 Come on.

587
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:16,460
 Wait.

588
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:16,960
 Wait.

589
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:17,860
 Oh, the Jeepers.

590
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:19,260
 I'm so excited I can't even whistle.

591
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:19,760
 Look out.

592
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,860
 Bob, where you going?

593
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:21,660
 What do you think I'm going?

594
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,660
 I'm going to get them.

595
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:25,460
 And now I am going to destroy this will

596
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:27,760
 and cut my daughter off for life.

597
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,760
 Oh, Bob.

598
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:29,760
 Keep my sister off.

599
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,460
 [LAUGHTER]

600
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:32,460
 Oh, my gimme no paper.

601
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:33,160
 Cool me.

602
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,160
 I've got a tear to me and my will.

603
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:38,000
 (crowd cheering)

604
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,600
 - What is wrong with this is my big theme.

605
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,440
 - Hold on a minute.

606
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,600
 - Wait a minute.

607
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,440
 (crowd cheering)

608
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,280
 - Oh, we're doing great dance.

609
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,280
 I'll just die in a beer later.

610
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,880
 (upbeat music)

611
00:24:49,880 --> 00:25:03,800
 - Can you have some bacon, Sam?

612
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:04,880
 - No, thank you.

613
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,880
 They haven't eaten much breakfast, do you?

614
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,880
 I've eaten all the breakfast I care to, thank you.

615
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,880
 Now, Sam, you can't go through life being upset over a little thing like last night.

616
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:13,880
 I am not upset.

617
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:19,880
 I was just wondering how it would be if I gave up my practice here in town and opened an office in Abbott City.

618
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,880
 Now, Sam, I'm sure nobody even knows this.

619
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:22,880
 No!

620
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,880
 Yes, Mary.

621
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,880
 Mother. I've been thinking.

622
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:29,880
 And don't you suppose we could most of Abbott City or someplace where people don't know father?

623
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:30,880
 Mary.

624
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,880
 Please go out in the kitchen and make me some more trouble.

625
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:33,880
 Excuse me.

626
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:34,880
 Yes, of course.

627
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,880
 Father, Henry, I don't think your father wants to talk to you right now.

628
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:41,880
 And mother, the man at all the faithful father just called and said that through the fact

629
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,880
 it was easier to get it down than not.

630
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,880
 The return ship will only be $22.

631
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:46,880
 What's that?

632
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,880
 I'll answer the phone.

633
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:48,880
 Sam, here's a review.

634
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,880
 A review?

635
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,880
 Of the tray in the morning paper.

636
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:52,880
 Littin.

637
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:57,880
 One of the most hilarious evenings this town has ever enjoyed took place in the Santa Bill High School Auditorium last evening.

638
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:02,880
 The highlight was the guest performance of Samuel Ulrich's prominent local attorney.

639
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,880
 What's that?

640
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:08,880
 Who made his entrance in what was erroneously listed on the program as a wealthy gentleman's dining room.

641
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,880
 The scene was actually on the western plane.

642
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:14,880
 And when Mr. Ulrich caught the buffalo single handed,

643
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:19,880
 wrestled with it and threw it into the cave where the double doors the audience went wild.

644
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,880
 What's that? No, wait a minute.

656
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:19,340
 Water letter, Henry, water letter.

657
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:21,340
 I'm sending a copy to each one of the seven people

658
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,640
 that loan us water table leaves.

659
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,740
 Oh, it says, "Dear Mrs. So-and-so."

660
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:28,240
 This is to thank you for loaning us your leaves.

661

 But, soon it will slight mix up

662

 where you please have your husband come to the school

 auditorium Monday morning with either a leaf that matches

664
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:37,140
 or some part of your dining room table

665
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:39,340
