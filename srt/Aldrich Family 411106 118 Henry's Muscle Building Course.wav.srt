 Entertainment for All the Family brought to you by Postam,

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 Friends, before we join the Aldrich family,

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 I wonder if I could put something squarely up to each one of you

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,640
 who has trouble getting to sleep at night.

11
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,120
 Would you be willing to make a simple test that should show whether coffee keeps you

12
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,120
 awake?

13
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:09,160
 Mind you, it may not be coffee, for there's no question that many folks can drink it without

14
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,200
 losing a minute sleep.

15
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,600
 But if you suspect it is coffee that keeps you awake, the way to check on it is to drink

16
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,440
 postum instead.

17
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:22,560
 You see, postum contains no stimulants, nothing that could possibly rob you of sleep.

18
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,680
 So it stands to reason if coffee is the cause of your sleeplessness, switching to postum

19
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,440
 will settle the point. Now why not try it? Drink fragrant flavor for post-em

20
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:37,520
 instead of coffee. Give it a fair trial, say for two short weeks, and see if you

21
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,760
 don't honestly enjoy good sound sleep again, and along with that, see what a

22
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:47,360
 perfectly swell mealtime drink delicious tempting post-em really is.

23
00:01:47,360 --> 00:02:09,520
 There's an old saying that claims you're young only once, but you can prolong that

24
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,920
 youth, and the best way to do that is to share the experiences of Henry Aldrich.

25
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,960
 He'll take you right back to your own teenage days

26
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:21,780
 Tonight Henry is visiting Nancy Adams one of his favorite classmates

27
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:30,800
 Nancy tell me honestly. What is it you like about Bill Turner? I don't know Henry. I just like him. Don't you sure?

28
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,000
 I guess Bill's all right. That's a loud Henry. I hear you

29
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,440
 How would he hear me he's out in the front hole and I like him only hey Nancy

30
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:42,360
 Oh, she was I ever tell you about the time I dove off the top of the boat house

31
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,360
 I didn't even know anybody could climb up that high.

32
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,360
 Oh, it's easy.

33
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,360
 You know that flagpole down at the end of the lake?

34
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,360
 Yes.

35
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,360
 Oh, I dove off that one.

36
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,360
 Nancy, how's your mother?

37
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,360
 She's better, Henry.

38
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,360
 She just strained her back a little.

39
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,360
 Boy, that was some luck I had in the game Saturday.

40
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,360
 Boy, remember when those three guys tackled me

41
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,360
 and I carried them right across the goal line for a touchdown?

42
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,360
 That was just wonderful, Bill.

43
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,360
 I don't see how you stood up.

44
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,360
 Nancy, what make radio is this?

45
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,360
 I don't know my father bought it.

46
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:14,640
 father bought it. You know Nancy when I pull those three fellas across. Yeah. I heard a

47
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:23,080
 good radio program the other day. It was about a milkman. Boy was it funny. Yeah go on.

48
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:31,080
 Well it was just awful funny. Boy I darn near left my head off. Yeah. Henry could you

00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,080
 You are Bill open this window a little please.

50
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:33,920
 Sure, well I'm not.

51
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,440
 Wait a minute Henry, I'll open it.

52
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,040
 Well that's alright Bill, I've got it practically.

53
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,240
 Practically.

54
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,800
 Huh, is it stuck a little Henry?

55
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,840
 No it isn't stuck, I just...

56
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,440
 Could you stand back please Bill?

57
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,520
 How am I in the way?

58
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,520
 I want to get my elbows out.

59
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,520
 I'll add a little further.

60
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,240
 Here let me show you how to open it.

61
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,440
 Now look out Bill, all I have to do is...

62
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,760
 Nancy would you mind if I push this sofa away?

63
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,560
 No Henry.

64
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,880
 Don't get up, I'll push you along.

65
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,880
 A lot.

66
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,680
 She was who opened that window.

67
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,980
 I did.

68
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,420
 You know I thought I had it started.

69
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:09,040
 I just should have kept at it.

70
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,520
 Anything else you want done Nancy?

71
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,720
 Well listen Gingerail out in the kitchen if one of you wants to.

72
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,280
 She was all get it for you Nancy.

73
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,880
 You stay right where you are Bill.

74
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,160
 Sure you don't need any help lifting the bottles.

75
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,160
 Now Bill.

76
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,400
 You'll find everything out there on a tray Henry.

77
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,200
 All you have to do is put some ice in the glasses.

78
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,760
 I'll be right back.

79
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,400
 Listen Nancy, what do we have to have him around for?

80
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,400
 But I like Henry.

81
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,800
 What do you suppose that is?

82
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,000
 Well, I don't know. Nancy, isn't there any way of getting rid of him?

83
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 This evening?

84
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,200
 What does he ever say?

85
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,400
 Bill.

86
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,600
 My goodness, Henry Aldrich is one of the nicest people I've...

87
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:45,200
 Excuse me, Nancy, but is there any special way of getting your ice trays loose?

88
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:49,200
 Well, my mother never has any trouble. All she does is pull and they come right out.

89
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,600
 Oh, isn't that strange? I'll be right back.

90
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,600
 Nice guy. I'd like to see him come out for football practice some afternoon.

91
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,200
 Bill, you just don't understand, Henry.

92
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,660
 No. Say about the dance Friday night.

93
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:01,460

 Yes, Mother?

103
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,200
 I don't believe Ray's football down there.

104
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,400
 No, Mother. Henry's getting some ice.

105
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,800
 I'll pick everything up, Nancy.

106
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,600
 Does your mother have a good big screwdriver?

107
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,100
 Henry, what is that all over your coast?

108
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,000
 Why, you're...

109
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,800
 I'm pretty sure it's tomatoes juice.

110
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,960
 Get out of the way.

111
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,860
 Come on, Nancy. I'll get the ice out.

112
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:35,040
 I think you'll want something to get it loose with, Bill.

113
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,460
 What's the matter with my hands?

114
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:38,200
 Well, be careful where you walk.

115
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,500
 Henry, oh, do I--

116
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,240
 Well, I didn't know that wire basket would come all the way out.

117
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,040
 What did you want to take it out for?

118
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,880
 So I could spread my elbows.

119
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,280
 Yeah.

120
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,040
 Here, Nancy. Well, one tray of ice be enough for you.

121
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,920
 Gee, had I loosened it that much?

122
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:55,160
 Nancy, you know what we were just saying about Henry in the living room?

123
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:55,800
 What?

124
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,920
 Well, don't you remember?

125
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:00,920
 Now Bill, you know Nancy I think I better be going.

126
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,920
 Is there a way Henry?

127
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:06,920
 Well I've got a lot of homework to do and I think I better.

00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:17,920
 What time will I be calling for you Friday evening?

134
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,920
 Friday evening?

135
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,920
 Sure for the dance.

136
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,920
 Henry I didn't promise to go with you did I?

137
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,920
 Why sure?

138
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,920
 Why sure?

139
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,920
 You didn't?

140
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,920
 I don't see how I could have. I'm going with Bill.

141
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,920
 Oh. With Bill?

142
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,920
 Well, I'm terribly sorry, Henry.

143
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,920
 I guess you just must have misunderstood me.

144
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,920
 I'll go to the door with you.

145
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,920
 No. You go back and have your ginger ale.

146

 I can find my way all right.

00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,920

 Sam, could you pass the toast please?

 There you are.

154
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,920
 Why didn't he go?

155
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,920
 Well dear, that's what I don't know.

156
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,920
 You remember the other evening when Henry came home from Nancy Adams?

157
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,920
 When?

158
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,920
 Last week, dear.

159
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,920
 A couple of nights before the dance.

160
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:19,680
 He walked into the house and went right straight up to his room and it didn't come down again all evening

161
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,380
 And Sam Henry hasn't been himself since then. Did you have a talk with him?

162
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:26,640
 Yes, and all he'd say was he felt dancing was a waste of time

163
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,640
 Mary come in here and eat your breakfast

164
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,280
 Henry's doing upstairs

165
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:36,280
 What is he doing? He's putting on his best suit again, and that's the fourth day in a row

166
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:42,000
 He's wanted to school. Well dear Henry explained all about why he had to wear his best suit. Is this male for me?

167
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 Yes, dear.

168
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,500
 Why does he have to wear it?

169
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:47,700
 Well, he says the class may have their picture taken any day this month,

170
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:50,000
 and they just aren't sure which day it's going to be.

171
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 And so he wants to be prepared.

172
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 Well, my goodness, what's this letter all about?

173
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 What letter?

174
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 Certainly the most absurd thing I've ever seen.

175
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 It must be for father.

176
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 May I see it, please?

177
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 Who is it, from, Sam?

178
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 From the National Institute of Muscular Development, Incorporated.

179
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 Dear Mr. Ulrich, are you a man or a mouse?

180
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 I knew all the time, it wasn't for me, Father.

181
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 Yes. Are you a man or a mouse? We assume it is the former, otherwise we would not have received your recent inquiry.

182
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 No man can make his mark in the world, no man can inspire the love of a good woman, unless he is willing to develop his inner potential strength and enroll in our 26-week course.

183
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 Sam, what in the world are you reading?

184
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 I don't know, Alice, but I'm fascinated.

185
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 In case you do not care to sign for the full 26 weeks,

186
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 we can offer a shorter course for the busy executive

187
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 who is interested in only partial development.

188
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 Remember, decide now.

189
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 Sam, when did you write for that?

190
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 May I see the envelope in which this arrives?

191
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 It's right here, Father.

192
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 Oh, my goodness, it's addressed to Mr. Harold, Aldrich.

193
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 Who's he?

194
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 I have no idea.

195
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 But he's a man or a mouse.

196
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 Well, put the letter in the envelope, please. It's probably for Henry.

197
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 Mother, why would he want to develop?

198
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 I don't know, dear. And besides, it's none of our business. Please put it back in the envelope.

199
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 Well, well, I think I walked to the office this morning.

200
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 Well, Sam, you haven't walked to the office in six years.

201
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 Of course I have. I walked a couple of times just this last summer. It made me feel great.

202
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 I'll go get your coat for you, Father.

203
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 A coat? A coat? Why would I want a coat?

204
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 Well, I can leap get your hat for you.

205
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 Goodbye, Alice.

206
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 - Are you leaving? - Goodbye, child.

207
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 Goodbye. Mother, do you have any ideas to where my best tie is?

208
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 Your best tie? No, dear. Sit down and eat your breakfast.

209
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 But, Mother, I've got to find it.

210
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 There'll be plenty of time to find it after you've eaten.

211
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 Now, please sit down. I want to ask you something.

212
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 What about?

213
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 What in the world is the trouble?

214
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 The trouble? The trouble? Do you think I don't know of any trouble?

215
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 But you want yourself, dear. When anyone speaks to you, you're way up in the air.

216
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 I'm not up in the air, Mother. I may be a little upset this morning

217
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,960
 this morning because I can't find my blue and white tie, but otherwise I feel fine.

218
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,360
 Then why not eat your breakfast?

219
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,360
 I'm going to eat.

220
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,360
 I'm going to eat.

221
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:07,160
 How's Nancy Adams these days?

222
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,800
 Nancy Adams' mother.

223
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,280
 Well, I asked, is how is she?

224
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,440
 You see this book here, mother?

225
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,440
 You see this book?

226
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,440
 Yeah.

227
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:17,040
 Well, that gives you an idea of how little interested I am in her.

228
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,120
 What about it?

229
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,280
 I borrowed it from her two weeks ago.

230
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,280
 Well.

231
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,280
 And now I'm returning it.

232
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,280
 That's fine.

233
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,280
 I'm returning it.

234
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,280
 I'm returning it.

235
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,280
 But that's all.

236
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,280
 I go.

237
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,880
 Would you like some butter on your toes?

238
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:29,880
 No, thank you.

239
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,280
 I'll have you know this mother.

240
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,880
 She asks me whether I'd like to keep it and finish it.

241
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,880
 I'll tell her I'm not even slightly interested.

242
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,080
 That's fine, dear.

243
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:37,880
 Now drink your milk.

244
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,880
 And do you know what else?

245
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,380
 What?

246
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:39,980
 That's all right.

247
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:40,680
 Never mind.

248
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:43,080
 But if her folks can't afford a better ice box

249
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:46,480
 than the one they have, do you like Bill Turner?

250
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,780
 Bill Turner.

251
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:48,780
 I hardly know him.

252
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,180
 Gee, he's got a lot to learn.

253
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,180
 He just goes around.

254
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,280
 Do you know what he says?

255
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,780
 Henry.

256
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:55,280
 What's your ambition in life?

257
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,800
 My ambition, Mary, what do you mean?

258
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,300
 That's all.

259
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,580
 I just wondered whether you wanted to be a man or a mom.

260
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:02,240
 Now listen, Mary, I haven't any time for a small talk.

261
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,160
 Have you seen my blue and white tie?

262
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,480
 No, but I'd love to see your chest expansion.

263
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,320
 Now, Mary, that's what I say, Mother.

264
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,160
 But, Mother, all I was going to ask him was,

265
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,040
 is he going to take the short course of the 26-week course?

266
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:13,540
 Of what?

267
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,440
 Mary, will you please give Henry that letter?

268
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,120
 What letter?

269
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,960
 I don't think it's for you, though, Henry.

270
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,120
 You certainly didn't write to the National Institute

271
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,480
 of Muscular Development Incorporated, did you?

272
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,080
 Yes.

273
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:23,600
 No.

274
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,640
 Yes.

275
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,440
 Listen, Mary, where did you get that letter?

276
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,680
 You just said it wasn't yours.

277
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,920
 Now listen, Mary, that's United States, Mary.

278
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,280
 Mary, mother, it says right here on the envelope.

279
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,960
 Maybe open for inspection.

280
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,640
 Mary, give me that letter.

281
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,240
 Are you Mr. Harold Aldrich?

282
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,320
 No, yes, no.

283
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,280
 Now listen, Mary, you come back with that.

284
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,920
 Children, stay out of the living room.

285
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,200
 We won't break anything.

286
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,000
 I'm just helping Henry develop.

287
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,080
 Now listen, Mary, you're only going to make me late for school.

288
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,280
 Do you want to take a video to show to Nancy Adda?

289
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,840
 Mary, if you breathe one word about that to her, I'll--

290
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,840
 Mary! Mary, come back down here with that!

291
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:10,560
 Is there a class in this room next period, Homer?

292
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,560
 Sure.

293
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:14,840
 Why are all those questions you're filling out, Henry?

294
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,120
 Nothing, Homer. Nothing important.

295
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,240
 It's just some information I've got to send away.

296
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,600
 Could you measure my calf once more, please?

297
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,600
 It's pretty hard with this ruler.

298
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:31,600
 Well, just go around me real slow.

299
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,600
 It's...

300
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,600
 14 exactly.

301
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,600
 14 for my calf?

302
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,600
 Gee, was my ankle was 14 too?

303
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,600
 It was?

304
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,600
 Yes, Homer, and I don't want to mislead anyone.

305
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,600
 I don't want them to send me...

306
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,600
 Listen, Henry, what is it you're sending for?

307
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,600
 Nothing, Homer.

308
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,600
 Gee, why would I...

309
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,200
 whether Nancy Adams has a class here next period.

310
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,800
 - I thought you were ignoring her.

311
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,640
 - I am.

312
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,700
 That's why I'm waiting to return this book.

313
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:02,680
 When I give her this back, it's going to end everything.

314
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,940
 - Well, let me see that letter just for a second.

315
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:05,780
 Will you please?

316
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:06,620
 - No, Homer.

317
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,400
 - What is this question at the bottom mean?

318
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,320
 - What question?

319
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,440
 - Do you have flat feet?

320
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,840
 And you wrote in yes.

321
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,800
 - Now listen, Homer.

322
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,800
 - Well, what did it say then?

323
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,080
 - Keep quiet, Homer.

324
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,600
 Miss Watson just came into the room.

325
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,440
 - Miss Watson.

326
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,480
 - Well, boy, you certainly look busy.

327
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,880
 - We are Miss Watson.

328
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,480
 You working on your biology?

329
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,800
 Well, in a way we are.

330
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,400
 Well, isn't that fine?

331
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,840
 You know, we're going to start working on mice next week.

332
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,480
 We are?

333
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,200
 On mice?

334
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:32,760
 Yes.

335
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:36,120
 We're going to compare their development with that of man.

336
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,360
 What's that?

337
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,080
 Come on, Henry.

338
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,320
 That's the end of the period, and there's a class coming in.

339
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,040
 Hello, Henry.

340
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,400
 What are you doing in here?

341
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,640
 Well, I'll tell you, Nancy.

342
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,240
 I've been waiting.

343
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,480
 I've been filling out--

344
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:50,080
 Henry, you're getting ink all over yourself.

345
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:50,920
 I am?

346
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:54,720
 Well Nancy, I just wanted to tell you how much I enjoyed this book.

347
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,320
 Well I'm awfully glad you returned to Henry Cudd. Bill Turner's anxious to read it.

348
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:58,920
 He is?

349
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,620
 Are you sure you threw it with it?

350
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:02,220
 Oh yes.

351
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:07,420
 After all, even if I weren't through with him, well naturally, if Bill wants to read it...

352
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:09,320
 Where have you been for the last week?

353
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,820
 Just around. Just around.

354
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,720
 Hey Henry, come on!

355
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,720
 You go on ahead Homer, I may be held up here a second.

356
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,520
 Quietly!

357
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,920
 You better go Henry.

358
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:22,000
 I just wanted to tell you though how much I enjoyed your book.

359
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,320
 Henry Aldrich, don't you and Homer Brown have a class this period?

360
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,640
 Yes, Ms. Watson, I'm on my way right this minute.

361
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,640
 Bye, Henry.

362
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,960
 Goodbye.

363
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:32,200
 Henry, let me have a look at that letter, will ya?

364
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:32,800
 What letter?

365
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,160
 About your flat feet.

366
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,520
 Now, Homer.

367
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,920
 Listen, Homer, where is that letter?

368
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,080
 I haven't got it.

369
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,880
 But, Homer, I put it in this English book.

370
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,800
 I put it in this English.

371
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,800
 You suppose I put it in Nancy's book?

372
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,800
 Why would you do that?

373
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,720
 I didn't know I did.

374
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,680
 I was talking to her and I just stuck it in there.

375
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,440
 Well, come on, you can't go back now.

376
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,640
 Oh my, I gotta get that letter.

377
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,140
 Why?

378
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:52,800
 My name's on it.

379
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,880
 Do you think I want a thing like that

380
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,520
 to be read publicly by Nancy?

381
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,600
 Well, you certainly can't get it now, Henry.

382
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,920
 Maybe they haven't started yet.

383
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,480
 Well, I'm not going in with you.

384
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,200
 I don't want that whole class to look at me.

385
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,920
 Keep quiet, Homer.

386
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,440
 Will you all get it out your pencils, please?

387
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,920
 [GRUNTS]

388
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,680
 Miss Watson, I'm sorry to interrupt your lesson like this,

389
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,320
 but I just returned Nancy to a book.

390
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:16,920
 I mean, Nancy's desk has something in it I'd like.

391
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:17,420
 I want.

392
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:18,360
 I mean, need.

393
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:21,520
 Is it anything you can't do without the rest of the period?

394
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,520
 Yes ma'am, I have to have it.

395
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:26,520
 Well, if it won't take more than a second, you may go to a desk and get it.

396
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,580
 Thank you, Ms. Watson.

397
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:31,000
 In the meantime, will all of you be copying what is on the board here?

398
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:31,800
 Nancy.

399
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,720
 Henry, what on earth is it you want?

400
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,760
 I'd like to borrow that book again.

401
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,960
 Henry didn't have to come all the way back into the class and embarrass me.

402
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,200
 But I just happened to remember.

403
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,200
 I haven't finished it.

404
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,680
 I thought you had finished it.

405
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,880
 So did I, and so I got out.

406
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:46,960
 Yes, Ms. Watson.

407
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,760
 Here, Henry.

408
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,760
 Thanks.

409
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,760
 Henry, may I ask good books?

410
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,760
 That is.

411
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,760
 This book?

412
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:53,760
 I just got from Nancy.

413
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:54,760
 Yes.

414
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,760
 Well, it's just a book.

415
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,760
 What is the title?

416
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,760
 Murder on the third floor.

417
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:05,760
 That is the book you were in so much of a hurry to get.

418
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,360
 Well, I'll tell you.

419
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,760
 It isn't the murder I'm so angry.

420
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,760
 May I have the book, please?

421
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,760
 The whole book?

422
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:12,760
 The whole book.

423
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,760
 Well, couldn't I just...

424
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,760
 Please do not open it.

425
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,760
 No?

426
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,760
 May I have it, please?

427
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:19,760
 And I should like to see Nancy Adams immediately after class.

428
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,760
 But Miss Watson...

429
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,760
 Please leave the classroom.

430
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,760
 Yes, Miss Watson. I'll go.

431
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:50,260
 Well, Henry may be a man, but it's easy to see how he'd feel like a mouse if that letter gets around.

432
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:56,460
 So let's hope that it doesn't, and if you will, turn to something that should get around, something that all of you should know about.

433
00:16:56,460 --> 00:17:03,960
 You really owe it to yourself and to your family to find out what a swell treat it is to enjoy a good hot cup of postum with your meals.

434
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:09,160
 For I can promise you if you haven't tried postum, you have a very pleasant surprise in store.

435
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:12,080
 because postum really hits the spot, sugar and cream with

436
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:14,720
 who suit your taste, and you have a cup of pleasure

437
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,480
 overflowing with goodness.

438
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,440
 The goodness of postums inviting a aroma

439
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,480
 and irresistible flavor.

440
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,280
 Just don't expect postum to taste like coffee anymore

441
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,960
 than you'd expect coffee to taste like tea.

442
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,000
 For naturally, postum is different,

443
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,960
 and it's that very distinctiveness of flavor

444
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:33,120
 that gives postum its special delightful appeal.

445
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,920
 Yes, folks, is a good hot meal time drink for all the family,

446
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,720
 for even the youngsters at the table.

447
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:41,160
 You'll agree that no drink is quite so good as Postam.

448
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,400
 So fill everyone's cup with it and see if I'm not right in saying,

449
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,440
 it's flavor that puts the "Mm" in Postam.

450
00:17:47,440 --> 00:18:02,400
 Now getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldrich, Henry has decided that he needs a course in physical development.

451
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,080
 After filling out the rather intimate questions on the application blank,

452
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:10,160
 He discovers that he has left the blank in a book belonging to Nancy Adams.

453
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,240
 The scene opens in Henry's school at the close of the period.

454
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:17,200
 Listen, Henry, this will make two classes I've missed just because of you.

455
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:21,560
 Homer, all you have to do is just walk into Miss Watson's classroom, pick up Nancy's book,

456
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,720
 and walk out with it.

457
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,680
 Are you sure Miss Watson isn't in there?

458
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,600
 No one's in there.

459
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,400
 There isn't a soul in there.

460
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,240
 Why don't you go in and get it?

461
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:33,520
 Well, gee whiz, Homer, I was going to stand here in the doorway and keep watch for you.

462
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:37,680
 Well, if anyone does come along, Henry, don't speak. Just clear your throat.

463
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,040
 Sure, I'll just sort of cough.

464
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:41,920
 Okay. Nobody's coming, Homer.

465
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:46,760
 That's it. Just walk right along as though you own the place.

466
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,960
 Which book is it on to take?

467
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,560
 The one your hand is on.

468
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,960
 This isn't it?

469
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,600
 Well, it must be there, Homer.

470
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,360
 Well, come here and show it to me.

471
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,480
 All right. Wait a second. I'll close the door, partway.

472
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,960
 If it was here, it would be here.

473
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,440
 Homer, I'm almost positive Miss Watson didn't take it with her.

474
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,760
 All right, show it to me.

475
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,840
 Well, gee, was it a book with a blue cover?

476
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,240
 A blue cover? Blue?

477
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,500
 Yes, I will.

478
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,000
 Henry, someone's out in the hall.

479
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:12,600
 Well, I'm glad you were.

480
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,000
 Quick, Homer, we're all we done.

481
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,360
 Get down here beside her desk.

482
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,760
 Did they come in, Henry?

483
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,640
 No, they just closed the door.

484
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:22,640
 She was a locked it.

485
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,880
 They locked it.

486
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:27,200
 You mean we're locked in and I can't get to solid geometry?

487
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,640
 Well, at least they didn't see us, Homer.

488
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:32,640
 But Henry, I'm weak and geometric as it is.

489
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,940
 Well, all we have to do is climb out that window, Homer.

490
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:39,140
 Well, what good will that do? We're way up on the third floor!

491
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:53,140
 Nancy, could you take these keys down to the main office, please?

492
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:54,140
 Yes, Miss Watson.

493
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:59,140
 And Nancy, if you are quite sure you won't let this book interfere with your studies anymore, you may have it.

494
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:00,140
 Yes, Miss Watson.

495
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:05,940
 After all, Henry Aldrich has much more important things to attend to in school than reading mystery stories.

496
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:06,840
 Yes, Miss Watson.

497
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,640
 He's a very nice boy, Nancy.

498
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,840
 At least he has his good points.

499
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:16,540
 But I do wish you'd become more interested in someone who takes things just a bit more seriously.

500
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:24,340
 Be careful, Homer.

501
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:26,440
 Do you want to knock me off this fire, Skyn?

502
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:29,040
 She was Henry, we've got to get off of here somehow.

503
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,640
 Sure, and I suppose you want to go down to the bottom and jump.

504
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:35,640
 Don't you realize this fire escape goes right past first and second floor classroom?

505
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,940
 He's quiet, Henry.

506
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:39,540
 Suppose somebody should come back in the Miss Watson's room.

507
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:41,140
 Let's close the window we came through.

508
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,940
 Then if anyone does, they won't hear us.

509
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:44,940
 Easy now, Henry.

510
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:46,940
 I'm being quiet.

511
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:49,440
 That's it, make all the noise you can.

512
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,440
 Homer, all we have to do now is go up the fire escape to the roof.

513
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,240
 And then what?

514
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,740
 Well, it's bound to lead to something, Homer.

515
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:58,200
 Come on, have you got Nancy's book?

516
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,240
 Sure, here take it.

517
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,240
 Is my letter in it?

518
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,540
 I don't know.

519
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:03,000
 Hey, Homer, what'd you take this for?

520
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 Why?

521
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,240
 This isn't Nancy's book.

522
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,720
 Gee whiz, it's Miss Watson's report book.

523
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,760
 Her report book?

524
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,080
 What made you think my letter would be inside that?

525
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,000
 He said blue, so I grabbed blue.

526
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,080
 Well, you should have looked, Homer.

527
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,200
 If we get caught with that, we could even be expelled.

528
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,400
 Just for having a report book?

529
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,520
 Sure.

530
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,440
 Well, you can be the one that takes it back, Henry.

531
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,480
 I'll take it back, Homer.

532
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,480
 All I have to do is open the window again.

533
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,980
 Be sure no one's in there, Henry.

534
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:28,480
 No one's in there.

535
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,480
 She whiz.

536
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,480
 All you have to do is lift, Henry.

537
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,480
 I am lifting.

538
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,480
 Get away so I can spread my elbows.

539
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,480
 Does it open?

540
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,480
 Let me try once more.

541
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,480
 Well, what's the matter, Henry? You weak.

542
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,480
 She whiz, maybe I do, Nick.

543
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:48,480
 Wouldn't you think I could at least open a window when it's an emergency?

544
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,480
 You're certainly in the nice fix.

545
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,480
 Nice fix. You've got Miss Watson's reports and Nancy's got your measurements.

546
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,980
 Sure, and probably by this time Nancy's read the whole thing. Come on, pull Homer.

547
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:01,980
 Boys! Boys, what are you doing up there?

548
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:03,480
 Who is it, Henry?

549
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,980
 What are you doing up there?

550
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:07,480
 Mr. Bradley, he's down in the courtyard.

551
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,480
 Boys!

552
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,480
 Why? Why, we're just trying to open a window.

553
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,480
 Don't you know the rules about going out on the fire escape?

554
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:18,480
 Are there any special rules, Mr. Bradley?

555
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,480
 What are your names?

556
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:22,860
 Why I'm Henry Aldridge. Oh, Homer Brown

557
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:28,860
 Henry and Homer all rich and brown yes, sir

558
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:34,080
 Will you please report in my office at once yes, sir?

559
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,520
 How would you like to have us get there?

560
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:43,500
 Any way you can't well the only trouble is mr. Bradley that nothing will get down

561
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:50,500
 (music)

562
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,500
 Hey Nancy, wait Nancy!

563
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,500
 I've got to go to class Bill.

564
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,500
 What's that book you've got?

565
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,500
 Murder on the third floor.

566
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,500
 Let me read it, will you?

567
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,500
 Henry Olderch hasn't finished it yet Bill.

568
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:01,500
 But I've got a study period and I've got to have something to read.

569
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,500
 Bill, turn it you give me that book!

570
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,500
 I won't hurt it!

571
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,500
 Bill, let me have it! Please Bill!

572
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,500
 Bill, bring it here!

573
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:17,500
 [Music]

574
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:22,500
 And now then, class, the first question is, what is the comparative?

575
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,500
 The comparative?

576
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,500
 You get the window open, Henry?

577
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,500
 Sure.

578
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,500
 May I ask what this means?

579
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,500
 Oh, excuse me, Mr. Van Wie.

580
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:33,500
 Do you realize you literally are breaking into a Latin class?

581
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:36,500
 But this is the only one on the fire escape we could get open.

582
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:39,500
 And Mr. Bradley wants us right away, we think.

583
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,500
 Well, get out of the room quickly to can, please.

584
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:45,500
 Yes, sir. Now then, plaz, what is the comparative of bonus?

585
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,500
 - Oh, me? - No!

586
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:59,500
 About how long have you been a student in this school, young man?

587
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,500
 About three years, Mr. Bradley.

588
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,500
 And these are the young men?

589
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,500
 About three and a half, Mr. Bradley.

590
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:08,500
 Well, that wasn't an account of the mums right on top of the measles.

591
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,500
 I see.

592
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:14,500
 Then you both know those fire escapes were placed on this building for emergency use only.

593
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,500
 Well, the fact is, Mr. Bradley.

594
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:19,500
 Mr. Bradley, I have some papers here that were just picked up in the third floor hall.

595
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,500
 What are they?

596
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:23,500
 Well, they seem to be some sort of a physical education report.

597
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,500
 Uh, just post them on the bulletin board, please.

598
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,500
 Well, Ms. Shea, could I...

599
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,500
 Could you...

600
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,500
 Is that by any chance my paper?

601
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,500
 Yours.

602
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,500
 Yes, ma'am, it might be mine.

603
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,500
 How much do you weigh?

604
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:36,500
 132 pound. Well, this is not yours.

605
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:40,500
 Well, have any others been picked up lately? I mean, around 132.

606
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,500
 They have not.

607
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,500
 Homer, must you lean on my desk?

608
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:48,500
 Oh, no, sir. Excuse me. I thought you were through with us.

609
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,500
 I don't know what gave you that impression.

610
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:53,500
 Excuse me, but could I interrupt you, Mr. Bradley?

611
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:54,500
 You're a built-turner, aren't you?

612
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:57,500
 Yes, sir. I'm the one that carried three men over our gold Saturday.

613
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,500
 What were you sending here for?

614
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:04,500
 Well, I don't suppose I should have been reading this book during study hour, Mr. Bradley.

615
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,500
 What's the title?

616
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:06,500
 Murder on the third floor.

617
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,500
 Murder?

618
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,500
 Well, G.

619
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,500
 Well...

620
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,500
 Henry?

621
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,500
 Yes, Mr. Bradley.

622
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:17,500
 What do you think of a boy who would spend his time reading a book like that?

623
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:20,500
 Well, I guess it's pretty bad, Mr. Bradley.

624
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,500
 That's what I say.

625
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:24,500
 Do you know what I think all three of you boys need?

626
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,500
 No, sir.

627
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,500
 Suppose you wait here, all of you?

628
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,500
 Wait here, all of you.

629
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:29,500
 Well, I step out and get your records.

630
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,900
 Yes, Mr. Bradley.

631
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:34,380
 Well, Henry, you aren't worried about anything, are you?

632
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:36,260
 Listen, Bill, could I borrow that book a second?

633
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:37,100
 Nancy's book?

634
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:39,060
 All I want to do is take it for one second.

635
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:40,100
 What for?

636
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:41,060
 I just want to--

637
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:42,660
 Bill, can't you even let me look at it?

638
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:43,820
 Keep your hands off it.

639
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:44,940
 Look what fell out of it.

640
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:46,500
 There's your letter right on the floor.

641
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,500
 Oh, Gee whiz.

642
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,620
 Hey, Bill Turner, you take your foot off that.

643
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:50,340
 You make me.

644
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:50,900
 Do you hear me?

645
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:52,460
 Take your foot off that letter.

646
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:53,500
 Henry, somebody's coming.

647
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,220
 I don't care.

648
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,160
 Mr. Bradley, Mr.

649
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,800
 - She whizzed Henry. - Hello Nancy.

650
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:58,740
 - Close the door.

651
00:25:58,740 --> 00:25:59,660
 - Let go of my leg.

652
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:01,260
 - You lift your leg, do you hear me?

653
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:02,100
 Lift it.

654
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:02,940
 - Boy stop it.

655
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:04,160
 - Lift his leg Henry.

656
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,440
 - She whizzed.

657
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,740
 - Hey Bill, quit your twisting my head off.

658
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:08,580
 - Yeah.

659
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:09,660
 - Bill Turner, you stop that.

660
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:10,840
 - Don't you, Bill.

661
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:14,140
 There.

662
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:15,140
 - Henry.

663
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:16,140
 - She, Henry.

664
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:17,980
 Did you knock him out?

665
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:18,820
 - Oh boy.

666
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:22,140
 - She, you lifted him right off the floor.

667
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:24,220
 - Hey, what hit me?

668
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:26,680
 He's all right, Henry. Pick him up before Mr. Bradley comes in.

669
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,680
 Come on, Homer. Let's lift him onto the couch.

670
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,960
 Listen, Aldrich. What did you hit me with?

671
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,640
 I just used my bare hands, didn't I, Nancy?

672
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:36,100
 Well, then, young man. Turn up.

673
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:38,600
 Does anyone invite you to lie down on that couch?

674
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:42,920
 No, Mr. Bradley.

675
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,620
 I'll help him up, Mr. Bradley.

676
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:46,520
 Don't you think he can get up himself?

677
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,160
 - Well... - I'm up.

678
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,060
 Well, young lady.

679
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:51,100
 Let's watch an athlete to bring her keys down here.

680
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:53,800
 Thank you. Turn up. Here's what I want you to do.

681
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:57,360
 I want you to spend a part of each lunch hour for the next ten days,

682
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,480
 picking up the papers in the halls of this building.

683
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,840
 On all three floors?

684
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,800
 On all three floors.

685
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:03,940
 And as...

686
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:06,240
 How did Miss Watson's report book get here on my desk?

687
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,640
 On your desk, Mr. Bradley?

688
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,960
 Nancy, will you see that she gets it?

689
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:09,480
 Yes, sir.

690
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,600
 Orich and Brown.

691
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,480
 Yes, Mr. Bradley.

692
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,560
 Yes, Mr. Bradley.

693
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,560
 Orich!

694
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,040
 What is that you're tearing up?

695
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:19,960
 Why, it's just a sort of a letter that I've decided I won't need to send away.

696
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:22,960
 It so happens that the gym instructor needs a couple of huskies,

697
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:27,440
 such as you two to go down each afternoon and help him move the steel lockers move

00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:35,800

700
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:41,280
