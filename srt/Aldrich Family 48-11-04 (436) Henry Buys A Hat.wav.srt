00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,320
 Henry! Henry, all great!

00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:04,320
 Coming, brother!

 [Music]

4
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,800
 Thank Heaven, American boys eventually grow up.

5
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,800
 But no matter how important or how old they become,

6
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,600
 they always like to grow down the boyhood again,

7
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:32,120
 to recapture their teenage and the adventures of Henry Aldrich. The scene opens in the Aldrich

8
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:56,280
 front hall. It is Saturday morning. Well, I guess I'm just about all set, Homer. Gee, Henry. Gee, how'd you ever talk your folks into it? I didn't have to, Homer. After all, it's the most natural thing in the world to do. Boy, I bet this is the biggest day in your life since your first pair of long pants. Homer, Gee whiz. My mother and father just suddenly

9
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,920
 realize that I've reached the age of manhood.

10
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,440
 I wish I would.

11
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,120
 Yes, mother.

12
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,040
 You got your money?

13
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,000
 Sure, mother.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,040
 Here I want you to tie it up in this handkerchief.

15
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,240
 Mother.

16
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,040
 Oh, Alice, stop worrying.

17
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:09,880
 You won't lose it.

18
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:10,720
 Sure.

19
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,480
 Gee whiz, didn't we all agree?

20
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,960
 I wasn't a kid anymore.

21
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:14,960
 That's right, son.

22
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,000
 Now, run along and use your own judgment about the whole thing.

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,040
 Thanks, Dad.

24
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,200
 And Homer, when we get down there, I don't want you saying anything.

25
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,160
 Nothing at all.

26
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,480
 If I ask for your opinion and even if he asked you home, but please don't interfere

27
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:33,340
 We want Henry to make his decision entirely on his own sure come on Homer. Let's go only Henry

28
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:36,460
 If you really can't decide be sure and phone me. I'll be okay mother

29
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:41,520
 Good luck, Henry. Yeah, you got the handkerchief. Yes, mother. Good boy, please be careful and Henry

30
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,320
 Alice let him go

31
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:48,480
 Sam we should never have let him do it now Alice and is perfectly capable of handling a thing like this by himself

32
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,820
 Well, maybe he is, but just the same...

33
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,120
 Why are you putting your coat on?

34
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,820
 Sam, I'm gonna say a good hundred yards behind him.

35
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:58,100
 Alice, you're going to do no such thing.

36

 [music]

37
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:12,240
 Well, here I am, everybody. How do you like me?

38
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:15,740
 Henry, oh, Henry, all of your balls, thanks.

39
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:17,440
 Oh, she wins. What's so terrible?

40
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,780
 Sam speak to him.

41
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:22,240
 I refuse to say a word to him until he takes that thing off his head.

42
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:25,900
 You mean you don't like the hat, Father?

43
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:28,660
 Well, after you told me I could choose my own.

44
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:31,240
 All he needs now is spats and a cane.

45
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,600
 Henry, I hardly know what to say to you.

46
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,360
 For mother's...

47
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,320
 My goodness, a straw hat!

48
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,160
 Dear, what on earth possessed you to buy a thing like that?

49
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:43,740
 Look, mother, it's a genuine West Indian straw worth $14.50.

50
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:47,240
 And on account of winter coming on, I got it for only $3.

51
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:50,940
 You could hug any of my friends, so I'm walking along under the ash.

52
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:53,640
 Mary, mother said I could pick it out myself.

53
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,940
 Oh, no, I didn't.

54
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:59,340
 Sam, you were the one who decided your son could choose his own clothes from now on.

55
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,340
 Alice, he's your son as much as he is mine.

56
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:06,440
 Look, look, let me sort of walk away from you, mother, so you can get a better perspective.

57
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,040
 What's that?

58
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,140
 The road trouble is everybody's just looking at it too closely.

59
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:12,440
 Pretend I'm walking down the street, see?

60
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:12,940
 Yes?

61
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:15,140
 Doesn't the hands begin to look better?

62
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,440
 Keep on walking, Henry.

63
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,440
 Sure, you see my point?

64
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,440
 There, now it looks fine.

65
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,440
 This father ain't having a haul!

66
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,440
 Precisely!

67
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,440
 Henry, will you please stop this foolishness and come back here?

68
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,440
 Mother, won't you please try to look at the overall effect?

69
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:36,440
 You always have to make an adjustment when you see a man you're not used to in a hat.

70
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,440
 I mean...

71
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,440
 Henry, let's not waste any more time talking.

72
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,440
 You'll just have to march straight down to the Emporium and return that hat.

73
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,440
 Return it?

74
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,440
 Mother, you don't mean...

75
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,040
 Mother, you don't mean...

76
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,880
 You're just kidding, aren't you?

77
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,320
 I've never been more serious in my life.

78
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,880
 But she is, Mother. I can't.

79
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,720
 Father, you see my side, don't you?

80
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,440
 Sam, will you please explain to Henry

81
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,360
 that you were wrong about the whole thing?

82
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,160
 As a matter of fact, Alice,

83
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,800
 I just remembered some work I have to do.

84
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,360
 Sam!

85
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,240
 Mother, look, I can't go back. I can't.

86
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,120
 Henry, it's a perfectly simple matter

87
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,600
 to walk into a store and say,

88
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,200
 "I've changed my mind about this,

89
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,640
 and I like my money back, please."

90
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,120
 Of course it is, Henry.

91
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,120
 Oh boy.

92
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,760
 My goodness, I do it all the time.

93
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:21,600
 But Mother the Quirk will think that I don't know my own mind.

94
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,200
 Just tellin' your mother refuses to let you have it.

95
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,240
 After him calling me, sir?

96
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,400
 Oh, jeez.

100
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,080
 They're even big boys have mothers.

101
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,640
 Now please start.

103
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,880
 Gee whiz, mother, I can't.

104
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:48,920
 I just can't very well Mary would you please take Henry by the hand and Mary don't you touch me

105
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:55,280
 Listen won't you please try to look at it this way

106
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,580
 Yes, sir. Is there something I can do for you?

107
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:16,180
 Well, yes, as a matter of fact, Homer, how would you like to sort of step over there and look at those coats a minute?

108
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,580
 Well, Henry, I'm interested.

109
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,780
 Oh, you interested in buying a coat, young man?

110
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:22,780
 Me? She was no. I've got a coat.

111
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:23,780
 Homer?

112
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:26,780
 Well, I guess I wouldn't do any harm to investigate.

113
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:28,280
 Look, uh, mister.

114
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:32,280
 Look, about this hat, it isn't that I don't like it.

115
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,780
 I knew you'd like it, sir.

116
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:37,380
 Well, in all my years and hats, I've never seen a face that fitted a hat to where your

117
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:38,380
 fits that one.

118
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,380
 Yeah, sure.

119
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:46,980
 That's exactly what worries me, the fit.

120
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:47,980
 The fit?

121
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,980
 Well, we can certainly remedy that.

122
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:50,980
 You can?

123
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:55,380
 Well, I don't mean the fit so much as, well, as my doctor.

124
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,380
 What's that?

125
00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:02,540
 I don't know how it slipped my mind, but according to my doctor, I shouldn't wear a hat, I think.

126
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:03,540
 Why not?

127
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:07,140
 Well, I'm sort of losing my hair.

128
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:07,640
 And--

129
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,140
 We're there.

 So?

131
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,440
 Well, if you're really losing your hair,

132
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,640
 you don't ever want to be seen without a hat.

133
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,240
 I don't?

134
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,040
 No, sir.

135
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,040
 Now, just let me set it back on your head.

136
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:16,940
 But, Mr. What I--

137
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:19,540
 Always remember to give it a pat, like this.

138
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:20,540
 There you are.

139
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:21,040
 Sure.

00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:21,040
 Only--

141
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,140
 You're doing hard while I look in this.

142
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:24,140
 Homer, where are you?

143
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:25,840
 Right here inside this coat.

144
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,840

 I'm interesting.

148
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:31,840
 Sure.

00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,640
 How much is it?

00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,780
 three hundred dollars

151
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:38,200
 well frankly i've certainly lost interest

153
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,280

00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,040
 he had nothing to do with it

161
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,520
 well i'm sorry sir but i'm afraid we can't take it back why not what about

162
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,560
 your initials

163
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,900
 I forgot about the initials.

164
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:04,120
 There they are, right. On the sweat band, HA, as large as like.

165
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,740
 We never take a hat back once it's been initiated.

166
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:06,860
 But couldn't you remove them?

167
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:07,360
 Remove them.

168
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:07,860
 Yeah.

169
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,640
 How could we remove initials? They're perforated.

170
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,280
 Look, HA.

171
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,280
 Oh.

172
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:15,800
 Well, couldn't you just add a T to the HA?

173
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,800
 And then you have HA.

174
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,640
 Get out.

175
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,160

 (jazz music)

178
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:30,500
 - Hello?

179
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,340
 - Hello?

180
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:34,780
 - Hello, is this Mr. Harold A. Corn?

181
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,060
 - All corn, Henry.

182
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:36,900
 - What's that?

183
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:37,820
 - 'Cause I mean all corn.

184
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:38,900
 - Yeah, who's this?

185
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,300
 - Well, you don't know me, see,

186
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,460
 I just found your name in the phone book.

187
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:43,300
 - You did?

188
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,620
 - Sure, I'm phoning everybody I can find

189
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:49,180
 who has the initials, H.A. (audience laughing)

190
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:52,100
 Look, how would you feel about a swell new hat?

191
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,500
 Yeah? What program is this?

192
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,700
 What program?

193
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,900
 Sure, didn't you say you were giving away a hat?

194
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,800
 No, she was. I'm selling it.

195
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,600
 Selling it?

196
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,700
 Look, just let me ask you this.

197
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,300
 What size is your hat?

198
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,300
 Eight and a half. What's it to you?

199
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,700
 Eight and a half. Wow.

200
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,200
 So, just forget the whole thing.

201
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,200
 Goodbye.

202
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,700
 Quick, let's see the phone book, Homer.

203
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:15,800
 Are there any more H.A.?

204
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,600
 Sure, only I think all this phone is hopeless.

205
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,100
 Homer, there just has to be one H.A. in center,

206
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:25,100
 with a six and a half head size who needs a hat what's the next number?

207
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,100
 Elm 669.

208
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,100
 Number 3.

209
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,100
 Elm 669.

210
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:32,100
 How did you make out on Mr. Alcorn him?

211
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:35,100
 Boy he was the biggest sore head I ever heard of.

212
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,100
 Yeah eight and a half.

213
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:41,100
 But I've got a feeling this is my lucky customer coming up.

214
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,100
 He and I sure hope so.

215
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,100
 Hello.

216
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,100
 Hello.

217
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,100
 May I speak to H. Andrews please?

218
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,100
 Well this is Hildegard Andrews.

219
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,100
 The old a guard.

220
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,100
 (audience laughing)

221
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,100
 - Yes.

222
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,100
 Who's this?

223
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,780
 - Well gee, gee, gee, gee, gee, gee, gee, gee, gee,

224
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:57,420
 I don't think you'd be interested.

225
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,020
 - Well I might be.

226
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:01,100
 Come on, who is it?

227
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:03,780
 - Well no, no, no, I'm sure you wouldn't be.

228
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:05,020
 Goodbye.

229
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:06,940
 Homer, we're just not getting anyplace.

230
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:08,860
 - Hey Henry, I just got a swell idea.

231
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:10,540
 Why aren't you filling the police department?

232
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:11,380
 - The police?

233
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:12,220
 - Sure.

234
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:13,740
 After all, I keep fingerprints.

235
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,580
 Maybe they keep head sizes too.

236
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:16,740
 (audience laughing)

237
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:17,940
 How are your crazies?

238
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:18,780
 - Head free.

239
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:19,780
 Oh boy.

240
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,180
 Henry, haven't you left yet?

241
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,980
 Flest mother, for where?

242
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:26,580
 There, didn't we decide you were to take your hat down to the Emporium and get your

243
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:27,580
 money back?

244
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:28,880
 Well, I'll tell you, Mother.

245
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,180
 I did go down, see.

246
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,380
 Oh, you did fine.

247
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:35,580
 Sure, and I had a long talk with a clerk, see?

248
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,380
 And he gave you your three dollars back?

249
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:38,380
 Well, not exactly.

250
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:39,580
 You mean he gave you credit?

251
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:40,580
 Credit?

252
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,180
 That's just as good, Henry.

253
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:45,380
 You and I will go down later this afternoon and pick out another hat.

254
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:46,380
 Mother, wait.

255
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:47,380
 You don't understand.

256
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:51,340
 understand how you feel but until you're a few years older you need help in

257
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:54,180
 selecting your clothes. But Mother if you don't let me explain.

258
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:56,780
 You're talking about it now. There I have to start lunch.

259
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:59,700
 She was home. My mother thinks I returned the hair.

260
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:03,580
 Why didn't you send her straight? I tried to homework. What's she gonna do when she

261
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:07,300
 finds out I've hidden it up in my room? Boy you're in a spa hand.

262
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:11,260
 Wait a minute. Who are you gonna phone? The center will times. I've got the whole

263
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:14,540
 thing figured out. Number please. Elle 909. Elle 909.

264
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:16,200
 - He's trying to change hands.

265
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,300
 - Mary's boyfriend, Kermit, and he always said,

266
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,700
 "If there's anything he can do for me,

267
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:20,940
 he'd be glad to do it."

268
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:21,780
 - Yeah.

269
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:23,940
 - Sure, and I know he'll be just crazy about my hat,

270
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,700
 even if his initials aren't H.A.

271
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,500
 - Set it all times, set it up like me.

272
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,980
 - I'd like to speak to one of your reporters, please.

273
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:31,060
 Kermit, Hanygan.

274
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:33,060
 - Hanygan isn't there, sorry.

275
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:33,900
 - He isn't?

276
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,220
 Oh, just a minute.

277
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:36,300
 Homer, he isn't there.

278
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,140
 - He isn't.

279
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:38,620
 Well, why not leave a message?

280
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:39,460
 - Sure.

281
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:40,380
 Hello? - Yes?

282
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:42,060
 - Look, could I leave a message, please?

283
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,500
 A very important message.

284
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,340
 - Who is this?

285
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:48,580
 why you wouldn't know me but but i'm a member of the general public who reads

286
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:49,560

287
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:53,520
 and uh... i'm trying to locate somebody with the initials h_a_

288
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,720

 but no gee was i just have to find them and i call the police department

290
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:03,180
 the police were they fool around with a thing like this i told you

00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:05,640

 uh... the other one give me my money back

294
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,120
 working for how much was involved

295
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,680
 Oh gee, every son I have.

296
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,480
 Is that so?

297
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,040
 Alright, let's have all the information.

298
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,280
 And they show today, Jay.

299
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:15,960
 Sure.

300
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,920
 With a six and a half head size.

301
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,160
 Are they gonna help you, Hinn?

302
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,480
 Homer, will you please be the--

303
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,000
 Hello?

304
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,500
 Hello.

305
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,600
 OK, Henry, I can take a hint.

306
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,560
 Mrs. Aldrich.

307
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,520
 The important thing is he has to like stalk.

308
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,440
 Are you in the living room, Mrs. Aldrich?

309
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,160
 Yes, Homer.

310
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,240
 Mr. Aldrich and I happen to be having a private discussion.

311
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,480
 Well, can I hear you say it was almost lunchtime?

312
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,400
 Not quite, Homer.

313
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,800
 You have plenty of time to get home.

314
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:49,800
 Yes, dear. Well, are you sure I can't help you in any way, Mrs. Oldrich? Set the table or anything?

315
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:54,800
 No, thank you. Oh, well, I guess I'll be running along then.

316
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,800
 Goodbye, Alma. Where were we, Alice?

317
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,800
 I was saying, Sam, that you should take a lesson from what happened this morning and put your foot down.

318
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:06,800
 That was unfortunate, Alice, but I still maintain we should give Henry one more chance to choose his own hat.

319
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,300
 Sure, I agree with Mr. Aldrich.

320
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,300
 Homer, I thought you'd gone home.

321
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:14,300
 Now, let's try to look at this whole thing from a boy's viewpoint.

322
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,800
 I was a boy once myself.

323
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,300
 Sure, so was I.

324
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:22,300
 If you need him down to the Emporium by the hand, you'll destroy every shred of his self-respect.

325
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,300
 Dear, I don't intend to take his hand.

326
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,300
 Psychologically, you'd be taking his hand.

327
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:29,800
 The same, the important thing is Henry has to have a new hat.

328
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:33,800
 And since he isn't capable of choosing one himself, then someone has to do it for it.

329
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:37,100
 When Mrs. Algory, Homer, will you please go home?

330
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:40,200
 Sam, listen to me. Someone has to help Henry.

331
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,100
 Well, Alice, have it your own way.

332
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,300
 No, I'm glad you're being reasonable, Sam.

333
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,600
 And when you get down there...

334
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,300
 Don't worry.

335
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,600
 ...to the Emporium with Henry.

336
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,800
 Alice, I'm not going with him.

337
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,100
 Yes, you are, Sam. I changed my mind.

338
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,900
 You're a man. You are definitely the one to help Henry.

339
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:54,900
 Select the new hat.

340
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,100
 Now, wait a minute, Alice.

341
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,300
 I think so, too.

342
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,700
 Homer, will you please go home?

343
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,700
 [audience laughter]

344
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:10,700
 [Music]

345
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:14,700
 Well ladies, you'll never be in a predicament when it comes to making a choice

346
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,700
 if you choose gay shimmering jello for dessert.

347
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:20,700
 Tomorrow night try raspberry pear whip.

348
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:24,700
 Just prepare a package of raspberry jello as usual, then whip it up.

349
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:27,700
 Fold in a cup of luscious pear pulp and chill until firm.

350
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:37,700
 All six jello flavors, strawberry, raspberry, cherry, orange, lemon, and lime have that wonderful locked in goodness that reminds you of the real ripe fruit itself.

351
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:41,700
 Ask for jello, America's favorite gelatin dessert.

352
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:50,700
 And now getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldrich.

353
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:57,500
 Having been told by his parents that he could choose his new hat himself, Henry came home this morning,

354
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:01,000
 proudly exhibiting a genuine West Indian straw.

355
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,600
 And then, ordered to return the hat immediately, he ran into difficulties.

356
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,400
 Now, Henry is searching for someone to whom he can sell the hat.

357
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:13,000
 The scene opens in the San Rafael police station. It is that afternoon.

358
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,700
 But, Saunter, what's this full of done?

359
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:17,700
 I don't know what he's done. All I've found out is a set of old times on his trail

360
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,700
 and they'd sure like a chance to show us up.

361
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:20,700
 You're right.

362
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,100
 Now here's all I know about him.

363
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,900
 His initials are HA and his head size is 6 1/2.

364
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,500
 His head size, that's a new one.

365
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,500
 From what I can gather, the main clue is a straw hat.

366
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,200
 Now if you find that, we'll be on the right track.

367
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,000
 Okay, I'll start checking hat stores and cleaners.

368
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,100
 And if you run into anyone from the newspapers,

369
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,700
 don't let on, we don't know anything,

370
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:39,200
 but try to find out who it is we're looking for.

371
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:48,700
 Mary, please.

372
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:51,500
 Henry, let's go. I have to get ready for the beauty parlor.

373
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:57,400
 Mary, listen. If you had a brother and he was going to die any minute now, wouldn't you make a move to help him?

374
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,400
 Of course I would.

375
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,400
 Well, okay. I've got to have three dollars.

376
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,500
 Henry, do you think I'm made of money?

377
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:07,000
 But don't you realize Mother thinks I've got a credit of three dollars at the Emporium and I have them?

378
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,600
 Don't you realize that Kermit is coming here for dinner tonight and I am a size?

379
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:14,500
 Look, Mary. Why waste your money in beauty parlors?

380
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,000
 What?

381
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,500
 If you're going to marry Kermit someday, don't you think the only fear thing to do is let him see in your natural condition?

382
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,500
 [audience laughter]

383
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,000
 Henry Aldrich, marry way before you get mad.

384
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,700
 When is Kermit's birthday?

385
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:26,700
 In June, wow.

386
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:29,200
 How do you like to buy him a swell present?

387
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:32,480
 It's worth $14.50 and you can have it for $3.

388
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:32,980
 No.

389
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:33,480
 $2.95.

390
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:33,980
 No.

391
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:35,800
 And goodbye. I have to fix my hair.

392
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,700
 You mean you're not going to the beauty parlor?

393
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:40,200
 Of course I am, but I can't go there looking like this.

394
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:44,100
 Okay, Mary. Just wait until you want me to be best man at your wedding.

395
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:44,900
 Henry?

396
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:47,900
 Mother, are you sure there hasn't been a phone call for me?

397
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:48,900
 No, dear.

398
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:51,900
 Gee whizzer reporter, there won't even answer a phone call.

399
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:56,900
 Henry, I have to run over to your aunt Harry in first, but I want you to meet me down at the Emporium in 45 minutes.

400
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:57,900
 Has the Emporium?

401
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,900
 Yes, it seems your father has suddenly disappeared.

402
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,900
 Well, look, Mother.

403
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:05,900
 Don't you think a new hat is just a waste of money?

404
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:06,900
 Certainly not.

405
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:10,900
 But, Gee, you know how I always lose everything, especially a hat?

406
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,900
 Why, I won't have it a half an hour.

407
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:16,140
 He was, mother, I lose my head if it wasn't fastened on.

408
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:20,640
 And now, dear, you really need a hat, and you have a credit of $3 down at the Emporium.

409
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,640
 Mother, listen, there's something I've got to tell you.

410
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,960
 You tell me down at the Emporium in 45 minutes.

411
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,720
 But it'll be too late, then.

412
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,900
 What summer?

413
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:30,380
 Excuse me, Mrs. Orange, did I knock you over?

414
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:32,660
 Not quite, and please don't be late, then.

415
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:35,120
 Hey, Henry, where's your hat?

416
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,460
 It's hidden up in my room.

417
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:40,040
 Who, listen, I found this pilot, see who wants us to draw a hat?

418
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:40,560
 He does?

419
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:45,940
 Sure, he flies planes from Miami to Chicago, and he wants to stroll to where while he's in Miami.

420
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:46,940
 [Laughter]

421
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:48,540
 Homer, you don't mean it.

422
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:52,860
 Sure, and his head size is six and a half, and he doesn't care a darn about the initials.

423
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:56,220
 Oh boy, Homer, let me shake your hand.

424
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,320
 Sure, yes.

425
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,320
 Shake out!

426
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,820
 Oh, I'm sorry, Homer.

427
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,760
 It's just I'm so graceful.

428
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:04,460
 Well, stop twisting my arm and I'll give you his address.

429
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,560
 Sure, and then let's go upstairs and get the hat.

430
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,460
 You know what happened to me on the way over?

431
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:11,460
 a cop stopped me on the street and asked me my initials.

432
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:12,460
 - He did? - Sure.

433
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:16,460
 And when I told him HB, he said I was just one letter out.

434
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:17,460
 (laughter)

435
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:18,460
 That's funny.

436
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:21,460
 Do you suppose I nearly won a prize of some kind?

437
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:23,460
 - I'll answer the phone, Henry. - Okay, Mary.

438
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:26,460
 Only if it's Kermit. Tell him he's Mr. Chan.

439
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:27,460
 (phone ringing)

440
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:29,460
 - Hello. - Hello, Mary.

441
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:31,460
 Dear. - My Kermit.

442
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:33,460
 How are you, Kermit? - Fine.

443
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:36,460
 As a matter of fact, Mary, I'm on top of the world.

444
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:41,580
 the world. You are? I just wanted to prepare you. By the time I come over for dinner tonight,

445
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:46,380
 I might be out of obituaries. Really, my goodness, what's happened? Well, I haven't

446
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:50,580
 time to explain, Mary, but I'm working on a big story. I'm going to scoop the police

447
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:57,380
 department. No. Yes. So, it won't be long now, Mary, before you and I can talk over

448
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:03,780
 a breakfast table instead of a telephone. Oh, my. Oh, my goodness. Well, I've got to be

449
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,780
 getting along.

450
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:06,780
 Of course.

451
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,780
 Goodbye, come in and good luck.

452
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:09,780
 Mary!

453
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:10,780
 Yes, Henry!

454
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:12,780
 Listen, Mary, I give you my word.

455
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:13,780
 I didn't mean it.

456
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:14,780
 You didn't mean why.

457
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:17,780
 Anything I've ever said to you, except when I paid you compliments.

458
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:18,780
 Henry, get to the point.

459
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:19,780
 That's what I said.

460
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:23,780
 Mary, whatever I've done to you, let's both be good sports and give me back my hat.

461
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:24,780
 What hat?

462
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,780
 My West Indian straw that was up in my room.

463
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:27,780
 I haven't been anywhere near you.

464
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:29,780
 No, Mary, I haven't timed to joke.

465
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:30,780
 Now hand it over.

466
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:31,780
 But, Henry, I haven't got it.

467
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:34,380
 Listen Mary, I'll have Father Sue you.

468
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:36,580
 No I had, I'll sue you for both of us.

469
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:38,580
 Hey man, I don't think she's got it.

470
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:40,780
 But somebody's got it, I can't have lost it.

471
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:41,780
 Why not?

472
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:43,780
 You'd lose your head if it wasn't fast enough.

473
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:47,780
 Oh boy, Homer get out of my way, maybe I'd put it in here.

474
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:53,780
 Hey man, you're gonna throw everything out of your whole closet?

475
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:56,780
 Hey, cut it out, can you really hit me with that cold hair?

476
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:59,780
 Henry, put down that rubber boat!

477
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:09,780
 (Music)

478
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,780
 Yes sir, we clean and block hats.

479
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:13,780
 But what I want to know is do you stretch them?

480
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:15,780
 - Sure. - Well, you see this straw hat?

481
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,780
 It's a six and a half, it belongs to my son.

482
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:20,780
 And if it's possible, I'd like it stretched, so it would fit me.

483
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:23,780
 - Well, may I see the hat, please? - Yes, certainly.

484
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:25,780
 - Oh, it's a very fine hat. - Yes.

485
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:28,780
 - Genuine West Indian straw. - I, my, your son, has good taste.

486
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:33,100
 taste you think so to tell you the truth I agree with you I'm surprised he'd want

487
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:38,100
 to part with it well he isn't anxious to but his mother that is I understand what

488
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:41,980
 you mean I'm a married man myself it isn't that mothers mean to be unreasonable

489
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:47,020
 it's just that no fault of their own their well they're women that's quite true

490
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:53,020
 I'd like to help my son out and find his hat from his initials they say yeah now

491
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:57,460
 do you think you can stretch it I'm pretty sure I cancer it'll only take about

492
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:01,300
 10 minutes. Oh, that's fine. Just make yourself comfortable while I step into the

493
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,500
 back room and don't go away.

494
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:17,300
 Hello. Hello, is that you Mary? Yes, mother. I just got back from the beauty

495
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:21,580
 pole. Where are you? Now that the emporium I've been waiting for nearly two hours.

496
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:25,660
 Have you any idea where Henry is? He isn't here. And mother, do you realize it's

497
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:28,260
 Almost dinner time and come and we'll be here any minute.

498
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,960
 Oh my goodness, I've forgotten.

499
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,660
 Mary, you better start peeling potatoes

500
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:33,160
 and let your father entertain Kermit.

501
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,660
 But father isn't here either.

502
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:35,760
 He isn't.

503
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,960
 Well, dear, I'll get a taxi and be home in five minutes.

504
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:38,960
 All right, mother, goodbye.

505
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,460
 This is our dear.

506
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:42,860
 Father, where did you come from?

507
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:44,060
 Good evening, Mary.

508
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:45,860
 My goodness, that store has you--

509
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:46,660
 that's Henry.

510
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:49,460
 Mary, I don't want to hear this hat mentioned again

511
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:50,160
 in this house.

512
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,060
 Do you understand?

513
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:51,960
 Father, you look upset.

514
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,360
 Is anything wrong?

515
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,160
 Mary, let me ask you something.

516
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,240
 Do I look to you like a common criminal?

517
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:00,440
 No, it's not, Bob. You don't look the least sitcom.

518
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:05,680
 Mary, I've just come from the police station.

519
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,800
 The police station? What'd you go down there for?

520
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,400
 I was taken down there in a police car.

521
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,400
 You were, Bob.

522
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,320
 I was arrested.

523
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,880
 Really, Bob? Really, and truly?

524
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:16,080
 One minute I was sitting quietly in the cleanest,

525
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,880
 thumbing through the hat fires monthly.

526
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:21,200
 And the next minute I was sitting under a bright light answering questions.

527
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:28,220
 It seems the cleaner telephones some eager beaver newspaper reporter and he sent the police down.

528
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,620
 But why did they arrest you?

529
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:31,820
 How should I know that it didn't even know themselves?

530
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:34,120
 Excuse me, Father, I've got a phone permit.

531
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,820
 My goodness, when a prominent lawyer gets arrested, that's new.

532
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:38,020
 Mary, put down that phone.

533
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:38,520
 But Father...

534
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,020
 Put it down.

535
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:44,720
 Do you really mean you'd sell your own father down the river just to get permit out of obituary?

536
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,920
 But Father, our whole future is involved.

537
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:47,920
 So is mine.

538
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:48,920
 Yours, Father?

539
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,620
 Age it as I am, Mary.

540
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:52,920
 I have a few good years left.

541
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,920
 Please answer the phone.

542
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:55,920
 Hello.

543
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,920
 Hello, Mary. This is Kermit.

544
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:00,920
 Oh my goodness. See you there. Hello, Kermit.

545
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:04,920
 Mary, I'm afraid I won't be able to come up for dinner tonight after all.

546
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:05,920
 You won't. Why not?

547
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,920
 No, I'd rather not go into details, Mary, but...

548
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:11,920
 ...case I was working on, more or less blew up right in my face.

549
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,920
 Oh, Kermit, that's a shame.

550
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,920
 Yeah. Oh, well.

551
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,920
 Never mind, Kermit. I've got a scoop for you.

552
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,920
 Oh, you have to promise not to print it.

553
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:21,920
 What is it?

554
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,520
 Yes, what happened to my father?

555
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,320
 Mary, I really have to go now.

556
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,720
 How did you enter city was arrested?

557
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,720
 Oh, arrested?

558
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:32,220
 Well, I'm certainly surprised.

559
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:34,220
 Arrested? Why, that's terrible.

560
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,320
 Well, goodbye, Mary.

561
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,620
 You're hanging up right in the middle of our conversation.

562
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:39,520
 And Kermit, why can't you come to dinner tonight?

563
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,120
 I've got to cover an obituary.

564
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,720
 Well, everybody, I'm home.

565
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,820
 Look, look, Mary, could you meet me on the corner?

566
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:45,720
 From the corner.

567
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,920
 Mary, have...

568
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:49,320
 Gee whiz, here it is, my store.

569
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,320
 Wait a minute, Kermit.

570
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,720
 Henry Otter, what on earth have you got on your head?

571
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,520
 What does it look like, Mary? Mother!

572
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,720
 Hello, Kermit, listen!

573
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,120
 Mother, are you in the living room?

574
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,620
 No, Henry, she isn't home yet.

575
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:00,220
 She isn't? Oh boy.

576
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:03,620
 When she gets here, Father, will you help me explain how I got tied up?

577
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:05,720
 Hey, wait a minute, Henry, what's that thing on your head?

578
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:08,120
 An aviator's helmet, Father.

579
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,320
 Well, yes, but...

580
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,620
 See, it has ear flaps and everything.

581
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:14,320
 Don't you think it's the most practical type hat for me?

582
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,320
 Where did you get it?

583
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,820
 From a pilot friend of Homer's.

584
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:19,320
 He sort of traded it to me on trust, see?

585
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:22,720
 And now that I found my straw hat, all I have to do is take it over to him.

586
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,020
 Henry, about that straw hat.

587
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:27,420
 Boy, am I lucky he takes six and a half.

588
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:30,120
 Yes, well, the hat is now size seven and a half.

589
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:32,120
 What? Why can that be?

590
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,120
 I never buy it, it is.

591
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,520
 You don't have to return that helmet to your pilot.

592
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:39,420
 Return? Oh, no, father.

593
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:40,920
 Let me have a look at you.

594
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,220
 You, Mary!

595
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:43,520
 In the living room, I'll ask you.

596
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:46,320
 Oh, boy. Listen, Mother, I can explain everything.

597
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,680
 Henry, you can explain later. First I have something to show you all.

598
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,880
 What is it, Mother?

599
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,120
 Well, while I was waiting for Henry down at the Emporium, I bought...

600
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:57,120
 Here I am, everybody. How do you like me?

601
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,720
 Mother! Mother!

602
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,120
 Gee, what is it?

603
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:04,120
 Why do you use a hat? A hat?

604
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:07,720
 I don't believe it. Mother! A brace of pheasant?

605
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,320
 Certainly, Mary.

606
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:15,120
 Alice, you will march down to the Emporium, first thing in the morning and return that pheasant hat, Father.

607
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,120
 - Return it, but Sam!

608
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,700
 (upbeat music)

609
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:30,840
 - Thank you, Henry.

610
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:31,680
 - What, Homer?

611
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,980
 - Before I'm coming to dinner tomorrow night,

612
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:34,340
 you suppose we should tell your mother

613
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:36,180
 I'm on a very special diet?

614
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:37,180
 - She was, you are?

615
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:38,820
 - Sure, because I'm anemic.

616
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:40,380
 - You are?

617
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:41,620
 - G-Homer, that's tough.

618
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:42,460
 - Sure.

619
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:43,380
 To build up my strength,

620
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:45,880
 I have to have second helping of everything.

621
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:49,500
 Well, second helping is what everybody has for when there's

622
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,780
 Jello Tapioca Puddings for dessert.

623
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:55,560
 Yes, Jello Tapioca Puddings, newest members of the famous Jello

624
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,700
 Pudding family.

625
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:00,100
 And they're a miracle of goodness, a marvel of speed.

626
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:03,420
 There's Jello Vanilla Tapioca, Jello Chocolate Tapioca,

627
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:06,100
 and Jello Orange Coconut Tapioca.

628
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:09,800
 All three are luscious, light and delicate, gloriously rich

629
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,860
 and creamy.

630
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:13,180
 And you know that name Jello is a trademark.

631
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:18,460
 It's the property of general foods and it tells you that you're getting a genuine jello product.

632
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:21,580
 Ask your grocer for jello tapioca puddings.

633
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:26,420
 And while you're about it, better get three packages so you'll have plenty for the weekend.

634
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:28,860
 That's jello tapioca pudding.

636
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:34,620
 You're showing you'll be in your living room in ours next week at the same time.

637
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:35,820
 Good night, bros.

 [MUSIC]

639
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:42,100
 And this is Dan Seymour in New York saying the old Ridge family

640
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:44,680
 is brought to you by the jello family.

641
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:59,160
 For desserts that are delicious, boy, believe me, you should know, they are made by famous J-E-L-L-F.

642
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:11,560
 Listen again next Thursday, same time, same station. One other sparkling half hour was the old recender.

643
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:18,560
 This is NBC, the National Broadcasting Company.

644
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:21,140
