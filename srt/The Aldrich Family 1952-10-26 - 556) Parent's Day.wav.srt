 [Music]

00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 Henry Henry, coming mother!

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 [Applause]

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 Yes, it's the Army family, transcribed, written by Crippa Goldsmith.

 [Music]

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 Men who work with figures say that the average American family consists of 4.2 persons

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 and that certainly is true of the Aldrich family.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 For Sam and Alice, Mary and Henry always add up to 4.2.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 The extra two tenths contributed by Henry because he's a typical teenage boy plus a little something extra.

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 The scene opens in the all-rich hallway. The time is evening.

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 Hey Henry, what are you doing?

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 Looking for the phone book Homer.

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 Are you folks going to be there tomorrow?

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 Be well Homer.

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 At school. You've forgotten Henry the mile was parents' day.

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 Oh, we're not so loud. Hey folks are right there in the living room.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 Are they going, Henry?

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 No. Boy am I lucky they've forgotten all about it.

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,720
 about it. Well how do you know? Well the notice came two weeks ago and my mother

20
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,320
 put it on the table. Then about three days later somebody threw it out. I

21
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,440
 forget who. Boy I sure hope my folks forget. It's the one thing I hate it's

22
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:33,360
 parents day. Same here. If you go on a piece of tour on that day. Hey. Yes mother.

23
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,240
 Why don't you at home I come into the living room. Well I've got to put in a

24
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:42,200
 call mother. Who are you gonna call? I go to a foreign's word. But you told me to

25
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,480
 get a date for tomorrow night. Well sure, but what do you want to take by all of

26
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,440
 for? Listen Homer, she's a darn good looking girl.

27
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,420
 Never seen.

28
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:52,720
 L273. L273. Yes please.

29
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,840
 Henry, didn't you ask why I was a go to something a week ago? Sure.

30
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,960
 And she turned you down, didn't she? Homeward or reason. She turned me down

31
00:01:58,960 --> 00:01:59,720
 was because

32
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,960
 when you please stop reading down my neck.

33
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,400
 Henry, she'll only turn you down again. Why embarrass yourself?

34
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,920
 Homer, do you hear me? Catch your mother in the room and read the National Geographic.

35
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,920
 Okay, but don't say I didn't want you.

36
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:13,920
 Hello?

37
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,920
 Hello? This is Hen.

38
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,920
 Hello?

39
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:17,920
 Hen, don't you remember?

40
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,920
 Henry.

41
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:19,920
 Hello.

42
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,920
 Hi, Viola.

43
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:21,920
 Hi.

44
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,920
 Henry who?

45
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,920
 He was Henry Aldridge.

46
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,920
 Oh, hello.

47
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,920
 Are you studying hard for tomorrow?

48
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,920
 You mean for parenting?

49
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,920
 Yes.

50
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,920
 Yes.

51
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,920
 Well, would you like to go to a dance tomorrow night?

52
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,920
 Would you?

53
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,920
 Sure.

54
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,920
 No thank you.

55
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:41,920
 Well...

56
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,420
 You mean you can?

57
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:44,420
 Yes.

58
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:46,420
 Would you like to do anything Saturday night?

59
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:47,420
 No thank you.

60
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:49,420
 I'm going to be busy Saturday night.

61
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:51,420
 How about a week from Saturday night?

62
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:54,420
 Well I can't very well tell what I'll be doing that for a head.

63
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:55,420
 Oh.

64
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:58,420
 Well I guess I'll see you at school tomorrow.

65
00:02:58,420 --> 00:02:59,420
 You will.

66
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,420
 Bye.

67
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:01,420
 Bye.

68
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:02,420
 Bye.

69
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:05,420
 Hey Henry, don't bother me Homer.

70
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:07,420
 Didn't I tell you you shouldn't ask her?

71
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,420
 You know what she said to me.

72
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:13,420
 Alright, Henry, I wasn't going to tell you because I was afraid that it hurt your feelings,

73
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:14,420
 but...

74
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:17,420
 Well, I happen to know Viola doesn't want to go out with you.

75
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:18,420
 How do you know that?

76
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,420
 She told Agnes Lawson.

77
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:21,420
 She did?

78
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:22,420
 Sure.

79
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:24,420
 You know what she said her folks said?

80
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:25,420
 What?

81
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:29,420
 That you wanted the right kind of company for her, and they didn't want her to be seen with you.

82
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:32,420
 Mr. and Mrs. Barnes were and said that about me?

83
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,420
 Why should you care what they say, Henry?

84
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:37,420
 You've got lots worse things to worry about than that.

85
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:38,420
 What?

86
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:41,420
 Well, I'm not sure, but when I was in the living room just now,

87
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:44,420
 I think I heard your father say something about coming to school a mile.

88
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:46,420
 You couldn't have.

89
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:48,420
 All I know had me is what I thought I heard.

90
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:49,420
 She whiz.

91
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:50,420
 Where's my coat?

92
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:52,420
 Right there on the floor.

93
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:55,420
 You want me to get a date for you tomorrow night?

94
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:56,420
 No, I don't.

95
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:58,420
 Well, so long.

96
00:03:58,420 --> 00:03:59,420
 So long.

97
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:03,420
 And Homer, when you see Agnes, will you please tell me to stop spreading stories about Viola?

98
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:08,060
 What you say against my over you know what you just told me oh

99
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:17,700
 Father yes, and father could I ask you something what's on your mind? Well house

100
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:20,700
 house business

101
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:27,740
 Quite good. Thank you Henry. Have you done all your studying for this evening? I'm getting my book out right now, mother. I just

102
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,220
 Father are you gonna be busy tomorrow?

103
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:33,920
 My I expect to be where

104
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,500
 What do you mean where well?

105
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:43,360
 At the office or all around town. I'm going to my office in the morning if that's what you mean you are

106
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,860
 And we'd be quite busy down there. I hope so

107
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:52,400
 Well, I'm I'm glad to hear the business is so good and I'm glad you feel that way

108
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:58,140
 I'm can I get you something no thanks? I'm going upstairs a moment any please get over your homework. I am father

109
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:03,140
 Mother? Mother? Mother, do you mind if I ask you something?

110
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:08,140
 It hasn't anything to do with your algebra. She hasn't anything to do with anything.

111
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:10,140
 You know by all this mother and father.

112
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:13,140
 Mr. and Mrs. Fonsworth? I know them slightly.

113
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:18,140
 Oh. Mother, did father say it was going to be busy all day?

114
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:22,140
 Henry, I thought you were going to study. They am studying my lot. Look, I'm on page 18.

115
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:25,140
 Well, suppose you keep right on then.

116
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:30,140
 All nays, artes, qui, ad, humani.

117
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:33,140
 Do you know what Agnes said somebody said about me?

118
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:34,140
 What?

119
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:36,140
 Never mind, nothing.

120
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:39,140
 But gee, I don't see all our folks congeum to conclusions

121
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:41,140
 when they don't even know me.

122
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:43,140
 Who's folks don't even know you?

123
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:45,140
 Anybody's, anybody's.

124
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:47,140
 She was, what's so terrible about me?

125
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:50,140
 Henry, are you translating Latin?

126
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:53,140
 Who me? Sure.

127
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:56,140
 Mother, do you think Viola Farnsworth is so good looking?

128
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:57,140
 What's that?

129
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:00,140
 I mean, what ride is Homer, God?

130
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:04,140
 Homer, dear, is there something in that book that confuses you?

131
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:06,140
 No, she whiz.

132
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:11,140
 Mother, would you mind asking Mr. Mrs. Farnsworth over here for dinner some time?

133
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:14,140
 Dear, we don't even know Mr. and Mrs. Farnsworth.

134
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:17,140
 That isn't the point, Mother. You're just looking at things backwards.

135
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,140
 Have you ever met the Farnsworth?

136
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:23,740
 Yes, but only under what you might call unfavorable circumstances.

137
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:25,940
 So why couldn't you have them over here sometime?

138
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,940
 Let them see what father is really like.

139
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:28,940
 What is what?

140
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,340
 - Henry getting his work done?

141
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,340
 - What's that father?

142
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:33,740
 - Henry, I think you'd get a great deal more work done

143
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,940
 if you'd take your book and go up to your room.

144
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:36,740
 - Now?

145
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:37,340
 - Now.

146
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:38,740
 - People on Mother answers my question.

147
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:39,540
 - Henry?

148
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,540
 - Yes, Father, I'll go.

149
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:43,140
 - I'll only first...

150
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,740
 Mother, may I ask one thing?

151
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,540
 Well...

152
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,340
 Well, if you should meet me on the street,

153
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:52,420
 out of a clear sky, see, and you never met me before.

154
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:54,100
 What would you say?

155
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:59,860
 Why, I think I'd say, here comes a very fine looking young man.

156
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,420
 You what?

157
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,060
 Well, good night.

158
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:03,820
 Good night.

159
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,780
 Good night.

160
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:06,420
 How was it?

161
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,580
 Yes, Sam.

162
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:09,660
 Why in the world did he ask Sam?

163
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:13,140
 Now, dear, didn't you ever wonder the same thing about yourself?

164
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:16,980
 Yes, but I never went around asking people.

165
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:21,380
 Sam, how would you like to have Mr. and Mrs. Farnsworth over for dinner some evening?

166
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:22,580
 What on earth for?

167
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:28,580
 Well, if I read between the lines, Henry wants them to see that his family is at least civilized.

168
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:30,180
 Oh, what are the Farnsworth's like?

169
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:32,180
 No, I'd like to know too, dear.

170
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:34,980
 Why couldn't we at least ask them to join us tomorrow?

171
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,180
 You mean when we go to the school?

172
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,180
 Yes.

173
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:37,180
 Why?

174
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:39,380
 Well, they've never been to parents' day.

175
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:40,980
 Well, give them a ring.

176
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:45,180
 Only, Alison, you're quite sure we shouldn't tell Henry that we're going to be there.

177
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:48,680
 Don't you know how nervous Henry got when we went last year?

178
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:52,180
 I think it would be much nicer just as surprising.

179
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:55,180
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

180
00:07:55,180 --> 00:08:04,180
 I'll bring your bacon in in just a moment.

181
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:05,460
 Did you reach the farms where?

182
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:05,960
 No, there.

183
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,540
 I just tried them again.

184
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,020
 They must be pretty social.

185
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:11,420
 Out last night, line busy this morning,

186
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:12,860
 I guess they're all in our class.

187
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,020
 Will you call Henry, please?

188
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:14,860
 Henry!

189
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:17,200
 - Hey, my grandfather, I'm coming right now.

190
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:20,060
 Could you sort of tighten this tie for me, please?

191
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:22,280
 - What are you wearing a bow tie for?

192
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,440
 - Well, I don't know, I just thought

193
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,440
 maybe it would make me look different.

194
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,760
 - From what?

195
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,680
 - Hmm.

196
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,240
 - Please sit down and eat your cereal.

197
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,160
 - Yes, father.

198
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,600
 - And don't spill anything.

199
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,440
 I've never seen you look so neat

200
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,600
 and I'd like to save the memory.

201
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,400
 (audience laughing)

202
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,040
 - Yes, sir.

203
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,560
 Would you mind asking me some of the questions

204
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:42,920
 in this history book while I'm eating?

205
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,280
 - Yeah, well, this is something

206
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:49,280
 going to have in school today? Yes, sir. Well, in any way it is. When did the Civil War

207
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:56,720
 start? April 12, 1861. Did the move to see seed have general acquiescence among the southern

208
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:03,200
 states? What's that? Did the move to see seed have general acquiescence among the southern

209
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:13,640
 states? Acquiescence? Will you pass the cream, please? Here you are. How do you spell that

210
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:25,160
 words. A-C-Q-U-I-E-S-C-E-N-C-E. Oh, acquiesce, ensure, naturally. What does it mean? Well, that

211
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:29,720
 was when the war started. Things were sort of mixed up in there. And I suppose you go

212
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:33,640
 in the living room and look up the word in the dictionary. No? No. Yes, Father.

213
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,640
 Hack we have to say

214
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:42,580
 They're still busy who the funds were so I just tried to phone them again

215
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:47,680
 So you sure we shouldn't tell Henry that we're trying to get them to go down to the high school with this

216
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:53,460
 Be it why not wait and make it a double surprise your father acquiescence means to accept

217
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:58,000
 That's fine. It can tuck he didn't do it and Missouri didn't know what to do

218
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,520
 Henry, anybody wrong?

219
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,520
 She wasn't that you, Homer?

220
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,960
 You know what time it is?

221
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,680
 Oh boy, I've got to go, mother.

222
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,720
 I sure you don't want to be late on--

223
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,760
 on goodbye, mother.

224
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,400
 Take your banana, dear.

225
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,760
 I've got it.

226
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,720
 Break your tie.

227
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,760
 She was in that crooked again.

228
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,680
 And thanks very much for all your other help, father.

229
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,200
 Bye.

230
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,840
 Pea Henry, I'm I sick.

231
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,920
 It's a matter, Homer.

232
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,240
 My darn folks are coming to school.

233
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,600
 Oh boy, that's tough.

234
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,840
 And you know what's going to happen?

235
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:31,840
 My teachers are all gonna call on me and make a fool of my whole family.

236
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:35,840
 Boy, I'm sure glad I'm not in your shoes, Homer.

237
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:46,840
 - Ms. Eggleston. - Ms. Eggleston, yes, darling.

238
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:49,840
 - I've got a wonderful idea. - Well, what is it, Homer?

239
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:56,840
 As long as this is parents day, don't you think it'll be a good idea if instead of my coming into English class I act as sort of a nasher?

240
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,840
 - And ushers? - Sure.

241
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,840
 I'll stand right outside the classroom, see?

242
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:04,840
 And whenever I see a parent that doesn't look as though he knows where he's going, I'll say,

243
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,840
 "Wouldn't you like to step in your listen to English?"

244
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,840
 That's very thoughtful of your whole mother.

245
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:11,840
 We're going to need you in the spelling bee.

246
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:14,840
 [audience laughter]

247
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,840
 - In the spelling bee? - Of course.

248
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,840
 It's better be one of the main features of the day.

249
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,840
 Some of the boys are going to spell against some of the girls.

250
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,840
 I think the parents would enjoy that, don't you?

251
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:28,240
 The fine minute mine won't.

252
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,440
 You are in it.

253
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,440
 Oh boy.

254
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:35,440
 I know this sounds like an excuse, but frankly I've got a sore throat.

255
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,440
 Oh man, sorry that I'm busy and I should have to ask you to leave the room.

256
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,440
 Yes, Ms. Eggleston, I'll go.

257
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,240
 But my throat's getting worse every second.

258
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,240
 Hey Homer.

259
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,840
 Tell me your long Henry Wissian.

260
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,840
 How about delivering this note if I own a fine's worth?

261
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,340
 No.

262
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:50,340
 Please Homer.

263
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:52,640
 Henry, why are you wasting time writing her notes?

264
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,440
 I didn't write it, I didn't write a word of it.

265
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,000
 I just cut it out of a book.

266
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 Let's say it.

267
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,880
 It's just a little write up Homer.

268
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,960
 Here, it's about my father.

269
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,480
 She was.

270
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,800
 What was that printed in?

271
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,200
 Miss College Yearbook when he graduated.

272
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,240
 He was a big shot in his class.

273
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,360
 Boy, does he look different.

274
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,880
 What did they call it?

275
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,080
 Dapper Sam?

276
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:15,580
 Sure.

277
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:17,080
 Dapper Sam.

278
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,440
 Hey, read the whole thing.

279
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:22,080
 Dapper Sam Aldridge, perhaps a bit stuffy at times,

280
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:25,680
 but generous, brilliant, and most likely to succeed.

281
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,160
 Pretty good, huh?

282
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,360
 What do they mean by stuffy?

283
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,080
 Well, my mother got him over there.

284
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:34,800
 How about it?

285
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,680
 Would you please give it to Viola?

286
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,480
 If I will, will you do something for me?

287
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,320
 Sure.

288
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,160
 Okay.

289
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,160
 Go on and tell Ms. Aglison,

290
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,520
 you'd like to take my place in the spelling bee.

291
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:46,520
 Hold on, wait a minute, Homer, what spelling bee?

292
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,960
 Just a little spelling bee.

293
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,320
 It's gonna be a lot of fun.

294
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,440
 Fun for who?

295
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,940
 I can't remember. My folks are going to be there and yours aren't.

296
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,940
 Homer, I've got a sore throat.

297
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:58,740
 Don't give me that. I thought you said you'd help me if I'd help you.

298
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:00,940
 But Homer, you know what my spelling is like.

299
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:02,840
 Do you want me to give this note to Viola?

300
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,640
 Well sure, but that's entirely different.

301
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:08,240
 Do you? Oh, don't you want it to know your father used to be considered bright.

302
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:22,540
 Good morning, students.

303
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:23,940
 Good morning, Ms. Farmer.

304
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:27,300
 Before we begin our history, I think it would be very nice

305
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,180
 if we introduced our visitors.

306
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:32,220
 Class, this is Homer Brown's mother and father,

307
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,700
 Mr. Mrs. Brown.

308
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,900
 Good morning, Mrs. Brown.

309
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:39,220
 Now then, who would like to answer the first question?

310
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,780
 Oh, I wouldn't have.

311
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:43,140
 Well, that's fine.

312
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:46,460
 But I think we should let Homer have the honor.

313
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:48,580
 Homer, will you stand up, please?

314
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:50,300
 Yes, Ms. Barkley.

315
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,300
 Oh, it was my brother.

316
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:59,300
 Now Homer, in what year did the civil war begin?

317
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:00,800
 Why are you...

318
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,800
 Well...

319
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,800
 In what year?

320
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,800
 In what year?

321
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,800
 The civil war?

322
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,800
 Was that in today's lesson, Miss Buckley?

323
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,300
 Yes, it was.

324
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,300
 Oh.

325
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:16,300
 Well, I guess I'm not thinking very fast.

326
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,800
 Now, that's quite all right, Homer.

327
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:21,560
 Suppose we let you sit down and give you another chance later on?

328
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,840
 Yes, Ms. Barker.

329
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:26,040
 Henry Aldrich, would you tell us the answer?

330
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,040
 Who me?

331
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,640
 Well, it was in 1861.

332
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,640
 That is correct.

333
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,640
 It would be exact April 12th.

334
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,640
 Thank you, Henry.

335
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,640
 You may sit down.

336
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,640
 Yes, Ms. Buckley.

337
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:38,560
 Well, I see we have some more visitors.

338
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,560
 How are you?

339
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,560
 How are you?

340
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,560
 Hi.

341
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:45,480
 Glad you're glad to welcome Mr. Mrs. Aldrich and Mr. Mrs. Parnsworth.

342
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,480
 Good morning.

343
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,480
 I believe that Lady of Chaos right here in front.

344
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,480
 Thank you.

345
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,480
 No, then.

346
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,480
 Supposed me that Viola Farnsworth answered this next question.

347
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,480
 Yes, Ms. Buckley.

348
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,480
 What were the basic causes of the Civil War?

349
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,480
 Slavery and economic difference.

350
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,480
 No, that's fine.

351
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:10,480
 Now the next question, I think we should let Henry Aldrich have the next one in honor of his parents.

352
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,480
 Henry?

353
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,480
 Yes, Ms. Buckley.

354
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:17,480
 Did the move to secede have general acquiescence among the southern states?

355
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:23,480
 Well, I'll tell you Miss Fine. I mean my puppy.

356
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:26,480
 Take your time.

357
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,480
 Well, I guess I'm afraid.

358
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:34,480
 Henry, you told me a breakfast Kentucky and Missouri were doubtful states.

359
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:39,480
 Oh, yes. I'm sorry, Mr. Audrich, but I'm afraid we'll have to ask our visitors not to give any assistance.

360
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,480
 I beg your pardon.

361
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,480
 Homer?

362
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,920
 Yes, Miss Barkley?

363
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,560
 That piece of paper that you just died to pass the viola.

364
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:49,760
 Does that have anything to do with our civil war history?

365
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:53,480
 Well, it's from around that time.

366
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:56,960
 [Laughter]

367
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,280
 Yeah, that's fine.

368
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:02,480
 I'm quite sure then all of this will be interested in hearing what it has to say.

369
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,880
 You mean...

370
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,480
 You mean you want to say this?

371
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,680
 Will you stand up and read it, please?

372
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,680
 The only thing is it's...

373
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,680
 Yes.

374
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,680
 Now, let's forget that we have visitors.

375
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,680
 Just stand up and read it right out.

376
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,680
 Right out?

377
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,680
 I think we should keep up on everything that anyway pertains to history.

378
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,680
 But it's my former.

379
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,680
 Yes, ma'am.

380
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,680
 It says...

381
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:35,680
 "Dapper Sam Albridge, perhaps a bit stuff in your eyes, but you're a little bit taller."

382
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,180
 Homer!

383
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:38,180
 Sam!

384
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:39,180
 Henry!

385
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:41,180
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

386
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:43,180
 [APPLAUSE]

387
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:50,320
 When we turn to the oldest family in just a moment,

388
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,860
 his voice has thrilled millions.

389
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:54,900
 His curly locks have been compared to spun gold.

390
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:57,420
 His background makes him a man among men.

391
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:58,340
 Who is he?

392
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:00,060
 None other than Phil Harris.

393
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,460
 And this evening, why not join Phil and his long-suffering

394
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:05,660
 wife, Alice Faye, in another of the crony misadventures?

395
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:10,940
 Then for another Theatre Guild on the Air presentation, listen to Madeline Carroll, Burgess Meredith

396
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:14,780
 and Melville Cooper in the Broadway hit Hobson's Choice.

397
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:19,580
 Each Sunday over most of these same NBC stations, Theatre Guild on the Air brings you stars

398
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,860
 of Broadway and Hollywood.

399
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:26,500
 News comes next with Martha Round Trees Meet the Press, and here is your chance to sit in

400
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:31,920
 on America's only public press conference as the personalities in the news answer questions

401
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:35,600
 asked by a panel composed of prominent reporters.

402
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,120
 So check your newspaper for broadcast times

403
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:41,460
 and listen in this evening for more top NBC radio

404
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,680
 entertainment with the Phil Harris Alice

405
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:47,080
 facial theater guild on the air and Meet the Press.

406
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:58,680
 Now getting back to the troubles of Henry Olmute.

407
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,720
 Henry, not knowing his mother and father,

408
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:05,160
 planning to visit his school on parance day as agreed to take part in a spelling

409
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:10,440
 bee in place of home of brown seen opens in the school corridor a few minutes

410
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:14,920
 before the contest is scheduled to begin you wait Homer you just wait Henry could

411
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,920
 I help it if she made me read it if you think I'm gonna go into that spelling

412
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:21,480
 before you you're crazy but Henry you got you all know I don't know what to

413
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:25,240
 tell Miss Eggleston to put you back in listen Henry you gave me your word

414
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:30,360
 you're in the spelling bee yes father may I speak with you please you know

415
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:34,120
 what you're going to say. So long, Henry. I'm going into the arts and crafts exhibit.

416
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:37,080
 I don't believe I've ever been quite so embarrassed in my life.

417
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:40,440
 Father, I didn't know Homer was going to read that. The whole thing was out of my control.

418
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:46,760
 That isn't what I'm referring to. And what is it? In history class, you're not remembering that it

419
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:51,720
 was Kentucky. And father, my mind went blank. Didn't I send you into the living room during

420
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:56,280
 breakfast to look up the key word acquiescence? And didn't you come back and tell me the correct

421
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:59,960
 answer? Yes, father. Then why did you act as though you didn't have a tongue?

422
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,960
 Because right at that minute I couldn't have told you my own name.

423
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:03,960
 Henry!

424
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:04,960
 Yes, mother?

425
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,960
 Where's the autumn craft exhibit?

426
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,960
 She, I don't think you and father would enjoy seeing that, mother.

427
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,960
 Don't you have anything in there?

428
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:17,960
 Well, yes, but wouldn't you rather have me take you around the building and show you the gymnasium or something?

429
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,960
 And what room is the exhibit?

430
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,960
 Well, I don't know the exact room.

431
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,960
 Well, will you please go down the hall and ask someone?

432
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,960
 Yes, mother, I'll go.

433
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:28,960
 Sam?

434
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,260
 I'm not sure, but I don't think I like the Fonzers.

435
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:34,660
 Thankfully, I don't like them either.

436
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:38,260
 Did you see Mr. Fonzers' face when Henry couldn't answer that question?

437
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,260
 I saw it.

438
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:41,660
 Your mother, the exhibit's right here in room 101.

439
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:43,260
 Well, let's go in.

440
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:45,060
 I want you all like it.

441
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,460
 Oh, yes, we will.

442
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:49,260
 My goodness, look at all the things.

443
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:51,260
 Look at that card table.

444
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:53,460
 Henry, did one of the students build that?

445
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:54,460
 Yes, sir.

446
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,460
 But without sort of an advanced chord.

447
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,460
 Henry, look out, you're backing into someone.

448
00:19:58,460 --> 00:19:59,860
 Oh, well, she was. Excuse me.

449
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:02,260
 That's all right. I hardly felt it.

450
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:04,760
 Oh, is that you, Mr. Farnsworth?

451
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:05,560
 It is.

452
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:08,960
 Henry, your father and I go to walk over and look at the mechanical drawer.

453
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:09,660
 All right.

454
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:10,460
 Young man.

455
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:11,460
 Yes, Mr. Farnsworth?

456
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:14,460
 Do you happen to know who built this model airplane?

457
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:17,460
 Well, that was built by five or six of the boys.

458
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:19,560
 They all sort of got together on it.

459
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,960
 Were you one of them?

460
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,260
 No.

461
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:23,260
 No, I wasn't.

462
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:25,560
 You know, what did you build?

463
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:30,060
 Well, I sort of... I built this thing right here.

464
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:32,060
 What is it?

465
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:35,060
 What is anything? It's just a paperweight.

466
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:38,060
 Well, how did you happen to put your time in on a thing like that?

467
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:41,060
 Well, it's nothing but a brass ball.

468
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:44,060
 Well, I made it out of a square block, see, on a machine.

469
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:47,060
 I'd probably be fun to see if I could make it perfectly round.

470
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:48,060
 Father!

471
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:49,060
 Yes, Viola?

472
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:50,060
 Viola, Viola.

473
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:53,060
 We were just looking at Henry's paperweight.

474
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:56,540
 - Henry, did you make that? - Sure.

475
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:58,740
 - Would you like me to show you some of these other things?

476
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:01,360
 - Oh no, it's almost time for the spelling bee.

477
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,120
 - The spelling bee?

478
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,560
 Are you in that tool?

479
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,740
 - Of course.

480
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:08,460
 - Do you mean to say, young man, that you were in it?

481
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:11,460
 - Well, in a way I am.

482
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:13,260
 - It ought to be quite a contest.

483
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:14,260
 - Yes.

484
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:17,460
 - I was just looking at this card here by your paperweight.

485
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:19,060
 Did you letter this?

486
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,060
 - Yes, sir.

487
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:27,760
 It says "sphere" made by Henry Aldrich, and "sphere" is spelled S-P-E-R-E.

488
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:32,560
 - Don't you happen to tell us that way? - Henry, you kill me!

489
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:36,060
 Listen, Viola, anybody would think you never made any mistake?

490
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:41,860
 - Henry, is that the bell for the spelling bee? - Yes, I think it is, Father.

491
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:45,160
 This is something I don't want to miss, Mr. Aldrich.

492
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:49,960
 - Your daughter pretty good at spelling? - Well, I'll certainly stake her against any boy.

493
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:54,880
 Anytime yes well just to be a good sport I'll take Henry against any girl

494
00:21:54,880 --> 00:22:01,360
 Father you don't really want to go in there. Do you I'd like to see anyone keep me out? Come on father

495
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:07,440
 We're going to be late Sam wait for me. Mother are you coming to? Of course I am well

496
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,560
 Well look you're gonna use for this paperweight on your desk

497
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:15,160
 Henry did you make that sure could you just put it in your pocketbook?

498
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:18,720
 Well there I can't very well carry a brass ball like that around

499
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:22,080
 Aren't you supposed to leave it here on exhibit?

500
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,480
 She was no.

501
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,480
 Don't know why I entered it here in the first place.

502
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,480
 Sam?

503
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:26,980
 What?

504
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:30,980
 Put this paper weight in your pocket and hurry up or we'll be late to the spelling bee.

505
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:45,480
 Now then please, the boys will stand on this side of the room and the girls on the other side.

506
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,980
 Yes, Ms. Eggers.

507
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:53,980
 "In suggestly, perhaps I should have said beforehand how delightably I have so many guests present."

508
00:22:53,980 --> 00:23:03,980
 Mr. Mrs. Farnsworth, Mr. Mrs. Brown, Mr. Marshall, Mrs. Johnson, that's Theresa Johnson's aunt, of course, and Mr. Mrs. Sam Orbridge.

509
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:07,980
 Now then, let's draw the first word for the girls' theme.

510
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:12,420
 That's a chase. Your word is "re-conoiter".

511
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:13,420
 Reconoiter.

512
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:17,660
 R-E-C-O-N-N-O-I-T-E-R.

513
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:20,120
 Convect. And now the boys.

514
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:25,320
 When it was sure, I believe your word is to be "irrecipilist".

515
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,820
 Irrecipilist.

516
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:31,840
 E-A-R-Y-S-I-T-E-L-A-S.

517
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,960
 Wrong.

518
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,000
 Wrong.

519
