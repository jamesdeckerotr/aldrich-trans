00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,200
 picture of What A Life.

8
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,440
 It's truly a four-bell movie and we urge you all to see it.

9
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,640
 Tonight we are pleased to present one of the stars of the motion picture, Miss Betty Field.

00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,600
 It will play Barbara Pearson, Henry Sweetheart.

 They've seen Opens in Barbara's home.

13
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,200
 It is early evening.

14
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,200
 Grandma!

15
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,200
 Grandmother!

16
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,400
 Grandmother!

17
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,200
 Well, yeah, Barbara.

18
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,700
 Henry, you all just become young, has he?

19
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,300
 No, come in and not ask you, Barbara.

20
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,700
 Uh, no, he hasn't, Barbara.

21
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:34,200
 First time this week, he hasn't been here.

22
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,000
 Father, could you come here a minute?

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,500
 Where are you?

24
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,600
 I'm here in the front hall.

25
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,700
 Well, well, what is it this time, Barbara?

26
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,200
 Now, listen, Father.

27
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,100
 I don't want grandmother to hear me.

28
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,300
 Why don't you want me to?

29
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,300
 Oh, no reason.

30
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:55,660
 Father yes when Henry comes would you do something for me well what is it I know

31
00:01:55,660 --> 00:02:00,520
 it's awful but I've got it all planned I found out today Henry is saying an

32
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:06,180
 awful lot of Constance Marshall who told you Constance yourself did I say but

33
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:11,060
 not even seen them together I'll I'll back the candy we had around here last

34
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:16,100
 night I haven't any idea father when Henry does come would you learn stepping

35
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:19,260
 into the room just once or twice and saying George Bigel I want to speak to

36
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:24,220
 me on the telephone. Well, I will. Father, won't you? I'm just a bit surprised,

37
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:29,140
 Barbara. Father, it wouldn't be so terrible, wouldn't? Don't you think I'm human? Barbara,

38
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:33,060
 I still think it'd be much better if you got your grandmother mixed up in this. But daddy,

39
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:36,820
 grandmother wouldn't approve it. You know she wouldn't. And exactly what makes you think

40
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:43,140
 I do. It's for Henry's own good father. Constance Marshall is so silly. Barbara, young ladies,

41
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:47,580
 don't go about deliberately making young men jealous. What would they do? I beg to differ

42
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:52,380
 with you. Well, I get my I. T. for peace that candy. So had my

43
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:56,060
 teeth. Charles, somebody's at the front door. Please say yes,

44
00:02:56,060 --> 00:03:00,260
 father. Well, I'll think it over. That's practically yes. Tell

45
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:05,820
 him the other right now. Well, how do you do, young man? How do

46
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:09,420
 you do, Mr. Pearson? How are you this evening? Splendid. And

47
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:13,740
 that how is Mrs. Sanderson? She's splendid. No, she's not either.

48
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:15,300
 My digestion is terrible.

49
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,220
 Is that you in there, Mrs. Sanderson?

50
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,340
 Jaws.

51
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:20,060
 Tell Barbara Henry's here.

52
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,860
 Mask and all evening, where Henry is?

53
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:22,700
 Hashi.

54
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,460
 No, I haven't eaten it, grandmother.

55
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:26,500
 I had to stop for a second and see

56
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,900
 somebody on the way over, Barbara.

57
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:29,740
 Oh.

58
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,940
 Wanna want to put your hats in that package, Don?

59
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:35,460
 I'll put my hat down, but I think I'll keep the package.

60
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:36,620
 Don't you trust us, Henry?

61
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,140
 Oh, I don't mind holding it.

62
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:39,500
 It only weighs two pounds.

63
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,340
 What's in it?

64
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:42,260
 Oh, just a little something.

65
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:46,540
 Well, Mr. Pearson, how do you find business?

66
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:47,540
 - Very good, Henry.

67
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,140
 - You know, my father was saying--

68
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:52,060
 - Will you excuse me just a moment, Henry?

69
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,220
 - That's all right.

70
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:56,020
 - Henry, I went over to my doctor's today.

71
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:56,900
 - Is that right?

72
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:59,140
 - And I can't eat one blessed thing.

73
00:03:59,140 --> 00:03:59,980
 - Is that right?

74
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:02,260
 - And I can't remember when I went sleep last.

75
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,220
 - Hello, Henry.

76
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,300
 - Oh, hello.

77
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,660
 Well--

78
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:09,180
 - Oh, here, here's a package for you.

79
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:11,700
 Be careful when you take it, it weighs two pounds.

80
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,420
 Oh, you shouldn't have done this, Henry.

81
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,340
 Well, aren't you going to open it?

82
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:17,340
 All right.

83
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:22,300
 Who did you drop in to see on your way over, Henry?

84
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,460
 Nobody in particular.

85
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:26,540
 It wasn't Constance Marshall, was it?

86
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:29,900
 Oh, all she wanted me to do was drop in and say hello.

87
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:32,740
 Oh, she's a nice girl.

88
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:33,700
 Bobra?

89
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:34,740
 Yes, Bobra?

90
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,500
 You're wanted on the telephone.

91
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,540
 Who is it?

92
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,980
 It sounded like George Bigelow.

93
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,500
 George Bigelow?

94
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,700
 again

95
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:43,700
 all

96
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,660
 will you excuse me

97
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,540
 you mean you're going without opening it

98
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:49,780
 i'll be right

99
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:51,900
 it's a strange i didn't hear that for a ring

100
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,340
 mrs sanderson did

101
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:56,660

102
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:58,700

104
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:02,740
 what do you want to sleep think of george tell you true so don't think of

105
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,420
 them at all

106
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:05,460
 are you think of

107
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:08,100
 all you can't get me to say anything against them

108
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,580
 very honorable of you

109
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,540
 You know, I said to Barbara only the other day.

110
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:13,780
 And lady, I said, "I hope you appreciate

111
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,460
 what kind of young man Henry Orgrit really is."

112
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:18,100
 - Is that right? - Oh, mine is.

113
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,980
 - And what did she say?

114
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,140
 - I forget, Ma'am. - Oh.

115
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:24,860
 - Well, I certainly hope George doesn't call again.

116
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:26,020
 - George Fine?

117
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:27,540
 - It's very fun.

118
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:28,700
 - Glad to hear that.

119
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:31,620
 - Certainly wish I could say as much about herself.

120
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:32,780
 - Don't you think it'd feel better

121
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:34,300
 if you went up to bed grandmother?

122
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,260
 - When you're gonna open that candy.

123
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:37,260
 I'm opening it.

124
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:45,120
 Candy grandmother hmm well just to candy Henry. Oh, I didn't even know you were there

125
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,720
 Thank you. Mmm very good

126
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:52,660
 Even if they do have no shall we step out onto the front porch barber?

127
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:58,860
 No, I'm going out there and catch pneumonia right the prime your lives or a cudin barber put on a coat maybe

128
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:05,680
 Yes, Bob. I think it's George big a load. Yeah, my goodness

129
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,760
 I guess he just thinks I don't have anything else to do.

130
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,440
 Excuse me, isn't he?

131
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,440
 Uh-huh.

132
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,240
 I must be getting deaf.

133
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,040
 Henry, do you hear any following rings?

134
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,040
 No, ma'am.

135
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,040
 How are you?

136
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,040
 With I?

137
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,040
 Hmm.

138
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,040
 I don't.

139
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,040
 Whatever it is.

140
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,040
 You know, would you do something about it?

141
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,040
 What is there I can do?

142
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,040
 Oh, it's worth having it.

143
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,040
 Worth having, ain't it?

144
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:29,240
 You mean, you mean I ought to pound the daylights out of George?

145
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,200
 Oh, he's out of him or out of Barbara.

146
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,200
 How?

147
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,000
 Let me lay your hands on.

148
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 Reminds me.

149
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 I don't mean that, can't he?

150
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,300
 But if Barbara likes George, I don't see how socking him is going to help any.

151
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,360
 He'll certainly make you feel better, won't he?

152
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,840
 Even if he's older than I am?

153
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,160
 Isn't he, young man?

154
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:50,080
 I used to be as pretty as any of them in my day, and I know all the tricks of the trade.

155
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,760
 Did you used to fight?

156
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,920
 When the occasion demanded it, yes.

157
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,480
 Hey, are these all caramelles?

158
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,480
 No, ma'am.

159
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,480
 Now, let me tell you something.

160
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:03,520
 If you want to make her set up and take notice, only way to do is to make her joke.

161
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,720
 I mean, when she comes into the room, I don't pay any attention to her.

162
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,220
 I just sit and talk to you.

163
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:11,020
 Well, is that the way they do it in the movie?

164
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:13,220
 You mean I should make her think I like somebody else?

165
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,520
 No, I'm telling you.

166
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,320
 Not as a grandmother.

167
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,620
 But as one soldier to another.

168
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:20,020
 Get busy and get busy quick.

169
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:20,920
 Yes, ma'am.

170
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,820
 Yeah.

171
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,720
 One eater, half of this one.

172
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,120
 Good nut, son.

173
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,920
 My goodness.

174
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:30,120
 George Bigelow, he wants to give me his class pin.

175
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,620
 Can you imagine such a thing?

176
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:35,020
 Well, I'm late as it is.

177
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,060
 Where are you going?

178
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:36,660
 No place.

179
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:40,020
 I just told Connie when I dropped in, I'd be right back.

180
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:43,100
 Oh, I'm sorry.

181
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,820
 I didn't tell George he could come over.

182
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:46,260
 No, I just called him back.

183
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:48,100
 Well, of course.

184
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,740
 Maybe I will.

185
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,500
 If he's phone ain't wore out.

186
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,180
 What's that you're putting in the lapelia code?

187
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,180
 Oh, nothing.

188
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,540
 Just a pen of Connie.

189
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:58,500
 She asked me to wear.

190
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,060
 Where'd she get it?

191
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:03,780
 Her mother had it first. It's an old family hair loom.

192
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:06,060
 Let me see what it says.

193
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:08,460
 Vote the Democratic ticket.

194
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:12,500
 Yeah, the whole family comes from a long line of Democrats.

195
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,980
 Oh.

196
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:16,460
 I'm sorry you have to go, Henry.

197
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:17,580
 Maybe I can stay.

198
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:22,060
 I'm telling you, Henry, all right, you're making the mistake here alive.

199
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:27,260
 But, well, Grandmother, I don't think we should force him to go.

200
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:30,940
 Henry well, I guess I have to go barber. Goodbye

201
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:37,660
 Bye, I am and I suppose we see very much of you from now on will we why not? Oh?

202
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:42,460
 Oh, oh, yeah, I guess this time goes on you won't well

203
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:47,440
 Who is it you better go to George?

204
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:52,700
 She's over at somebody's house and wants you to come over is that right? Oh

205
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:55,260
 I'll answer in just a minute.

206
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:57,060
 Who is this constant marshal?

207
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:59,300
 Constance Marshall is nothing but an NTS.

208
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,660
 What's an NTS?

209
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,900
 NTS is necktie straightener.

210
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:05,500
 Every boy she meets she has to straighten right away.

211
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,140
 Charles, who is constant marshal?

212
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:11,900
 Constance Marshall's father is one of the most active Republicans in this state.

213
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:12,980
 Is that right?

214
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:13,980
 I think I'll be going.

215
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:16,580
 I know what you're going to do, Henri Otter.

216
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:18,820
 You're not going to Connie's house at all.

217
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:19,580
 But I am.

218
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:21,020
 Oh no, you weren't.

219
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:23,580
 You're really going to some other girl's house.

220
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:27,580
 I hope whoever she is you have an awful time in.

221
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:28,580
 But listen.

222
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:29,580
 No, I won't.

223
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,580
 I hate you, Henry Aldrin.

224
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:33,580
 Young man, get out of this house.

225
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:34,580
 Good Mr. Sam.

226
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:36,580
 And don't you ever die from this doorway again.

227
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:39,580
 With chocolate spilled with nuts and raisins?

228
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:40,580
 Get out of here.

229
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,580
 Yes, ma'am.

230
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:53,580
 [Music]

231
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,080
 Hello Henry.

232
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,380
 Hi, your Constance.

233
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:57,380
 Where are you going?

234
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:59,580
 No place just at the grocery store.

235
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:02,280
 Henry, all of a sudden, look at your neck time.

236
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,580
 I know it's crooked.

237
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:05,880
 I wear my tie like that purposely.

238
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,780
 Please let Constance help you.

239
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:08,680
 Not so tight.

240
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,980
 Do you want to strangle me?

241
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:11,660
 How do you do, Henry Aldrich?

242
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:13,780
 Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Sanderson?

243
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,300
 How do you do, Mrs. Sanderson?

244
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,420
 How do you do, young lady?

245
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:17,340
 Where are you going?

246
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,620
 I'm going to the doctor.

247
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:21,180
 Would you like to have me walk along partway with you?

248
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:23,140
 Oh, do you have to go now, Henry?

249
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:24,740
 Gee, I'm late as it is.

250
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,740
 Tell you what I wish you do, Henry.

251
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,660
 Say right where you are.

252
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:29,500
 Here?

253
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,340
 Yes, sir.

254
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:32,220
 Barbara, be along just a minute or so.

255
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,620
 Wish you tell her where I've gone.

256
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:35,500
 But my mother's waiting for the groceries.

257
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:38,020
 Do you want, Barbara, to walk the streets of this town

258
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:39,100
 looking for me?

259
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,300
 I used to stay right here because I'll tell you to.

260
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:44,100
 And you young lady, you stay here to see those.

261
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,500
 Oh yes, Mrs. Sander.

262
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,100
 And you tell her if I'm up for doctors,

263
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,300
 I'll be right across the street,

264
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,300
 and there's getting a bag of candy.

265
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,300
 Henry, all good, you look at your hair.

266
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,500
 Listen, Constance.

267
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:57,700
 You know, you could be one of the cutest boys I've ever known.

268
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,000
 Cute?

269
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,100
 I'm cute.

270
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,900
 Who?

271
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:04,400
 How do you think I'm cute?

272
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,400
 Oh, Henry, you've got the cutest lot of hair right up there.

273
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,600
 What's the matter with it?

274
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:12,280
 Every time I push it down it goes right up.

275
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,600
 Oh, look at it.

276
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,920
 Down, up, down, up.

277
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,080
 How do you do?

278
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,920
 Where did you come from, Barbara?

279
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,920
 No, please.

280
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,680
 Your grandmother wanted me to tell you she's gone to the doctors.

281
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,320
 I know where she is.

282
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,880
 Oh, what did she want us to wait here and tell you for?

283
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:30,200
 I should like to add Henry Aldrich.

284
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,800
 But you are certainly making us spectacles yourself out here in the street.

285
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,680
 I am?

286
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:38,160
 No self-respecting person would have his hair combed by a girl

287
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,960
 out in public. Listen Barbara, I'll have you know I'll have my hair comb wherever I want.

288
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,920
 And what George Bigelow said about you is absolutely true.

289
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:55,680
 What do you say about me? Never mind. He said you. He said I hope from time it tells you what he said.

290
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:59,360
 What do you know about that? Gee was anybody think I'd struck her?

291
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,080
 Henry, if I were you, I'd never speak to her again.

292
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,640
 I hope you don't think I'm going to speak to her again.

293
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:08,640
 Henry, would you like to come over to my house tonight?

294
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,640
 She would. I'd be glad to.

295
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,640
 I'd be glad to. I think it would do me good.

296
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:30,640
 Before Henry Aldrich comes back, I want to say that if you happen to have an active growing boy in your family,

297
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:36,080
 family, I know one thing, I know that you're kept plenty busy feeding that boy, because

298
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:40,680
 youngsters that age are always hungry, always on the lookout for something good to eat.

299
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:46,240
 Well, now here's a dessert that every boy and girl too will say is a real smoothie.

300
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,640
 The new Jello Butterscotch pudding.

301
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:52,000
 It has a swell tempting color like gold-colored taffy.

302
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,680
 It's smooth and luscious, and it just can't be beat for real flavor.

303
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,120
 That's rich and delicious as old-fashioned butterscotch candy.

304
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:03,520
 No butter scotch puddings bring you real downright homemade goodness, and best of all

305
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,320
 it's quick and easy to make.

306
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:10,640
 It takes you only a few minutes, there's no fuss or trouble, you just can't go wrong.

307
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:15,040
 Then try jello chocolate pudding with that wonderful real chocolate goodness smooth and

308
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,520
 satisfying.

309
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:20,480
 And jello vanilla pudding cream-colored and tempting with nuts or fruits folded in to

310
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,600
 make it even more delicious.

311
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:27,640
 All three new jello puddings have that homemade richness you love, so try them all.

312
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:32,640
 Here goes to tomorrow for Jello, butterscotch, chocolate, and vanilla pudding.

313
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:39,640
 [Music]

314
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:43,640
 Back at the Aldrich home we find the whole family seated at the breakfast table.

315
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:47,640
 Everyone that is except Henry.

316
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:53,640
 Henry! Henry! Henry!

317
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:56,040
 Mary, do you know whether Henry's up yet?

318
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,480
 He said he was getting up the first time he calls.

319
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,880
 Father!

320
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,880
 What is it?

321
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,180
 Father, will you please tell Mary that a G.C.

322
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:06,800
 Connie Mardle go by to flag her?

323
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,760
 Aren't you all dressed yet, Henry?

324
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,120
 Practically, Mother.

325
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:13,600
 My goodness, all Henry can think about is Constance Marshall.

326
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,240
 How is it he never sees Barbara Pearson anymore?

327
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,320
 Her grandmother won't let him near the house.

328
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,880
 What's the trouble?

329
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,600
 I don't know, except she said something

330
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,280
 about his going too far over something.

331
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,840
 And did I tell you about the picture

332
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,560
 I found under Henry's pillow?

333
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,560
 - Of whom, Barbara's grandmother?

334
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,900
 - Of Connie Marshall.

335
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,840
 And down in the corner it said,

336
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:36,600
 Constance to others, but constantly to Henry,

337
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,120
 does not make you positively ill, mother?

338
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,400
 - Please pass the salt.

339
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,000
 - This whole business is something

340
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,480
 I shall never understand.

341
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,920
 - Oh, forget it.

342
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,960
 My next week you'll be over the whole thing.

343
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,120
 - Mother!

344
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,400
 - Yes, Henry?

345
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,840
 Have you any idea where my trousers might be?

346
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,640
 I thought you were all dressed.

347
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,880
 I am, Father.

348
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,760
 All of my trousers.

349
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,240
 They seem to be missing.

350
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,920
 Where did you wear them last?

351
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,960
 I think it was when I went to the movies.

352
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:05,960
 Don't tell me you like your trousers at the movies.

353
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,200
 Where your brown trousers, dear?

354
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:11,320
 My brown trousers are mother-coddies of the light, though.

355
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,280
 She tells them what clothes to wear.

356
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,840
 The next thing you know, they'll be announcing their engagement.

357
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,640
 It may be of interest for you to know

358
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,720
 that this is not one bit funny.

359
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,360
 But Mother, I think it would be all right with Constance.

360
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,800
 How do you know?

361
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,880
 I heard her tell Henry only the other day

362
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,960
 that she believes in long engagement.

363
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,240
 Well, this would have to be a good long one

364
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,120
 because Henry still has a year and a half of high school

365
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,320
 and six years of college before he even begins

366
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,440
 to practice law.

367
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,680
 She may even talk him out of becoming a lawyer.

368
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,160
 Mary, you certainly are cheerful this morning.

369
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,440
 (phone ringing)

370
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,600
 Mother, look out through the window.

371
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,920
 - Look at what I see! - Constance Marshall.

372
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:52,040
 - Constance Marshall. - She didn't come here for breakfast now.

373
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:55,680
 - Well, I selected a very excellent name for that child.

374
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,320
 - Hello, Mary. - Hello.

375
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,880
 I wanted whether you'd like to have me walk to school with you.

376
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,800
 - Come on in, Constance. - I guess you know my father, don't you?

377
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,760
 - Ha ha ha ha. How do you do? - How do you do?

378
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:10,520
 - My goodness, Mr. Old, would you look like Henry? - I.

379
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:13,640
 - Only, of course, an awful lot older. - Yes.

380
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,480
 - Shall we start now, Constance? Has Henry left yet?

381
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,480
 Not yet. Where is he?

382
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,480
 We have no idea where he is.

383
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,480
 You mean Mr. Algaj, Henry is left home?

384
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,480
 Apparently he has.

385
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,480
 Constance Henry's upstairs.

386
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,480
 We only think he's upstairs.

387
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,480
 No one in the family has seen him.

388
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:32,480
 We have simply heard sounds that might have come from Henry.

389
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,480
 Henry! Henry!

390
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,480
 You see? What did I tell you?

391
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,480
 There's somebody calling me!

392
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,480
 There's somebody down here to see you!

393
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,480
 Who is the mother?

394
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,480
 Somebody!

395
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,480
 You mean the ring ring?

396
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,480
 Yes!

397
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,780
 I know, but it is a stinky camera.

398
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:49,780
 I stinky!

399
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:50,780
 Henry!

400
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:53,380
 I'll be down just to sort of like buy my pants!

401
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:57,780
 Henry, it's not stinky, and even if it were, I don't think you should call him that!

402
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:58,780
 I need that to line!

403
00:16:58,780 --> 00:16:59,780
 No, you're stinky!

404
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:00,780
 Henry!

405
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:03,980
 Father, come on up and help me buy my pants!

406
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:06,380
 Henry, you're just scraping the entire family!

407
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:09,980
 In fact, it might interest you to know that Constance is down here!

408
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:10,980
 Yeah?

409
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:12,980
 That was General Grant!

410
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:13,980
 Hello, Henry!

411
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:16,980
 Well do you wait where did you come from Connie?

412
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:17,980
 Home?

413
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:19,980
 Well why didn't anybody tell me I'll be right down.

414
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:21,980
 Henry have you got your trousers on?

415
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:24,980
 Oh no I'm glad you spoke about that excuse me.

416
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:26,980
 You better be starting Constance.

417
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,980
 Oh we got loads of time Mary.

418
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:30,980
 Not unless you want to be as late as Henry is.

419
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:32,980
 Goodbye mother.

420
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:33,980
 Goodbye father.

421
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:34,980
 Goodbye Mary.

422
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:36,980
 Goodbye Mr. Ogman.

423
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:37,980
 Goodbye.

424
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:40,980
 Charming young woman.

425
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:44,220
 Oh my goodness, Sam, I hope you'll get over it.

426
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:47,580
 You must remember, however, that someday somebody

427
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,620
 is going to marry that young woman.

428
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:52,700
 But it certainly isn't going to be Henry.

429
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,700
 It would be just our luck to have it be Henry.

430
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:55,940
 Wait for me, Mary.

431
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:56,780
 Wait for me.

432
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:57,700
 They've left Henry.

433
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:58,540
 Say what?

434
00:17:58,540 --> 00:17:59,380
 Without me?

435
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:00,380
 Well, of course.

436
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,460
 Well, goodbye, everybody.

437
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:03,260
 Come back here and eat your breakfast.

438
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:06,100
 What, Mother, do you want me to run right on top of a hearty meal?

439
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,980
 I want you to come back to this table.

440
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,180
 Where did you find your trousers?

441
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:11,060
 That's the strangest part of it.

442
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:12,900
 I found them on a chair in my room.

443
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,380
 - On a chair? - Yeah.

444
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:16,940
 - Henry, where did you meet this constant?

445
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:18,540
 - I was a fine young store.

446
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:20,460
 - Henry, don't you think you should swallow your food

447
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:21,700
 before you talk?

448
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:22,700
 - That's not it.

449
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:25,940
 I learned to end up in the minute, Father.

450
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:28,100
 - There, I was assigned next to her.

451
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,180
 - In what way?

452
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:30,180
 - My seat.

453
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:31,620
 - My seat in assembly.

454
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:32,460
 - Oh, I see.

455
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:33,380
 - Why were you asking?

456
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:36,660
 - I was just wondering, what does her father do?

457
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:37,500
 - In the--

458
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,660
 - He's a what?

459
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:41,740
 Dr. Merritt, he's an exterminator.

460
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:42,860
 And exterminator?

461
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:44,620
 No matter what you have, even if it's rats,

462
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:45,980
 you call him and he'll get rid of him.

463
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:47,700
 Henry, that's right, mother.

464
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:50,420
 He'll get rid of any kind of pest there is.

465
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:53,580
 He has never shown any disfavor toward his daughter.

466
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:54,700
 Aren't you like Constance?

467
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:57,700
 Henry, in the past, your father and I have always

468
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:00,380
 permitted you to know anyone you wanted to.

469
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:02,900
 But somehow we don't care for this, Kanye.

470
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:03,740
 Why not, mother?

471
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:07,300
 Well, putting it bluntly, you're much too nice, father.

472
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:12,480
 mother dump the absurd. Until she came along I didn't care how I look. Now look at

473
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,900
 it. Remember that bunch of hair that that always used to stand up? Now I keep it

474
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:20,900
 calm down. And to tell you the truth I miss that lock of hair I miss it very

475
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:25,100
 much. You don't think I look improved? Henry dear when are you coming to your

476
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:29,500
 sense? And what way mother? Well for one week now you haven't touched your homework

477
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:34,900
 you can't eat your meals. I don't need food. Whatever became a barber of pissing.

478
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,900
 Barbara Pearson.

479
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:37,900
 Oh, good.

480
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:38,900
 She wouldn't.

481
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:41,700
 Well, she was all right when I was young, mother.

482
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:44,100
 You grew old seven days ago?

483
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,500
 I certainly changed since then.

484
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:49,100
 In what way, aside from putting Vaseline on your hair?

485
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,500
 In a lot of ways, father.

486
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:54,900
 Well, just remember, son, we wouldn't have you lose your head for anything.

487
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:55,900
 Is that clear?

488
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:56,900
 Yes, father.

489
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:57,900
 Now I run on the school.

490
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:58,900
 Yes, sir.

491
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:01,900
 Only you've got the wrong idea about Constance.

492
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,900
 I'm quite sure one of us has.

493
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:06,500
 "Goodbye, so long."

494
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:10,340
 Sam Aldridge, I'm worried sick.

495
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:12,980
 "Alice, you're worrying about something that's absurd."

496
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:15,780
 "Sam, I didn't want to say anything about it before.

497
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:20,840
 I usually don't read anything that belongs to Henry, but I picked up a note, Constance

498
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:23,140
 wrote him, and Sam, she isn't his kind."

499
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:25,260
 "Why didn't you tell me there was more to it?"

500
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:27,380
 "Well, what I want to know is what we should do."

501
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:29,580
 "Give him some cash to Royal and send him to bed."

502
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,500
 "Well, that's what I thought you'd say.

503
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,420
 I know what I am going to do."

504
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:37,140
 I'm going to handle this the way the psychologist say a parent should.

505
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:41,420
 Well, if I were you, I wouldn't start fooling around with psychology at a time like this.

506
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:46,420
 But it's common sense, Sam. If we forbid it's seeing the girl, it's simply a challenge.

507
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:51,020
 So the thing for us to do is to tell him that he may see her just as much as he wants to.

508
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:52,820
 Which is what he's doing, anyhow.

509
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:54,920
 But we should invite her to dinner, Sam.

510
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,120
 And might I hear to dinner?

511
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:59,720
 Well, of course. If he sees enough of her, he'll grow tired of her.

512
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,920
 You hope he will.

513
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:06,920
 I'm sure he will. And on next Saturday night we're having her and some of these other friends here for dinner.

514
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:16,920
 [Music]

515
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,920
 Hi, Connie.

516
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,920
 Henry. Henry, do you like my dress?

517
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:23,920
 Yeah, it's very pretty. I've got to see who's at the door.

518
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:26,920
 Oh, I'll let them in. It was George Bigelow and some other girls.

519
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:27,920
 Oh.

520
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,920
 Henry, let Connie straighten your toy.

521
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:34,920
 You always yank it so tight. The other night I had to go to sleep with it on.

522
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,920
 Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Aldrin?

523
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:37,920
 How do you do, Constance?

524
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,920
 We're very glad you could come.

525
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:40,920
 How do you do?

526
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:44,920
 You'll find my family in the living room. Papa has to leave early once.

527
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:45,920
 Sorry to hear that.

528
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,920
 He's got to go on a big job for somebody.

529
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:48,920
 You don't sense so.

530
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:53,920
 This is the third time he's been there. He just nicely gets the map and they always come back.

531
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,920
 Then come along.

532
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,920
 Henry, wait and talk to Connie.

533
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,560
 You gotta go and see my guests.

534
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,920
 Are they more important than pulled it alive?

535
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,720
 No, but I ought to go in and say a lot of them.

536
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:06,920
 Henry, Henry, look at me.

537
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:10,720
 Oh, you've got the bluest eyes Connie has ever seen in her life.

538
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,720
 Yeah?

539
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,120
 Excuse me, friend Repton.

540
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:13,720
 Oh.

541
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,920
 That's something in your eye, Henry?

542
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:15,420
 Huh.

543
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:16,920
 She was, Mrs. Sanderson.

544
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:17,920
 Hello, Henry.

545
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,520
 Henry, you didn't tell me Barbara was coming.

546
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,320
 No.

547
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:23,720
 Well, I understood this party was for me.

548
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:26,520
 I'm going in the other room and tell your mother what I think of it, Henry.

549
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,020
 You know that?

550
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:30,920
 Henry, I know I shouldn't have come.

551
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,620
 Even if your mother did say I should.

552
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:33,860
 But I'm glad to have you.

553
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:35,260
 I'm glad to have both of you.

554
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:36,320
 No, I'm not staying.

555
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,220
 I just can't make sure she got here.

556
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:39,060
 Where's your mother?

557
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:39,900
 In the next room.

558
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,660
 I just slipped in, say hello.

559
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:44,300
 Whether maybe there's a little candy around.

560
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:50,140
 Well, I see Constance has been fixing your tie again.

561
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:51,640
 How can you tell?

562
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,340
 It looks so nice.

563
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:54,500
 Doesn't look like you.

564
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,980
 No.

565
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:59,580
 When I came in she was just going to straighten your eyes for you I guess.

566
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:00,380
 Wasn't she?

567
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:01,780
 Listen Barbara, please.

568
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:04,580
 Henry, would you mind very much if I went home?

569
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:06,780
 Henry, aren't you going to come in and join your guests?

570
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:08,380
 Yes Father, we're coming.

571
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:10,780
 George Bigelow says he hasn't even seen you.

572
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:11,980
 George Bigelow?

573
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:13,780
 Henry, I can't go in there.

574
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:14,580
 Why not?

575
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:15,980
 Because I can't.

576
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:17,380
 Please let me go in.

577
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:18,780
 But I want you to stay up.

578
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:21,180
 Henry, I've got to tell you.

579
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:24,180
 Those telephone calls I had from George.

580
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,380
 They weren't from Georgia, do you?

581
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:28,060
 Well, who were they from?

582
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:29,900
 Nobody.

583
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,900
 I just did it to make him jealous.

584
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,940
 Was that your grandmother's idea?

585
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:35,180
 No.

586
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:37,180
 It was mine.

587
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:38,180
 Wasn't it ridiculous?

588
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:39,460
 Robert, come in here.

589
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,980
 They got cake with every kind of icing you can think of.

590
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:42,740
 No.

591
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:44,100
 Henry, your mother wants you.

592
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:44,900
 I'll be there.

593
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,860
 She wants you now, right away.

594
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:48,300
 Of a clenchy way to suck.

595
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,860
 No.

596
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:53,340
 Now then, young lady, if you want Henry old Ridge,

597
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:55,440
 You will stay here where you can keep an eye on him.

598
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,520
 I'm not gonna stay.

599
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,640
 You want to upset me more than I already am?

600
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,480
 I can't help but I'm going home.

601
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,960
 Well, wait, no.

602
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,240
 Well, you've got to come in, dear.

603
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,380
 It wouldn't be a party without you.

604
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:06,280
 Why not?

605
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:09,920
 Or any number of reason?

606
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,360
 Well, look at my eyes.

607
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,440
 They're a sight.

608
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,480
 Here is my dear only make you prettier.

609
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,520
 I know from experience.

610
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,360
 Do you really think so?

611
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,940
 (somber music)

612
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:49,940
 I've been thinking about that party. I knew that I didn't understand psychology. I didn't say that. I said that you were taking a gamble. Just think we won't have to worry about that awful constant marshal or the idea of Henry's ever giving up law.

613
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:53,020
 giving up law or getting engaged before he leaves high school.

614
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:56,180
 - Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, usually work out for this.

615
00:24:56,180 --> 00:25:00,340
 - Mm, provided you give him a little assistance.

616
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:02,180
 By the way, have you heard Henry come in yet?

617
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:03,620
 - No, believe I have.

618
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:05,740
 - Oh, my goodness, what time is it?

619
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:10,740
 - It's by the clock on the bureau at 10 minutes to two.

620
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:12,980
 - Sam Oldridge Henry has never stayed out

621
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,380
 this late before in his life.

622
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:17,020
 - I thought you weren't going to worry anymore.

623
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:19,820
 - Oh, Henry, is that you?

624
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:21,220
 Where have you been, Henry?

625
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,020
 No place.

626
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:26,120
 I just walked home with Barbara, and then I had to wait until her grandmother went to bed.

627
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,220
 Come in here and say good night to us.

628
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:30,720
 I want to thank you for the swell party.

629
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,720
 Barbara said she had a very nice time.

630
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,520
 He'd sit down here on the edge of the bed.

631
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,720
 Henry, you're sitting right on my ankle.

632
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,820
 I'm sorry, Father.

633
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:40,320
 I didn't know it was there.

634
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,920
 Where did you think it would be?

635
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,820
 Henry, move your head over toward the light from the door.

636
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:45,620
 What for?

637
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:48,020
 Well, Henry, I could almost cry.

638
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:48,720
 Why?

639
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,820
 That old lock of hair, it's standing straight up again.

640
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:54,000
 Yeah.

641
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,960
 She lets me wear my necktie so I can breathe too.

642
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:02,440
 Mother, would you mind my asking right from the shoulder?

643
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,480
 What, dear?

644
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:08,520
 Well, would you and Father be disappointed if I didn't

645
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,720
 study six years to become a lawyer?

646
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,320
 Why not?

647
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,400
 No particular reason, Father.

648
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,200
 Just asking.

649
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,120
 Henry, old Richard, aren't thinking of getting married, are you?

650
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:23,120
 No mother, no. We think you should wait until you're at least through high school, don't you?

651
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:27,120
 Well, Alice, you certainly understand psychology.

652
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:34,120
 [music]

653
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:39,120
 Well, ladies and gentlemen, once there was a husband who was very fussy about his desserts.

654
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:43,120
 He liked puddings, but only the kind of puddings that his wife made for him.

655
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:47,080
 Well, of course, it's a lot of work to make good puddings, so this man's wife decided

656
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,760
 to play a little trick on him.

657
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:49,760
 What happened?

658
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:53,200
 Well, the wife who wrote us about this is right here in person.

659
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:58,080
 Mrs. Florence C., who lives at 25 Hillside Avenue, Washington Heights, New York City.

660
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:01,440
 Here's your letter, Mrs. C. Would you read us the rest of what you wrote, please?

661
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,240
 Certainly, Mr. Varnzel.

662
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,760
 I've decided to try a jello chocolate pudding.

663
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:11,200
 It only took me a few minutes to risk it up, and when supper time came, there it was.

664
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,600
 a big bowl full of rich creamy smooth chocolate pudding.

665
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:17,600
 Well, my husband came right back for the second helping.

666
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,640
 Said it was the most delicious pudding I had ever made.

667
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,080
 So then I told him about it,

668
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:26,760
 told him that I had used the new jello chocolate pudding.

669
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:29,440
 He had to admit it surely was a success.

670
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,240
 Every bit as delicious as the old-fashioned kind.

671
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,000
 - Well, thank you very much, Mr. C.

672
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,600
 And ladies, that is the way to make a hit

673
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,040
 with your husband too.

674
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:39,520
 For the new jello puddings have that real old-fashioned

675
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,360
 goodness.

676
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,960
 creamy, smooth, full-flavored and tempting,

677
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,480
 but they're far quicker and easier to make.

678
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:48,200
 There are three delicious yellow puddings to choose from.

679
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,760
 Rich chocolate, mellow butter scotch,

680
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,880
 and creamy, delicate vanilla.

681
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,480
 Yes, you like all three new jello puddings.

682
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:58,920
 Real old-fashioned puddings made a new-fashioned way.

683
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,280
 So try them tomorrow.

684
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,860
 (upbeat music)

685
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:08,760
 Barbara.

686
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,680
 - Yes, Henry.

687
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:12,280
 Are you sure your grandmother's going to bed?

688
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,480
 Thanks, Heaven.

689
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,480
 She has.

690
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,480
 Well, uh, do you mind my asking you something?

691
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,480
 What is it, Henry?

692
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:21,680
 What would, uh, would you like to go to a football game with me Saturday?

693
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:24,280
 Of course I would, Henry.

694
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:29,080
 If you go, Henry, I give you the money to get a seat for me.

695
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:33,680
 Well, Grandma's in again, but be sure to tune in again next week for further adventures

696
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,080
 of Henry Aldrich.

697
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:38,680
 The Aldrich family, starring as with Stone, is written by Clifford Goldsmith.

698
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:42,320
 night's special guest was Betty Fields, star of the stage in screenplay, What A Life,

699
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,280
 and she'll be back with us again next week.

700
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:47,880
