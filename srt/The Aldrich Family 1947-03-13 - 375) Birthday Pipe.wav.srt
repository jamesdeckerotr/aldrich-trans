1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
 Great nuts and great nuts plates present. Henry! Henry all great. Coming mother. The All-Great Family.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 [applause]

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 [music]

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 Young by your minute, great nuts like Star Wars by your minute,

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,800
 Sugar roasted, new and better there,

6
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,440
 Richard now in sweet monster,

7
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:27,200
 Sugar roasted, good by your minute,

8
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,400
 Great nuts, great young young by your minute,

9
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:38,000
 The Aldrich family based on characters originated by Pippert Goldsmith,

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,400
 and starring as Ruston as Henry with Jackie Calcas Homer,

11
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,400
 is brought to you by great nuts and great nuts, right?

12
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,400
 Hey, I hear they should have roasted!

13
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:51,600
 And now put the Aldrade family.

14
00:00:51,600 --> 00:01:10,080
 A teenage boy may have his ups and downs, but he's never half way between.

15
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:15,640
 Henry Aldrich wins the never walks when he can run and never smiles when he can laugh.

16
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:19,640
 And when he's late for dinner, he's good and late.

17
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,640
 The scene opens at the Aldrich dinner table.

18
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,640
 Sam, can I get you another piece of pie?

19
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,640
 Oh, thank you. What time is it now?

20
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,640
 It's a little after 6.30 here.

21
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:35,640
 Oh, yes. Seems to me it was a little after 6.30 half an hour ago.

22
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,640
 Well, now that I look again, yes, it's getting on towards 7.

23
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,640
 I'm sure, Henry, you'll be home any minute, Father.

24
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,640
 Why don't you put him right out of your mind into just your coffee and newspaper?

25
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,640
 Mary, I can think of nothing more enjoyable than being able to put Henry right out of my mind.

26
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:57,640
 Look, there, for all dear, he's only a little late, and a little late, when we've already finished dinner?

27
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,640
 Well, I'm not trying to defend him, but we did eat quickly.

28
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,640
 And my goodness, Father, Henry was much later than this the night before last, and you didn't say a thing, Mary.

29
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:09,640
 He's been late for dinner three days in a row, and he's late for breakfast every day.

30
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:10,640
 It's time I put my foot down.

31
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:13,640
 Well, the only thing is, the adults think I'm criticizing,

32
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:17,640
 but couldn't you just put your foot down gently all the time

33
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:21,640
 instead of standing it down only every once in a while and scaring us all to death?

34
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,640
 Are you insinuating that I'm not a good father?

35
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,640
 I know, dear.

36
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:28,640
 My goodness, of course you're a good father, father.

37
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,640
 Of course you are, dear.

38
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,640
 But won't you let me handle Henry this once?

39
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,640
 You've been having Henry too long as it is.

40
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,640
 Sam, are you insinuating that I'm not a good mother?

41
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:42,640
 My goodness, Father, look out the window! Here he comes!

42
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,640
 See, he's coming up the street, pulling a wagon.

43
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,640
 Yes. What time is it?

44
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,640
 It's a little after 6.30, Sam.

45
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,640
 Look at him.

46
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,640
 Ambling as long as we had all the time in the world.

47
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,640
 Well, yes, but...

48
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,640
 As he got on that wagon.

49
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,640
 It looks like pop bottles.

50
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,640
 Now what's he stopping for?

51
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,040
 He's probably tying his shoe lace.

52
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,360
 He's picking a bottle up out of the gutter.

53
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,880
 [laughter]

54
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,440
 Look at him standing there looking at it.

55
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,120
 It's all right, Sandy, he's putting it back in the gutter.

56
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,360
 Mother, do you think I should go out and tell him to hurry?

57
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,360
 You say where you are, Mary.

58
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,920
 This is very interesting.

59
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,000
 Look at that.

60
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,360
 But you're what's wrong with stopping to pet a dog.

61
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,000
 Look, isn't that thoughtful of him?

62
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 He's offering the dog a candy.

63
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 Probably it won't take it.

64
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 I dare say the dog knew enough to go home in time to get his dinner.

65
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 Mother, oh, I know dear.

66
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 Henry, come in here.

67
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 We let him eat first father before we scold him.

68
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 Oh, everybody, his dinner ready and boy, I'm starving.

69
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 I'll go and eat something up.

70
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 Alice, say here.

71
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 Boy, what a time I've been having.

72
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 Father, are you going to get us a prize?

73
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 Henry, are you going to get us a prize?

74
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 Henry, do you realize what time it is?

75
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 Why?

76
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,500
 You've been eating your meals here for a good many years now and you're aware of the fact that your mother served in a promptly at six o'clock.

77
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,300
 You mean it isn't six o'clock yet?

78
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,500
 Sam, why don't you buy him a watch?

79
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:12,000
 Henry, according to your mother, it's a little after six thirty.

80
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 It is?

81
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,100
 Well, gee whiz, I have to be someplace at half past seven.

82
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,800
 I'll have to eat dinner in a hurry.

83
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:21,100
 If you've been interested in dinner, you would have been here at six o'clock.

84
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,200
 Now please go to your room.

85
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,900
 You're not going to eat dinner in my room?

86
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,800
 [audience laughter]

87
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,900
 I mean, son, you're not going to eat dinner at all.

88
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,900
 You mean you weighed everything up?

89
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:32,900
 [laughter]

90
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:35,900
 Henry stop arguing and go up to your room.

91
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:36,900
 Sure Father.

92
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,900
 But that's perfectly alright.

93
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,900
 I'm not going anywhere.

94
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:43,900
 So, supposing I go and sit in my room...

95
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:44,900
 Good.

96
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,900
 ...until a quarter after seven.

97
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,900
 You will sit in your room until I tell you to come out.

98
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,900
 But Father, I have to be someplace and have past seven.

99
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,900
 When you were rummaging around the streets picking up bottles,

100
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:57,900
 it had occurred to you that you had to be someplace at six o'clock.

101
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,000
 Father, I was a...

102
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,200
 Now look, I told you to do something.

103
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,700
 But Father, yes Father.

104
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:06,600
 And I hope you enjoyed your dinner.

105
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:10,200
 That roast meat certainly smells good.

106
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,600
 Sam, hold it, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.

107
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,300
 Ashamed? What should I be?

108
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:19,400
 As a matter of fact, Alice, I believe I will have that piece of pie now.

109
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,200
 Yes?

110
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,100
 Well, you'll find it in the kitchen.

111
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:32,100
 [Music]

112
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:37,100
 All right, mother. The coast is clear. Good. You go on downstairs, Mary, and be on the lookout for your father.

113
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:42,100
 As soon as I get this sandwich, end the Henry. I'll come down too. All right, mother. Henry.

114
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:49,100
 Oh, Henry? Yes, mother. Alice? Oh, dear. Alice, what on earth are you doing?

115
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:52,100
 I'll just stand in here eating a sandwich there.

116
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,100
 Yeah?

117
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,100
 Would you like a bite?

118
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:58,100
 No, thank you, Alice. I just finished my dinner.

119
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,100
 Mother, what did you call me for?

120
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,100
 I didn't call you, Henry.

121
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,100
 Are you eating something, Mother?

122
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,100
 Yes, I'm...

123
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,100
 A sandwich.

124
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,100
 Is it good?

125
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,100
 Yes.

126
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:11,100
 It's delicious.

127
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,100
 Hey Henry.

128
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,100
 Come along, Alice.

129
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,100
 This is Henry's apparently room, Homer.

130
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,340
 I think we finished this dinner, Mrs. Oliver.

131
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:20,340
 You know he hasn't.

132
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,740
 The home I don't meant to think to it.

133
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:23,740
 Why not?

134
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:25,940
 Hey Henry, are you in here?

135
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:26,940
 Yeah.

136
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:27,940
 Behind.

137
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:28,940
 Behind.

138
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,940
 She, does that roast beef you had for dinner smell good?

139
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:32,500
 Boy, my one chance.

140
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:36,860
 My one big chance to earn that pipe I've been wanting at the Havens drug store.

141
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:37,860
 A pipe in here?

142
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:40,060
 Yeah, and I have to stay here in my room.

143
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:43,540
 She was, do you think I'm old enough to smoke a pipe too?

144
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:46,940
 It isn't for me, it's for my father's birthday next week.

145
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:49,940
 Oh, well I guess he's old enough.

146
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:52,940
 Gee whiz, Mr. Dehaven gave me a job to do,

147
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:55,940
 and all I have to do is have it done by nine o'clock from night,

148
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,940
 and he'll pay me the price.

149
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,940
 What's the job, Henry? Is it mixing sodas?

150
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:02,940
 Maybe I could do it for you, if it's mixing sodas.

151
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:06,940
 Point Homer, would ya? You see the small pile of overdue bills?

152
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:10,940
 All you have to do is go around and collect them all by nine o'clock.

153
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:13,940
 Oh, well I don't think I'd be any good at collecting money.

154
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:15,940
 I'm not going to get any allowance at all.

155
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:20,940
 But look, Homer, I've already collected five bills, and that's not counting Mrs. Clark,

156
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,940
 who paid me off with a wagon load of ginger ale bottles.

157
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:28,940
 I'd like to, Henry. Only my doctor says I have to take it easy.

158
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:30,940
 Okay. That's all right, Homer.

159
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,940
 I'm not going to get any allowance at all.

160
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:35,940
 But look, Homer, I've already collected five bills, and that's not counting Mrs. Clark,

161
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:38,940
 who paid me off with a wagon load of ginger ale bottles.

162
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:42,940
 I'd like to, Henry. Only my doctor says I have to take it easy.

163
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,440
 That's alright, Homer.

164
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:47,600
 Naturally, I can't force you to help me.

165
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,240
 And will you please stop swinging on my bed pose?

166
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,640
 I will hurt myself, and we have been doing this since I was a kid,

167
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,640
 and I've never fallen yet.

168
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,540
 Ouch!

169
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:59,140
 Boy, I did that on purpose.

170
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:01,740
 Henry, stop that racket!

171
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,240
 Now, look what you did, Homer.

 You watch some ice cream and saw from Mr. Dehaven last October. I don't remember that about two dollars worth

195
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:17,240
 Well, there'll be more exact exactly two dollars worth. Here's the bill. Mr. Collins. Yes, it must have slipped your mind

196
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:23,560
 The only thing is Henry. I'm a little short tonight, but look do you know mr. Dixon over 23 maple stream?

197
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:29,020
 I don't think so he owes me 250 so you going over there and collect from him and say I sent you 250

198
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:31,020
 And you just give me 50 cents.

 Oh, Zee was the only thing is I have it much time.

200

 I sort of have a friend sitting in for me at home.

201
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:41,220
 I mean, are you sure I'll be able to collect for Mr. Dixon?

00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,120
 Sure thing.

00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:45,320
 Well, here's your 50 cents, but, Vee, I sure--

 And Henry, when you get back to the drugstore,

205
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,720
 would you tell the Haven to send me up a carton of cigarettes?

206
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,320
 Sure.

207
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,920
 Would you like to pay me for them now?

 Well, he didn't know it to me.

345
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:15,180
 He owed it to another man.

346
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:21,500
 I gave him 50 cents because it was a bill from last our told me are you trying to tell me that you owed somebody 50 cents since last October

347
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:26,740
 After all the times I told you never to borrow money. No, father. I just borrowed the baby and then it fell down this grading

348
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:34,300
 What the not the baby the ten dollars? Oh boy my father just let me explain one thing to me

349
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:39,000
 Let me explain one thing to you. You're a smart right straight home and go up to your room and stay there

350
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,180
 Do you understand my father that ten dollars belongs to a man over at 23 maple store?

351
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:46,640
 Now get the ten dollars out of here, all I have to do is reach in for it.

352
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,640
 Now go on home.

353
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,640
 Yes Father, I'm going.

354
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,240
 Don't stop the talk to anybody and don't come back.

355
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,240
 Yes Father.

356
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,240
 Now then.

357
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:57,240
 If I could just get my arm.

358
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,240
 My arm.

359
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,240
 My.

360
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,240
 Henry.

361
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,240
 Henry, my arm is caught in the grading.

362
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,240
 Henry, come back.

363
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:13,240
 [Music]

364
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,240
 Mother, you mean you really do?

365
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,240
 Of course Henry, I follow you perfectly.

366
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:21,240
 Well, Jean was, how is it I can always make you understand?

367
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,240
 Father always gets me mixed up.

368
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,240
 It's very clear to me, dear.

369
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:28,240
 You've had a date since last October to mind Mr. Dixon's baby.

370
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,240
 What?

371
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:32,240
 And he said he'd give you his best pike that he found down underneath a grating.

372
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,240
 Underneath the grating, if you'd collect $10,

373
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,840
 Mr. DeHaven Oden, put some bottles.

374
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,340
 - No, Mother.

375
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:40,400
 I guess you didn't understand.

376
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,260
 - Now, Henry, didn't you say you want to get a pipe

377
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,520
 as a presses for your father?

378
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,520
 - Yeah, sure.

379
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:47,560
 Gee, if I made that clear, that's all that matters.

380
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,840
 - For father's day.

381
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,680
 - No, for father's birthday.

382
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,520
 - Oh.

383
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:56,520
 I'm in the living room, Homer, with my mother.

384
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,560
 - You have a little old employee,

385
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,280
 your father caught me in your room,

386
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,040
 and boy, it's a good thing I found you before he did.

387
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,040
 You're too late.

388
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,040
 No, I'm not.

389
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,040
 And I've got it all figured out.

390
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,040
 You can hide in my basement for the next few days.

391
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,040
 Now, what am I?

392
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,040
 He isn't going to do any such thing.

393
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,040
 If Father said he was to go straight to his roof,

394
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:16,040
 but Mother, I just have to collect six more of these bills before 9 o'clock.

395
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:20,040
 Wouldn't you consider letting me go out for only half an hour?

396
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,040
 No, dear.

397
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,040
 Your father's going around saying that I spoil you.

398
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,040
 Look, Mother.

399
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:29,040
 Do you suppose there's a way that I could collect the money and still not leave my room at all?

400
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:39,040
 [Music]

401
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:45,040
 Wait a minute. Now Mr. Olridge for the last time. If you don't stay down on your knees there's nothing I can do for you.

402
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:48,040
 How long do you think I can hold this position? My back's nearly broken.

403
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:51,040
 Well, you're going to get your arm broken if you don't hold it.

404
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:56,040
 Well, then kindly hurry up. You realize I had to walk six blocks with this grate on my arm?

405
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,800
 Yes, Mr. Allrich.

406
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,960
 But I can say I like your attitude.

407
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:03,000
 Do you realize I closed this hardware store two hours ago

408
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,840
 and I came from clear across town to help you?

409
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,200
 Yes, of course I didn't mean that.

410
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,920
 And I'm doing the very best I can.

411
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,800
 I realize that, Mr. Jackson, and I appreciate it very much.

412
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,800
 All right.

413
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,440
 Now, see if you can hold still.

414
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,880
 Very well, Mr. Allrich.

415
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,600
 If that's your attitude, you can go straight to the right sniff.

 Hello Mrs. Walker, this is Alice Olgrich.

418
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:35,600
 I just thought I'd phone and give you that chocolate cake recipe you've been wanting.

419
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:41,600
 Well, yes, it's always been a family secret, but I just decided there's no point in being selfish about it.

420
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:48,600
 Oh, and by the way, Mrs. Walker, did you know that you owe the Haven's drug store $9.13?

421
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,660
 Yes, of course you'd forgotten about it, dear.

422
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:54,400
 Supposing I sent Homer Brown over to pick it up.

423
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,800
 And then he'll be glad to give you the recipe.

 Hello.

426
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,300
 Hello, are you still there, Doris?

427
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,800
 Well, I know I'm not home.

428
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,800
 I'm sitting here in some stranger's house mining a baby.

429
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,800
 [laughter]

430
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,800
 No, dear, a baby.

431
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,200
 I know, dear, but listen.

432
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,200
 I gave a young boy ten dollars and he was going to change it.

433
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,560
 No dear, change the ten dollars.

434
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:25,200
 Oh, but dear, you don't understand.

435
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:30,600
 Dear, goodbye, dear.

436
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,080
 Excuse me, is your name right here?

437
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,600
 Yes, are you the father?

438
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,440
 Right, yes.

439
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,840
 Well, I'm certainly glad you're here.

440
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,240
 Come on in.

441
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:36,640
 Thank you.

442
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,720
 Just a minute now.

443
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,920
 If I can manage to get my bill pulled out.

444
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,800
 I notice your arm is in a sling.

445
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:42,600
 Were you in an accident?

446
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,440
 Yes.

447
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,680
 Here's your ten dollars.

448
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,240
 Thank you.

449
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,600
 I'll just get my coat up.

450
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,960
 Wait a minute. Where did you get the ten dollars?

451
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,600
 Look, I'm trying to forget. Time to take the money and let's not talk about it.

452
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:56,200
 Well, that's too clean. I'll drive into the heavens and pay that bill on my way home.

453
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,000
 Good evening.

454
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,300
 Oh, here. Wait. I'm leaving too.

455
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,200
 Oh, no. No, you can't. You're wisest in home.

00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,500
 Oh. You'll have to stay with a baby.

00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,300
 Oh.

00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:02,800
 Good evening.

00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,600
 That's right. Wait a minute. What baby?

462
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,300
 Henry, what time is it?

463
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:21,800
 It's... it's just a little after nine o'clock, mother.

464
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:25,200
 Henry, it must be an hour since you said it was only a little before nine o'clock.

465
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,900
 Jim, sure father will be home any minute.

466
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:30,400
 After all, he's only two hours late.

467
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,600
 Oh, let's see that pipe again, Henry.

468
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,300
 Here.

469
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:35,100
 Boy, isn't it a beauty?

470
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:35,900
 I'll say.

471
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:38,940
 And was Mr. D. Haven surprised when I took him all the money.

472
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:39,440
 Yeah?

473
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,580
 He said to tell you you were the best bill collector he ever had.

474
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:47,080
 Jean, mother, and to think that chocolate cake has been a family secret for generations.

475
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,020
 Henry!

476
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:48,920
 Yes, Mary?

477
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:51,020
 I have a ticket paper out here in the kitchen.

478
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:52,660
 Do you want to wrap father's pie?

479
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:55,060
 Sure, Mary. Can we do it up real fancy?

480
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:56,900
 You better step on it, Hinn.

481
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,760
 So your father doesn't see it.

482
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,460
 Oh, my, what time is it now?

483
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:01,460
 Oh, there it is.

484
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:03,660
 Oh, boy. I'm going home.

485
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:04,900
 Who's going to name Mrs. O'Lor.

486
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,400
 Are you in the living room, Alice?

487
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,000
 Sam, old Rick, where have you been?

488
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,500
 Alice, I can explain everything.

489
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,600
 Oh, my goodness, your arm. You've been in an accident.

490
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,700
 No, Alice, this wouldn't have happened if Mr. Jackson hadn't lost his temper.

491
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:18,000
 All I said was out. You'd say out, too, if I was twisting his arm off.

492
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,700
 So that's it. You've been fighting at your age.

493
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:26,300
 Listen to me, Alice. This $10 bill fell down a grading, and I got my arm caught in it trying to reach the money.

494
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:28,200
 Was Mr. Jackson trying to reach the money, too?

495
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:34,600
 No, dear. I had to lift the whole grading off with my arm still in it, and then I had to get down into the hole and get to $10.

496
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,200
 You mean Mr. Jackson pushed you in?

497
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,200
 No, no. I got in by myself.

498
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,100
 And Mr. Jackson wouldn't let you out?

499
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,500
 I was forget about Mr. Jackson.

500
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,300
 Well, my goodness, you didn't yell.

501
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:46,800
 Thank you, if that's the way you were, I don't blame him for hitting you.

502
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:49,700
 Alice, listen. Mr. Jackson did not hit me.

503
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:52,900
 Mr. Jackson didn't do a thing except fight my head off.

504
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,200
 Then why are you so late?

505
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,900
 Because I've been binding the baby.

506
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:56,700
 What baby?

507
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:57,700
 Well, you see, I went...

508
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:58,600
 Mr.

509
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:01,100
 Never mind, you wouldn't believe it anyway.

510
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:05,200
 Mother, have you got a longer piece of ribbon I could tie around this?

511
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,200
 Henry!

512
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,200
 This...

513
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,200
 Oh, she wished.

514
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,200

00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,200
 Henry, wait a minute.

00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:28,520
 Yes, so next he gets to slam the dog team, but the dogs wear out and give up.

568
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:31,520
 So then my friend gets out, he skis, hugs free dogs under each arm,

569
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:36,520
