00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,840
 [Music]

2
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:11,700
 And now the Jell-O family presents...

3
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:15,360
 Henry Henry O'Brien!

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,560
 Coming, mother!

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:22,280
 [Applause]

6
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:27,520
 Yes, it's the O'Brien family based on characters originated by Clifford Goldsmiths

7
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:32,380
 and starring Ezra Stone as Henry with Jackie Kelt as Homer.

8
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:35,220
 Brought to you by the Jell-O family.

9
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:37,220
 Yes, the Jell-O family.

10
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:42,320
 Oh, the Big Red Letter stand for the Jell-O family.

11
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,220
 Oh, the Big Red Letter stand for the Jell-O family.

12
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:47,520
 That's Jell-O.

13
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,120
 Yum, yum, yum.

14
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,120
 Jell-O puddings.

15
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,120
 Yum, yum, yum.

16
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,120
 Jell-O tack.

17
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,420
 Be oke, puddings.

18
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:54,920
 Yes, hooray.

19
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,920
 And now for the Aldrich family.

20
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:14,920
 The most exciting thing about 117 Elm Street

21
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,920
 is the fact that a typical teenage boy lives there.

22
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,920
 And when the boy is Henry Aldrich,

23
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:23,920
 he does many more things than just live there.

24
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,920
 The scene opens in the oldridge front hall. It is early morning.

25
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,920
 Well, good morning, Father Old Timer.

26
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,920
 I beg your pardon, Henry.

27
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,920
 I said good morning, Father Old Timer. Is there anything I can do for you?

28
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:36,920
 For me?

29
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:37,920
 Yes, sir.

30
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,920
 Henry, what is it you're after?

31
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,920
 I'm not after anything, Father. I'm just being cheerful.

32
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,920
 Before I've had my coffee?

33
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,920
 I was looking for my left sock under the bed this morning, see? And what do you suppose I've found?

34
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,920
 Your right sock.

35
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:57,920
 No, my New Year's resolutions. They must have fallen under there when I was wrapping my Christmas presents.

36
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,920
 And you know what was right on top of the list?

37
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,920
 Always be cheerful.

38
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,920
 Gee whiz, how did you know?

39
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,920
 I'm psychic.

40
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,920
 Sure. And right after that comes always be helpful. So is there anything I can do for you?

41
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,920
 You can let me go in and have my breakfast. I'd like to finish putting up my rose arbor this morning.

42
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,920
 Gee whiz father, why not let me do it?

43
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,920
 I prefer to do it myself, thank you. Now let's go into the dining room.

44
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:19,920
 Good morning, Sam.

45
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,920
 Good morning.

46
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,200
 - Great, aren't you?

47
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,040
 - Thank you, Alice.

48
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,520
 - Mother, is there anything you'd like me to do for you?

49
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,560
 - Yes, dear, you can drink your juice.

50
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,120
 - That's all?

51
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,480
 Well, gee, where's Mary?

52
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,520
 - In the living room.

53
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,360
 - She is?

54
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,720
 Would you excuse me while I go in

55
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,760
 and give her a cheerful good morning?

56
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,600
 - Dear, if I were you, I wouldn't.

57
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,440
 - But mother, I haven't seen good old Mary

58
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,440
 since the last night.

59
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,160
 - Sam, let's come over, Henry.

60
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,240
 - It's nothing, Alice.

61
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,240
 - Nothing.

62
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,240
 Dear, do you realize he got up this morning

63
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:50,240
 and put coal in the furnace without being told?

64
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,140
 You don't suppose he's coming down with something.

65
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,380
 Nothing that won't wear off in 24 hours.

66
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:55,480
 Mother!

67
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,780
 Mary, what did I say?

68
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:59,940
 Henry, if you don't leave me alone, I'm gonna throw a pillow at you.

69
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:00,540
 Mary!

70
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,340
 Can't I be miserable and peace?

71
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,740
 Well, she was who's stopping him.

72
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,900
 Mary, do you sit down and have your breakfast?

73
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,940
 Breakfast, Mother, the way I feel?

74
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,640
 Henry, what did you say to your sister?

75
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,860
 Another thing, Father.

76
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:13,280
 All I did was mention what a nice day it was,

77
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,980
 cheerfully, as though we weren't even brother and sister.

78
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,220
 And boys, you went all to pieces.

79
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:24,220
 Henry, it so happens Mary has had a little disagreement with Kermit, and she's very much upset.

80
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:24,720
 Aww.

81
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,220
 What sort of a disagreement, Alice?

82
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:30,220
 Well, it seems Mary waited in front of the movies the other night for more than an hour,

83
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:31,720
 and Kermit never showed up.

84
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,720
 You don't say.

85
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,720
 Now, Mary will even talk to him.

86
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,720
 Poor old Kermit.

87
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,720
 I always kind of liked him.

88
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:40,220
 Henry, he hasn't passed away.

89
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,220
 [audience laughter]

90
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:43,720
 Well, sure, Father, sure.

91
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,220
 Mother, you can tell Mary to stop worrying.

92
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:49,220
 Things are always darkest before the dawn.

93
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:51,220
 I've got an idea, excuse me.

94
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:54,220
 Henry, you're not to go near your sister.

95
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:57,220
 Sam, what are you supposed to do about Mary?

96
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:58,220
 She's just miserable.

97
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:01,220
 Misalable? I thought she went dancing with Joe Graham last night.

98
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:05,220
 Yes, dear, and that's a very good example of how heartbroken she is.

99
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,220
 Alice, that doesn't mean a thing.

100
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:08,220
 It does.

101
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:12,220
 You remember that spat? We had that Fourth of July just before we were married.

102
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:16,620
 I dated Beaches Kilroy three nights in a row just to get even.

103
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:21,420
 Sam Aldrich, you told me you just sat in your room and read Keats and Shelley.

104
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,420
 I did?

105
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:25,420
 Pass the cream, please.

106
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:29,020
 You can reach it and excuse me.

107
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,020
 Where are you going?

108
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:33,220
 To bring Mary some orange juice and try to cheer her up.

109
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:35,220
 Peaches Kilroy indeed.

110
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,220
 Mary!

111
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:38,220
 I'm just going upstairs.

112
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:40,620
 Dear, I'm glad to see you eating that roll.

113
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,820
 I'm just keeping body and sewn together.

114
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:45,920
 That's very wise and how about a soft boy of egg?

115
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,320
 On top of my waffles?

116
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,420
 Miri!

117
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,620
 I'll make you a cup of hot cocoa.

118
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:52,620
 Miri, you're lying on the phone!

119
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:53,920
 I am by who?

120
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,420
 Why, I'm not sure, but the voice sounded very familiar.

121
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:56,920
 Here.

122
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,920
 My goodness, I didn't even hear it ring!

123
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,420
 Hello!

124
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:00,420
 Hello?

125
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:01,420
 Who...

126
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:02,420
 Who is this?

127
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:03,420
 Me, Kermit.

128
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:03,920
 What?

129
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,120
 Kermit, Henry said you wanted to talk to me.

130
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,120
 Well, look!

131
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:07,620
 Oh, look!

132
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:08,620
 Henry, you're old rich!

133
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,220
 Mary, what do you hang up for?

134
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:12,620
 In the future, I'll thank you to mind your own business.

135
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:16,120
 Well, how can I marry without breaking my new year's resolution?

136
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,620
 Main Henry, where am I?

137
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:21,120
 I'm in here, Normard.

138
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,120
 Wait, can we give a scene such a terrible morning?

139
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,620
 Whose role is this?

140
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:26,120
 What?

141
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,120
 Whose role is this?

142
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,120
 Oh, you can have it.

143
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,120
 Thanks.

144
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,620
 I've never met a more unreasonable woman than Agri-Slawson.

145
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,120
 You have any butter on you?

146
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:34,620
 No.

147
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:35,120
 Oh.

148
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:39,460
 Something's happened between you and I also

149
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:45,700
 She won't well gee whiz sit down and tell me all about it

150
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:50,780
 It's nothing to tell just because she saw me having a soda with Geraldine love she flies off the handle

151
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:56,740
 Oh, and I explained that Geraldine just happened to be sitting on the next two and she didn't believe you know

152
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:59,980
 She insists she saw us drinking out of the same glass

153
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:05,860
 Were you Henry Geraldine politely asked me to see if her soda wasn't too sweet?

154
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:10,860
 Gee, Lushin' over, my folks have been trying to get me to be a gentleman.

155
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,860
 Homer, don't worry about a thing.

156
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:15,860
 Just as soon as I see who's at the door, I'm gonna start helping you out.

157
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,860
 Helping me out of what?

158
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:20,860
 The puppies from very old rich from the candy kitchen.

159
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:21,860
 No kidding.

160
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:26,860
 Well, that's certainly very thoughtful of you to deliver this just at this time.

161
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:27,860
 What's that?

162
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:28,860
 I'm thanking you.

163
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:29,860
 Oh, well.

164
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:30,860
 You're welcome.

165
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:31,860
 So long.

166
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:34,860
 So long to you too, and I hope someday somebody does as much for you.

167
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:37,260
 I'm sending Mary presents Henry.

168
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:39,660
 Homer, this is all a part of something you don't know about.

169
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:40,660
 Mary!

170
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:42,660
 Henry, please, don't come near me.

171
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,560
 But Kermit sent you a present!

172
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,560
 It looks like a box of stuffed dates!

173
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,060
 It's fine, that's wonderful!

174
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:51,060
 You can throw them in the trash can for all I care!

175
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,060
 Throw them in the trash can?

176
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:55,060
 When Homer's here?

177
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:56,060
 [Laughter]

178
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:59,060
 Here at Homer all the time, her have won.

179
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:01,260
 No thanks, I don't like stuffed dates.

180
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:03,260
 But she was your hurt Kermit's feelings.

181
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:06,640
 Why should I make myself sick so Kermit's feelings will be hurt?

182
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,740
 You'll eat them.

183
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,180
 When I feel so good?

184
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,820
 Look, Homer, how would you like to be hell?

185
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:12,820
 Well...

186
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:13,820
 Or...

187
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:16,820
 Are you gonna be just like Mary and say I'm just buddy-

188
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,380
 Kim, you let go of me!

189
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:20,780
 Boys, you're not fighting, are you?

190
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:22,260
 Fighting Mother Gee was no.

191
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:24,900
 I'm just offering Homer a helping hand.

192
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,380
 And so far he has a very nice attitude about it.

193
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,380
 Well, that's fine.

194
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:29,380
 Mary!

195
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,380
 Yes, Mother!

196
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:31,820
 I'd like to see you for a moment.

197
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:36,060
 Listen Homer, the first thing you've got to realize is it's always darkest before the

198
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:39,100
 Henry, what's the weather got to do with me and Egg?

199
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:42,660
 Mother, it's about that box of stuffed dates. I'm not interested.

200
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:45,460
 Mary, did you hang up on Kermit a while ago?

201
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:47,060
 Yes, Mother, I certainly did.

202
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:51,260
 Well, there I'm ashamed of you. He just called back and you know what he told me.

203
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:53,900
 I'm not even interested. What?

204
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:58,180
 He wasn't supposed to meet you in front of the movies at all.

205
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:02,020
 He wasn't. No, you were demeated the library under the gargoyle.

206
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:04,180
 Oh my goodness, the gargoyle, that's right.

207
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:06,180
 Mother, he'll never speak to me again.

208
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:08,980
 Yes, he will. There he's on his way up here.

209
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,580
 Now? Mother, he can't be.

210
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:11,380
 But Mary!

211
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:12,980
 Look at my hair, I'm not even dressed.

212
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:14,180
 Now Mary just calmed down.

213
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:16,580
 And the dates, Mother. What did Henry do with the dates?

214
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,780
 Fear I don't know.

215
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:20,180
 Mother, I couldn't face Kermit without his stuffed eggs.

216
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:31,180
 [music]

217
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:33,180
 Well, here we are, Homer.

218
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,180
 I don't think it'll work.

219
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,180
 Sure it will.

220
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:37,180
 Once you hand-agnes these stuffed dates,

221
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:39,180
 you'll forget all about Geraldine.

222
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:40,180
 Now, smile.

223
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:41,180
 What's for?

224
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:42,180
 She was home.

225
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:45,180
 Don't you know everyone likes a cheerful person?

226
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,180
 Smile.

227
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:48,180
 Okay, there.

228
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:49,180
 More.

229
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:51,180
 How's that?

230
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:53,500
 Forget it Homer

231
00:08:53,500 --> 00:09:00,740
 Just fix your bowtie and let's go in look can me maybe we ought to think about this for a minute about what suppose the dates don't work

232
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:05,740
 I mean whenever Agnes loses her tempo. She forgets. She's well bred look Homer

233
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:11,100
 There's only one way to face life, and that's to face it. I'd rather face life than Agnes

234
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:16,620
 Can't you at least do this can't you go in and see if she's in the good mood?

235
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:21,100
 Well, all right well, and I'll be hiding behind this book. Okay

236
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:25,940
 When you see me pull down the living room shade it means everything's okay

237
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:30,980
 Then you walk in smiling as if you were a very careful person sure

238
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:34,020
 Yeah, yeah

239
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:37,940
 Left foot what for?

240
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:42,700
 Agnesol was steps on it then pretends it was an accident. Oh my duck. I hear someone

241
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:46,220
 Well, gee whiz hi Ag

00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,220
 Hi!

243
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,220
 Hi!

244
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,220
 What do you want?

245
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:50,220
 Just playing a friendly call?

246
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,220
 Yeah?

247
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,220
 Hi!

248
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:53,220
 Is anyone with you?

249
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,220
 What anyone?

250
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:57,220
 You know what anyone, you know what anyone is with you?

251
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:59,220
 Well, do you want to see anyone?

252
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:01,220
 No, come on in.

253
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:03,220
 Well, what's up, kid?

254
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,220
 Agnes.

255
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:07,220
 Agnes, have you ever looked at it this way?

256
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:10,220
 Things are always darkest before the dawn.

257
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:11,220
 What?

258
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:14,220
 I mean, on the outside it may look bad, but from the inside,

259
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:16,420
 Dizzy was from the inside, everything looks different.

260
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:18,060
 The inside of what?

261
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,060
 Homer.

262
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,140
 Homer!

263
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:22,260
 Don't ever mention that chazanovia.

264
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:22,700
 What?

265
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:25,100
 Chazanovia chazanovia!

266
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,780
 Imagine making sodas out of the same glass.

267
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:30,980
 Doesn't he know that's a perfect way to get germs?

268
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:33,420
 Anna's Geraldine doesn't mean a thing to Homer.

269
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:34,780
 Sure, sure.

270
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:39,020
 Honest, if she did, wouldn't he have sent her this box of candy?

271
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:40,300
 Instead of you?

272
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:40,860
 Candy?

273
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:41,780
 Sure.

274
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:42,500
 For me?

275
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,420
 Sure.

276
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:46,780
 Candy! Oh, boy!

277
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:48,180
 You mean you're pleased?

278
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:51,620
 Why, how can I ever get me candy in my life? Let me open it.

279
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,520
 Go ahead, Agnes.

280
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,820
 Oh, and isn't the sun in your eyes?

281
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:56,820
 No!

282
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,820
 Honey, now let me pull down this shade.

283
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,820
 I'll be darned!

284
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,020
 Is there something wrong?

285
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:04,020
 Dates! These are stuffed dates!

286
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:05,020
 Well, sure.

287
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:07,020
 Whoever said stuffed dates were candy.

288
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:08,020
 Where did he get them?

289
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:10,020
 At a clearance sale?

290
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:12,020
 Well, I'll answer the door.

291
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:13,020
 Never mind, I'm practically there.

292
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:14,780
 It's probably the wrong number.

293
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:15,980
 I mean the wrong house.

294
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:18,620
 Henry, that must be the new kid that moved in next door.

295
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:19,120
 No.

296
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,120
 He saw me chaining myself on the back porch

297
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,620
 and I've been expecting him to drop in all day.

298
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:25,620
 Agnes, I'm sure that isn't--

299
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,620
 Henry, step aside.

300
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:27,620
 Oh, she's pregnant.

301
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:31,020
 Agnes, you realize you stepped on my toe?

302
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,420
 Well, it's about time.

303
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:34,420
 Father, you mean it's just you?

304
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:35,420
 I'm afraid it is.

305
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:36,020
 Oh, boy.

306
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,220
 I forgot my key.

307
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:39,220
 Agnes, let's put it up to your father

308
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:41,820
 and see if you're not being unreasonable about Homer.

309
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,580
 Henry, I've had a very hard day.

310
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:44,240
 You have?

311
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:44,740
 Yes.

312
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:49,580
 Well, Mr. Lawson, just remember, things are always darkest before the dawn.

313
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:50,080
 What?

314
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:50,980
 Have a stuffed date?

315
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:51,780
 No, thanks.

316
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:53,260
 I don't want to spoil my dinner.

317
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,460
 I don't blame you.

318
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:57,180
 Although Mrs. Lawson's very fond of dates.

319
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:58,220
 Let me have them, Henry.

320
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:59,580
 Sure, Mr. Lawson.

321
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:02,980
 And would you tell her Homer sent them over for the entire family

322
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,220
 to enjoy?

323
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:05,420
 Including Agnes.

 [MUSIC PLAYING]

325
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:14,420
 Mother, did you call Charlie Clark?

326
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:15,420
 Yes.

327
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:16,420
 And Willie Marshall?

328
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:17,420
 Yes, dear.

329
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:18,420
 Goodness Henry must be somewhere.

330
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:21,420
 I suppose I start calling the girls Henry no.

331
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,420
 Mother, that'll take all day and Kermit's do any minute.

332
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:25,420
 Henry, is that you?

333
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:27,420
 No, Mary, it's your father.

334
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:31,420
 I've been to every candy shop in town and there isn't another box of stuffed dates to be bought.

335
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:32,420
 Mother?

336
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:35,420
 The box the candy kitchen sold Kermit was the last one they had.

337
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:36,420
 Oh dear.

338
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:39,020
 They seem quite relieved and sold it.

339
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,620
 What am I going to do?

340
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:42,420
 An airy thing's not that bad.

341
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:45,420
 I love that you don't understand what those stuff dates mean.

342
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:48,420
 The very first time Permit took me out we ate some.

343
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:50,420
 Can't you see the sentiment that's attached?

344
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:53,420
 In that case, there's just one thing we can do.

345
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:55,420
 What? Make some stuff dates of our own.

346
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:58,420
 An airy opened the cupboard and handed me that box of dried prunes.

347
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,420
 Prunes?

348
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:00,420
 Prunes?

349
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:03,420
 When they're stuffed and have sugar on them, Permit will never know the difference.

350
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:04,260
 - What is he?

351
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:06,020
 - He's here, come here, I'll die.

352
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:07,460
 - Don't worry, control yourself.

353
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:08,660
 Sam, let him in.

354
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:09,500
 - I?

355
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,740
 - Yes, dear, and keep him occupied

356
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,500
 until we've got the prunes all stuck.

357
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,460
 - What Alice, my rose arbor.

358
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,620
 - Sam, what's more important?

359
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:17,300
 Your arbor, your daughter?

360
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:20,020
 - All right, Alice, I'll keep him occupied, but hurry.

361
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:21,600
 - Tell him she's dressing.

362
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,860
 Now let me see what can be used for stuffing.

363
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:24,700
 - Mother.

364
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,100
 - Oh, I know peanut butter.

365
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:28,300
 - Mother, I beg of you, don't embarrass me.

366
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,860
 - Mary, calm down and start stuffing.

367
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:41,860
 [Music]

368
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:45,860
 Agnes, won't you be reasonable and say you'll forgive Homer?

369
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:46,860
 You want a direct answer?

370
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:47,860
 Yeah.

371
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:48,860
 No.

372
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:54,860
 Okay Agnes, okay. But just remember, you're taking full responsibility for whatever happens to poor old Homer.

373
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,860
 What's going to happen to him?

374
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:57,860
 Who knows?

375
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:00,420
 JP's in pretty soon, he won't be able to sleep.

376
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:00,920
 Yeah?

377
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:01,860
 Or eat.

378
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:02,860
 Who, Hollner?

379
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:04,020
 Sure.

380
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:06,020
 They'll start going down in his studies.

381
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:07,080
 Further down?

382
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,820
 And it'll all be your fault.

383
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,020
 Gee.

384
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:12,180
 Gee, the poor kid.

385
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,980
 Why am I a heel?

386
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:15,180
 You are.

387
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,380
 You know that sun shining right in again.

388
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:19,380
 Maybe I ought to pull this other shade down.

389
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:20,580
 What for?

390
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:21,580
 Whoops.

391
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:22,940
 [CLAPPING]

392
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:24,820
 No reason.

393
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,300
 Did I just hear the doorbell ring?

394
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,140
 No.

395
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:29,260
 Maybe I want to pull down the shades in the hall.

396
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:31,520
 Wait, Henry, enough's enough.

397
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,520
 I thought you were our friend of Homer.

398
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,640
 Agnes, what do you mean?

399
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,560
 That's okay, kid. That's okay.

400
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,520
 But just let's get one thing straight.

401
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,520
 You can pull those shades down all you like,

402
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,760
 but it won't do you a bit of good.

403
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,800
 Well, Agnes, you don't think I'm--

404
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,720
 So pull 'em up, Henry.

405
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,720
 Pull 'em up.

406
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,160
 [LAUGHTER]

407
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,200
 But what Agnes--

408
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,840
 Oh, my God.

409
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,360
 If you will pull 'em up, I will.

410
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,400
 Oh, boy.

411
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,800
 No wonder you pulled down all the shades.

412
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,240
 Is that your old being loved out there?

413
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,400
 Look at her falling all over Homer!

414
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,600
 But Agnes, why don't I lay my hands on that cazenovial?

415
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,680
 She's just tying his bow tie!

416
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,680
 With her head so close together?

417
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,480
 I think.

418
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,680
 Henry!

419
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,880
 Yes Mrs. Lawson?

420
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,560
 You've missed him, every once and a once on the phone!

421
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,520
 And thanks Mrs. Lawson, Agnes don't do anything rash until I get back.

422
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:18,000
 Look, how'd I look? How'd I know she's standing his head?

423
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,920
 But he's doing it just for you!

424
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:20,560
 Hello?

425
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,800
 Henry, I've been calling all over town for you.

426
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,280
 We're our comments, dates! He's here already!

427
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,880
 Kermit? You mean you've made up?

428
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,940
 Oh Henry, stop asking foolish questions.

429
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:32,500
 Mother and I have been working for a half an hour and we've only stopped three prunes

430
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,380
 and we can't get the wrinkles out of those!

431
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:37,100
 Mary, what are you talking about?

432
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,920
 Henry, where are my dates?

433
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:39,760
 They're here!

434
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,120
 We'll bring them right home!

435
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,960
 Sure, Mary. They're not doing Homer any good anyway.

436
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:44,600
 Goodbye!

437
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,240
 And hurry!

438
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:48,500
 Listen, Henry, all which where are you?

439
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,680
 In here, Homer!

440
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,080
 Why are you trying to fix her up or you are?

441
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,740
 Homer, what happened to you?

442
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:59,600
 What I'd like to know I noticed the shade was down so I started to come in and you know what Agnes did to me

443
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,000
 What hit me with a bag of water from our bedroom window

444
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:08,900
 Don't worry. I'll straighten you and Agnes out just as soon as I take care of Mary. Mrs. Lawson

445
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:12,760
 Where is it raining out in a way?

446
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:18,720
 Mrs. Lawson about that box of stuff. Yes, I certainly want to thank you boys for bringing those

447
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,820
 Well, Mrs. Lawson. It's been years since I've baked date bread. Yeah

448
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:26,140
 Daybreak yes, I just put it in the oven Henry. What's wrong?

449
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:31,520
 Mrs. Lawson now why don't you both stop by later and I'll give you a slice from Mrs. Lawson

450
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:35,260
 boy

451
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:49,620
 Big red letter stand for the jello family oh the big red letter stand for the jello family

452
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:50,900

 message.

468
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:01,720
 I'm now getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldrich.

469
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:07,240
 Henry arose this morning with a deep resolve to be helpful to his fellow humans, including

470
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,240
 Homer.

471
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:15,240
 Through his earnest efforts, the stuff dates which Mary received as a gift have now wound up in Mrs. Lawson's date bread.

472
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:20,240
 The scene opens on the Lawson's back porch. It is later the same afternoon.

473
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,240
 Quiet, Henry.

474
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:24,240
 Homer, are you sure there's no one in the Lawson's kitchen?

475
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:29,240
 Positive. I look through the window. Now, easy while I try the door knob.

476
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:35,240
 Homer, I'm pretty sure what we're doing is against the law.

477
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,240
 Aren't they your date?

478
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:40,240
 Sure, but they're in Mrs. Lawson's date, Brad.

479
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,240
 That's just a technicality.

480
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,240
 Besides, you have to hit me with a bag of water.

481
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,240
 Agnes forfeit it all right to them.

482
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,240
 Look out.

483
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,240
 What are you doing?

484
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,240
 I think I smell something in the oven.

485
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,240
 Ow!

486
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,240
 Oh, tumor!

487
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,240
 Boy, is that hot? Is that hot?

488
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,240
 Tumor, look!

489
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,240
 There it is, in that pan!

490
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,240
 Get it out!

491
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,240
 I am!

492
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,240
 Tum-ouch!

493
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,240
 Here's a paper bag, put it in.

494
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,240
 Ouch! Ouch!

495
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,240
 Ouch!

496
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,240
 You got it?

497
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,240
 Sure

498
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:11,240
 Boy we're close the oven door

499
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:18,120
 There I didn't realize you boys were still here

500
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:22,400
 Yeah, goodbye missus loss and come on. Oh, oh my dear

501
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:30,980
 Yes, missus lost. I hope you've forgiven Agnes for throwing that water. She's very impulsive. Yes, ma'am. I found that out

502
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,000
 Lucille!

503
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,500
 I'm in the kitchen, Frank!

504
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:39,800
 Lucille? This is the most delicious date, Greg. I've ever eaten.

505
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,800
 You tasted it?

506
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:44,700
 It looks so delicious sitting there on the dining room table. I just couldn't resist it.

507
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,600
 Thank you, Deb. Please don't take any more.

508
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:50,700
 I have a wonderful salmon loaf in the oven for dinner and you'll have to drink it.

509
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:07,140
 Won't, you know, won't you have another piece of fruit?

510
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:09,500
 - Crime it. - Uh huh.

511
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,700
 - Fruit? - Oh, no, no, thank you, Mr. Aldrich.

512
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:16,700
 I've already had two pairs, an apple, and a sizable bunch of grapes.

513
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,780
 - And a banana. - That's right.

514
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:21,300
 - I lost track, I guess. - Yes.

515
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,060
 Yes.

516
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:27,740
 - Did you suppose Mary'll be finished dressing soon? - Oh, pretty soon.

517
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:31,660
 That's what being married is. - But I'm not married.

518
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:34,300
 Oh, of course, what I meant was, well that is...

519
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:38,140
 We've been having an awful lot of rain, don't you think?

520
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:39,340
 Yes, quite a bit!

521
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:40,580
 Yes.

522
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:44,220
 You, uh...

523
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:47,980
 You might even call it unusually rainy.

524
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,900
 I guess you could.

525
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,980
 Good for the farmers though.

526
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:52,940
 Now that's true.

527
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:57,980
 But you take resort owners, I wouldn't say it was too good for them.

528
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:59,420
 No, no.

529
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,060
 But it's good for taxi drivers.

530
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:02,560
 Yes.

531
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:05,660

 Henry, you'll just have to go in and tell Kermit

00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:33,380
