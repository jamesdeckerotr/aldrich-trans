00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,160
 The Aldrich family based on characters originated by Clifford Goldsmith and starring Ezra Stone

2
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:11,760
 as Henry with Jackie Kalk as Homer.

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:15,360
 Henry! Henry Aldrich!

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,360
 Coming, mother!

5
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:44,360
 [Music]

6
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:50,880
 Each election year we hear a lot of talk about favorite sons, but Senator Bill USA claims

7
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,600
 one who has nothing to do with politics.

8
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,320
 Mr. and Mrs. Aldrich's boy Henry.

9
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:01,240
 And because he is just a real American boy, well that makes Henry Aldrich everybody's

10
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,920
 favorite son.

11
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:09,240
 Our scene tonight opens in the Aldrich living room where we find Henry and his sister Mary.

12
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:14,080
 Mary, Mary, what is it Henry?

13
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,280
 Have you seen my new wrist watch any place your wrist watch? Where'd you leave it?

14
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:23,480
 I didn't leave it anyplace. I just can't find it. Mary you hadn't finished what you were doing in the kitchen

15
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:26,580
 Oh, I'll go right out mother and Henry I want you to go upstairs and get washed

16
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:32,860
 Yes, mother just as soon as I finished looking for something wash especially well there and Harriet's gonna be here for dinner

17
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:35,620
 She is and you know how she is about everything like that

18
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:40,340
 May I ask what you're upsetting all the cushions on the sofa floor? Oh nothing

19
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:43,580
 I just happened to be looking for something.

20
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:47,340
 I certainly hope you wrote your Aunt Harriet and thank her for the lovely wristwatch, she

21
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,340
 sent you.

22
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:49,340
 Yes, Mother.

23
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:51,980
 I wrote her the minute I heard she was coming.

24
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:56,460
 Oh, you didn't find anything out of the ordinary when you swept under the sofa, did you?

25
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,220
 What would you call out of the ordinary?

26
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,220
 Nothing.

27
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:01,020
 Just dust or something.

28
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,860
 Mother, what time shall I put the potatoes on?

29
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,460
 Oh, Henry, what time is it?

30
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:12,060
 It's exactly about, I should say it's a time of 26 minutes after six.

31
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,260
 Oh Father, am I glad to see you.

32
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:16,160
 Put the potatoes on right away Mary.

33
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,960
 Henry, I hope you're going to wash before Aunt Harriet gets here.

34
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:24,160
 Yes Father, have you seen anything lying around that's sort of round and shiny?

35
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,460
 Such as what?

36
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:28,460
 Well, if you saw it you couldn't help but notice it.

37
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:32,960
 Father, mother wants to know whether you remember to bring that picture Aunt Harriet gave us down from the attic.

38
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,660
 Which one?

39
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,260
 The Colosseum in ruins.

40
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,300
 I'll go up and get it.

41
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,260
 Oh, and Henry, Mother says to the dinner,

42
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:39,940
 "Yorta, sit down and Harry, it's right."

43
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:40,980
 On her right?

44
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:42,700
 Where she can see my left wrist?

45
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,260
 Henry, always, do you mean to say

46
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:46,340
 you lost that beautiful watch she sent you?

47
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:48,380
 No, Mary, I'm sure I can find it.

48
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:50,300
 Oh, my goodness, if you can't.

49
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,260
 You know how to press down,

50
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:53,100
 Harry, it gets over a thing like that.

51
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,580
 That isn't the half of her.

52
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:56,380
 She said if I'd take good care of it,

53
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:58,140
 maybe she'd give me a new bicycle.

54
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,980
 Henry, haven't you washed yet?

55
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,260
 Yes, Mother.

56
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:04,620
 Mary, if anyone asks where I am, tell them I'll be right back.

57
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:05,460
 Where are you going?

58
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:06,620
 I just happened to remember.

59
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:09,180
 I left my watch across the street at Nancy Adams's.

60
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,620
 I'll be right back, Mary.

61
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:13,200
 (upbeat music)

62
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:23,740
 Can't you help me look for my watch, Herbert?

63
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,340
 Are you sure you left it here?

64
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:26,180
 I must.

65
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:28,180
 I've just been over at Nancy Adams's

66
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,620
 and it isn't there any place.

67
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:31,020
 Well, Henry, I don't see how you could

68
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:33,100
 lose a watch on my front lawn.

69
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,680
 This is where I remember wearing it last.

70
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,440
 Herbert, let me see the watch you have on.

71
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,880
 Now listen, Henry, this isn't yours.

72
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,320
 It's exactly like mine, Herbert.

73
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,320
 It's the same, right.

74
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,360
 But is your strap worn as much as this?

75
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,360
 No.

76
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,760
 Was the second hand gone?

77
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,360
 No, but could I borrow that watch just for this evening?

78
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,360
 No, Henry.

79
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,320
 You don't know how to take care of a watch.

80
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:57,360
 I've never ruined the strap or busted my second hand, have I?

81
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,840
 No, but you've lost the whole watch, haven't you?

82
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:06,220
 If my Aunt Harry at finds I've misplaced it, she'll get depressed and refused to give me a bicycle.

83
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:10,580
 Henry, you're the last person in the world, my folks who want me to loan my watch to.

84
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:12,500
 What makes them feel that way about me?

85
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,740
 They don't even think you're a very good influence for me.

86
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,020
 Alright.

87
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,140
 Listen.

88
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:23,900
 Would you let me wear your watch if I give you all my allowance for the week of October 15th?

89
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,900
 Why would I have to wipe that wall?

90
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,460
 I owe everything until then.

91
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:28,940
 I wouldn't be interested.

92
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:33,380
 You wouldn't be interested. Well, would you consider two weeks allowance beginning October 15?

93
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:33,880
 No.

94
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:37,480
 But I wouldn't be asking you to help me if it didn't mean a lot.

95
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,600
 Henry, my folks will raise the dues.

96
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:45,080
 I'm not asking you to give me your watch tomorrow. I'll bring it back as safe as though I'd never taken it.

97
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:48,360
 But supposing my folks ask me what time it is.

98
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,360
 All right, give me a call and I'll be glad to tell you what time it is.

99
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,000
 Would you give me three weeks allowance?

100
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,840
 Three?

101
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,960
 Sure.

102
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,140
 Come on over by this, please, so my mother doesn't see it.

103
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:05,440
 Herbert, if there's ever anything I can do for you of any nature whatsoever, just name it.

104
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,540
 Here, Henry's the watch. Thanks, Herbert.

105
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:10,240
 Boy, if I got a run, it's a good thing we're eating late tonight.

106
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,040
 - They'll be careful. - Herbert?

107
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,840
 Uh, what is it, mother?

108
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,640
 You have the correct time.

109
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:19,640
 - Why, uh... - It's exactly 12 minutes to heaven, Mrs. Thompson.

110
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,240
 Herbert, could you come here a minute, please?

111
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,440
 Don't you think I got to put the lawnmower away first?

112
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,940
 Will you please come here?

113
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:29,940
 Sure. Has something going wrong, Mother?

114
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,940
 May I see your watch, please?

115
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,440
 My watch?

116
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,940
 You didn't buy any chance. Give it to Henry, did you?

117
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:36,940
 To Henry?

118
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:38,940
 It was that you gave him.

119
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:41,940
 I didn't give him anything. I loaned him my watch.

120
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:47,440
 But, Mother, he's going to give me his allowance for the last two weeks in October and the first week in November.

121
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,940
 Herbert, you realize how much of Father paid for that watch?

122
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:53,940
 Put the money Henry's paying me as it was doing the investment.

123
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:57,440
 I want you to march over to Henry's house and get that watch this minute.

124
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,240
 Right now.

125
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,240
 At once.

126
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,740
 But mother, I don't think I should.

127
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:02,240
 Have it.

128
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,740
 Do you want me to tell your father?

129
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,240
 Okay, I'll go.

130
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,640
 And if you dare to come home without your watch,

131
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:10,540
 you will go without your allowance for one entire month.

132
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:23,540
 [Music]

133
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:24,940
 Sam, ask Harriet.

134
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:26,540
 But then she won't have another piece of steak.

135
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:28,040
 More steak, Harriet?

136
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,540
 No, thank you.

137
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:32,040
 How many nights a week can you people afford steak?

138
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,040
 Well, we're really having this for you.

139
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,540
 You needn't afford it for me.

140
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:36,540
 Where's Henry?

141
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:38,540
 He ought to be done any minute, Anne Harriet.

142
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:40,040
 I heard him run upstairs a little while ago.

143
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,600
 Father never let us be late when we were children.

144
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,440
 Henry! Henry, all rich!

145
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,840
 Yes, Father!

146
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,840
 Do you realize we're practically through with dinner?

147
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,040
 I'll be right there!

148
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:55,440
 Sam, as long as you have so much state, give me that piece next to the bone.

149
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,840
 All right, sir.

150
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:02,240
 What on earth is that? Henry!

151
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,040
 I'm awfully sorry, I'm late. Hello, Aunt Harry.

152
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,040
 How do you do?

153
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,040
 Henry, didn't you know what time it was?

154
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,760
 Oh, oh yes, father. It's ten minutes after seven.

155
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,300
 And me, where did you get that watch?

156
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,540
 Why, Mary, why?

157
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:16,180
 Oh, nothing. Oh, when you have some bread and Harry.

158
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:20,920
 No, thank you. And Harry, I want to tell you how very much I appreciate the watch.

159
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,220
 Why didn't you write me about it?

160
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:24,420
 I did, and Harry. Didn't you get the letter?

161
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:26,820
 I did not. Let me see the watch. Here it is.

162
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,980
 Who could that be at the door?

163
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:29,820
 I see who it is.

164
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:30,860
 Don't you want me to, mother?

165
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:33,020
 No, thank you, Mary. I'm already on the way.

166
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,620
 So you like to watch?

167
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:37,020
 And Harry and I wouldn't work with it for anything.

168
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:39,020
 Hello there Herbert.

169
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:42,020
 How do you do Mrs. Orridge? Could I speak to Henry a minute?

170
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:43,020
 I'm sorry but Henry's at dinner.

171
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,020
 But I have to see him.

172
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:45,020
 We're having guests, Herbert.

173
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:47,020
 Well could I go into the dining room and speak to him?

174
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:50,020
 No, you better go back home and see him tomorrow morning.

175
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:52,020
 Oh no, I'll wait here until he's through.

176
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:54,020
 But Henry will be busy all evening.

177
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:57,020
 But Mrs. Orridge, Herbert, I'm quite sure anything you have to say can wait until morning.

178
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:58,020
 Good idea.

179
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,020
 Okay Mrs. Orridge, the only thing...

180
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:04,020
 My goodness Herbert Thompson never comes over to this house except when we're eating.

181
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:05,020
 Oh that's him?

182
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:06,020
 Herbert.

183
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,820
 Oh, Herbert, Herbert Thompson?

184
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:08,380
 Yes.

185
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:10,120
 What's the matter with him?

186
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,620
 Nothing.

187
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:12,940
 Henry, are you all through?

188
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,500
 Yes, Father, I've caught up with you.

189
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,860
 Well, I'll clear the table then.

190
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:17,020
 Mary, you helped with dinner.

191
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:19,140
 I'm sure Henry would be glad to clear the table.

192
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:19,940
 Oh, yes, Mother.

193
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:20,980
 Sure.

194
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,900
 Should we keep our forks for the pie?

195
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:23,420
 No, dear.

196
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,740
 We're going to have clean ones.

197
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:25,700
 Oh, OK.

198
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,700
 Henry, don't break anything going through that door.

199
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:28,200
 I won't.

200
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,580
 Now, put everything on the big kitchen table.

201
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:32,260
 Yes, Mother.

202
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,260
 Here for, buddy.

203
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,260
 Here you go.

204
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,260
 Here you go.

205
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:37,260
 Hey Henry, she was, who's that?

206
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:38,260
 It's me.

207
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,260
 Herbert, where are you?

208
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,260
 You're here behind the refrigerator.

209
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:43,260
 Oh, Henry, I've got to have my wife.

210
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:44,260
 You're gonna listen, Herbert, aren't I?

211
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:46,260
 Paying you for the use of it?

212
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:49,260
 But if I don't get it, I'll lose a month's of a while.

213
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,260
 Herbert, you can't back out on a bargain.

214
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:53,260
 But you shouldn't have taught me anything.

215
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:55,260
 Listen, Herbert, have sense, can't you see?

216
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,260
 I'm... I'm...

217
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,260
 Do I or don't I get my watch?

218
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:59,260
 Let me have it just until the end of the meal.

219
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:00,260
 No.

220
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:01,260
 Henry?

221
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:02,260
 Yes, Mother!

222
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:04,260
 When are you coming back to the rest of these dishes?

223
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,260
 Right away mother!

224
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:06,260
 Henry, wait!

225
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:07,260
 Get out Herbert, I gotta go back.

226
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:10,460
 Well I'm gonna wait right here Henry until I get that one.

227
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:11,460
 No Herbert.

228
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:12,460
 Henry!

229
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:16,260
 I'm just putting the dishes down carefully mother.

230
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,260
 Here I come.

231
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:19,500
 Was there something you wanted?

232
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,260
 I'll take the rest of the dishes out.

233
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,260
 Oh wait, mother I'll take it off.

234
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,260
 I'll take everything in one load.

235
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:25,260
 Henry, look out.

236
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,760
 I haven't spold a thing.

237
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,860
 Please sit down while I take these things out.

238
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,660
 But mother, why not at least let Mary?

239
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,260
 She's good at a thing like that.

240
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:34,460
 Mary's done more than her share.

241
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:36,260
 And I think I'll go up and lie down.

242
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:37,660
 What's the matter with you?

243
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:38,460
 I have a fever.

244
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:40,960
 You're not to go to bed until the dishes are done.

245
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,260
 I'll be right back to the pie, Harriet.

246
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:47,060
 Henry, must you drink an entire glass of water in one gulp?

247
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:49,860
 No, no, don't you think?

248
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,860
 Henry, what are you doing?

249
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:53,460
 I'm dying.

250
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,660
 Here, you're looking to slap you on the back.

251
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:59,560
 I'm all right, Anne, Harriet.

252
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,260
 Do you think I found in the kitchen?

253
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,860
 Listen mother, let me explain.

254
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:06,060
 Explain, I let the burner on under a brand new pan.

255
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:07,460
 You let the burner on under a pan?

256
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:08,460
 I did.

257
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:10,060
 Here Harriet, the piece of pie for you.

258
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:12,860
 I could need a piece that big unless there's some cheese to go with it.

259
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:14,260
 I have the cheese right here.

260
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:15,660
 Where are you going now, mother?

261
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,060
 Back to get the rest of the pie.

262
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:17,860
 I don't want any.

263
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,660
 But Henry, the rest of us might.

264
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,660
 Oh, oh sure, of course.

265
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,660
 Henry, you still need a new bicycle?

266
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:25,260
 Well, I could certainly use one.

267
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,260
 Mary, it is mother.

268
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:28,460
 How many pieces of pie did you cut?

269
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:29,060
 Pie?

270
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:33,700
 Well, I brought in two, and when I just went back out, there were only two left.

271
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:34,700
 There's one missing?

272
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,340
 There is.

273
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:38,140
 Well, I guess Mary only cut four.

274
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:40,140
 But I'm sure I cut five.

275
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,260
 Well, don't go back, mother.

276
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:42,300
 I can't eat a thing.

277
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,660
 The best pie I ever ate.

278
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:46,500
 [SIREN WAILING]

279
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,660
 Well, what could that be?

280
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:52,300
 That whistle?

281
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,700
 Yes.

282
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:56,500
 Oh, I imagine it's just one of the fellows outside or something.

283
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,580
 Sounded as though it would be right here in this house.

284
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:00,380
 I think it was in the cellar.

285
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:01,820
 From the cellar, Mary?

286
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,540
 That's ridiculous.

287
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:07,820
 She was, what is there in the cellar that would whisper?

288
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,380
 We have some sold in, Harriet?

289
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:10,180
 On my pie?

290
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:12,060
 Well, some people I get in.

291
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:14,620
 Henry, the doctor says that Harriet must never touch sold.

292
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:15,260
 Well, I'm not kidding.

293
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:16,540
 She certainly doesn't want any.

294
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:21,500
 Isn't that strange?

295
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,620
 Santa, is the hot water heater down the basement all right?

296
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:25,300
 Perhaps I'd better go down and see.

297
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,220
 You sit still, father, and finish your pie.

298
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,380
 I don't care for any more.

299
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,380
 I'm halfway out to the kitchen already.

300
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:32,380
 Just turn the path off.

301
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:33,380
 Yes, Father.

302
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:37,380
 Hey, Herbert, you here in the kitchen?

303
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:43,380
 Herbert, you down here in the basement?

304
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:45,380
 Yes, and I want my watch.

305
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:47,380
 Oh my gosh, it's so dark down here.

306
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:48,380
 Where are you?

307
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:51,380
 In the cold, but listen, Herbert, do you want to get me into serious trouble?

308
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:53,380
 You want me to go up until you're in, Harriet?

309
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,380
 That's my watch you have, please.

310
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:56,380
 I beg of you.

311
00:11:56,380 --> 00:12:00,460
 decent inside of you Herbert please don't go up. Well I'm going up right now.

312
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:03,980
 All right Herbert here's your watch G-Wiz. You better give it to me.

313
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:07,500
 Here take the darn thing. She was the jadropa? You dropped it.

314
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:11,180
 Where is it? Don't you have any light in this part of the cellar. What do you

315
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:15,420
 want with a light in the coal bin for? Are you sure you aren't stepping on it?

316
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:20,220
 How would I know? If I am Henry you'll be responsible. It's a funny thing. I fell

317
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:23,820
 all around on the floor. There isn't any sign up. Let me feel.

318
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:24,660
 Do you have it?

319
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,480
 Whoa.

320
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,540
 Herbert, here's a broom.

321
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:30,340
 Stand up in the coal while I try to find it by sweeping.

322
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:30,840
 OK.

323
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:36,220
 Henry!

324
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:37,580
 Yes, Father?

325
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:40,580
 What are you doing down there?

326
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:43,780
 I'm sweeping the cellar.

327
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,340
 What for?

328
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:48,700
 It's something I should have done weeks ago.

329
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:49,460
 Herbert, Herbert, look.

330
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:49,960
 I found it.

331
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,540
 It's OK.

332
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:51,900
 Yes.

333
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,900
 Look out, Henry!

334
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:59,460
 Herbert.

335
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:01,740
 Herbert, are you buried?

336
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,500
 Tell me to watch Henry.

337
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,340
 Quick Herbert, quick, my father's coming, I think.

338
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:06,420
 Let me up the stairs.

339
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:07,540
 You can't go upstairs.

340
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:08,340
 You gotta go in here.

341
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:10,540
 In this little room where my father has his work bench.

342
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:11,540
 Okay.

343
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:14,060
 Don't bother to come down, Father!

344
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,740
 What's the trouble down there?

345
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:16,740
 Nothing!

346
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:17,660
 Are you in there, Herbert?

347
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:18,180
 Yeah.

348
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,340
 We'll close the door tight.

349
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,260
 I can't. There's no latch on the inside.

350
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,180
 here I'll close it.

351
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:24,540
 Give me my word.

352
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,380
 Hey, I asked why you're sweeping this

353
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:28,580
 fellow while your Aunt Harry is taking dinner with us.

354
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:30,940
 I guess I just didn't stop the thank-bothering.

355
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:32,900
 Who closed the door to my workroom?

356
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,100
 But I have.

357
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:36,700
 I certainly hope you didn't snap that lock, son.

358
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:37,900
 Well, it snapped by itself.

359
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,460
 Well, that's a nice state of affairs.

360
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:42,540
 I've told everyone in this house I've lost both keys to that lock

361
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:43,820
 and it must not be closed.

362
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,700
 You mean it can't be open?

363
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:46,860
 Of course it can't.

364
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:49,420
 Not until I get a locksmith tomorrow afternoon.

365
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:59,420
 [Music]

366
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:02,420
 Now getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldrich.

367
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:05,420
 Henry having lost the new watches and Harriet gave him,

368
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:08,420
 as borrowed one exactly like it from his friend Herbert.

369
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:12,420
 Herbert, in trying to get the watch back, got locked in Mr. Aldrich's work room.

370
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:15,420
 The scene opens now in the Aldrich kitchen.

371
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:16,420
 Henry!

372
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:18,420
 Yes, Father?

373
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:19,420
 Where are you?

374
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:23,420
 I'm in the kitchen asking Mary if there's anything I can do to help her.

375
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:28,420
 Your aunt Harry has been waiting here in the living room for you to come and play Rummy with her.

376
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:31,420
 Ask father, I'll be right there.

377
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:33,420
 Listen Mary, did you put in that phone call?

378
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:34,420
 Yes, Henry.

379
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:36,420
 Well, what did the locksmiths say?

380
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:38,420
 His wife said she sent him over the minute he got home.

381
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:42,420
 Did you tell her Herbert's been locked in the cellar for more than an hour and a half?

382
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:43,420
 Yes.

383
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:44,420
 Henry!

384
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:45,420
 I'm coming right away, father!

385
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:48,820
 And don't forget him, it was your promise to give me for putting in that call.

386
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:52,820
 No, Mary, you get my allowance for the second and third weeks in November.

387
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:55,820
 - Henry! - Coming, Father!

388
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:59,020
 - Henry! - Is Anne Harry ready to play?

389
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:01,020
 Well, I'm almost ready to go home.

390
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:02,420
 Sit down here and deal the part.

391
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:05,420
 Yes, Anne Harry, I see you give each seven cards.

392
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:07,620
 - Henry, do you know anything about Herbert Thompson?

393
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:09,420
 - Herbert? - Mrs. Thompson just phoned.

394
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:11,420
 Herbert hasn't been home all evening.

395
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:12,620
 Is that right?

396
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:16,020
 The way this younger generation stays out nowadays.

397
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:17,520
 Play your first card.

398
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,520
 Oh, let me go.

399
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,820
 His mother hasn't seen him for two hours.

400
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:23,720
 Boy, it is time flying a crisis.

401
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:26,220
 In a crisis?

402
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,120
 I'll go to the door.

403
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,820
 You stay right here and play with me.

404
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:29,920
 Yeah, but that might be for me.

405
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:30,920
 I'll see who it is.

406
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,120
 I'm on my way now.

407
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:35,320
 How do you do?

408
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,020
 How do you do?

409
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:37,320
 Sorry to have kept you waiting.

410
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,620
 Kept me waiting.

411
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:39,420
 Yes, man.

412
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:40,820
 Didn't you phone for locksmith?

413
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:41,920
 Who is it, mother?

414
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,920
 Henry, ask your father if he's phone for a locksmith.

415
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,520
 Oh, is there one out there?

416
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,220
 Yes, sir.

417
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:51,120
 Well, I didn't phone for you, but I do have a job downstairs you might attend to.

418
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,120
 Father, who is there?

419
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,420
 Henry, play your car.

420
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:55,420
 You got somebody locked up downstairs?

421
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:56,620
 Locked up?

422
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:57,720
 No, sir.

423
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,820
 Well, this place I was called to has an emergency of some kind.

424
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:03,220
 Say, I better go back to the shop and shake up with my wife.

425
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,720
 I'm sorry, this wasn't the house.

426
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,720
 Well, that's okay, lady. All of these were...

427
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,720
 Father, has the man gone?

428
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,620
 Yes, dear.

429
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:10,720
 Is Mary in the kitchen?

430
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,220
 Yes.

431
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,980
 I think I'll get in Harry at a glass of water.

432
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,260
 I don't want any water.

433
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:15,780
 Oh yes you do Anne Harry.

434
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:17,780
 She was I'd be very glad to get it.

435
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:18,780
 Mary.

436
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:19,980
 What is it Henry?

437
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:22,500
 Mary, Mary listen you gotta phone the locksmith again.

438
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,300
 Where's Nick home?

439
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,780
 He's come and gone.

440
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:25,860
 They sent him away.

441
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:28,060
 Henry I done all I'm going to.

442
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:32,700
 Mary don't you realize my best friend is down in the basement locked in that room.

443
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,100
 Maybe without air.

444
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:39,660
 Henry if you think I'm going to make myself ridiculous by falling out locksmith every 10 minutes you're crazy.

445
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:43,980
 Look, Mary, would you be interested in my allowance for the first week in December?

446
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:45,820
 Well...

447
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:48,340
 That practically cleans me out up to Christmas.

448
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,540
 Henry, where's that water?

449
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:52,460
 I'm letting it run in, Harriet!

450
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:54,780
 All right, for you, Mary.

451
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:58,460
 I'm putting the full responsibility for Herbert's condition on your shoulders.

452
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:02,380
 When we get to the door to Father's workroom open and Herbert comes to,

453
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:04,060
 he'll want to know who did this to him.

454
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,780
 But, Henry, I haven't even seen him.

455
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:06,380
 Henry!

456
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:07,540
 Yes, see, and Harriet.

457
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:10,460
 Here's your glass of ice cold water.

458
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:12,780
 Now I can sit down and play.

459
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:13,620
 Here you are.

460
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:14,660
 Thank you.

461
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:15,500
 What did you do?

462
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,980
 Let the hot water run?

463
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:17,660
 Was it warm?

464
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:21,100
 I'll put it down and let it cool.

465
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,220
 How could that have happened?

466
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:25,460
 See, I played that car, didn't I?

467
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:28,700
 I discarded it.

468
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:29,740
 Oh, then it's my turn.

469
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:37,380
 - Is that someone sawing wood?

470
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:42,380
 - Is what someone sawing wood?

471
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,380
 - Oh, oh, wow.

472
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:45,380
 - I thought I heard a saw.

473
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:47,380
 - You still haven't discarded.

474
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:48,380
 - Oh, no.

475
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:52,380
 - Oh, oh, wow.

476
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,380
 What do you mean?

477
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:55,380
 - What do you mean well, well, well?

478
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:56,380
 You haven't put your car down.

479
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:58,380
 - I thought I heard that sawing again.

480
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,380
 - Yes.

481
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:01,380
 And sounded as though I were in the basement.

482
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,380
 - Maybe it's the hot water heater.

483
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:04,380
 - I didn't even hear a noise.

484
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:05,980
 You listen, you hear it.

485
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:08,220
 (humming)

486
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,900
 Henry, will you please stop singing?

487
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,620
 I'd like to hear what that song is.

488
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:12,720
 - Oh, excuse me.

489
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,420
 - Very unharried is my card.

490
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:18,560
 - And Harriet, did you know I've been taking

491
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,660
 music lessons?

492
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:20,900
 I'll play a tune for you.

493
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:21,740
 - Not now.

494
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:23,540
 - Look, here's what I learned so far.

495
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:25,300
 (piano music)

496
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,140
 - Henry.

497
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:26,980
 - Yes, mother.

498
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,340
 - I want you to go back to that card table,

499
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,380
 and if I hear one word out of you for the next five minutes,

500
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,900
 I'm gonna have to ask you to go up to bed.

501
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,140
 - Yes, mother.

502
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:34,140
 Now then let's listen.

503
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:38,140
 Well, you wait.

504
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:42,740
 I hope that that be.

505
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:44,540
 Probably that locksmith again.

506
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,840
 Is it?

507
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,540
 I don't know, dear, and I won't know until I open this door.

508
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:51,240
 Hello, Mrs. Orr, a chibbit.

509
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,040
 Mother, is that Harvard?

510
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,240
 Henry, come back here.

511
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,940
 Henry, I want to talk to you.

512
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:58,040
 Henry's playing Rummy with his aunt, Herbert.

513
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,740
 And if you don't mind, I'll go into the living room.

514
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,440
 Who's coming in here?

515
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:06,240
 I am. I always wanted to play Rummy and now I'm going to.

516
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:21,440
 Harriet, what's the score?

517
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,440
 I'm two thousand ahead. It was I'm three thousand and going.

518
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:27,940
 Herbert, how would you like another glass of ginger ale?

519
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:28,440
 Sure.

520
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:31,940
 Young man, do you realize this is the fourth bottle you've had?

521
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,200
 It is. You drink anymore. You're going to go right up in the air.

522
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,360
 - Herbert! - Yes, Mary.

523
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,120
 Your mother wants to speak to you on the phone.

524
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:39,960
 Okay.

525
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:43,480
 You mean to say that young man is actually going to leave this room?

526
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:46,800
 Well, I had a nice nap.

527
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,320
 Father, you've been asleep for two hours.

528
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:52,000
 Oh, I'm glad to see Herbert's gone.

529
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,800
 What makes you think he's gone?

530
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,480
 - Where is he? - He's phoning for his pajamas.

531
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,680
 But, Mother, it's just a question of time.

532
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:02,280
 As soon as he's in, Harry, it goes like got it.

533
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,280
 He's got what?

534
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,480
 There are several things I'd like to know.

535
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,880
 One is that locksmith coming back the second time.

536
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:10,180
 Yes, that some man was locked up here.

537
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:13,680
 Well, I'll certainly be interested in reading what was in the morning papers.

538
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,680
 Henry, I'm quitting.

539
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,480
 You are?

540
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,680
 Oh, uh, this only?

541
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,680
 I'm not going yet.

542
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,080
 Just not going to play anymore.

543
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,080
 Yes, Anne, Harry.

544
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,280
 Henry, I want to see your watch.

545
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,480
 It's exactly eight minutes after eleven.

546
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,480
 Let me look at it.

547
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,880
 Oh, there's just one little thing I'd like to explain.

548
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:28,680
 Give it to me?

549
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,680
 Yes, ma'am.

550
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:33,980
 How would you like to have me take this down to the jewelers and have your monogram put on it?

551
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:35,580
 Who's monogram, Henry?

552
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:36,880
 Who's do you think?

553
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,280
 You mean my initials naturally?

554
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,780
 Oh, I don't think he'd like that.

555
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:42,280
 How do you know he wouldn't?

556
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,380
 Oh, no, Aunt Harriet, she was.

557
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:47,380
 Suppose, and Henry wanted to change his name sometime.

558
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:51,080
 - To what, for instance? - Early thing.

559
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:51,680
 Yeah.

560
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:54,180
 Only girls use their monograms.

561
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:58,580
 Henry, you let me take this and sometime during the next week or so, I'll have it in braid.

562
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:00,040
 I'll put in my pocketbook.

563
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:03,800
 Wouldn't you fight to have me carry your things out to the car for you?

564
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:04,800
 What things?

565
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,080
 Well, your pocketbook or anything?

566
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,240
 No, thank you.

567
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:12,160
 Henry, supposing you helped your aunt Harry go with her coat?

568
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,680
 Well, I hold her pocketbook.

569
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,880
 Put my pocketbook.

570
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,800
 I'll put it right down here.

571
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,640
 Thank you.

572
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,680
 Anne, Harriet, don't you want to leave it there and go upstairs and see my new wallpaper?

573
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:25,480
 You mean to say you got new wallpaper, but not asking me what to get?

574
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,640
 Well, you told me to get it.

575
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,940
 Well, I'll go up and see it, but I know I won't like it.

576
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:30,240
 Oh, but I think you will.

577
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,640
 Hand me my pocketbook.

578
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,340
 Do you want to carry it all the way upstairs?

579
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:35,040
 Give it to me.

580
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,040
 Give it to me.

581
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:38,440
 Henry, don't you think it'd be nice if we helped

582
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,140
 your aunt Harry up the stairs?

583
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:40,840
 Yes, Herbert.

584
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:41,640
 Let's do that.

585
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,440
 Not so fast, boys.

586
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,640
 So fast, but Henry?

587
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,640
 Yes, Aunt Harry.

588
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,340
 It isn't necessary to push me.

589
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:49,140
 Alice.

590
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:49,940
 Yes, darling.

591
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:52,540
 Would you please tell me what's gotten into those two boys?

 Trying to be nice to Harry it.

593
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:56,240
 It isn't like them to be that nice.

594
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,320
 Herbert's fond of us, and he fits.

 Yes, Mr. Walrich?

599
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,520
 Did you like the wallpaper?

600
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,000
 Oh, very much.

601
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,160
 Well, Henry, I guess I'll be going.

602
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,360
 About what time is that, Herbert, my friend?

603
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:16,000
 Well, my friend, it is exactly 21 minutes after 11.

604
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,120
 Thank you very much.

605
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,600
 Alice, what do you think I've lost?

606
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,100
 What?

607
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:19,760
 Well, sir.

608
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,760
 So long, Henry.

609
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:21,880
 You wait, young man.

610
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,040
 I want to say good night to you.

611
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:23,800
 What did you do?

612
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,240
 I locked my car out in front of the keys inside it.

613
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:26,740
 What?

614
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:28,080
 Sam go out and get them.

615
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,200
 And how would I do that?

616
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,080
 Oh, here they are in my pocket.

617
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,080

618
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:33,580
 Now what?

619
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:35,520
 Henry's watch is gone.

620
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,240
 You mean it isn't there, Anne Harry?

621
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,520
 Henry, I gotta go home.

622
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,040
 Yeah, so long, Herbert.

623
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:43,080
 Now who's dead at the door?

624
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:43,680
 Hello?

625
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,600
 No, Mr. Oldie.

626
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,720
 Go ahead and then see Adams.

627
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,760
 What are you doing here?

628
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,880
 If Henry here, I just found his watch.

629
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,440
 What?

630
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,160
 His watch?

631
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,200
 Where did you find it?

632
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,360
 He left it over at my house this morning.

633
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,960
 Well, how would you account for a thing like that?

634
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:58,520
 Henry also let this letter you forgot to mail.

635
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,440
 A letter?

636
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,400
 Oh, yeah, here, Aunt Harry, it's for you.

637
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,960
 Thanking you for my watch.
