 [Music]

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
 If you weren't too far from the days when you were in high school,

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 you probably remember that a teenage boy is about as unpredictable as the wind.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 And so because Henry Aldrich is an average boy,

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 the kind you'll find anywhere in your town,

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 well, there's just no telling.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 It's morning and the scene opens in the Aldrich Mythi room.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 Now, don't worry, Ed, I've taken care of everything.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,840
 I know the country courts wouldn't have a better chairman of the arrangement committee.

10
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:32,840
 Thank you, Anne.

11
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,840
 But I can't help worrying.

12
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:38,400
 Last year, only 11 people turned up for our Fourth of July celebration.

13
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,760
 And six of them were waiters.

14
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:40,760
 That's right.

15
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,760
 Well, this Fourth of July will be different.

16
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,440
 I have a rose surprise.

17
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,440
 A surprise?

18
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,680
 A special fireworks display.

19
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:50,080
 George Washington crossing the Delaware on Hothback.

20
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,080
 It's famous.

21
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,080
 Didn't Washington cross in a rowboat?

22
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:57,280
 That's the surprise.

23
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,280
 And that is no.

24
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,280
 I have a...

25
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,280
 You see, if we want a big crowd, we have...

26
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,280
 - We have to call the killer to hear him, sir.

27
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,280
 - No, but he isn't.

28
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,280
 Now, my idea is...

29
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,280
 - He isn't home.

30
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,280
 - I mean, he isn't here.

31
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,280
 The thing here is not to scribble about pennies.

32
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,280
 - Oh, I agree with you, sir.

33
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,280
 We send a little money on publicity.

34
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,280
 We'll be able to...

35
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:19,280
 How many do you find this conversation particularly interesting?

36
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,280
 - Oh, no, no, no.

37
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,280
 I mean...

38
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,280
 - Oh, but if you want, Henry, he's in the kitchen.

39
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,280
 - Thank you.

40
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,280
 - The kitchen is the room with the refrigerator.

41
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:35,800
 Good to you. All the time. Now if you don't mind. Oh sure. I'm going I would say it. And all of the

42
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:43,880
 things. I'm going to. What are you doing here. What does it look like. Like a clean. That's what I'm

43
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:52,120
 going to. For a home or guy can help his mother out without the force to do it. Can you're doing this

44
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,380
 of your own free-roading humor.

45
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:56,160
 And Homer, since I'm going to be busy.

46
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,000
 Oh, don't mind me, madam.

47
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,720
 I'll just sit here and watch.

48
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,720
 Don't be just a wise guy, Homer.

49
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,920
 Personally, there's nothing I like to see there

50
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,520
 in a well-kept kitchen.

51
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,640
 Listen, if you came over to scarf at me--

52
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,720
 I don't see how you keep your kitchen so wide and clean.

53
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,400
 Homer and your woodwork.

54
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,240
 It's just spotless.

55
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,720
 Homer, it may interest you to know

56
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,480
 that the reason I'm helping my mother is on account of the park.

57
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,480
 I find the scouring powder that's wonderful.

58
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,480
 What powder?

59
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,480
 The one we're having here tonight.

60
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,480
 Tonight?

61
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,480
 Here?

62
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,480
 Don't want me to help you clean the stove here in old pal?

63
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,480
 I don't know, my mother's pretty fussy about her stove.

64
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,480
 Come on, here, I'm going to help. I'm a 12 stove cleaner.

65
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,480
 Well, please hand me.

66
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,480
 You've talked me into her.

67
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,480
 Here, take the rag.

68
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,480
 Just rest a little.

69
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,480
 He pays him.

70
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,480
 You're a pal.

71
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,480
 All the way in back, Homer.

72
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,480
 You'll have to get a little dirty.

73
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,480
 Oh, that's all right.

74
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,480
 I don't mind.

75
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,480
 Oh, what kind of party are you having, Jim?

76
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,480
 They're well parties, of course we're going to the country for the summer.

77
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,480
 Have you invited many people?

78
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,480
 Well, it's just going to be a small affair.

79
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,480
 Well, exclusive time.

80
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,480
 Now, get all the burners, Homer.

81
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,480
 Oh, sure, he's sure.

82
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,480
 Are all invitations out?

83
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,480
 Oh, most of all.

84
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:17,240
 Oh, but there are still some people you haven't asked.

85
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,440
 Just one.

86
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,440
 Here's some clean calls, Henry.

87
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,440
 There I ask you to clean the soul.

88
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,720
 It's been done, mother, by what you might call remote control.

89
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,200
 - Well, I'm doing it, Mr. Holders.

90
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,000
 - Why, goodness, Holders, I didn't see you under the stoke.

91
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,440
 - I'm getting all the corn in.

92
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,560
 - Thank you, dear.

93
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,600
 - Tell me, I don't think it's very nice making Homer do your work.

94
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,440
 - The mother was his own idea.

95
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,960
 - That's no excuse.

96
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,440
 - It really did go up Mary back in the hall, Rob.

97
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:46,040
 He was mother do you want to have to this girl's work?

98
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:49,040
 Well you could clean up the garage. That's man's work.

99
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,340
 Well what I'm adding mine was more boys work.

100
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:55,640
 Then there's the base of the guest mother. I'll help Mary.

101
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,940
 I'm going right now.

102
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:59,440
 Uh is there anything you want me to do Mrs. Hauler?

103
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,940
 No thank you Hauler.

104
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:04,140
 My goodness you got yourself all dirty from the stove.

105
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,740
 How am I getting dirty?

106
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:09,240
 After all it's not as though I was doing anything tonight.

107
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,340
 You know, that's no.

108
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:14,540
 Or if I was at another suit I could wear.

109
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:15,820
 Oh, that's nice.

110
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:18,420
 It's the suit I always wear to parties.

111
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,860
 [LAUGHTER]

112
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,620
 I'd like you to see it sometime.

113
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:23,300
 Oh, I'd like to do it.

114
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,300
 When?

115
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,780
 [LAUGHTER]

116
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:26,460
 Sorry.

117
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:27,900
 It's fine, not tonight.

118
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,700
 It's free having little parties here.

119
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:30,200
 Mm-hmm.

120
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,420
 I'm trying to love you.

121
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:32,060
 Good.

122
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:33,260
 Really expect you then.

123
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,980
 Of course, I don't want to be in the way.

124
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,380
 Not at all, my--

125
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:39,380
 Maybe I'll be one to many for an exclusive party.

126
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:41,100
 I'm trying to feel your tight welcome.

127
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,700
 The last thing in the world I want to do is force myself.

128
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,700
 Oh, but don't you want to come?

129
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,700
 Am I giving you a question I didn't?

130
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,600
 I don't see what mother says, Henry.

131
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,800
 You are asked or you'll see, you'll see.

132
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,300
 Children, not so nice.

133
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:56,100
 Mother, when we say that, I have to say one to the party tonight.

134
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,100
 Do I, mother?

135
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:57,600
 Now, do I--

136
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,700
 You're darn right, you do, Mary.

137
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,100
 Mother's making me say it.

138
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,100
 And tell me you stay out of this.

139
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,100
 Mother, I'm supposed to go to the movies tonight.

140
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:04,800
 It's coming.

141
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,600
 If Mary goes so to why.

142
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,200
 It's in.

143
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,100
 What kind of a party is this?

144
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,380
 Now Mary, you and Henry will both stay home.

145
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:15,220
 After all, it's the last time you'll see Aunt Harriet all summer.

146
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:17,100
 Is that the party?

147
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,620
 This Aunt Harriet?

148
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:19,620
 Yes, dear.

149
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,620
 Oh, boy.

150
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:24,900
 But Mother, I've been here at home and everything goes down.

151
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,460
 And I see all of them as in that.

152
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,820
 That's enough.

153
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,900
 This time they thought it was your father's idea,

154
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:32,300
 and I don't think he'd like the way you're both behaving.

155
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,220
 Yes, Mother.

156
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:34,540
 But Mother, it's a doubt.

157
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:35,580
 Don't call him moving.

158
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,580
 I don't care where I practice those.

159
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:38,580
 You're saying no.

160
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:39,580
 Mother!

161
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:40,580
 Now come along, Mary.

162
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:41,580
 Help me with the bedroom, please.

163
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:42,580
 Mother, where are those?

164
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:43,580
 I'm so tired.

165
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:46,580
 Boy, if I'm known as a family party, I wouldn't have let your mother invite.

166
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:47,580
 You mean your invite?

167
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,580
 Yeah, and you can get some invite.

168
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:51,580
 That's all I'm inviting.

169
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:52,580
 See, you were a farmer.

170
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:54,580
 What kind of attitude is that?

171
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:58,580
 Listen, if I were an ovation, even in that way, I happened to have relatives of my own.

172
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:01,580
 Mother, I'm not an opportunity to finish vacuuming the hall.

173
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:03,580
 Boy, Mary, it's girls.

174
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:05,820
 Oh, Mary, it's Gerald's work.

175
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:08,080
 Mother said if you said that, you tell me the garage,

176
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:08,580
 you should be--

177
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,180
 I know, Mary, I know.

178
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:12,920
 I suppose you know how to operate a vacuum cleaner.

179
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,980
 Don't worry, Mary.

180
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:17,100
 If there's one thing I know, it's had a maneuver of Hoover.

181
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:21,100
 You take my work for it, eh?

182
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:23,100
 This will be the biggest port of July celebration

183
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,460
 the country club has ever had.

184
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:26,580
 Father, no, I just heard you.

185
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:27,660
 You already have, Mary.

186
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:28,500
 What is it?

187
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,020
 Mother would like you to move the living room

188
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:32,740
 furniture when you have time so we can get out the rug.

189
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:34,060
 I tell you mother I'm busy.

190
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:34,940
 That's all I say.

191
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:35,940
 I'm going anyway.

192
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:36,780
 Well, goodness, Father.

193
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:38,340
 I just gave you mother's message.

194
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,220
 That's all.

195
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:41,660
 Well, family, the ticket committee does a good job.

196
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:42,580
 Everything will be fine.

197
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:45,060
 And we'll just have to make it our individual business

198
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,060
 to get as many people to come as we can.

199
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:48,260
 Are you right, Sam?

200
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:50,140
 Now, I won't keep you from the furniture.

201
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:50,740
 I'll see you later.

202
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:51,580
 And I'll ask you, bye.

203
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:52,580
 Bye.

204
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:55,940
 Mr. and I can show, Karen, you can do it by yourself.

205
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:56,540
 Oh, hold on.

206
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:57,380
 Yes, sir.

207
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:59,260
 Do answer the question for me.

208
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:01,780
 If this is the one about how you get down from an elephant's

209
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:08,500
 back I've heard it no I'm a this is I do you get down from another side you know

210
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,540
 you get it from the dark

211
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:21,180
 think of it I've heard it home would you say that a six piece orchestra is large

212
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:27,200
 enough for dancing I'm sure you're gonna have an orchestra of course we are

213
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:30,520
 nothing but the best. I thought that is mr.

214
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,600
 Polders said it was going to be a small thing.

215
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,880
 I was just being modest.

216
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,760
 Matter of fact, it's going to be one of the biggest affairs

217
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,040
 center there has ever seen.

218
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:43,080
 Even any sort of was going to be a small quiet gathering.

219
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,640
 I think Henry is due for a surprise.

220
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:49,280
 Oh, I get it.

221
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,200
 And by the way, over, I want to see as many people

222
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,160
 show up as possible.

223
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,000
 I'd appreciate it if you would spread the word to anyone who doesn't know.

224
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,440
 I sure will.

225
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:59,180
 You can depend on me, Mr. Orley.

226
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,360
 Good, oh my good.

227
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,160
 Oh boy.

228
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,360
 We're not even wanting to bring the ladder up there.

229
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,800
 All right, don't forget all this.

230
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,640
 Spread the water.

231
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,960
 You bad, Mr. Orley.

232
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,160
 Spread the word about what?

233
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,400
 I can tell you, he needs to see good.

234
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,880
 You and my father have a secret, sure.

235
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,280
 And don't ask me what it is.

236
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,120
 I'm on a bound not to tell.

237
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,440
 Wild horse, you couldn't drag it from me.

238
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,120
 OK, almost.

239
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,080
 That's the way you feel.

240
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,200
 I'm trying to explore all the whole things you knew.

241
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:23,720
 Knew what?

242
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,720
 If your father was going to...

243
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:28,720
 I almost told you.

244
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,720
 Okay, Homer, don't tell me. I don't want to know.

245
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,720
 All right, here, look here and sit.

246
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,720
 But remember, you forced it out of me.

247
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,720
 What?

248
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,720
 This party tonight.

249
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,720
 You're in, Harry?

250
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,720
 Yeah.

251
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,720
 It's just a blind.

252
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,720
 It is?

253
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,720
 Sure.

254
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,720
 It's really a surprise party for you.

255
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,720
 For me?

256
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,720
 Are you sure?

257
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,720
 Sure.

258
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,720
 Sure.

259
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,720
 Your father just told me, face to face.

260
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,120
 And she will.

261
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,760
 And it's gonna be a real big affair.

262
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,220
 An orchestra and everything.

263
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,720
 An orchestra?

264
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,560
 Sure, and I'm supposed to invite anyone I can think of.

265
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,400
 Boy, how's that?

266
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,160
 I wonder why my father's getting a party for me.

267
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,960
 It must be some reason.

268
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,160
 Is it some special occasion?

269
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,160
 None that I can think of.

270
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,880
 I don't graduate till next year.

271
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:14,720
 Maybe.

272
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,520
 [audience laughter]

273
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,280
 It isn't my birthday.

274
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,920
 - Since I say... - What's it?

275
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,920
 I bet it's because I passed in chemistry.

276
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,420
 You think that might be it?

277
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:25,920
 Sure, I got a fixie too.

278
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:30,920
 That's the only thing that's happened lately that's worth celebrating.

279
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:31,920
 Hey, me!

280
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,420
 Oh, my gong, but my mother's suspect, I suspect anything.

281
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:36,920
 Henry, will you help your father with a ladder?

282
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,420
 I sure will, mother.

283
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:40,420
 I don't know why the curtains have to be changed today.

284
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:42,420
 Well, the house will look nice, thanks.

285
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:43,420
 All right.

286
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,420
 All right.

287
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:45,420
 Come on, Henry, give me a hand with a ladder.

288
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:49,420
 Do you mind if I get a glass of 8-2-0 first?

289
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:51,420
 I beg your pardon.

290
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,420
 That's chemistry for water.

291
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:56,420
 It's also an excuse for not working. Come along, you know.

292
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:57,420
 Yes.

293
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:58,420
 Yes.

294
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:01,420
 Sometimes I think it'd be easy just to do everything myself.

295
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:03,420
 Oh, Mrs. Alden. Yes?

296
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,420
 I know all about it.

297
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:07,420
 Oh, about what's here?

298
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:08,420
 About the party tonight.

299
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:10,420
 Oh, you're not the prize party.

300
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:11,420
 What's the prize party?

301
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:13,420
 Sure, you know.

302
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:14,420
 No, I don't.

303
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:16,420
 And I don't think you should have told me.

304
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:17,920
 Oh, Mrs. Long, if you study,

305
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,120
 you tell me I don't want to hear about it.

306
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,720
 But you learn to find out.

307
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,520
 When I do, it'll be time enough.

308
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,520
 But wouldn't you like to know?

309
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,420
 I mean, tell me.

310
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:27,120
 Not another word.

311
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,320
 Yes, ma'am.

312
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,320
 Would you mind having Henry and Mr. Albright, tell me?

313
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,320
 He is, my little.

314
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,320
 I'll be glad.

315
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,720
 Thank you, dear.

316
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:39,820
 I'll ask my good friend to give me L2O2O.

317
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:42,120
 Hello, is this the beauty stop?

318
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,320
 This is Mrs. Albright.

319
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:46,320
 Can I come in at two o'clock?

320
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,120
 I couldn't wait that late.

321
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,820
 There's a special reason.

322
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:53,820
 My husband was giving a surprise party for me tonight.

323
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:57,020
 Yes, I found out by accident.

324
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:58,420
 You're a pager?

325
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:03,620
 Oh, it's the anniversary of the day he proposed.

326
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:06,420
 I knew it was the '20' age.

327
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:08,820
 Oh, it was the '27.

328
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:09,820
 Was it you?

329
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,820
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

330
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:18,820
 (music)

331
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,820
 Mother, is anything wrong?

332
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,820
 Well, Mary, I have a cotton heart.

333
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:25,820
 I don't know, you've been walking around with a funny look.

334
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,820
 Come Mary, that's silly.

335
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,820
 So most of those you know something?

336
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:30,820
 I don't know something.

337
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:31,820
 Another thing.

338
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:32,820
 Hi, Mother.

339
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:36,820
 Really, Mary, I don't know something like that.

340
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,820
 Did you know anything? I didn't know.

341
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:41,820
 I told you I don't know a thing.

342
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:42,820
 I'll get it, Mother.

343
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:43,820
 Thank you, dear.

344
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:46,820
 Hello?

345
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:47,820
 Hello, Mary.

346
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:48,820
 This is Elaine.

347
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:49,820
 Oh, hello, Elaine.

348
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:50,820
 I just saw Homer Brown.

349
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:51,820
 You do you?

350
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,820
 Yes, you invited me to the party tonight.

351
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,820
 Homer invited you?

352
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:58,820
 That was by the authority of your father.

353
00:11:58,820 --> 00:11:59,820
 It's all right, isn't it?

354
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:00,820
 Oh.

355
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,820
 Oh, of course Elaine.

356
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,820
 It's just that I didn't know about it.

357
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:05,820
 Well, I wanted to know what to wear.

358
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,820
 I thought that since your father was hiring, you know,

359
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:10,420
 It was highly an orchestra and everything it might be formal.

360
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:13,540
 Oh no, Elena. It's just a small family party.

361
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:15,420
 But Norman said it was a surprise party.

362
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:17,980
 It's nothing like that, Elena. It's just a...

363
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:20,220
 a surprise party.

364
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:22,620
 Mary, don't tell me you didn't know.

365
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:23,940
 Why, I didn't.

366
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,700
 Oh, you wouldn't get it yet, I am.

367
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:29,340
 But, I mean, it never occurred to me that the party might be for you.

368
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,620
 It is.

369
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:31,660
 Isn't it?

370
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:35,980
 Oh, I'm good. There's no wonder my mother was actually so mysterious.

371
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:38,380
 Please, please don't let on a told you.

372
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:39,980
 Oh, don't worry, I won't.

373
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:41,780
 Mary, what's the reason for the party?

374
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:45,780
 Oh, I can't see them, huh?

375
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:47,980
 Yes, that's what it is.

376
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:49,480
 My birthday.

377
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,480
 Yes?

378
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,480
 Happy birthday.

379
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,480
 No.

380
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,480
 No, it's your time.

381
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,980
 But we'll be in the cut-scene then,

382
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,980
 so they'll have to have it now.

383
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:00,560
 (upbeat music)

384
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:07,600
 - Hey, now you came to it?

385
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,300
 - Well, no, it's my party, isn't it?

386
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,400
 - But when it's a surprise party, I knew it.

387
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,740
 It is an ethical invite people yourself.

388
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:16,500
 - Homer, what have ethics got to do with gliders?

389
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,300
 - Boy, and you should don't know girls.

390
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,800
 Ethics is everything to them.

391
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,640
 - It is?

392
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,680
 - Okay, Homer, you call gliders.

393
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,260
 (upbeat music)

394
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:31,840
 Hello, Willy. Can you come to a surprise party for Henry tonight?

395
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:34,840
 You're going to do a club practice?

396
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,840
 We'll bring them along.

397
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,840
 [CHEERING]

398
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:41,840
 Madeline, like to drop over to my house tonight.

399
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:44,840
 Oh, the lights may be out, but come in anyway.

400
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,840
 [CHEERING]

401
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,840
 Oh, yeah.

402
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,840
 Yes, tonight, a wrong night.

403
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,840
 You have to be a babysitter.

404
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:53,840
 Look, why don't you bring the baby along?

405
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,840
 [CHEERING]

406
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,840
 Hello Lucy, this is Henry Aldrich.

407
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,840
 Aldrich?

408
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:05,840
 Yes, you may not remember me, but I used to sit behind you in third grade.

409
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,840
 Yes!

410
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:17,840
 Mary, I didn't expect to see you here, and I was happy to surprise you.

411
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,840
 Oh, I don't know why we should be surprised.

412
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:24,840
 I suppose it's the most normal thing in the world for a woman to go to a beauty college.

413
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:29,840
 I don't know why I came to do to just as relevant tomorrow.

414
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,840
 That's the way I see your mother.

415
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,840
 Well, especially since I'm not going to have much done.

416
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:37,840
 I think I've got a manicure and lazy a hair set.

417
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,840
 Goodness, they say, "Yeah, do this today."

418
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,840
 And I don't even have an appointment.

419
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,840
 Neither do I.

420
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,840
 I wonder if you lady could come back tomorrow with terribly rough.

421
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,840
 Tomorrow?

422
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:50,840
 But unless... I mean, I'd like to have it done today.

423
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,840
 You told me over the phone you'd be able to squeeze me in.

424
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:58,840
 I'm sorry, I don't know what happened, but everyone seems to be going to a party tonight.

425
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:09,840
 - How am I sure, oldie? - Yes, Omar, what is it?

426
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:14,840
 - Well, I've been spreading the word, like you said. - Good, Omar. I knew I could defend on you.

427
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:19,840
 - George Bigel, a way to question. - What question, Omar?

428
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,840
 He wants to know what flavor ice cream you're having.

429
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:25,840
 All flavors and sandwiches and cold drinks.

430
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:29,840
 Boy, I did not let it get around there. Everybody will want to come.

431
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,840
 Well, that's just what I want, Homer.

432
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,840
 You do?

433
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,840
 Get as many people as you can.

434
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,840
 All right, Mr. Olga, if you say so.

435
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:37,840
 Goodbye.

436
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,840
 Bye.

437
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,840
 What do you say, Homer? What do you say?

438
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,840
 Homer, don't you hear me?

439
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,840
 Boy, you hear me? You're a father. I'm so excited to invite more people.

440
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,840
 He does?

441
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:49,840
 God, who would drink the chemistry was so important to my father.

442
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:56,840
 (music)

443
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,340
 That's right Ed, 38.

444
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:01,140
 I just got a report from one of my agents.

445
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:02,540
 And it's just the beginning.

446
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:06,640
 We'll have more people at the country club this fourth of July than ever before.

447
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,940
 All right, this is why I called Ed.

448
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,740
 We'd better order more food.

449
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,540
 You better double the order to the caterer.

450
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:12,540
 Oh, no wait a minute.

451
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,540
 The way things are going, you better triple it.

452
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:17,540
 (music)

453
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:21,340
 (music)

454
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:24,340
 My goodness, my grandma, how much longer are you going to have to go?

455
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:26,940
 I'll just about restain to my patients, Mary.

456
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:28,340
 Are you going to leave, Mother?

457
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:30,140
 I'll wait just one more hour.

458
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:31,140
 Oh.

459
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:32,140
 Oh, yes.

460
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:34,140
 How much longer will it be?

461
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,740
 Oh, I'm very sorry you had to wait.

462
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:36,940
 Can you take a glance?

463
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:38,940
 Which one of you want to be sample and set,

464
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:40,940
 facial, manicure, fingerweight, and feather cut?

465
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:41,940
 Yay!

466
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,340
 Oh, well, I can only take one of you.

467
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:44,340
 Which one will it be?

468
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:45,340
 Namir.

469
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:46,340
 Namir!

470
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:48,920
 (upbeat music)

471
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:55,500
 - Can I add him to you?

472
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,580
 What you're worrying about,

473
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:59,100
 your father said to invite as many people as I could.

474
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:02,380
 - I know Homer, but 54 people.

475
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:03,780
 How do you wanna cook them?

476
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:04,860
 - How about the basement?

477
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:05,860
 - I'm allowed for that.

478
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:07,620
 They're just as in room and up in this house

479
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:08,620
 for that many people.

480
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:10,420
 - Well, I only did what your father told me.

481
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:11,820
 - I know Homer, I know.

482
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:12,980
 Look, here comes my mother.

483
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:14,020
 - Why don't you ask?

484
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,340
 - Okay, but you better be.

485
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:16,840
 You're not supposed to know when it comes out.

486
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,640
 All right, Homer, I'll be in my room.

487
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,540
 Oh, my, wasn't Henry just here?

488
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,540
 Yes, ma'am.

489
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,740
 Oh, Mrs. Org, this is sure when I--

490
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:24,940
 Oh, thank you, dear.

491
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:26,640
 --just come from the beauty palace.

492
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,640
 Mrs. Org, can I ask you something?

493
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,940
 Who, Homer?

494
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:33,040
 It's, um, about the surprise party tonight.

495
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,340
 You think, Homer, I'd rather not hear about it.

496
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:37,440
 And Mrs. Org, if you don't know what I'm gonna say.

497
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,340
 And I don't want to know, dear.

498
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:41,540
 But Homer, please.

499
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:42,840
 Yes, Mrs. Org.

500
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,760
 Mother, look at my hair.

501
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:45,960
 It's just awful.

502
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,080
 It looks very nice, Mary.

503
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,360
 And besides, dear I did, you're yours.

504
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,520
 I know, Mother.

505
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,880
 Now I wish I had taken a sample one thing to wait

506
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,120
 instead of the face.

507
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,320
 Now I'll have to with your hair.

508
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,240
 Dear, come upstairs.

509
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,000
 All right, Mother.

510
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,600
 I hope you can do something with it.

511
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,600
 Mary.

512
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,280
 Yeah, Mother.

513
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:01,920
 What is it?

514
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:02,960
 Can I ask you something?

515
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,520
 That isn't Homer.

516
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:07,560
 Well, you know the surprise party, Tenerys.

517
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,560
 I do not.

518
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,460
 What?

519
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:11,400
 I don't know what's it happy about.

520
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,400
 Listen, Mary, there's a party to me.

521
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,400
 Oh, I'd rather not discuss it.

522
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,400
 And I must say I'm surprised at you.

523
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,400
 Oh, Mary.

524
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,400
 Oh, Mary, I'm sorry.

525
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,400
 Excuse me. Mother's waiting for me.

526
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,400
 Mother, do you think I had a wash, my mamper?

527
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,400
 Well, Omar, what's the latest figure?

528
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,400
 It's, uh... 54.

529
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,400
 But don't forget, you told me it's plenty.

530
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,400
 Plenty.

531
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,400
 Why?

532
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,400
 Omar, I never realized before how talented you were when it seemed to spread it.

533
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,400
 [laughter]

534
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,400
 Or even a football.

535
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,400
 Oh, there's plenty of room at the country club.

536
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,400
 The country club.

537
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,400
 The country club?

538
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,400
 What's the matter?

539
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,400
 Nothing, I had no idea you were going that way.

540
00:18:51,400 --> 00:19:06,400
 Well, isn't this cozy? Our own little family at our own table.

541
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,400
 Yes, Sam. Yes, Father.

542
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,000
 Well, what are we waiting for? Let's eat.

543
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,200
 Since you think we better wait, dear?

544
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,800
 It's still our own father.

545
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:18,600
 And we might have, well, you know, company.

546
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,800
 Oh, that's right. That's about all about it.

547
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,800
 Oh, who?

548
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,200
 There is that, Harriet.

549
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,800
 And didn't you call her?

550
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,000
 I thought you were.

551
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,600
 My goodness.

552
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,000
 It's too late now.

553
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,200
 Alex, have you served dinner?

554
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,000
 Oh, no, Father, not you.

555
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,600
 Can we wait, Father?

556
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,400
 Wait, what's all?

557
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,400
 Sam, please. What's going on?

558
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,740
 What's everybody all dressed up for?

559
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:40,640
 Is this special there or something?

560
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,540
 Now, Sam, please don't be kidding me.

561
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:46,340
 Father, I hate this boy, I suppose, but I know.

562
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:47,340
 You do.

563
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,340
 And I suppose you know too, Henry.

564
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:52,780
 Tell you the truth, Father, and I do.

565
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:55,920
 I just want to say I consider myself well rewarded

566
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,320
 for all the work I did in chemistry.

567
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,220
 Fine.

568
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:02,260
 Now, everybody knows but me.

569
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:05,220
 What if it is just an ordinary day that's when he hates his deal

570
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:08,180
 and I don't think I'll go right.

571
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:11,660
 You do father and that's not playing game.

572
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:13,380
 Just on you too.

573
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,700
 It is.

574
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,860
 This is a surprise party.

575
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:18,820
 Father we know that.

576
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:23,340
 You're also clever about it but my birthday isn't until next week.

577
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:26,740
 But father.

578
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:30,260
 And you're always saying how good you are today.

579
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:32,020
 A surprise party for me.

580
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:34,020
 Oh we before my birthday.

581
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:37,460
 Well, better early than never, Sam.

582
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:39,860
 I got to say, I'm really touched.

583
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:41,460
 Thanks, you all.

584
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:42,860
 Happy birthday, Father.

585
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:45,860
 [LAUGHTER]

586
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:47,660
 Happy birthday, Father.

587
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:49,060
 Thank you, Mary.

588
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:51,660
 Dear Father, I hope you don't mind a present

589
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,260
 with slightly second hand.

590
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:53,760
 What?

591
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,500
 I thought I'd give you the present I got to Uncle George

592
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:59,660
 for Christmas, the BB gun.

593
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:01,860
 So I can fire three times.

594
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:02,860
 Thank you, Henry.

595
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:04,740
 Feel free to use it anytime.

596
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:09,820
 Father, you remember that book of Robert Brown in the past?

597
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:11,140
 I got lost, please. Yes.

598
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:13,100
 You said he was your favorite part.

599
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,300
 He said he is.

600
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:17,900
 When you take it as a birthday gift, I'll have a credit.

601
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:18,500
 Yeah.

602
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,660
 Thank you, Mary.

603
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:21,740
 Borrow it whenever you like.

604
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:24,460
 Sam, you know that package it came today

605
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:27,340
 from the guest of Brothers Department store in Arlington?

606
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:28,140
 Yes.

607
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:29,980
 Please take it as a birthday present.

608
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:32,660
 All right, what will I do with the ladies umbrella?

609
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:34,860
 Stand where you take it and don't ask any questions.

610
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:35,940
 All right.

611
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:37,260
 Now, what about the birthday cake?

612
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:39,060
 All I have is an apple pie.

613
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:39,360
 Good.

614
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,380
 I don't like cake anyway.

615
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:41,700
 And why should I have to eat something?

616
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,460
 I don't like a week before my birthday.

617
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:44,580
 I'll get the pie.

618
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:45,660
 Don't bother about it.

619
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:47,700
 I'll get the vote.

620
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:48,540
 Hello.

621
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,980
 Mr. Allrich, where is everybody?

622
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:51,980
 What's that, Omar?

623
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:55,580
 I'm here at the country club with 96 people.

624
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:56,580
 What?

625
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:57,080
 What?

626
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,980
 Not including the police club.

627
00:21:58,980 --> 00:21:59,820
 What?

628
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:00,980
 In a baby.

629
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:02,380
 A what?

630
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:14,380
 [applause]

631
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:17,380
 Boy, Homer, it's my whole family mad at you.

632
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:19,380
 Oh, now wait a minute, Henry.

633
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:21,380
 You and your surprise party, boy.

634
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:23,380
 Listen, Henry, you heard your own father tell me.

635
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:24,380
 Right on this whole home.

636
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:26,380
 Well, my father was talking about

637
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:29,380
 was the big Fourth of July party at the country club,

638
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:30,380
 next week.

639
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:33,460
 - This is Ezra Stone.

640
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:35,540
 Now that I've stepped out of character,

641
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:38,500
 I'd just like to say a word to all you folks in our audience

642
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:41,020
 who've been friends and neighbors of the Aldridge family,

643
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:42,580
 all these years.

644
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:46,340
 Folks, we want you to know how much we'll really miss

645
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:49,580
 our wonderful sponsor, the General Foods Corporation,

646
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:52,460
 and our foster fathers, Howard Chapin and Ray Smith,

647
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:57,020
 who have kept us in the world so well fed all these years.

648
00:22:57,020 --> 00:23:00,540
 But I guess most of all, we'll miss you.

649
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:03,780
 We hope you'll miss us too, just a little bit.

650
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:05,500
 Usually at the close of each show,

651
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,980
 I've always bid you goodnight to the entire Aldridge family,

652
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:11,580
 but tonight I think we should eat, speak for ourselves.

653
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:13,580
 In the booth, NBC's finest.

654
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:16,740
 Alice Young, Paul Knight, Bill Brinkmeyer,

655
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:20,020
 and of course, our own Jack Miller and his fine orchestra.

656
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:22,500
 Goodnight to Rita Bauer, Mary Aldridge.

657
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,500
 - Goodnight everybody.

658
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,180
 - And Catherine Ross, Alice Aldridge.

659
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:26,180
 - Goodnight everybody.

660
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:28,580
 - House Jameson, Samuel Longbend.

661
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:29,420
 - Good night, everybody.

662
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:31,780
 - Of course, Jackie Kelk, Homer.

663
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:32,740
 - Good night, everybody.

664
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:34,940
 - And for me, as with Stone,

665
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:37,580
 may you always be healthy, prosperous,

666
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:40,860
 and appreciative of the folks who live next to you.

667
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:43,100
 Good night, and good bye.

668
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:46,260
 (audience applauding)

669
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:49,000
 (dramatic music)

670
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,740
 (dramatic music)

671
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:53,980
 (buzzing)
