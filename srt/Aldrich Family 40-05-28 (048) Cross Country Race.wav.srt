 The Aldrich family, written by Clifford Goldsmith and starring Ezra Stone as Henry Aldrich,

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 brought to you by the Puddings and our Tops in Tates,

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:13,840
 Jello pudding. Do you remember when you were in your teens? Well, when you listened to Henry

14
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,480
 Aldrich and his pals we think you sort of be able to detect a little of yourself

15
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:24,200
 or Henry Aldrich is a typical American boy from a typical American family just

16
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:28,520
 listen and see if I'm not right it's six thirty in centerville and the scene

17
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:34,140
 opens with Henry taking dinner at the home of his pal busy Steven Mr.

18
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:38,840
 Stevens could I trouble you for the bread please oh yeah certainly Henry she was I

19
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,840
 I almost took two slices.

20
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,840
 Well, wouldn't you like to take two?

21
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,840
 No, thank you. Never take more than one at a time.

22
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,840
 Why only one, Henry?

23
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,840
 My mother has asked me not to, does he?

24
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,840
 Basil.

25
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,840
 Yes, father.

26
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,840
 Supposing you put back three of the four slices you took?

27
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,840
 Yes, sir.

28
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,840
 And eat your broccoli.

29
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,840
 Father, I don't like broccoli.

30
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,840
 You aren't supposed to like it. Just eat it.

31
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,840
 The only way I can make broccoli good down is with bread.

32
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:15,340
 Mrs. Stevens, I'm very sorry to interrupt you, but could I have a second helping of broccoli

33
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,340
 good?

34
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,340
 Of course.

35
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,840
 Now that's the way I like to see a young man eat.

36
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,840
 Thank you, Mrs. Stevens.

37
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,640
 I just wish Basil had such nice table manners.

38
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,840
 I do, Mother, when I'm busy.

39
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,840
 Oh, yes.

40
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,840
 But when I'm home, I like to relax.

41
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:35,240
 And the only reason Henry is eating broccoli is so we can take Geraldine to the dance Saturday

42
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,240
 night.

43
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,240
 Go to the dance with them unless you eat broccoli.

44
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,240
 She won't be able to.

45
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,240
 I see.

46
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:44,240
 That Mr. Stevens is why I have to have the typewriter.

47
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,240
 The what?

48
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,240
 The typewriter.

49
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,240
 But I'm not worried.

50
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,240
 I'm almost positive I can get it.

51
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:52,240
 If I can only get the sleeping bag I need.

52
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,240
 A sleeping bag?

53
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,240
 Kind of a dance is this, Henry, a masquerade?

54
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,240
 Oh no, it's just a dance.

55
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,240
 But before you can go to it, you have to eat broccoli

56
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:04,240
 and get a typewriter and a sleeping bag.

57
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:09,440
 Yes, sir. There's just one drawback. I can't get the bag if I don't pass my mathematics.

58
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,240
 Molly, may I have this all, please?

59
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,240
 Don't you understand, Father?

60
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:17,240
 That's why Henry has to win the cross-country race.

61
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,240
 Perfectly clear.

62
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,740
 Mrs. Stevens, do you understand?

63
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:22,740
 Well, it's entirely.

64
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,740
 There's just one point I missed.

65
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:26,240
 Which one was that?

66
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,240
 I don't know.

67
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:30,240
 I'll explain it to you again, Father.

68
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,240
 Eat your broccoli.

69
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:37,240
 Yes, sir. Mr. Stevens, I'm going to run an across-country race for Central High.

70
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:43,240
 And our track coach is my math teacher. That's why I have to win, or I don't pass my math.

71
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:47,240
 In which case you will or you won't need a sleeping bag.

72
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,240
 I will.

73
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:51,240
 Thank, will you have some more potatoes?

74
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,240
 I've lost my appetite.

75
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:56,240
 Didn't I tell you, Henry, you're too hard to understand?

76
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:01,240
 Father, if he doesn't pass in his math, his father won't give him his old sleeping bag.

77
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:06,700
 is that a punishment? If he doesn't give it to me, I won't be able to swap it for

78
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:12,600
 shorty woods as typewriter. In which case? In which case what Mr. Stevens? It's a

79
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:19,520
 field is choice. See the dance committee needs a typewriter and if I get the one

80
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:23,880
 they'll give me four tickets free. Oh well I'm glad you're that's true. Yeah and

81
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:28,200
 that's the only reason why Henry is eating his broccoli. My whole future depends on

82
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:32,560
 winning that race. That would be putting it mildly. Could I have some more please?

83
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,280
 Are you sure you're not eating too much there? Don't discourage him,

84
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:41,560
 Mother. I have just as much a steak on his winning as he has. Hey, Molly, don't ask

85
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,920
 Basel why. Well, it's just because... Well, it's just because... You don't want to know.

86
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:50,920
 But I want to... Yes, Mother. Would you like to have me tell you, Mrs. Stevens? No,

87
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:54,920
 Well then could I have a little more of everything please?

88
00:04:54,920 --> 00:05:11,920
 One, two, three, four, one, two.

89
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:16,920
 Let your knees high and we'll have to run like this even in a cross-country run, don't you want to develop?

90
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,920
 You want to develop?

91
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,920
 But this is going to over develop me.

92
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,920
 One, two, three.

93
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,920
 Hiya.

94
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,920
 I've hit my chin.

95
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,920
 Dad.

96
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,920
 Wait a minute.

97
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,920
 Wait a minute, Henry.

98
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,920
 Basil?

99
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,920
 Are you in heavy upstairs?

100
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,920
 Yes, Mother.

101
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,920
 What are you doing?

102
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,920
 We're just talking a little something over.

103
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:37,920
 Well, is that noise you're making while you're talking necessary?

104
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,920
 I'm developing Henry.

105
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,920
 Why can't you develop him outdoors?

106
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,920
 It's raining.

107
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:49,300
 It's raining and besides if Henry would run on his toes as he should you wouldn't even hear him.

108
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,460
 Well, please ask him to.

109
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:53,260
 Get up Henry and start again.

110
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,100
 I'm quitting.

111
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:57,200
 You mustn't sit down Henry. Do you want to step him?

112
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,640
 I ate too much broccoli, does he?

113
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:03,580
 Besides, I don't think I'll ever be able to make time in your father's golf shoes.

114
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:04,900
 Why not?

115
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:07,380
 They weigh five pounds each.

116
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:08,980
 They've got spikes on the bottom.

117
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:12,060
 Sure they have. That's to give you a grip on the road.

118
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:15,960
 You want to go into a three and a half mile race slipping and sliding all over the course?

119
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,860
 I'm not in training anymore.

120
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:20,760
 So you don't want to go to the dance and take Geraldine.

121
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:24,060
 You don't even care whether you get the two tickets you promised to give me.

122
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,660
 No.

123
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:29,760
 Henry, do you realize what Middleton High did to us last year?

124
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:33,160
 The final score for the meet was 65 to nothing.

125
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:37,760
 But, Dizzy, why not leave our training and just let me go into the race fresh?

126
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,360
 Okay.

127
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,160
 Okay, if you know more about how to run them, I do.

128
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,160
 Okay then.

129
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,160
 Uh...

130
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,760
 Alright.

131
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:48,260
 What is it I have to do next?

132
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:50,460
 You have to run up and down the front stairs.

133
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:51,460
 But quietly.

134
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:53,060
 Were these shoes on?

135
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:55,860
 You will hate the stairs I spread newspapers on each step.

136
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:58,360
 I'm not gonna do it.

137
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:01,860
 Look, I'll go to the trouble of timing you with my watch.

138
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:04,860
 Come on, just five times down and five times up.

139
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:07,360
 Okay, five times but no more.

140
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,860
 Okay, get on your mark, Henry.

141
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:11,000
 Yeah, and remember the old toes.

142
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,220
 Keep up on my toes.

143
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:13,180
 You're going down?

144
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:14,300
 It'll strengthen them.

145
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,900
 Oh, get on your mark.

146
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,180
 Yeah, get set.

147
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:19,220
 Go.

148
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:20,620
 What's the matter, Henry?

149
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:23,580
 There's one step there that doesn't have a piece of paper on it.

150
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,260
 Well, skip that one.

151
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:26,620
 Come on, get on your mark.

152
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:27,460
 Get set.

153
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:27,960
 Go.

154
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,260
 I'm off.

155
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,620
 Come on, Henry.

156
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:31,620
 Let her out.

157
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,140
 Come on, let's see what you can do.

158
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:34,900
 Now, come on, back up.

159
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,460
 Middleton's right behind you.

160
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:37,620
 She's posing in on you.

161
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:38,780
 She's gaining.

162
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:42,140
 You're crazy as to! Now stop down again!

163
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:44,780
 I know! What's going on here?

164
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:46,940
 Little town's starting to pass 'em!

165
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:48,540
 Well, come down here!

166
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:50,940
 Oh, oh, oh! So my head!

167
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:58,540
 What is this?

168
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:01,500
 Can we now look what you've done to the spass?

169
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:16,500
 [Music]

170
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:20,500
 But father, I'm not asking you to get track shoes and track pants for me.

171
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,500
 I thought you were.

172
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,500
 Oh no, you'd really be getting them for Central High.

173
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,500
 I see.

174
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:29,500
 Mr. Always, you realize that last year every men on the Middletown High School team

175
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:33,660
 school team finished before any of ours did. Did they? And we certainly don't want to

176
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:37,860
 thing like that to repeat itself. Gee, after all, a thing like that involves

177
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:41,900
 everybody in town. Everybody's pride is hurt. I see.

178
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:45,940
 Perhaps I could get the Chamber of Commerce to buy Henry's outfit.

179
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:49,980
 Well, I'll certainly be handicapped if I have to run in any old thing.

180
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:53,980
 If worse came to worse, Mr. Orwood, you'll be willing to buy Henry just ordinary

181
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:57,520
 sneakers. Didn't Henry tell you why I can't buy

182
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:00,660
 Henry, if I were you, I wouldn't

183
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,660
 swing those Indian clubs here in the living room.

184
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:05,060
 Yes, Father, I didn't even realize I was.

185
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:06,780
 You're not to swing them in this house.

186
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:07,700
 No, Father.

187
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:10,460
 Henry, which way has your father decided

188
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:12,100
 regarding the other question?

189
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:15,580
 I've decided he may have neither shoes nor a suit.

190
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:17,740
 I'm quite sure Henry understands why.

191
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,860
 Did you disobey your father, Henry?

192
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,980
 You were playing catch right out in front of a house.

193
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,380
 Weren't you, son?

194
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:24,020
 Yes, sir.

195
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,340
 And I told you that if you didn't go,

196
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:27,940
 Some other place should have an accident, didn't I?

197
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:29,140
 Yes, sir.

198
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:30,540
 Well, then.

199
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,340
 What happened, Henry?

200
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:34,940
 The ball went through this living room window.

201
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:36,140
 Yes.

202
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:38,940
 And father was sitting right beside it.

203
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,540
 Oh.

204
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:43,340
 Father, I know I should be punished, but

205
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:46,540
 think of how I'll feel when I have to tell them at school.

206
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:48,740
 Henry, let's not mention the subject again.

207
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:50,340
 She was what's all that doing?

208
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,340
 Now, sir, I know.

209
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,540
 Well, it's something...

210
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,940
 Now, here I go, Ben.

211
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:59,840
 I know I've got the windows, I'm having a rally for the fact that it's tomorrow.

212
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,940
 Come on, let's go up.

213
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:03,340
 You go, Jesse, I'm going to stay here.

214
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:06,940
 There goes Paul, how can you think I want him to see me?

215
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,540
 Which is more important, son.

216
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:12,940
 Winning that race tomorrow or building some character in the year to come?

217
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:15,040
 I suppose building some character.

218
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:19,840
 Mr. Orr, do you know if it would help me in the year 35 cents, I'd be willing to put towards a parish use.

219
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,340
 It's not a question of money.

220
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:23,540
 Well, Henry, why aren't you in busy out with the crowd?

221
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:30,740
 Why should I mother father doesn't care whether I win or not Henry that isn't exactly fair is this still about track shoes?

222
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:36,040
 Yes, mother. What do you think about it? I agree entirely with your father. You do mother. I'm sorry

223
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:41,500
 Come on, does he let's go upstairs? I guess the only thing to do Henry is train all the heart

224
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,080
 I've trained to the breaking point as it is

225
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:50,240
 Sam well, I couldn't be let Henry get what he needs after we've told him he can't but Sam

226
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,540
 You've always wanted Henry to go in for our sledding.

227
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:55,540
 Well, he may still go in, but he must also learn to obey.

228
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,240
 But he always does obey.

229
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,240
 Oh, every boy his age forgets now and then, dear.

230
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,840
 Very well, supposing we let him get some shoes and pants.

231
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,240
 How are we going to take faith?

232
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:08,240
 Oh, we can make out that came from Aunt Harriet or someone.

233
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,740
 I'm not so sure, Alice, we should do it.

234
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:14,740
 Name one time Henry has recently deliberately disobeyed you.

235
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,240
 When he threw that ball through the window.

236
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,740
 Oh, I mean one other time.

237
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:19,740
 What's that?

238
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,740
 It's an Indian club coming downstairs.

239
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:22,740
 Yes.

240
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:23,740
 Henry Orange.

241
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:25,740
 I didn't realize it was going to slip, Father.

242
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:29,740
 Didn't I ask you only five minutes ago not to swing those clubs in this house?

243
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:32,740
 Did that include the second floor?

244
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:35,740
 Is the second floor in this house?

245
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:36,740
 Yes.

246
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:38,740
 Is there any reason you can't train out on the porch?

247
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:39,740
 No, sir.

248
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:40,740
 What's the trouble, Henry?

249
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:41,740
 Come on down, Dizzy.

250
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:42,740
 Okay.

251
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:44,180
 What's the trouble, Henry?

252
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,940
 Come on down, Dizzy.

253
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:47,700
 OK.

254
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,620
 Does your father want to speak to me, too?

255
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:52,420
 Come on out onto the porch, Dizzy.

256
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,180
 Sam, may I speak with you in the living room?

257
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,100
 I certainly do.

258
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,060
 Mrs. Aldridge, were you speaking to me?

259
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:57,700
 No, Dizzy.

260
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,540
 I'm saying something to Mr. Aldridge.

261
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:02,340
 Oh, excuse me.

262
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:03,180
 Hey, Henry, wait.

263
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,660
 I'll go out with you.

264
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,540
 We can practice out here on the porch.

265
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:07,740
 You hear what I heard?

266
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:08,180
 Why?

267
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:09,620
 Your mother said something to your father

268
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:12,020
 that makes me think she's going to bring him around to your side.

269
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:14,020
 Yeah, I think he's gonna work on it.

270
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:17,020
 Boy, if you even get a pair of sneakers, you can't lose that race.

271
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:19,020
 Look, Tizzy, look in the window.

272
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:21,020
 Sure, they're talking it over. Your mother's even laughing.

273
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:22,020
 Gee, maybe it's all set.

274
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:24,020
 Come on, Henry, let's get back to work.

275
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:25,020
 Yeah, what do I do now?

276
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,020
 The whole routine.

277
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,020
 Raise your Indian clubs.

278
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:28,020
 Okay.

279
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:29,020
 Out straight.

280
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:30,020
 Begin.

281
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:34,020
 Two, three, four, one, two, three.

282
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:39,020
 - Oh gee, where's my club slipped?

283
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,020
 - Henry Ora!

284
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:43,020
 - I've gotta go home, Henry.

285
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:46,020
 Is anybody hurt, Father?

286
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:49,020
 - Not yet, but when you please come in the house.

287
00:12:49,020 --> 00:13:05,020
 [Music]

288
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:12,020
 Well friends, it's just about time for Henry's High School and other high schools and colleges to hold their mid-year graduating exercises

289
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:15,020
 and award prizes for various scholastic attainments.

290
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:22,020
 And speaking of honors being presented, that reminds us of another honor being awarded every day in thousands of homes all over the country.

291
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:25,020
 It's an honor that might be presented in the following words.

292
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:37,020
 Ladies and gentlemen, for rich mellow flavor, for smooth, creamy goodness, and for all around satisfaction, we proudly present the award,

293
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:45,020
 The award, not of cum laude, magna cum laude, but summa cum laude to jello chocolate pudding.

294
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:49,020
 And we designate it most likely to succeed.

295
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:55,020
 As folks, jello chocolate pudding certainly does carry off top honors when it comes to real downright goodness.

296
00:13:55,020 --> 00:14:01,020
 It's a swell luscious pudding, velvety smooth through and through, just the way a perfect pudding should be.

297
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:05,020
 And yellow chocolate pudding is simply unaccelled for rich chocolatey flavor.

298
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:10,020
 A chocolate flavor developed especially for Jell-O by the famous Walter Baker Company.

299
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:13,020
 So try this mellow treat real soon, won't you?

300
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:20,020
 You'll find that in your family too, they dessert most likely to succeed is Jell-O chocolate pudding.

301
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:36,020
 [Music]

302
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:41,620
 Now getting back to Henry Aldrich, Henry is to run for Central High in a cross-country race.

303
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:46,120
 Unfortunately, when we left him, he had neither track shoes nor a track suit.

304
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:49,120
 As we return we find him warming up at the starting line.

305
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:56,120
 Yeah! Yeah! Come on. Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

306
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:03,120
 How are the shoes, Henry? Well, let's see you running them.

307
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,120
 Well, I'm glad your father let me borrow these golf shoes.

308
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,120
 I thought you said they were too big for you.

309
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,120
 I've got three pairs of socks on.

310
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,120
 How about using your own head?

311
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,120
 How do you feel, boy?

312
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,120
 I guess I never felt better in my life.

313
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,200
 Well, see that's a great idea of your wearing your swimming suit

314
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:31,160
 Dizzy that was for me the whole school's in fact of you it's up to you Henry don't worry about me

315
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:35,000
 Boy, did you hear Gwenlyn yell out like that?

316
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:41,340
 Did you see that Middleton team over there if I can't pass them I'm gonna give up running the main thing is do you understand?

317
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:44,020
 Where the course goes sure yeah, well where does it go?

318
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:47,100
 We start right here at Scott's corners and follow the main highway

319
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,760
 Intercentible till we come to the big four huh yeah

320
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:54,500
 Well, do you turn to the left or to the right to the left anyone knows that that's the shortest way in the town

321
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:59,780
 Okay, but remember you don't go to the right and listen Henry if you can't start right with a gun

322
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:04,820
 Remember this is a three and a half mile race if you can get a quick start you're in

323
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:09,080
 I thought you didn't want me to take the lead take it until you can jockey for position

324
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:16,100
 After that whole back say yeah save yourself. Oh sure and don't try to pass whoever grabs a lead

325
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:22,180
 It's a come on they always put a spritter in their purposely to tie here. Hello Henry. She was Geraldine

326
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:28,440
 I'm going up to the finish line Henry. Are we going to the dance tonight? Sure if I win this race and pass in my math

327
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:36,260
 I am and Geraldine will you promise to save all your dances for me? Oh Henry of course. I was all right. Who's calling me? All right?

328
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,260
 Come here.

329
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:39,260
 Oh, Gee, did you want me, Coach?

330
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,260
 Oh, you do.

331
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:42,260
 Oh, Gee, Coach, I could race 10 miles.

332
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:43,260
 Fine.

333
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:45,260
 Now, I'll tell you what I want you to do.

334
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:46,260
 Yes, Coach.

335
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:47,260
 Central is got to win, see?

336
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:48,260
 Yes, Coach.

337
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:51,260
 But you and Erwin Cooper are the only two I can spare for this race.

338
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,260
 Yes, Coach.

339
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:54,260
 And there will be six running against you from middle town.

340
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,260
 Yes, Coach.

341
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:57,260
 The whole thing is up to you.

342
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:58,260
 Yes, Coach.

343
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:00,260
 Now, here's the dope.

344
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:02,260
 Take the lead right at the start.

345
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:03,260
 Yes, Coach.

346
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:05,260
 Run those six boys from middle town right off their feet.

347
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:10,560
 Yes, Coach, and then when you shot everything you've got, Erwin Cooper has been holding back.

348
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,460
 We'll come forward and win the race.

349
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:13,060
 Yes, Coach.

350
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:15,760
 I don't win it?

351
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,260
 Well, after all, isn't this for the school?

352
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:19,860
 Yes, Coach.

353
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:26,460
 This isn't the time to ask it, but could you tell me if I passed my math exam?

354
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:29,260
 I'll let you know about that when the race is old.

355
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:29,760
 [whistle]

356
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,260
 Now?

357
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:32,260
 There's a two-minute signal.

358
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,820
 I'll go in there and give everything you've got.

359
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:37,660
 Okay, Coach, you see, with...

360
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:38,460
 Henry!

361
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:39,360
 What do you have, Mother?

362
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,260
 Don't you think you ought to be wearing a coat, dear?

363
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,060
 Mother, don't embarrass me.

364
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:44,660
 Good luck, son.

365
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:47,260
 Thanks, Father. Only I can't win the race.

366
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:49,060
 They aren't going to let me.

367
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:50,860
 If you see Geraldine, will you tell her?

368
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:51,960
 Oh, you'll win it.

369
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,560
 They don't want me to.

370
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,260
 Your mother and I are going to get in the car

371
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,760
 and drive on up the road away.

372
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,360
 Henry! Henry!

373
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,660
 What do you think has happened?

374
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:00,160
 Why?

375
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,660
 Everyone Cooper just turned his knee and he can't run.

376
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:05,060
 I mean I'm the only one running for a special ride.

377
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:06,660
 Well, where are you everyone?

378
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,260
 Popeyes can line up here.

379
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:09,660
 Oh, stay, stay, stay!

380
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:10,660
 Hey!

381
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:12,860
 You still want me to take the lead?

382
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:14,260
 Oh, do whatever you can.

383
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,660
 Just get him there and run.

384
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,060
 Yes, coach, sure.

385
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:18,060
 Line up, boys.

386
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:19,060
 Yay!

387
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:20,060
 Tickle!

388
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:21,060
 Tickle!

389
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,060
 Tickle!

390
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,060
 Oh, hey!

391
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,060
 Get on your mark!

392
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:26,060
 Hey!

393
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:27,060
 Get, cut!

394
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:28,060
 Kill him, Henry!

395
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:30,060
 What's happening?

396
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:31,060
 Henry, get on!

397
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:32,060
 Oh, my friend!

398
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:35,060
 I'm going to go on, honey. I'll follow you on my bicycle.

399
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:37,060
 I don't have to go fair with me, this thing.

400
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:40,060
 You're doing great, boy. I am? Yeah.

401
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:42,060
 Could you put on just a little steam?

402
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:45,060
 The six middles and guys have already rounded the turn.

403
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:48,060
 I'm holding back on purpose. Oh, that's using the old head.

404
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:50,060
 I've got it all figured out, sure.

405
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:53,060
 But don't you think you ought to run a little faster?

406
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:55,060
 Don't talk to me so much.

407
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:57,060
 Darn it all anyhow. What's the matter?

408
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:59,060
 My shoe string busting.

409
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:01,060
 What difference does that make?

410
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:02,460
 Come on, keep going, Henry.

411
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:05,060
 I can't run with my shoe half, or...

412
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,660
 There, I kicked it off.

413
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,060
 And now you're coming.

414
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:11,060
 Look up ahead, they're less than a quarter of a mile in the lead.

415
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:15,260
 I'll never be able to catch them in one shoe,

416
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:18,060
 but you've got that much less to carry than they have, haven't you?

417
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:22,060
 Yeah, but look, take the other one off and you won't have anything holding you back.

418
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,060
 Okay.

419
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:24,060
 Well, I...

420
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:26,060
 ...take it off.

421
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:28,060
 You'll keep your eye on Middletown.

422
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:32,740
 I'm watching them I won't let them get out of your sight all you have to do now

423
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:37,580
 are sprint alone you pass them in no time oh boy does that feel good watch me

 miles that's going to help there's the I'll never be able to catch up with them

427
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,660
 Well get over and earn him the ditch.

428
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:58,660
 Yeah, that's an idea.

429
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:01,660
 Oh gee whiz, why didn't you tell me there was water in here?

430
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:02,660
 Well get out.

431
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:05,660
 I'm certainly glad I wore my bathing suit.

432
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:07,660
 Look at them up ahead.

433
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:08,660
 I've got an idea Henry.

434
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:09,660
 You keep on running, say.

435
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:10,660
 Where are you going?

436
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:13,660
 I'm coming up in the back and say this baby, where are you going?

 [Music]

438
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:30,660
 Sam, how many have gone by so far?

439
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:31,660
 Six.

440
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:33,660
 How many are there in the race?

441
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:34,660
 Seven.

442
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:39,660
 Are you sure Henry wasn't one of the first to pass?

443
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:43,000
 I certainly haven't seen anyone go buy in a red bathing suit.

444
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,860
 Come over the coach is having him hold back.

445
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,760
 - Hold back. - Uh-huh.

446
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:51,860
 - Well, what's the sense in that? - Strategy, Alice.

447
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:55,100
 You save yourself till the finish and then you put on a burst of speed.

448
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:58,260
 Well, isn't that smart of Henry to think of it?

449
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:01,160
 Oh, here he comes at it. He's coming around the curve.

450
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:05,560
 - On a bicycle? - Oh, no, no. That's strange. That's dizzy.

451
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:08,060
 - Miss Aldrich! Miss Aldrich! - Miss Aldrich!

452
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,160
 Did he have something happened to Henry?

453
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,660
 He lost his shoes.

454
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:12,660
 What was that?

455
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:14,960
 He's roaming in the stocking's feet on gravel

456
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,660
 and Mr. Orbridge needs some sneakers.

457
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:18,660
 Well, we couldn't possibly get any sneakers now.

458
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:19,760
 Sure, we can get some.

459
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,360
 It's only a minute up to the store.

460
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,360
 Well, all right. Hurry up. Get in the car.

461
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,660
 Okay.

462
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:27,160
 Then I thought you said it was Roy and Henry's character

463
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,160
 if we buy shoes.

464
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,960

00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,960
 Nothing that make a difference Henry.

468
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,960
 Henry, don't those shoes make a difference?

469
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,960
 Hey Henry!

470
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,960
 I can hear you.

471
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,960
 I can't speak.

472
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,960
 Put on the steam boy.

473
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:02,800
 Yeah.

474
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:06,360
 Let me get on your bicycle, would you?

475
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,760
 You're not gonna quit, are you?

476
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:12,120
 What's the use of my keeping on?

477
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:18,040
 The rest of it already finished and the crowd's probably going home.

478
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:22,440
 But, Henry, no matter how tired you may be, you should always finish your race.

479
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,760
 You've only got another quarter of a mile.

 I don't even care whether I take Gerald into the dance.

482
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:35,480
 But the one central high to go down in history is not finishing this race.

483
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,480
 Oh, I'll finish.

484
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:40,480

00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,480
 And you're fine!

523
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,480
 You're fine!

524
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:56,480
 Sam, I think this is the grandest idea you had.

525
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:00,480
 I had our dropping in for a few minutes and watching the young people dance.

526
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,480
 And there will probably be the hero of the ball.

527
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:06,480
 Oh, my goodness, has he been busy today?

528
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:12,480
 First he won that race and then after getting his mark in mathematics he had to exchange the sleeping bag you gave him for the typewriter

529
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,480
 so he could get the tickets and take Geraldine. I should think he'd be exhausted.

530
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:21,480
 Here we are. I'll open the door.

531
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,480
 Oh, thank you.

532
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,480
 Sam.

533
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,480
 Well...

534
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:31,900
 You don't suppose Henry's winning that cross-country race had anything to do with his getting 98 and mathematics do you?

535
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:36,320
 Why no no it couldn't have

536
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:44,520
 No Alice. I've decided that boy has character. Yes character as I'm really encouraged. Come on. Let's go into

537
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,660
 Mr. Mrs. Aldrich?

538
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:55,660
 Oh, yes, Shelby.

539
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,660
 Have you any idea where Henry could be?

540
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:59,160
 What do you mean there?

541
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,160
 Why he disappeared?

542
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,660
 Nobody can find him.

543
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:03,160
 What do you mean he disappeared?

544
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,660
 Well, he brought me to the dance and nobody seen him since.

545
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:07,160
 I haven't even danced with you.

546
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,160
 No.

547
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,660
 I've just been sitting and waiting and waiting.

548
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:12,660
 Then what are you supposed to have to happen?

549
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:14,160
 Hey, Mr. and Mrs. Aldrich.

550
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,160
 Hey, Dizzy.

551
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,660
 Dizzy, have you seen Henry?

552
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:18,660
 I've been trying to find him.

553
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:19,660
 Oh, my goodness.

554
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:21,660
 Maybe Middletown's kidnapper.

555
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:22,160
 Why?

556
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:25,360
 Boy, they were certainly very indignant when he won that race.

557
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,260
 I know who might know where he is.

558
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:28,760
 Who?

559
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:29,560
 The coach.

560
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,960
 He's down in the basement sneaking a smoke.

561
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,860
 Come on with me, Geraldine.

562
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:34,560
 Oh, I did.

563
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,960
 Will you come back and tell her?

564
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:38,560
 Look out for these stairs, Geraldine.

565
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,160
 Oh, did he?

566
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:41,660
 Do you think Middletell really has done anything to him?

567
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:43,360
 Come on around the landing here.

568
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,360
 If they've even touched them, we'll get them.

569
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,560
 Well, she lives.

570
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,760
 What's the matter?

571
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,260
 Do you see what I see?

572
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:51,960
 What?

573
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:55,960
 Henry! He's gone to sleep right here on the stairs.

574
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,960
 He's gone to sleep.

575
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:00,960
 Oh, so that's all he cared about bringing me.

576
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:01,960
 Hey, Henry.

577
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,960
 Don't wake him. I'm going upstairs.

578
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:04,960
 Hey, Henry!

579
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,960
 I'm going upstairs with any night, please.

580
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:12,960
 Henry, well, move over, Blam, tired too.

 [Music]

582
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:38,560
 Tomorrow night for dinner ladies and gentlemen, how about serving a dessert wonderfully easy to make?

583
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:41,560
 Yes and believe me mighty easy to take too.

584
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:45,560
 The dessert I'm thinking about, of course, is jello vanilla pudding.

585
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:50,560
 Served as is or mixed with bananas or any other fruits or nuts you may have, handy,

586
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:54,560
 jello vanilla pudding is a perfectly grand treat that the whole family will love,

587
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:57,560
 and they'll want to enjoy it again and again.

588
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,560
 It takes only a few brief moments to prepare.

589
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:02,560
 It's very simple and it's quite inexpensive.

590
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:05,560
 Yet few desserts, no matter how costly or complicated,

591
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:09,560
 can rival jello vanilla pudding for gratifying goodness.

592
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,560
 It has a flavor that is really swell,

593
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:16,560
 a rich delicate flavor that you'll find supreme for sheer satisfaction.

594
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:19,560
 So enjoy some jello vanilla pudding tomorrow,

595
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,560
 and try those other delicious jello puddings too.

596
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:25,560
 There are jello chocolate pudding and jello butterscotch pudding.

597
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:28,560
 You'll be delighted with their mellow creamy flavor,

598
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:32,560
 the flavor that has made jello puddings tops in taste.

 Did I tell you I'm going into partnership with another guy and buy a car?

607
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:24,320
 You don't say so yeah, here's the ad for it in the paper. It says

608
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,860

 but Henry Aldrich will be back on the air on Sunday night June 23 in place of Jack Benny.

615

 So remember, all summer long, Henry Aldrich will come to you on Sunday evenings at the same time

616

 and on the same station you now hear Jack Benny.
