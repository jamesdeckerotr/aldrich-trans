 But Mother, you don't see my point of view.

10
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,460
 Dear, that's the trouble I do see your point of view,

11
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:03,460
 but I don't think you're trying to see mine.

12
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:05,960
 Yes, I try very hard to see your point.

00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,060
 Just can't see it.

00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:20,260
 Henry, I realize you want to give Kathleen something nice for her birthday, but this...

18
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:23,260
 Henry, I still say you're entirely too young.

19
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:24,460
 Too young, mother.

00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:26,060
 You spend $12 and a half.

 Don't just see my point of view, dear, for the last time

 when a young man gives the young lady an expensive piece of jewelry,

24
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,660
 it usually carries some meaning with it.

25
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:36,660
 What meaning?

26
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:39,260
 You mean she'd be insulted because it's not gold?

27
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:40,560
 I mean, dear.

28
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,760
 I think you should take it back to the jewelry store

29
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,760

 You do?

43
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,700
 Yeah, but I can't tell you.

44
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,300
 I've gotten enough of much of that.

00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,500
 I've got ears. I've got ears.

 Hello.

51
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,500
 Yes, not too bad.

52
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,700
 Maybe that's why he's buying you such a swell.

00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:38,500
 I mean...

00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,300
 Is he trying to even give me something?

00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,100
 Yes.

56
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:43,300
 And I don't think it'll be too big for your wrist.

00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,100

00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,300
 It's for my wrist?

00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:48,100
 She was not planning to tell you the whole thing.

00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,340
 I have an explainer's idea what it is though.

61

 Sure you have. Sure you have.

00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:53,860
 You just said yourself it was a bracelet.

 I'll bet you didn't know what kind it is.

 Now, then, Mr. Roberts, I'm sorry we were interrupted.

 Mr. Roberts, what I want granted is a complete right-of-way.

87
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,280
 I agree. But I think they should give you something.

 They forgive a girl a piece of jewelry.

 No, sir. I'm sorry to say we haven't.

 Nothing for you to be sorry about, you should be glad you don't have any children.

 Well, what's your problem?

 We have a son in high school, Steve, and he's a parent and a plan to give some girl.

 I didn't hear it, it cost around $12. And you feel you ought to give her something better?

98
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:33,780
 No, because all it feels is too much.

 I don't know.

 Why would she?

 That's exactly what I told my wife.

 And if he tells you so, I'll ask him to answer.

00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,200
 Don't you think she's sort of a movie?

176
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,200
 Who, Kathleen?

177
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:37,200
 Listen, Homer, Kathleen has one of the most cheerful dispositions of any girl I've ever known.

178
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,200
 Sure, I agree with you.

179
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,200
 And then the next minute she can kick your right off her friend porch.

180
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,200
 Listen, let's have an understanding.

181
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,200
 Why here at this corner?

182
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,200
 Which way are you turning?

183
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,200
 Which way are you?

184
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,200
 I'm going right down this street here.

185
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,120
 the street here. Alright, I'll come along.

186
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:53,320
 Are you going to the center of those jewelry store?

187
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,680
 How do you know I am?

188
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,880
 She was, I just recognized the package.

189
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,720
 What are you going in there for?

190
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,400
 Never mind. Never mind.

191
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,360
 Are you taking Kathleen's bracelet into Heaven and Grave?

192
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,440
 Listen, whoever told you I got our bracelet.

193
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,200
 I get around, Henry.

194
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:12,280
 And do you know where I could buy one for Agnes for less than $12.5?

195
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,680
 Homer, for the last time, will you please run along?

196
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,080
 I'm going into the store.

197
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,720
 Don't you want me to come in with you?

198
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,720
 No, now go away! Go away Homer!

199
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,320
 You know, Henry, you're moodier than Kathleen!

200
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,720
 And don't hang around outside that window!

201
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,720
 Something I can help you young man?

202
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,720
 Yes sir, I want to have a little talk with you.

203
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,720
 Yes sir, you're the young fellow who bought that very beautiful silver hand-rot bracelet.

204
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,720
 Yes, could we step back here a ways?

205
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,720
 I beg your pardon?

206
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,720
 Well, I brought this bracelet back because...

207
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,720
 Well you see...

208
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,720
 Is there something wrong with it?

209
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,720
 No, there isn't anything wrong with it.

210
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,720
 But when I got home, my mother...

211
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,520
 That is, she had some bad news for me.

212
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,320
 You mean your mother doesn't want you to keep it?

213
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,820
 No, it isn't that.

214
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,320
 You see my girl...

215
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,620
 You see it this way.

216
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:57,420
 Doesn't she like it?

217
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,620
 She hasn't even seen it.

218
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,120
 Oh, she's gone away?

219
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,420
 Why?

220
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:02,820
 In a way, she has.

221
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:05,020
 Well, that bracelet will be a nice surprise for her.

222
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:06,420
 Here, I'll wrap it up and send it to her.

223
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,020
 Oh, no, you can't do a thing like that.

224
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:09,020
 Why not?

225
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:10,020
 Why?

226
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:12,020
 It's too late.

227
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:14,020
 My mother says the way things are now.

228
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,820
 It wouldn't be right for me to give it to her.

229
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,820
 Oh, she's marrying someone else, eh?

230
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:20,020
 Well, why not give her wedding presents?

231
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:21,020
 A wedding present?

232
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:23,220
 How about that percolator up there for three more dollars?

233
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,220
 Oh, no!

234
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:26,420
 I wouldn't want her to give her a thing like that.

235
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:28,420
 I think I'd just like to get my money back.

236
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:29,220
 Your money back?

237
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,420
 Well, before we do anything as rash as all that,

238
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:33,020
 have you seen these ladies' rings?

239
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:35,320
 They look just like diamonds, imported precious stones

240
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,420
 from Denver, and I challenge you to tell the difference

241
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:38,620
 between these and diamonds.

242
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,620
 But-- couldn't I have my money back?

243
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:47,620
 (music)

244
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:50,960
 Will you have some salary or who?

245
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,300
 No, thank you, Gary.

246
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,780
 Now, what was it you started to tell me about Mr. O'Rourke?

247
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:56,820
 Well, I was in this office today, see?

248
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:59,060
 And his wife calls and she's all upset.

249
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:02,460
 They've got a boy in high school and wants to give this girl some kind of a piece of jewelry,

250
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,860
 and she doesn't think he should.

251
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:05,500
 Well, I certainly agree with her.

252
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,620
 You agree with her?

253
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:09,420
 What's wrong with the boy giving this girl a birthday present if he wants to?

254
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:11,180
 That's because you've never had any children.

255
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,940
 What do you mean I've never had any children?

256
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:14,140
 You've never had any either.

257
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:17,100
 But I'm a woman.

258
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:20,740
 And Gary, it isn't necessary for you to point out every at me.

259
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:22,020
 I'm not pointing at you.

260
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:24,140
 I just want to know what's wrong with a kid doing it.

261
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:25,100
 What's wrong with it?

262
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,740
 He just isn't done, that's all.

263
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:29,260
 Who said so? Who passed the law that says it isn't done?

264
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:33,420
 Gary, in the first place, any present from a boy means a great deal to a girl.

265
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:34,540
 Let alone you.

266
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:35,980
 Why should it mean anything?

267
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:39,280
 Do you remember on my 15th birthday when you gave me some handkerchief?

268
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,080
 Handkerchief. What's that got to do with it?

269
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,880
 Well, we got married, didn't we?

270
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,980
 Is that what did it?

271
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:49,480
 Gary, for the last time, stop shaking that curry in my face.

272
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:59,780
 Oh, Mary!

273
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:00,680
 What, Mary?

274
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,780
 I speak here for one minute.

275
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:05,280
 It's about only a second. What is it, Henry?

276
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:09,520
 Well, look, are you keep something in your hat from not bother mother about it?

277
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:12,240
 I guess so. Didn't you pass no of your subjects this year?

278
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,160
 Yes, sure. But I was downtown just now and a man. I mean...

279
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:21,440
 Well, how would you like to buy a nice 12-dollar and a half bracelet?

280
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,000
 Gee. Why Henry, oh, which way did you get there?

281
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 No, don't wave it around like that. Listen, I'll show up to you for $10.

282
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,280
 I haven't got $10.

283
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,120
 Uh-huh. Have you got mine?

284
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,760
 No. No. How about eight?

285
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,760
 Henry, I have a gunny dollar, I broke!

286
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,760
 But, gee!

287
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,760
 Gee whiz.

288
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,760
 Whoa, look!

289
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,760
 As long as you can't buy it, Mary.

290
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,760
 You see anything against my giving a thing like this is a present?

291
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,760
 Sorry, Henry, that's awfully sweet of you!

292
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,760
 No, wait a minute, Mary, give it back to me!

293
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,760
 I didn't mean it!

294
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,760
 I was just asking you a hypercritical question!

295
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,760
 You mean you're taking it back?

296
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,760
 I haven't even got seven dollars!

297
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,760
 Henry!

298
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,760
 Yes, you know, Mary!

299
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,760
 Would you please come here a minute?

300
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,760
 Why?

301
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,760
 Yes, you're in just a second!

302
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,360
 You're very Holistarn thing.

303
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,360
 Henry, I want you to bring that bracelet right along with you.

304
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,360
 You do?

305
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,660
 Hi, do you...

306
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:11,160
 Look, Mother, I'm not disobeying you.

307
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:14,260
 I just thought maybe you know you would like to buy it and keep it in the family.

308
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:16,860
 Yeah, I thought you told me you returned that bracelet.

309
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:17,760
 No, Mother.

310
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,260
 What I told you was I took it down to the jewelry store.

311
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:21,760
 But the follow was so nice to me,

312
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,260
 said I thought I was making a great mistake and not keeping it.

313
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:27,160
 See, do you tell him I said you were to get your money back?

314
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,160
 Yeah, sure.

315
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,360
 And he said you probably neckwipped very well.

316
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:38,360
 But he said you didn't know what was going on in the world. He said what? She said phones give a girl present like that. Like this one every day in the year.

317
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:43,360
 Henry, I want you to take that bracelet and go down to that jewelry store and get your money back at once.

318
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:49,360
 Letting think our whole family's old-fashioned. I don't care about anything. Now please go. Yes mother.

319
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:54,360
 As a matter of fact, I think he took advantage of you. Of me. How do anyone take advantage of me?

320
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,160
 - Hi, Chris. - Yes, Sam.

321
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,960
 - Siddin' Marshall was just on the phone.

322
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:00,660
 Have you been spreading Henry's problem all around town?

323
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,460
 - No, Sam. I give you my word.

324
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:04,860
 I hadn't even mentioned it to anyone, except Harriet.

325
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:07,860
 [cheering]

326
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:10,860
 [music playing]

327
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:16,960
 - So will you give me six dollars for it?

328
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,960
 - Do I have to pay the whole six dollars?

329
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:19,960
 Will cash?

330
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,860
 You mean, you want a little time on it?

331
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:23,860
 She just goes for closing in an hour, Homer.

332
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,860
 And I've got to get Kathleen something for a birthday.

333
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:27,860
 I just can't.

334
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:30,860
 She may be pretty disappointed if she doesn't get this bracelet.

335
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:32,860
 All of them so much as mentioned it, too.

336
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:33,860
 No.

337
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:34,860
 They know you have it.

338
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:35,860
 Have a hunch.

339
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:37,860
 A very story, hunch.

340
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:41,860
 This bracelet is what she's looking forward to getting just the sport.

341
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,860
 For, I think this would be crazy about her, Homer.

342
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:47,860
 I know, but you know what, but the second time, he said there was war.

343
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,860
 And even then they made it a war.

344
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,860
 And even then they may not make them.

345
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:52,860
 Why?

346
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:53,860
 That isn't the point.

 Yes, he apparently did.

 He said he's going back downtown in just a few minutes

355
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:21,280
 a few minutes and see whether he can find a nice present for Kathleen for four

356
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:26,060

357
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:30,060
 whole thing is a tempest and it's a pot now Sam. It's all the boys in town are

358
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:34,060
 apparently doing it. Can I tell you about Homer? He's giving Agnes a bracelet

359
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:38,300
 exactly like the one Henry was going to give Kathleen. Really? And Homer's folks

360
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:42,420
 don't have Jeff? No Alice. Homer's father agreed with me. What's wrong with this?

361
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:46,500
 Well don't get Henry all upset again. He's come round to our point of view and

362
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,500
 taking the whole thing very nicely.

 That's more than that Harriet did.

364
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,500
 Just what was it she said when she phoned Sam?

365
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:58,500
 She said she just discussed the whole thing with her bridge club and they all agreed Henry shouldn't give Kathleen the bracelet.

366
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,500

376
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,560
 Well, we have some friends who have a boy and they had exactly the same problem you have

377
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:35,520
 You wanted to say every Sunday could make on a pair of hearings for some girls

378
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:38,800
 And do you know how his parents from him away from it?

379
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,460
 Oh, they send him on a trip to the Canadian Rockies and

380
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:49,640
 And hired a guy that took him into the woods, and he didn't even see a girl for a month.

381
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,940
 You don't say so.

382
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:56,640
 And like any normal boy, when they came out, he'd forgotten all about the girl and was crazy about the guy.

 Of course, you can't send Henry that far. The government doesn't want to travel.

00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:58,860
 Would they be classified as jewelry?

 The only thing is, he said I should get his money back.

 He's in a very embarrassing situation, see?

00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:09,900
 Yeah, I know all about it.

00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:04,460
 I'm not talking, Mother.

00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:06,540
 I just don't feel like talking to anybody.

00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:07,860
 Vidi, what were all those phone calls

553
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:09,420
 you've been taking for the last couple of hours?

554
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:11,420
 Frankly, Bob, they were all things of ours.

555
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:14,460
 What did you know if we were really going to let Kathleen accept that phrase?

00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:15,500
 Oh my goodness!

00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:16,220
 Now Kathleen!

00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:18,140
 The gold ride is nobody's business but ours!

559
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:21,260
 For a matter of fact, I think it shows a very healthy interest.

 Well, they heard this afternoon somehow,

00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:28,620
 that Homer's planning to give Agnes an expensive bracelet to...

00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:29,900
 What standard are they taking?

00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:33,580
 But to tell the truth, Bob, the Lawson family is split wide open.

566
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:35,820
 What should they against? The bracelet or Homer?

 The only thing is, before I give it to you,

588
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:11,660
 I want to tell you something.

 Well Henry, first, before you tell me anything, I feel...

590
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,360
 I ought to say something to you.

00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,360
 You do?

 Yes, my dear.

 Will you step out here to the front hole, please?

 Yes, my dear.

00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,360
 Only I think you're unnecessarily worried because I give you my words.

 I haven't accused you of anything.

00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,960
 I simply want to speak to you.

 What about Mother?

607

00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:13,960
 Well, I tell you a week.

 Why don't we just wait?

 You really have to do anything like that, Henry.

 Well, Henry, sometimes when a boy gives a girl some meat,

616
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,360
 completely misunderstood.

617
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,960
 You know what I mean?

618
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:25,960
 It is.

619
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:29,800
 But if a girl is sensible and realizes that it's just a presence without any special

620
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,160
 settlement connected with it,

621
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,260
 she's just a saying, Kathleen.

622
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:33,560
 I think...

623
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:36,260
 No, I don't think I'd better give you this.

00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:39,260
 Henry Orgage, you mean I got to make your give me that?

625
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:40,260
 You mean you're gonna take a...

 Henry, I can hardly wait to open this!

 I don't think you're gonna like it though!

 Oh yes I will!

00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:50,260
 Oh and I know what you've done, you put it in this big box, just hold me.

 It really isn't a bracelet?

 And would you write something on the fly, please?
