 Postum presents Henry, Henry Oldrich, coming mother.

 The Oldrich family written by Clifford Goldsmith.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,100
 At attainment for all the family,

6
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,760
 brought to you by Postam,

7
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:33,600
 attempting wholesome drink for all the family.

8
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,440
 Postam.

9
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,020
 (upbeat music)

10
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:52,580
 Well friends, here it is another Thursday night,

11
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:55,420
 an opportunity is knocking loudly at your door

12
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:56,840
 and knocking twice.

13
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:01,720
 First, it's your opportunity to put away your worries and cares for a half hour and relax

14
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:05,060
 and laugh with those grand people, the Aldrich family.

15
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:09,540
 And second, it's your opportunity to find out something about that equally grand mealtime

16
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,100
 drink postem.

17
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,200
 While even in looks, friends, postem is a winner.

18
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,500
 The kind of drink you don't waste a second tilting to your lips.

19
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:20,580
 It has the kind of flavor you refer to in italics.

20
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:25,340
 It has the kind of hearty, robust goodness that warms the cockles of your heart.

21
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:29,540
 But just don't expect when you try it that Postam is going to taste like coffee any more

22
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:32,380
 than you'd expect coffee to taste like tea.

23
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:36,260
 Remember that Postam's distinctive flavor is in a class apart.

24
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:41,020
 It has an extra special goodness of its own that leaves you no words for description but

25
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:43,620
 ah, and ah again.

26
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:48,180
 And then don't be surprised if you enjoy your meals far more than you did before the day

27
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:49,780
 you start enjoying Postam.

28
00:01:49,780 --> 00:02:09,280
 [Music]

29
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:14,780
 Boys like Penrod Scofield, Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn live in our memories because they

30
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:17,860
 They typify the teenage youngsters all of us know.

31
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:22,020
 And Henry Aldrich is another of these real American boys.

32
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:25,660
 He lives in your block, perhaps in your own home.

33
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:27,860
 The scene opens in the Aldrich living room.

34
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,260
 - But Mary, what have I done?

35
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:31,140
 - You know very well what you've done, Henry Aldrich.

36
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,700
 You know very well what you've done.

37
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:33,540
 - When?

38
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:34,860
 - Didn't you and Homer ask the whole crowd here

39
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,140
 to our house for a Valentine party Saturday night?

40
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,220
 - Sure, we even sent out written invitations.

41
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:41,580
 - But, Henry, that's the night I'm having my party.

42
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,100
 - Mary, how could you have a party?

43
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:45,600
 Oh my goodness Henry, I've been planning on it for six weeks.

44
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,600
 On a party?

45
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,100
 Yes, for my sorority.

46
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,600
 Oh, all right, Mary, can't you meet at some other house?

47
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:54,600
 Henry, mother says it's my party and I can have it here at our house and I'm not to budge an inch.

48
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,600
 I know, but Mary.

49
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,600
 Henry, you're well done with telephones.

50
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,600
 Yes, mother, I'll be there just as soon as I get something straightened out.

51
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,600
 Mary, how about our invitations?

52
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,600
 What are Homer and I gonna do?

53
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,600
 I'm sure I don't know. You can have your party at Homer's house.

54
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,600
 But Mary!

55
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,600
 But Mary!

56
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,600
 Hello?

57
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,600
 Hello, Henry, this is Agnes.

58
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,600
 Who?

59
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:18,600
 No, I was just going to call and see whether he's over at your house. There's something I have to seem about right away.

60
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,600
 Well, Henry, we're all looking forward to your party Saturday night.

61
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,600
 You're?

62
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:27,600
 And I was just wondering whether you'd mind calling Lillian Spencer and asking her to come.

63
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,600
 Lillian Spencer?

64
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,600
 She'd have an awfully good time, Henry.

65
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,600
 But Agnes, I wasn't.

66
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,600
 What do you mean by that?

67
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:36,600
 Well, besides one reason I'd rather not even mention, I'm not speaking to Lillian.

68
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,600
 That's all right. I'd be glad to call her.

69
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,600
 But Agnes, Agnes, that'll make 13.

70
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,600
 I'm gonna make 13.

71
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,600
 Henry!

72
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,600
 Yes, Mary.

73
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,600
 Just a second, Agnes.

74
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,600
 Homer's here.

75
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,600
 Well, tell him to come here quick.

76
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,600
 Agnes.

77
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,600
 Agnes.

78
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,600
 She was.

79
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,600
 Hey, Henry.

80
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:55,600
 I was just open to the bakery and loaded four dozen donuts.

81
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,600
 Homer.

82
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:00,600
 Homer, why couldn't we throw the party at your house?

83
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,600
 Why?

84
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:05,600
 Well, your house is a lot nearer the center of town, Homer, and your heating system's a

85
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,600
 lot better than ours.

86
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:10,400
 Now listen, Henry, don't you remember the last party we threw at my house?

87
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,640
 Homer, that was just due to an unfortunate series of circumstances.

88
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:16,320
 Even so, my father hasn't gotten over it yet.

89
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,400
 But Homer, let me tell you.

90
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,080
 We're giving a party Saturday night,

91
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,440
 and it doesn't want to be at your house,

92
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,880
 and it doesn't want to be at mine.

93
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,880
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

94
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:36,320
 But, Mother, why not look at it this way?

95
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,400
 I'm sorry, dear.

96
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,280
 Alex, if you see that piece of paper, I add.

97
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,200
 What was it, Sam?

98
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,920
 It was a list of the members of the Rotorich Club.

99
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,760
 Father, do you have any ideas as to how we could manage him?

100
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,360
 Henry, I haven't time to talk about anything.

101
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,640
 Now I've got to go find that list.

102
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,840
 But Mr. Aldrich...

103
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,320
 Henry, I'm sorry, but you may not have your party here.

104
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,680
 Please go answer the telephone.

105
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,600
 Yes, Mother.

106
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,000
 Henry, what are we gonna do?

107
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,280
 I don't know, Homer. Why do you keep asking me?

108
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,160
 Because I ordered the donuts in my name.

109
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,120
 Hello?

110
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,120
 Hello, Henry. This is Kathleen.

111
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,280
 Oh, hello.

112
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,920
 I just wanted to tell you the good news.

113
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,440
 What?

114
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,920
 I don't suppose I should tell you, but I got a new evening dress for your party.

115
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,920
 You did?

116
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,920
 An evening?

117
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,320
 But Kathleen, it's gonna be informal.

118
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,320
 Oh no! Agnes found all of us instead of it had been changed.

119
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,720
 Where to wear long dresses?

120
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,520
 Agnes, please?

121
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,320
 Yes, Henry, and I just wanted to tell you, I'm looking forward to coming.

122
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:24,920
 Goodbye!

123
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,720
 But Kathleen!

124
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,120
 Kathleen!

125
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,520
 What's the matter, Henry?

126
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,320
 Agnes is having them all dress up.

127
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,520
 Who gave her any authority like that?

128
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,320
 You know, Henry, what we've got to do.

129
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:34,720
 Why?

130
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,520
 Something about the number 13.

131
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,960
 Either we've got to get rid of one of our guests or you or I have got to drop out.

132
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,280
 Now listen Homer, you're not gonna leave me flat.

133
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,240
 Well, we're just making a generous offer, Henry.

134
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,560
 I know.

135
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,600
 Why not call Agnes and see whether she'd have any suggestions?

136
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,560
 And what what?

137
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,680
 Well, as long as she's showing so much interest, she might be very glad to have our party at her house.

138
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,280
 Now listen, Homer, we're not gonna get Agnes any more mixed up in this than she is.

139
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,560
 Henry, didn't you ever taste the lemon meringue pie her mother makes?

140
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:04,960
 Yes.

141
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,640
 And there you are. Let me call her.

142
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,280
 But Homer, hello.

143
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,040
 Number please.

144
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,040
 L9-7-1-7.

145
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,640
 L9-7-1-7.

146
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,800
 Homer, how do you know her mother will make any paw?

147
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,320
 Henry, why worry about that detail when you don't even

148
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,000
 have a roof over your party?

149
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,960
 Hello?

150
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,080
 Hello, is this-- is this Agnes?

151
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,880
 Yes, Homer, and I'm glad you call.

152
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:24,560
 You are?

153
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,640
 Yes, I want you to go right over to Andy Martin's

154
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,960
 and get all of his records.

155
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:28,720
 What for?

156
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,040
 But the party's out at E-Nite, at Henry's.

157
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,840
 At Henry's?

158
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,360
 Yes, aren't you taking me?

159
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,840
 Well, as a matter of fact, Agnes, that's

160
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,160
 what I really called you up about.

161
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,920
 Supposing, supposing it's raining real hard that night.

162
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,760
 - What about it?

163
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:45,560
 - Well, you wouldn't wanna go out in it, would you?

164
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,920
 I mean, if it was practically the worst storm

165
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,200
 we've had all season.

166
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,440
 - What made you think of that?

167
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,000
 - You can't tell Agnes,

168
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,920
 suppose it even turned to Sleeved and Frodo's right on you.

169
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,920
 - Oh, my, I'll go out of it, yes, that.

170
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,720
 - Well, I'm glad you'd be sensible

171
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,080
 because I've got a wonderful solution.

172
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,680
 We're all coming over to your house.

173
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,520
 - What's that?

174
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,640
 - Ask her about the pie holder.

175
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:07,440
 The home of the invitation said the party was to be at the Aldrich's.

176
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,440
 But Agnes, why not look at it this way?

177
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,040
 Now listen Homer Brown!

178
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:23,240
 I wonder why she doesn't come to the door.

179
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:27,440
 You know Homer, something tells me we're going to be sorry we're having the party at Agnes's house.

180
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,740
 Henry will have a wonderful turn and it was very nice of Agnes.

181
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:33,140
 But why do we have to come over a day early?

182
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:35,340
 because she said we had to come and make the plan.

183
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:36,860
 Sure, that's what I mean.

184
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:39,580
 Homer, we know what the inside of her house looks like.

185
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:40,100
 Hello!

186
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,000
 Hi, Agnes.

187
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,500
 Hello.

188
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,340
 Come on in.

189
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:44,260
 My goodness, I'm so excited.

190
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:44,980
 Yeah?

191
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:47,940
 First of all, I've got a lot of ideas about things for us to eat.

192
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:50,640
 Agnes, so far as the refreshments are concerned,

193
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,220
 Homer and I have taken care of everything,

194
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,220
 but the lemon meringue pie.

195
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:55,540
 But Henry, what do you have in you?

196
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:56,780
 Ginger, Ellen, don't know.

197
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:57,780
 Don't know.

198
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:59,500
 Sure.

199
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,100
 We just ordered four dozens.

200
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:01,980
 Four dozens?

201
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:02,620
 Sure.

202
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:04,380
 But my goodness, four dozen!

203
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,080
 Why didn't you say that isn't so many?

204
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,680
 As a matter of fact, I was just thinking we ought to double the order.

205
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,340
 Sure.

206
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:11,180
 For boys, I don't like donut.

207
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,080
 But I do.

208
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,220
 All right, my goodness, why worry over a little thing like donut?

209
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:17,960
 Naturally, we can decide to sing like that later on.

210
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,500
 Now here's the living room.

211
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,500
 Oh, yes.

212
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,100
 Yes.

213
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:25,300
 The first thing you want to do is move the piano down to the other end of the room.

214
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:25,900
 Move it?

215
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:26,540
 Move it.

216
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:27,600
 Yes, and you might as well--

217
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,640
 [LAUGHTER]

218
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:31,340
 Why tell my mother to bake a couple of cakes?

219
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:32,840
 In case we don't have donuts.

220
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,640
 What's that?

221
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,340
 In addition to the lemon meringue.

222
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:35,840
 Of course.

223
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,240
 Oh, she was agus.

224
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,440
 Naturally, I'd move your piano anyplace you want.

225
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,540
 That's so alive.

226
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:43,840
 And Agnes, are we glad you can come to our party here?

227
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,340
 Well, thanks, fellas.

228
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:47,740
 It was definitely very nice of you to ask me.

229
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,040
 And would you do me a favor?

230
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:49,540
 Sure.

231
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:50,040
 Sure.

232
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:50,540
 What is it?

233
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:53,540
 Would you mind if I asked Gerdie Parker to come Saturday night?

234
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:55,640
 She doesn't get invited to many parties.

235
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,640
 Gerdie Parker.

236
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,840
 Gerdie Parker?

237
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,440
 Oh, boy.

238
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,440
 I'm glad you mentioned her.

239
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,740
 I'll call her right now.

240
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,340
 Listen, Homer, who mentioned her?

241
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:07,800
 But, Henry, why should you object to Gerdy Parker when you're getting a wonderful room like this thrown in with her?

242
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,240
 Come on, let's move the piano.

243
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,080
 Okay, but my heart is minute.

244
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:11,740
 Push!

245
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:13,120
 Push yourself!

246
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,040
 Keep your going.

247
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:14,740
 Push!

248
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:16,740
 Now, wait a second, Henry.

249
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:18,040
 That's what I say.

250
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:22,740
 Oh, Homer, after we get this taken care of, how about our moving that picture that's on the wall?

251
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:23,840
 What's the matter with it?

252
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,340
 That's Agnes' father.

253
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,140
 It is?

254
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:27,040
 Sure.

255
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,540
 Come on and push.

256
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:29,840
 Push yourself!

257
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:29,920
 (

258
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,760
 She was...

259
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,600
 Boys!

260
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,760
 May I ask just what you think you're doing?

261
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,480
 Wait, uh,

262
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,560
 all muscles are awesome.

263
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,720
 Henry Oldridge, I'd like to ask you again.

264
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,560
 What you're doing?

265
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,640
 Wait, we're just...

266
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,160
 We're just...

267
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,680
 We're getting ready for the party.

268
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,320
 What party?

269
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,160
 Hours!

270
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,080
 Here!

271
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:47,960
 And you heard?

272
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:51,120
 And we want you to know Mrs. Lawson, we're very grateful.

273
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,640
 Boys, will you both please leave this house?

274
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,680
 Yes, ma'am.

275
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,960
 Without...

276
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,000
 Without...

277
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,760
 Well, she was.

278
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,960
 And I have a good notion to call both your parents.

279
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,760
 Oh, you don't have to bother about anything like that.

280
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,760
 We're going right away, Mrs. Lawson.

281
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,760
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

282
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:15,920
 Kathleen, tell me once more.

283
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,960
 When you called Henry, just what did he say?

284
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:21,240
 I miss he said he had no desire, whatever, to discuss the matter.

285
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,640
 And he said that I tried to boss their whole party?

286
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,320
 Yes, I miss.

287
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,760
 That's exactly what he said.

288
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,960
 But I don't see why you should blame me, Kathleen, for something my mother did.

289
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,760
 When I stuck up for you, I told him you didn't mean to be bossing.

290
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,560
 My goodness, I was never so embarrassed in my life.

291
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,760
 I'll never be able to face Homer again.

292
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:39,760
 I know, but I don't know why Henry should be so mad at me.

293
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,760
 At least, Kathleen, I did one thing.

294
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,560
 The minute I realized my mother wouldn't bake anything for them,

295
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,060
 I called the bakery and doubled their order for donut.

296
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:47,760
 Really?

297
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,760
 And Kathleen, as a matter of fact, I have an idea.

298
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,260
 What is it?

299
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:52,660
 First, where's your telephone?

300
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,160
 My goodness, when I get through,

301
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,480
 Henry and Homer will come around

302
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,680
 unbended knees and apologize.

303
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,260
 (upbeat music)

304
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:08,800
 - Hello.

305
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,760
 - Doesn't she answer?

306
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,200
 - I'm ringing your number.

307
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,840
 - Homer, when you went back to gift your hat,

308
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,400
 what did Mrs. Lawson say?

309
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,680
 - She didn't say anything.

310
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,520
 She wouldn't even let me in.

311
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,680
 - Well, I can tell you one thing.

312
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,840
 I'm never gonna darken the Lawson door again.

313
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,720
 and I hope you don't think I'm going to.

314
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,960
 I'm ringing your number.

315
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,720
 Thank you.

316
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,040
 Henry, when you see your mother, tell her I found the list.

317
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:27,800
 So what, Father?

318
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,120
 The list of bembers of the Rotary Club I was looking for.

319
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:30,920
 Hello?

320
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,920
 Well, she was-- oh, Anne Harriet.

321
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:33,800
 This is Henry.

322
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,680
 Hello, Henry.

323
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,320
 What is it you want?

324
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,920
 I've got to get back to the kitchen.

325
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,520
 Anne Harriet, how would you like to--

326
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,960
 how would you--

327
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,760
 how do you got a full day Saturday?

328
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,280
 No, not especially.

329
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,280
 Did your mother want me to come over for dinner?

330
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,600
 Well, if I could arrange it, could you?

331
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,200
 But what did you call me for?

332
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:53,300
 I wanted to know whether I could borrow something.

333
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,100
 What?

334
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:54,900
 Your house.

335
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:55,900
 What's that?

336
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,500
 [LAUGHTER]

337
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:00,100
 And Harriet, I have to give a party that evening, see?

338
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,700
 And, Gee, if I could arrange it so you wouldn't have to be there,

339
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,200
 Aunt Harriet, would you be interested?

340
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,100
 Why, I might.

341
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:05,600
 You might.

342
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,300
 Oh, boy.

343
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,600
 I'll let you have the party at my house, Henry, provided you

344
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,800
 don't invite that awful home of Brown.

345
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,800
 Oh, what an Harriet!

 Yes!

 Well, this is Agnes Lawson.

 Oh, my, yes.

 We have beautiful equipment downstairs right off the Sunday school room.

00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,800
 Well, could you serve a little Valentine's supper tomorrow night?

361
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,300
 Well, I guess we could.

362
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,300
 Hey, Ms. Henry and Homer had many money.

363
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:43,800
 Happily.

364
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,800
 Just a minute, Mrs. Tomkins.

365
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:49,260
 Kathleen, the food they serve wherever they have it is going to cost something, isn't it?

366
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:49,760
 Yes.

367
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,800
 Then why not let it go towards the church and make it worthwhile?

368
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,300
 Alright.

369
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,500
 Hello, Mr. Tompkins.

370
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,300
 Hello.

371
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:59,600
 Do you suppose you could serve something that wouldn't cost hardly anything?

372
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,400
 Oh, I guess we could.

373
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:06,000
 Something as simple as a bowl of soup and maybe sandwiches and a rice pudding.

374
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,700
 Yes.

375
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:09,400
 Well, we're awfully anxious to raise some money for the new organ.

376
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,700
 And I'm sure the ladies will be more than glad to.

377
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:21,700
 [music]

378
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,700
 Hello?

379
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,700
 Hello? Is this Miss Harriet Bryan?

380
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:26,200
 Yes.

381
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,700
 Harriet, this is Mrs. Thompson.

382
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:28,700
 Oh, yes, hello.

383
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,700
 Say, I've got some good news about people organ.

384
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:31,700
 The organ?

385
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,700
 Yes, the one we're raising money for is the truth.

386
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:37,700
 Oh, a young lady just phoned and wanted to know whether we could have a little dinner for her, a little party tomorrow night.

387
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,700
 Good, how many are you going to serve?

388
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:42,660
 I told her it wouldn't be worth our while unless we had at least 40.

389
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:43,340
 Good.

390
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:45,740
 And she said she'd see you, but there were at least that many.

391
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:47,500
 And she might be able to round up 50.

392
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,340
 Well, I'm awfully glad to hear that.

393
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:52,500
 That organ we have now bothers me every Sunday.

394
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,260
 And Harriet, do you suppose you can be one of the ladies of help, sir?

395
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:56,000
 Tomorrow night?

396
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,020
 Yes.

397
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:57,660
 Oh, I would.

398
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:59,020
 I'd be glad to only--

399
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:03,220
 Just this man has got through inviting some people over here for a party tomorrow night.

400
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:03,720
 Oh?

401
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:07,100
 Yes, I'm going to give a little surprise party for my nephew, Henry.

402
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,140
 I know he wants one.

403
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:08,980
 Oh.

404
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:10,980
 And I'm asking in quite a few.

405
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:14,480
 Mrs. Carbel said she could comment that wasn't too slippery for her bad leg.

406
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,380
 Really?

407
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:18,180
 And another person I'm going to ask is old Mr. Perkins.

408
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:19,380
 Henry, I like him.

409
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,080
 He's a lot of fun at the party.

410
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:21,780
 Good.

411
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:24,780
 And, uh, Miss Frederick, she hasn't been out all winter.

412
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:25,680
 Good!

413
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,180
 I'm just sorry that you can't be there yourself.

414
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:41,180
 [Music]

415
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:47,180
 Well, I'm afraid Ad Harreid and Henry have rather different ideas about who's welcome at a teenage boy's party.

416
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:53,180
 But something they probably would agree about is what makes the most welcome, hot drink at meal times.

417
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:55,180
 The answer is post them, of course.

418
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:57,180
 Millions of Americans will tell you that.

419
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:03,060
 In fact, it's because post-em is so popular, it's because every day more and more people

420
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:07,040
 are insisting on post-em that there's a temporary shortage.

421
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:11,500
 We just can't keep pace with the fast-growing demand, even though we're making more post-em

422
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,100
 today than ever before in our history.

423
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:18,820
 So if you can't always immediately get post-em when you ask for it at your grocers, don't

424
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,220
 be discouraged.

425
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:23,100
 Don't think your grocer isn't going to get any more post-em.

426
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,100
 He will.

427
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:27,660
 And as soon as he does get post them, you'll get it too.

428
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:38,260
 So be sure to ask for it again.

429
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:41,380
 Now getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldrich.

430
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:45,740
 Henry and Homer are trying to find a place to hold their party Saturday night.

431
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:50,100
 Meanwhile unknown to them, Agnes Lawson has arranged for them to hold it at the Methodist

432
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,100
 Church.

433
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:56,100
 And Aunt Harriet, also unknown to them, has decided to let them hold it at her house.

434
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:59,100
 The scene opens in the Aldrich living room.

435
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:03,100
 Hey, babe, would you please answer that phone?

436
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:05,100
 -Why? -Yes, please.

437
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:08,100
 Homer, would you mind answering it and just tell whoever it is I'm not here.

438
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:11,100
 Henry, I'm not going to be your personal ghost.

439
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:16,100
 But Homer, suppose the sadness is trying to get us again.

440
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:19,100
 Just tell her again, we're not speaking to her.

441
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:23,900
 Okay, if it's somebody wanting to know where we're going to have the party, I'll tell them it's slightly up in the air.

442
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:26,840
 Hello?

443
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,340
 Hello, is Mr. Aldrich there?

444
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:30,280
 Mr. Aldrich, why no, he isn't.

445
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:33,680
 Oh, well, when he comes in, could you please tell him that the mansion house phone...

446
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,160
 The mansion house? The mansion house hotel?

447
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,240
 Yes, I wanted to submit an estimate for his party, Saturday night.

448
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,280
 A party?

449
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:45,440
 Yes, I received word that he's planning a party for Saturday night, and I wanted to give him the figures for a private dining room.

450
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,520
 She was unplaining a party, but...

451
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,120
 Oh, are you Mr. Allridge?

452
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,320
 Yes, sir, only...

453
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,280
 Oh, you're the gentleman.

454
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,080
 Yes, sir.

455
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,760
 Well, I figured out an estimate for you.

456
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:57,960
 I know, but we can't afford anything that's going to cost as much as...

457
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,320
 Well, we just couldn't afford it, that's all.

458
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,880
 Well, this isn't going to cost so much.

459
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:02,520
 An answer?

460
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,440
 No, not at all.

461
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,560
 How much is it?

462
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,560
 Well, first, I'll have to know a little more.

463
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:09,960
 Would you want a fruit cup or tomato juice to begin with?

464
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:10,920
 What's that?

465
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:14,920
 I said, do you want a fruit cup or tomato juice?

466
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:17,920
 Why, Homer, what do you want a fruit cup or tomato juice?

467
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:18,920
 Now, who are you?

468
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:19,920
 We want to get a fart!

469
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,920
 [laughter]

470
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,920
 At the mansion house hotel.

471
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:23,920
 Oh.

472
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,920
 Could we have grape juice?

473
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,920
 Hello.

474
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,920
 Could we have grape juice?

475
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:28,920
 Yes, yes.

476
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,920
 You can have anything you want.

477
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,920
 We can't.

478
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:31,920
 We don't have anything you want.

479
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,920
 She would.

480
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:33,920
 How are you up on the side?

481
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:34,920
 What do you want?

482
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,920
 Oh.

483
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,920
 Take fruit cup.

484
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:37,920
 Hello.

485
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,920
 Oh, we'll take fruit cup.

486
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,920
 No, no, wait a minute.

487
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:41,920
 Henry, wait a minute.

488
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:42,920
 What's the matter?

489
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,320
 Okay, fruit cup.

490
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,560
 Hello?

491
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,920
 Fruit cup's okay.

492
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:47,920
 Yes, Mr. Olridge.

493
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:51,620
 Now would you want chicken patties with peas or lamb chops with limers?

494
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:54,320
 Well, that sounds all right.

495
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,320
 Which will it be?

496
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,120
 What?

497
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:58,520
 Chicken patties with peas or lamb chops with limers.

498
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,620
 Homer, how would you like some lamb chops?

499
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:02,920
 All right, with lots of mashed potatoes.

500
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:07,320
 Well, could we have lamb chops with mashed potatoes?

501
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,820
 Yes, of course, Mr. Olridge.

502
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,320
 Lamb chops with mashed potatoes.

503
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,120
 Lots of them.

504
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,720
 And how about limers?

505
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,720
 No, who wants lime if she was?

506
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,720
 Well, now about the dessert. What would you like?

507
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,720
 Well, what have you got?

508
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:24,720
 Well, we can give you almost any kind of pie, ice cream, French pastry, stewed fruit.

509
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,720
 Stewed fruit? Listen, Henry, I'm not going to eat any stewed fruit in my own party.

510
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,720
 Home a line a second. Homer, we can have any dessert we want.

511
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,720
 Anything? Sure. I've got an idea. Hello?

512
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,720
 Yes?

513
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,720
 Could we have pumpkin pie allomode?

514
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,720
 At the old fight, Henry.

515
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:46,180
 Well, I guess you could you'd like it served in separate dishes. No, just don't the whole works together

516
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:54,380
 Ask me about chocolate sauce. Oh, yes, would there be an extra charge or what chocolate sauce?

517
00:18:54,380 --> 00:19:01,520
 Chocolate sauce. Yes. Are you sure you should have chocolate sauce? Oh sure. Well, there might be a small charge

518
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:07,380
 Well, how much will the whole thing including it all come to? Well, just exactly how many are you having? Why?

519
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:11,040
 14 with Gertie Parker. What's that?

520
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:13,040
 I understood it was 200.

521
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,040
 200?

522
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:18,040
 I don't know where I got the idea, but that was the message that was left here for me.

523
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,040
 200?

524
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,040
 200 why Henry?

525
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:25,040
 Mr. Aldrich, I'm afraid that for 14 we'd have to charge you at least a dollar and a half of these.

526
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,040
 How much now what's happened?

527
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:30,040
 The only thing is, what do you wear?

528
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,040
 You can't afford it?

529
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:36,040
 Oh, it isn't that we can't afford it. It's just the...even when I wear my beans?

530
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:40,040
 Well, naturally I thought you wanted something rather nice.

531
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:43,640
 Oh, we do it, and I appreciate your offer only.

532
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,540
 Suppose I think it over.

533
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:46,540
 And you'll call me back?

534
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:49,740
 Yes, I may, but if you don't hear from me, don't worry.

535
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:51,840
 Well, thank you, Mr. Alrud, goodbye.

536
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,040
 And thank you.

537
00:19:53,040 --> 00:20:07,840
 But, mother, mother, we can't have a lot of fly-by night, young people who don't take anything seriously dancing around as well as sororities having a meeting here.

538
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,240
 My goodness, we have a deficit in the treasury as it is.

539
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,840
 But dear, I'm sure they wouldn't pay any attention to your deficit.

540
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:16,040
 But that isn't a point. Our president gets nervous with even just us there.

541
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:19,340
 Mary, I was simply wondering whether there isn't some way we can help your brother.

542
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:21,340
 - Brothers! - Yes, Sammy, you home?

543
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:22,840
 Yes, hello. Hello, Mary.

544
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:23,840
 Hello, Father.

545
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:24,640
 What's the matter with you?

546
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,340
 Nothing. Her sorority has a deficit.

547
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:30,940
 - Yeah? Any phone calls for me? - Not that I know of, dear.

548
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:33,040
 No. Isn't the mansion house phone?

549
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,440
 No, Sam. - No.

550
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:37,440
 Now, Sam, you don't have to start putting in phone calls the minute you get home.

551
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:42,240
 But Alice, I left word for them to let me know whether they could take care of our Rotorick Club bandwidth Saturday night.

552
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,440
 And we're expecting 200 guests.

553
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,440
 Hello?

554
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,240
 Number please.

555
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,240
 I want to...

556
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,440
 Elm 224.

557
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,940
 Elm 224?

558
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:50,640
 If you please.

559
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,840
 Sam, do you have any ideas as to where Henry could get his party?

560
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:54,740
 Why not right here?

561
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:55,940
 Father, Sam!

562
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:56,640
 Hello?

563
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:56,940
 Hello?

564
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:57,840
 Is this the mansion house?

565
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,240
 Yes.

566
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,440
 Well, listen to the roll-rich.

567
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,240
 Oh, yes, yes, Mr. Roll-rich.

568
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,940
 I was wondering whether you'd call me.

569
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,540
 Did I say I'd call you?

570
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:06,040
 Well, I understood you would.

571
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,040
 Oh, I'm sorry, I thought it was the other way around.

572
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,040
 Have you finally decided to go ahead with your party?

573
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:13,040
 Oh, yes, definitely. The question is, can you take care of us?

574
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,540
 I don't know why or not. There's nothing complicated about it.

575
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,540
 Good. Then I don't have anything to worry about.

576
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:19,540
 No, not a thing. You just leave it to us.

577
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:21,540
 And on second thought, Mr. Aldrich,

578
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:24,540
 there won't be any extra charge for the chocolate sauce.

579
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:27,040
 For the why? For the chocolate sauce.

580
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,540
 Oh, that won't.

581
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:30,040
 Well, that's fine. That's fine.

582
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,540
 - Goodbye. - Goodbye.

583
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,540
 - Alice! - Yes, thanks!

584
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:35,540
 But everything all fixed.

585
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:36,540
 And what do you think?

586
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:38,540
 They're throwing in the chocolate sauce.

587
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:39,540
 For what?

588
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:41,540
 I don't know, but it's very nice of them to give it to us.

589
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:42,540
 Well, isn't that fine?

590
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:46,540
 Yes, sir. I've been hoping we'd be able to have our banquet at the mansion house.

591
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:50,540
 And you know, Alice, I didn't tell you before, but this year it's going to be a bit more important than usual.

592
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:51,540
 In what way?

593
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:55,540
 Well, I've heard a rumor that they're going to nominate me for president.

594
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:57,540
 Really? Well, dear, you deserve it.

595
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:58,540
 Yeah?

596
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:00,540
 No wonder you want everything to be especially nice.

597
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:02,540
 Everything was especially nice about what, Mother?

598
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:03,960
 - Henry, I'm glad you came into the room.

599
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,700
 Kathleen and Agnes stopped me on the street

600
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,660
 and said they'd been trying to get you for two days.

601
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:08,500
 - I did.

602
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,460
 - They did Mr. Aldrich.

603
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:11,100
 Did they seem apologetic?

604
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,860
 - They said I wasn't anything for you to worry about

605
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:13,980
 and they'd be seeing you

606
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:15,900
 at the Methodist Church tomorrow night.

607
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,820
 - At the Methodist Church, what for?

608
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:19,460
 - I wonder what's going on over there.

609
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:20,620
 (audience laughing)

610
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:21,980
 - I don't know anything more about it

611
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:23,060
 than what I've just told you.

612
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:24,140
 - Well, the nerve of it.

613
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:25,220
 - That's what I say.

614
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:26,220
 - You know what they're trying to do,

615
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,060
 Homer, come to us on bend and knee.

616
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:29,660
 - In the Methodist Church?

617
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:31,920
 (laughing)

618
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:34,180
 We'll show them.

619
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:35,820
 We're gonna give the best party tonight

620
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:37,220
 to this town, ever saw.

621
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:38,040
 - Where?

622
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:40,020
 - Mother, that's the least of our worries.

623
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:42,220
 Something will open up, it always does.

624
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:44,100
 And Homer, do you know what I'm going to the phone and do?

625
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:44,940
 Why?

626
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:46,260
 Double our order of donuts.

627
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:48,840
 (upbeat music)

628
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:57,460
 Homer, how does my next tie work?

629
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:00,660
 waiting till we get up here into this lamppost and we now take a look at it.

630
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:03,260
 Oh, let's turn here though. My Aunt Harriet lives up the street.

631
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:05,660
 Okay. Your tie looks fine.

632
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:09,660
 You know, it was very nice of my Aunt Harriet to call me up and say we could have the party at her house.

633
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:10,760
 That's what I was thinking.

634
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,060
 Did I tell you what else she said?

635
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:12,560
 What?

636
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,460
 She said she had sort of a surprise for her.

637
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:14,960
 She did?

638
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,460
 Sure. You know what that means?

639
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:19,460
 She's probably going out and let us have the whole house to ourselves.

640
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:20,460
 She is?

641
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:21,560
 Oh boy.

642
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,760
 Oh boy.

643
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,560
 That's what I was thinking.

644
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:27,360
 Say, I wonder what's going on across the street at the Methodist church.

645
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,560
 I'm not interested.

646
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,360
 As a matter of fact, I'm not either.

647
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,360
 Hey, Henry, look up the street.

648
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,360
 Where?

649
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,360
 Well, she was-- what's that all about?

650
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:37,360
 There's something going on over at the Mansion House Hotel.

651
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,360
 Boy, they're all dressed up.

652
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:40,360
 There must be a lot of parties going on tonight.

653
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:43,360
 But, Henry, there are a couple of hundred people out there in the sidewalk.

654
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,360
 They're all trying to get in.

655
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,360
 Remember, they're all getting put out.

656
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,360
 Oh, look. There's my father.

657
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,360
 Oh, yeah? And there's mine!

658
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,360
 Where?

659
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,360
 Don't you see them with all those men talking to them with us back against the wall?

660
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,360
 Oh sure.

661
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,360
 Oh, there you are Homer Brown.

662
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,360
 She was Agnes. Where did you come from?

663
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,360
 We just came from the Methodist Church. That's where we came from.

664
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,360
 Oh, Kathleen.

665
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,360
 Henry Olbridge, you realize everybody's waiting for you?

666
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,360
 Where is the church?

667
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,360
 It's the church.

668
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,360
 We're not interested.

669
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,360
 You're not interested in your own party.

670
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,360
 You're not part.

671
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,360
 Now listen, Agnes, have you been arranging more things?

672
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,360
 And just what Homer Brown do you mean by that insinuation?

673
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,360
 Now wait a minute, Agnes. Wait a minute.

674
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,360
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

675
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:35,280
 And before I sit down, ladies and gentlemen,

676
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,680
 I would like to extend the thanks and gratitude

677
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:40,040
 of the Rotary Club to several groups,

678
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:42,760
 and shall I say, individuals.

679
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:46,920
 First, I think we should thank Sam Aldrich for the very clever

680
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:50,160
 an original way in which you arrange this evening for us.

681
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,200
 I needn't tell you that for a few minutes,

682
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,560
 when we first went over to the mansion house,

683
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,440
 it looked as our salmon slipped up

684
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:59,040
 and arranged the table, seating 16,

685
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,320
 to take care of 200 guests.

686
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:04,880
 But it was done, of course, simply to teach us a lesson

687
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,540
 that we mustn't expect sumptuous banquets

688
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:09,560
 in these days of war.

689
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:12,200
 In fact, it's very delicious dinner,

690
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:16,240
 consisting of pea soup and peanut butter sandwiches

691
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:22,080
 And shall I say rice pudding and let's not forget the doughnuts

692
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:25,080
 was just what we needed to bring us back to earth.

693
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:28,120
 While the 15 soldiers who would be our guests

694
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:31,200
 are reading at the mansion house and will join us later.

695
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,480
 Oh, incidentally, I understand Sam arranged their dinner

696
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,520
 to end up with a triple-headed dessert.

697
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,960
 And besides that, Sam Orritz has asked me to say

698
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,920
 that we're going to put all the money that we've saved

699
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:45,560
 on tonight's dinner into war bonds.

700
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:51,320
 What's more, the treasurer of this church has just handed me a report to the effect that

701
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,760
 their organ has gone over the top.

702
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,520
 [APPLAUSE]

703
00:25:56,520 --> 00:26:02,280
 And I would like to extend our thanks to the good ladies of this church who dropped everything

704
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:05,520
 in order to make our banquet the success that it's been.

705
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:10,360
 I understand one lady in particular would plan to Valentine's party at her house for

706
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,440
 her nephew or someone.

707
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:18,440
 At the last minute, Carmen did all her adult guests and brought them down here to help serve,

708
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:22,760
 leaving the youngsters to ship for themselves as best they can.

709
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:30,440
 And now, ladies and gentlemen, may I introduce our genuine chairman and next president, Sam Aldrich.

710
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:36,440
 Ladies and gentlemen, frankly, I don't know what to say.

711
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:53,240
 Well, all those parties seem to straighten out nicely for everyone, didn't they?

712
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:57,840
 But if you think Mr. Olrus' troubles are over, just you stay tuned in to find out what happens

713
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,080
 the next morning.

714
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:03,400
 And now let me remind you that Postum, for years the favorite mealtime drink in millions

715
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:08,880
 of American homes is made for your convenience in two forms. Instant Postam, which you make

716
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:14,680
 instantly in the cup, and Postam cereal, which you make in pop percolator or drip maker.

717
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:19,720
 Both forms make the same delicious distinctive drink. So no matter which form of Postam you

718
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:23,840
 choose, you'll enjoy a mealtime cup that's a real treat.

719
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:39,840
 (music)

720
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,840
 Good breakfast, Alice.

721
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,840
 Thank you, Sam. Father, will you have another doughnut?

722
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,840
 No, thank you. Go ahead, have one.

723
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,840
 Henry, I have already had three.

724
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:52,840
 Oh. You know, I think that was a very good idea you had about lunch.

725
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:56,400
 What idea was that? To make all o' costre, to plow with a donut.

726
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:00,840
 Incidentally, Alice, I won't be here for dinner.

727
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:05,160
 Listen again next week to the Aldrich family, same time, same station,

728
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:09,800
 for another sparkling half hour with your favorite youngster, his family, and his pals.

729
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:13,640
 The Aldrich family, starring as Ruston, is written by Clifford Goldsmith.

730
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:17,160
 Original music is composed and conducted by Jack Miller.

731
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:21,960
 This is Harry Vanzel, saying, "You will enjoy fragrant, flavorful postum."

732
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:24,560
 And remember, Postam contains no stimulants.

733
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,460
 It cannot make you nervous.

734
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:27,460
 Good night.

735
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:29,460

736
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:42,560
 This program came to you from New York.

737
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,960
 This is the National Broadcasting Company.
