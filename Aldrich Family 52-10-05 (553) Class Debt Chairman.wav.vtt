 by transcription

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 [Music]

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 Henry Henry Aldrich!

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
 Coming Mother!

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
 [Applause]

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
 Yes, the Aldrich family written by Clifford Goldsmiths.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:32.520
 [Music]

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:39.000
 Centerville is only a dot on the map, and 117 Elm Street is only a typical American home.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.500
 But it's where the Aldrichs live, and it isn't far from where you live or used to live.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:51.500
 And as a typical teenage boy, Henry Aldrich is always certain to stir up any number of mishaps and memories.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.000
 The scene opens in the Aldrich living room. The time is Saturday morning.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 Oh boy Mary, do I feel swell.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.500
 Henry, why are you popping out your chest that way?

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.500
 I don't know. Just feel swell.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.000
 Why do you say that, dear?

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 You know what happened at school this week, mother?

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 What, dear?

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 Well, they were having a meeting, see. And I didn't know they were going to elect a class debt committee.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.500
 And the first thing I know somebody nominated me.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.000
 What kind of a committee?

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.500
 A class debt committee.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.000
 A class debt?

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.260
 Sure, mother, we owe money, and they needed someone to take charge of it.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:23.640
 And you were elected?

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.340
 Sure, almost unanimously.

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.240
 Who did what unanimously?

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.840
 The class father to me.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.880
 Sam, Henry's been elected to wipe out his class debt this year.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.880
 [laughter]

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:38.980
 You were?

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:40.640
 She was, I don't know.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.900
 Everything's just suddenly going swell.

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.280
 And you were elected unanimously?

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:46.180
 Well, practically.

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.280
 And then the school photographer took a picture.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.040
 - Of you, Henry? - Sure.

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.080
 Henry, I certainly hope you didn't have your picture taken looking like that.

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.280
 - What's the matter with me? - You never needed a haircut more in your life.

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.480
 - My haircut? I don't need a haircut. - Look at it, it's almost down to your shoulders.

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.480
 - Mother, you're exaggerating. - Would you like some ribbon, didn't it, Henry?

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.480
 - Mary. - Well, dear, you should never have left them

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:15.080
 take a picture of you like that, especially if they elected you unanimously.

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.080
 Mother, they didn't just point the camera at my hair.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.680
 George Bigelow didn't even have a tie on.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.680
 What was he doing in the picture?

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:23.880
 Well, she was father.

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.880
 You don't think you asked me to wipe out the whole debt single handed, do you?

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.080
 Well, those that don't notice George's tie will certainly notice your hair.

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.080
 Henry, how many are there on your committee?

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.080
 Well, counting everybody... 14.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.580
 14?

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.080
 14?

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.080
 Yeah. But in the picture, I was in the first row, Father.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.400
 Well, it's too late now, but you're going down and get a haircut.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.200
 On a Saturday morning?

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.080
 Waste the whole Saturday morning in a barber's chair?

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:58.240
 As a matter of fact, if you wait until I finish the breakfast dishes, I'll go down with you.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.280
 No, Mother, I can tell I'm how to cut my own hair all by myself.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.880
 But Henry, how about the last time you came home with a haircut?

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.920
 She was married. That's the way all the guys were wearing it last month.

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.720
 Lo in the front and high in the back.

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.520
 [Laughter]

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:17.580
 Well, I'm going with you mother. Please don't embarrass me. My goodness

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:22.620
 What's embarrassing about having your mother go into a barbershop with you? It just isn't done mother

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:28.080
 Very idea makes me nervous. Yes, Sam. Did you come here a minute, please?

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:33.600
 I'll be right there and Henry you're to get ready to go down to the barbershop. Yes, mother

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.720
 Only don't feel you have to leave your work in order to go with me

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.800
 mother

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:39.900
 Mother

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.100
 Henry, she wants to go with you.

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:43.460
 - Mary, she'll only be embarrassed

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:45.220
 down there with all those men.

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.380
 You tell her I'll have to cut exactly right.

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.260
 - You better wait, Henry.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:50.580
 Henry!

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:51.540
 - Henry!

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.500
 - Mother, he's gone.

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:54.500
 He's gone where?

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.340
 - To the Barbies, and when he comes back,

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.100
 he'll simply be a sight.

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.740
 - Well, I have a good notion to phone Thompson's

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:03.660
 barbershop and tell him just what I want done.

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.240
 (upbeat music)

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.660
 (jazz music)

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:19.200
 - Where are you going, Henry?

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.200
 (audience laughing)

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.140
 - To the barber shop, Homer.

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:26.780
 Now, I'm in a hurry, look out.

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.400
 You don't need a haircut.

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.180
 What do you want a haircut for?

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:31.500
 - Listen, Homer, do you see that lady

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.220
 coming down the street back there?

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:34.500
 - In the next block?

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:35.400
 The one that's running?

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.280
 Yeah, that isn't my mother, is it?

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:38.840
 No, she's running for a bus.

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.320
 Oh.

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:41.640
 What barber are you going to?

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.280
 Mr. Thompson, right here in the center bill times building.

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:45.480
 Oh.

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.480
 Did you know you're going to have your picture in the times

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:48.480
 tomorrow?

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:49.240
 In the times?

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:50.120
 Sure.

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.880
 The one guy Maccorkel took of the class debt committee.

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.000
 Is it going to be in the times?

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.560
 Sure, tomorrow.

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.280
 He spent all day yesterday persuading them to run it,

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:59.720
 and they finally gave in.

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:00.800
 Well, she wins.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.200
 Imagine.

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:04.120
 Homer, home do you see that car coming?

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.420
 That isn't my mother, is it?

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:06.420
 No.

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:07.760
 Just the same.

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.340
 I'd better go into the barbershop.

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.800
 If I see your mother, I'll tell her you're looking for her.

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:12.760
 No, Homer.

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:17.680
 [LAUGHTER]

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:20.440
 You never even saw me.

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:21.560
 All right, there, Henry.

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:22.840
 Now, how do you do, Mr. Latin?

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:23.760
 Well, hello, Henry.

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:24.880
 Hello, Mr. Thompson.

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.360
 There, do you like this chair here?

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.840
 Well, you have one not quite so near the window.

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:30.960
 You don't like this one?

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.400
 Well, I'm thinking of the strong light.

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.120
 This is the only one that isn't busy.

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.520
 Hop in. Yes, sir.

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.000
 - Air print? - Yes, sir.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.560
 How do you want it?

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:40.880
 Well, I'll tell you.

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.920
 I want to sort of...

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:44.760
 You see this right over my ears?

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:45.840
 Yeah.

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:47.840
 Well, it's sort of hard to explain.

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.360
 You see this right up on top?

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:50.200
 Yeah.

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.400
 Well, I'll try to tell you.

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:58.880
 Do you know what he's sh

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:00.760
 You've never seen him?

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.880
 Well, how about this chart here?

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:05.360
 I got a photograph of just about every style there is.

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:06.920
 Well, gee whiz, let's take a look at it.

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:08.760
 Yeah, here you are.

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:11.640
 Now here's a style they call the New Yorker.

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:13.840
 That would sort of fit your head.

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:15.560
 You think so?

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:16.360
 Is that popular?

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.080
 Oh, sell a lot of these.

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:21.600
 And here's the one they call the Yale Bowl.

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:24.400
 No, I don't think my mother--

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:27.520
 in fact, I don't think anybody would care for that one.

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:28.640
 What's this one?

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:29.920
 The Ball Bremo.

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:32.760
 That's more the Eddie, Shanton, kind?

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:36.360
 Could you give me the bow-brummel up on top and the New Yorker on the side?

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:42.160
 Sure.

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:44.760
 I don't think that'd be a good combination.

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:47.760
 Well, I'm glad to have a customer that knows what he wants.

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:51.560
 Well, the way I look at it, if you don't know how you want your own haircut, who does?

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:56.360
 Would you mind swinging the chair around a little so I could look out the window, please?

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:57.960
 I thought the light hurt your eyes.

00:06:57.960 --> 00:06:59.960
 I like to watch the traffic.

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:02.900
 How's that?

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:03.720
 Fine.

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:06.020
 Would you mind not twisting your head like that?

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:07.220
 Oh, excuse me.

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:09.700
 I just happen to see somebody come out of that store across the street.

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:11.020
 Say, who is that?

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:11.820
 That girl?

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:13.100
 Oh, that's Natalie White.

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:13.980
 Not bad.

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:15.580
 She's got a dog just like mine.

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:17.620
 Would you mind holding your head still?

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:18.380
 I wasn't looking at her.

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:20.020
 I was looking at that man go up the ladder.

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:23.060
 Well, the Times was putting up a new electric sign out there.

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:25.220
 The Times?

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:27.500
 Mr. Tom's not reminds me.

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:29.260
 You ever read The Times on Sunday?

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:30.700
 Yes, sir.

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:32.620
 Well, I certainly wish it'd skip it tomorrow.

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:33.780
 Yeah, bad news.

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:36.780
 They're gonna print my picture, darn it.

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:38.940
 See, do I hope they don't put it on the front page?

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:40.460
 What are they gonna print before?

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:43.060
 Well, I'm in charge of something over at the high school.

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:45.060
 Gee, was I embarrassed when I heard about it.

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:46.380
 Embarrassed?

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:47.820
 You know, everybody in town will see it

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:49.220
 and I'll all be calling up my mother.

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:52.260
 Well, most boys would be pretty proud about a thing like that.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.580
 Well, I'd rather just be one of the crowd.

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:56.100
 You know, once they start printing your picture,

00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:57.060
 where's it all going to end?

00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:59.500
 Could you hold your head still, Henry?

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:01.000
 Just looking over at the bakery.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.500
 That's Natalie White's coming across the street, isn't she?

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:04.500
 I guess she is.

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:05.500
 Good looking girl.

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:06.500
 Oh, she whiz.

00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:08.500
 What's she coming in here for?

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:10.500
 Excuse me, what could I bother you?

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:11.500
 Yes, ma'am.

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:12.500
 Hello, Henry.

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:13.500
 Hello.

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:14.500
 How's your dog?

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:15.500
 She's fine.

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:16.500
 How's yours?

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:17.500
 He's fine.

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:21.500
 Mr. Thompson, they don't have any change over the bakery,

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:23.500
 and they thought perhaps you could change this $5 bill.

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:25.500
 Sure, I guess I can help you.

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:28.500
 Hey, Mr. Thompson, is Henry here?

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:30.760
 - Henry here? - Homer, where did you come from?

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:32.400
 - Hi, Natalie. - Hi, Homer.

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:35.460
 Henry, I just ran into your sister up the street.

00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:38.560
 She told me to tell you, as soon as you've had your haircut,

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:41.140
 you're to go right home and let your mother see it.

00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:44.180
 - Your mother? - What do you mean she has to see it?

00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:46.580
 - Oh, did Mary say that? - Sure.

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:49.340
 She said Henry couldn't be trusted in a barber chair.

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:50.900
 - Honestly? - She was, Homer,

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:52.860
 always trying to kid.

00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:55.740
 Mr. Thompson, when you get through on top, I'd like a shave.

00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:58.740
 (audience laughing)

00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:04.380
 A what? A what? A shave and make it close.

00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:05.720
 And with Bay rum.

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:08.140
 (jazz music)

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:16.820
 Mother!

00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:18.020
 Where are you, Mother?

00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:19.500
 - Out here in the kitchen.

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:20.860
 - Is there anything I can do to help you?

00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:22.300
 - I'm busy right this minute.

00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:23.580
 They're breaking these eggs.

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:25.060
 - Oh, well, if there's anything I can do.

00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:29.060
 Henry! I thought I told you to go to the barbers.

00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:30.060
 I did go.

00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:33.060
 Well, why didn't you have your hair cut?

00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:35.060
 She was, I did. The catch of seeing?

00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:38.060
 Henry didn't even touch it. Turn around.

00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:41.060
 Mother, I know he cut it. I saw the hair fall off.

00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:48.060
 Well, there I can tell when my own son, Tara, has been cut. All he did was comb it down.

00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:50.060
 Mother, is there anything I can...

00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:53.060
 Henry, all rich, what's happened to you?

00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:55.060
 - So... - What do you mean what's happened to me?

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:57.060
 - Well, yours why did the sheet?

00:09:57.060 --> 00:10:00.060
 - She was married. That's just sort of... powder.

00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:03.060
 - Talcum powder? - Sure.

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:06.060
 - Can you ever hear of anybody using talcum powder after shaving?

00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:10.060
 - Henry, who's shaved you? - And what's that piece of bandage doing on your cheek?

00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:15.060
 - It's just a cut, Mary. It's just a cut... from the razor.

00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:18.060
 - How did the barber happen to cut you? - A ladder fell.

00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:21.060
 [laughter]

00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:22.220
 What fell Henry?

00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:25.220
 A ladder that belonged to the center of those times.

00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:28.140
 When the man jumped, I jumped and so did Mr. Thompson.

00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:30.700
 My mother, look at Henry's hair.

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:31.860
 I have, dear.

00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:35.500
 My goodness, it's even longer than it was before he went.

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:36.900
 How could it be, Mary?

00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:38.100
 But it is, Henry.

00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:40.100
 This morning, it was in curls down to here.

00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:40.900
 And now it's straighten.

00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:43.540
 It comes all the way down to here.

00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:45.820
 My goodness, what's that awful smell?

00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:46.580
 What smell?

00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:49.060
 Henry, what did he put on your hair?

00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:50.380
 Just a tonic mother.

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:52.220
 You came me from growing bald.

00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:54.480
 Mother, hold me while I say.

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:58.660
 Henry, dear, I'm not going to have you walking around the house looking like that.

00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:03.960
 And, Mother, did you know Henry's been going around telling everyone he's going to have a picture in the paper tomorrow?

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:05.360
 Listen, Mary, who told you that?

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:07.160
 My goodness, it's all over town.

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:07.860
 It is?

00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:11.660
 I was just talking to Ted Gould and he said Mr. Thompson told him.

00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:14.360
 Well, I certainly thought Mr. Thompson could keep it confidential.

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:19.360
 Henry, you're going right straight back and tell Mr. Thompson to pay a little more attention

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:23.040
 to his own business and not so much to everybody else's.

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:23.840
 What do you mean?

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:26.520
 I want him to cut your hair correctly.

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:27.560
 Mother, he did!

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:30.040
 Henry, I want your hair cut.

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:32.960
 Mother, you're just influenced by the looks of this bandage.

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:37.080
 If you back up into the dining room and look at me, you'll get an entirely different perspective.

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:43.600
 I'm not going to pay good money to have you look like that from any perspective.

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:45.400
 They'd now please start.

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:48.240
 Mother, I'll be embarrassed to death.

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:50.080
 She was Mr. Thompson's very busy,

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:52.640
 and he cut my hair and I paid him.

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:55.240
 I wouldn't be comfortable asking him to do it again.

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:57.960
 Well, then I'm sure Mary would be very glad

00:11:57.960 --> 00:11:59.680
 to go down with you and ask him.

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:00.520
 Mother?

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:02.200
 Yes, Mother, I'd be delighted too.

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:03.400
 No, Mary, no.

00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:05.680
 But Henry, don't you want to be comfortable?

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:07.280
 Mary, you can't do that, you mean.

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:10.240
 Can we stop acting like a child?

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:12.200
 I'll go back, Mother, alone.

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:14.000
 I'll ask him by myself.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.800
 But please don't any member of this family come along.

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:19.400
 And will you tell him to take some off the sides

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:20.720
 and off the top?

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:21.800
 Yes, mother.

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:24.720
 I'll tell him to give me a good all-around trimming.

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:27.720
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:41.800
 Hello, Henry.

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:43.060
 Oh, Natalie.

00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:43.760
 Where you going?

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:44.720
 Huh?

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:45.960
 Well, I'd carry your bundles for you

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:48.120
 if I didn't have to go back down to my--

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:49.960
 I mean, back downtown for something.

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:51.720
 You've got to go back?

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:53.680
 What happened to your face?

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:54.800
 A man fell off a ladder.

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:57.400
 [LAUGHTER]

00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:58.480
 On you?

00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:00.760
 No, right in front of the center go time.

00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:02.080
 He didn't hurt himself, though.

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:03.680
 Oh, that reminds me.

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:06.000
 I guess I'll certainly have to buy a copy of the time

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.080
 tomorrow.

00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:07.440
 You will?

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:08.360
 What for?

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:11.480
 You just modest-- everybody knows about it.

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:17.080

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:43.680
 The bottom of the vanilla extract is broken.

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:45.880
 Well, it's there, but it isn't broken.

00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:47.380
 Isn't that funny?

00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:49.080
 I thought I smelled something.

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:51.080
 [LAUGHTER]

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:52.180
 You did?

00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:53.480
 Henry!

00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:54.380
 Well, gee whiz.

00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:56.080
 Henry, wait for me!

00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:57.280
 Oh boy, goodbye, Natalie.

00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:58.080
 Henry!

00:13:58.080 --> 00:13:59.080
 I've got to be going.

00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:00.280
 Was that your sister calling?

00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:01.180
 I guess it is.

00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:03.080
 How did I happen time to wait?

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:05.080
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:07.080

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:14.080

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:17.080
 We'll return to the Aldrich family in just a minute.

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:22.080
 Tonight NBC rolls out the red carpet for two of the most popular people in radio.

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:26.080
 Tonight Phil Harris and Alice Fay return to the air on this station

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:30.080

00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:32.080
 And this is just a reminder to tune in.

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:34.080

 And also this evening, Jack Webb stars in another dramatization of a case history

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:53.080

 [Music]

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:24.080
 And now getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldrich.

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:26.080
 His mother is upset about his haircut.

00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:28.080
 When he returned home from the barbershop,

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:30.080
 she told him to his complete embarrassment

00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:35.080
 harassment that he must go back and have his hair recut this time correctly.

00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:39.080
 The scene opens as Henry re-enters the barbershop.

00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:41.080
 That's you, Henry?

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:43.080
 Yes, Mr. Thompson.

00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:44.080
 What are you back for?

00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:45.080
 You forget something?

00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:47.080
 No, not exactly.

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:53.080
 I'll tell you, Mr. Thompson, if you aren't too busy, could you make a couple of small changes on this job?

00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:55.080
 What's wrong with it?

00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:59.080
 Oh, why, nothing's wrong with it. I like it very much only my mother...

00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:05.080
 Well, you don't suppose you could give me a little less of the New Yorker and a little more of the Yale bowl, could you?

00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:09.080
 Sure, I can do anything you want, but if I even touch your hair, it's going to spoil it.

00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:10.080
 You think so?

00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:14.080
 I've been cutting hair for 20 years, and that's one of the best jobs I've ever done.

00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:19.080
 Well, now that I look at it in your mirror, I can see that it's pretty good.

00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:21.080
 Your mother see it in a good light?

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:23.080
 Oh, it hasn't anything to do with my mother.

00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:26.080
 I guess it was just a mirror we have at home.

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:29.080
 Of course, I'll spoil it for you if you really want me to.

00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:31.320
 Oh, no, I wouldn't even have you touch it.

00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:32.320
 Goodbye, Mr. Thompson.

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:34.080
 Goodbye, I see you in a couple of weeks.

00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:36.080
 - Can I marry? - Oh, she was married.

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:38.080
 Have Mr. Thompson changed your hair yet?

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:40.080
 Not yet, Mary. I'm just going in.

00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:41.080
 Well, I'll go in with you.

00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:43.080
 No, Mary, you go on. Please.

00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:45.080
 I'll be in here for quite some time.

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:47.080
 - Don't have me. - No, Mary.

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:49.080
 What is it now?

00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:52.080
 Well, I'll tell you, Mr. Thompson.

00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:54.080
 I know it's against my better judgment,

00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:59.320
 especially when... well that is... well I think I'll let you spoil it.

00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:00.480
 What's that?

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:05.920
 What I mean is... I think you could take a little more off the top and the sides maybe.

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:07.120
 What for?

00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:12.120
 Well, I've got a hat at home, see, and it's my favorite hat and it fits a little snug.

00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:13.920
 And I think maybe it would be better, isn't it?

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:16.320
 Why didn't you tell me you wanted to cut to fit a hat?

00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:17.720
 I didn't think of it before.

00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:19.360
 Well, it'll hop up in the chair.

00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:21.280
 But mind you, I'm not gonna ruin it.

00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:22.960
 I'm just gonna ease it off a little.

00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:25.260
 Oh sure, I wouldn't want you to do any more than that.

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:28.460
 Quite a crowd out in front there, isn't it?

00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:31.660
 Yeah, that new sign that's being hoisted into place is quite a job.

00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:33.860
 I'm glad to have sort of a front row seat like this.

00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:36.460
 Mr. Thompson, is Mr. Lappam here?

00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:37.460
 Yeah, just a second.

00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:38.960
 Hey, John, customer.

00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:39.560
 Coming.

00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:41.060
 - Whoa, Toby. - Hi, Han.

00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:42.360
 Will it be Toby and haircut?

00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:43.960
 Yeah, my mother says, "Give it the works."

00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:45.060
 Get in the chair.

00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:48.060
 Henry, were you just talking to that Natalie White a little while ago?

00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:48.960
 Sure, why?

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:51.160
 Well, just because she's a new girl in town, Henry,

00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:53.160
 You don't think you have to impress her with yourself?

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:54.160
 What do you mean?

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:55.160
 You don't know what you told her.

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:58.160
 I... about your picture being in the paper tomorrow.

00:17:58.160 --> 00:17:59.160
 I told you that.

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:01.160
 Toby, I hardly brought the subject up.

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:02.160
 Hold your head still, Henry.

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:04.160
 You made the whole thing up just to make her think you were to somebody.

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:05.160
 You're crazy.

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:07.160
 You mean it isn't going to be in the paper?

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:08.160
 Yes, it is, Mr. Thompson.

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:09.160
 It is not.

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:11.160
 You want a bad Toby? You want a bad... Sure, I'll bet you.

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:14.160
 I'll bet you anything you want to. How much do you want a bad...

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:16.160
 Anything you want? All right, how much?

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:18.160
 Toby, I happen to know the paper is printing it.

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:20.160
 All right, all right. Here's what I'll bet you then.

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:22.660
 - Now look what you made me do. I'm giving you a bald spot.

00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:24.660
 - Well, you better take it all off. I like it short.

00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:27.160
 Henry, here's what I'll bet you. We'll make it a box of candy.

00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:29.660
 If I win, you pay for it, and I'll give it to Natalie White.

00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:32.660
 If you win, I'll pay for it, and you can give it to Natalie.

00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:35.160
 - Say that again, Toby. - Wholesale.

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:39.660
 - Will you? - If I win, all you have to do is buy me a box of candy to give to Natalie.

00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:42.660
 - And if I win, you buy me one to give her? - Sure.

00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:44.160
 - Shape. - Shape. - Shape.

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:46.160
 - Hey. - Wholesale. - What's up, Ms. Mier?

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:48.160
 - It's a bat. - It's a bat.

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:50.160
 Hey Henry!

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:51.160
 What do you want Homer?

00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:54.160
 I thought we were going to listen to the World Series this afternoon.

00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:56.160
 Keep quiet while I finish combing his hair.

00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:58.160
 But the game's begun. The first man struck out.

00:18:58.160 --> 00:18:59.160
 I'll be right there Homer.

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:00.160
 Yeah, there you are Henry.

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:01.160
 Henry?

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:03.160
 - Ken, you hurry Mr. Lapham. - That job's perfect Henry.

00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:05.160
 Now don't you even touch her comb to it.

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:08.160
 Well thank you very much Mr. Thompson. Frankly it's just exactly what I wanted.

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:09.160
 Hurry up Henry.

00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:11.160
 I'm coming. Thank you Mr. Thompson.

00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:12.160
 See you in a couple of weeks.

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:15.160
 And wait for me brothers. Mr. Lapham couldn't you just sort of chop it off.

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:16.000
 - What up?

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.000
 - She whizzed, is that Toby think he knows everything?

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:20.840
 - Why?

00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:23.480
 - He comes in and he tries to make out I'm a liar.

00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:26.080
 My picture isn't gonna be in the paper tomorrow.

00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:26.920
 - It isn't.

00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:28.800
 - What?

00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:30.120
 - It isn't.

00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:30.960
 - What do you mean it isn't?

00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:32.160
 You're crazy.

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:35.000
 Are you trying to make me out a liar, Henry?

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:36.880
 - You're the one that told me it was going to be in.

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:38.600
 - But I just heard that Guy no Corkel

00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:40.480
 that took the picture dropped his camera.

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:41.320
 - When?

00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:42.760
 - I don't know when he dropped it.

00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:43.800
 How would I know?

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:47.260
 Well, Gee whiz, Homer, you should never miss Led me like that.

00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:48.860
 Am I gonna be disgraced?

00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:50.620
 Why care about Toby?

00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:53.220
 Homer, it's all over town that my picture's going to be in.

00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:54.780
 Well, don't blame me, Henry.

00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:57.440
 Gee whiz, you think I wanna pay for a box of chocolates

00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:59.180
 for Toby to give to Natalie?

00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:01.780
 Then have him sit and even eat them with her?

00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:04.200
 (jazz music)

00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:12.740
 Again, mother?

00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:13.740
 Yes, dear.

00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:15.540
 Mother, what does Henry have to do again?

00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:18.440
 Mary, dear, if I were you, I'd stay out of this.

00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:21.140
 Oh, my goodness, Henry, it's worse than ever.

00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:23.480
 Now, listen, Mary, I'm tired of this.

00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:25.540
 All I've heard since I got up this morning is my hair.

00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:27.140
 It's been hair, hair, hair.

00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:28.740
 Henry, what, Homer?

00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:30.240
 The Yangt's just scored.

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:32.900
 Mother, please don't make me go back and be trimmed again.

00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:34.340
 Right in the middle of the world series.

00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:37.220
 Henry, I don't want to hear another word about it.

00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:39.340
 You're to go back and tell Mr. Thompson

00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:41.340
 that I want your hair cut correctly

00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:43.340
 I'll know the reason why.

00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:44.340
 Well, go.

00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:46.340
 Only when I get back into that chair,

00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:48.340
 it'll be just like getting up on the guillotage.

00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:49.340
 Henry!

00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:51.340
 Come on, Homer, we gotta go downtown again.

00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:52.340
 No.

00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:53.340
 Homer, I have to.

00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:55.340
 Mother, do you want me to go within this time?

00:20:55.340 --> 00:20:58.340
 Listen, Mary, don't you even come near that barber shop.

00:20:58.340 --> 00:21:00.340
 What do you have to go for, Henry?

00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:02.340
 I have to have my hair cut again.

00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:05.340
 How are you gonna have it done this time?

00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:07.340
 [laughter]

00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:09.340
 Well, I don't give a darn howie cut,

00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:10.340
 I've lost interest.

00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:12.340
 Aren't you even interested in how the yanks come out?

00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:13.340
 No.

00:21:13.340 --> 00:21:14.340
 Did you have that snapshot of me?

00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:15.340
 Sure.

00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:17.340
 Do you understand what you're going to do with it?

00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:18.340
 Sure.

00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:20.340
 I just put it under the door of the Times office and beat it.

00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:21.340
 Is my name on the back?

00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:22.340
 Sure.

00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:26.340
 It says Henry W. Aldrich, chairman of the class debt committee.

00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:28.340
 I guess that'll put Toby in his place.

00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:32.340
 It's too bad you don't have one where you're not in a bathing suit.

00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:34.340
 You think they'll really print it Homer?

00:21:34.340 --> 00:21:36.340
 To be honest, no.

00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:38.340
 But I'll tell you how you could get it in though.

00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:40.340
 - How? - Get engaged.

00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:42.340
 Then they'd be sure to print your picture.

00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:44.340
 On the society page.

00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:46.340
 In a bathing suit?

00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:47.340
 What difference would that make?

00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:49.340
 You'd win the box of candy.

00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:51.340
 I know how I might get my picture in.

00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:52.340
 How?

00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:54.340
 If I could only be near a good accident just as it comes off,

00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:56.340
 then maybe I could.

00:21:56.340 --> 00:21:58.340
 Look out, Harry, do you want to be killed?

00:21:58.340 --> 00:22:00.340
 He was. Why does he watch where he's going?

00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:04.340
 Boy, I practically saved your life.

00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:06.340
 I'm not sure you should have.

00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:09.820
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:21.220
 Box of candy, eh?

00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:22.260
 Yes, Mr. Aldrich.

00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:23.940
 And Toby was sitting in this chair here,

00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:27.100
 and your son Henry was over there in Mr. Thompson's chair.

00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:28.700
 And they started arguing about Henry

00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:30.620
 having his picture in the paper tomorrow.

00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:32.060
 Is it going to be in?

00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:33.460
 So he says, Mr. Aldrich.

00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:35.500
 And Toby says he's crazy.

00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:37.540
 That's how they came to bet the box of candy.

00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:40.420
 Well, now then is there anything else?

00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:41.660
 You all through shaving me?

00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:42.500
 Yes, sir.

00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:43.700
 I'll tell you what you can give me.

00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:45.540
 A couple of good, the hot towels.

00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:46.380
 Yes, sir.

00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:49.180
 Just let me lie under them for a while and relax.

00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:51.260
 Yes, Mr. Orange.

00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:52.900
 You heard how the ball game's going?

00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:55.620
 42, seventh inning.

00:22:55.620 --> 00:22:58.140
 Now, just put your head back, Mr. Orange.

00:22:58.140 --> 00:23:00.420
 Good.

00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:01.460
 Too, huh?

00:23:01.460 --> 00:23:02.380
 No.

00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:04.580
 No feels good.

00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:06.780
 Mr. Lopman, is Mr. Thompson here?

00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:09.220
 Well, you back who wants me?

00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:11.480
 It's Henry, Mr. Thompson.

00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:12.820
 Now what?

00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:14.420
 Yeah, Mr. Thompson.

00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:16.220
 Could I just have a word with you?

00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:17.500
 You've changed your mind again?

00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:18.420
 Who knows?

00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:21.920
 No, as far as I'm concerned, my hair's just perfect the way it is.

00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:23.780
 Only if you'd be willing to cut it a little short,

00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:26.140
 I'd be glad to pay a $0.60 out of my allowance.

00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:27.940
 What do you want to do that for?

00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:29.700
 You rolling in money?

00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:30.820
 I don't care about money.

00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:33.340
 The main thing is, I want to see everybody satisfied.

00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:36.340
 Well, hop up there. I'll get my clippers.

00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:40.040
 Between this haircut and that box of candy you bet you're going to be broke.

00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:42.040
 She was, why should I worry about money?

00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:44.740
 My allowance has gone as always. Plenty more where it came from.

00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:52.240
 I don't like it personal, Mr. Thompson, but I wonder if they have your hot towels. Aren't too hot.

00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:53.340
 What makes you say that?

00:23:53.340 --> 00:23:55.440
 I thought I heard the man in the next chair groans.

00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:56.640
 It's still, Henry.

00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:57.940
 Yes, sir.

00:23:57.940 --> 00:24:04.940
 [Music]

00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:07.940
 If your mother doesn't like it this time, it won't be my fault.

00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:13.940
 [Music]

00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:15.940
 You think you ought to make it that short?

00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:18.940
 Sure. We're closed all day tomorrow, and this is your last chance.

00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:22.940
 [Laughter]

00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:25.940
 I know Mr. Thompson both still, don't even speak.

00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:27.540
 (buzzing)

00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:29.340
 (sighs)

00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:30.680
 There.

00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:33.040
 - Well, I think that's much...

00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:35.780
 Will that be a full 60 cents, Mr. Thompson?

00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:36.940
 - Forget it.

00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:37.780
 - Forget it?

00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:39.620
 - Yeah, and I'll try and do the same.

00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:41.280
 - Well, thank you very much.

00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:42.520
 Now let me go home and watch the game

00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:44.360
 without anything on my mind.

00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:46.220
 Give all Mr. Thompson, I'll see you in two weeks.

00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:47.720
 - Forget it.

00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:50.700
 - Hey Henry, Henry.

00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:52.860
 - Oh, I thought you were Henry Aldrich.

00:24:52.860 --> 00:24:55.900
 (audience laughing)

00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:58.500
 I am Henry Aldrich.

00:24:58.500 --> 00:25:00.360
 What happened to you?

00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:02.300
 Now listen, Homer, what is it you want?

00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:04.260
 Turn around and let me see your face.

00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:05.540
 You're looking at my face.

00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:07.540
 [LAUGHTER]

00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:09.820
 Did you take care of the picture?

00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:11.000
 I got caught.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:11.900
 Wear Homer.

00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:14.220
 Sticking your picture under the time's door.

00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:16.300
 Just as I put it there, the door opened,

00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:18.780
 and they told me to take it and beat it.

00:25:18.780 --> 00:25:21.180
 Well, she was, Homer, you're a big help.

00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:23.340
 Hello, Henry.

00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:25.540
 Oh, I thought you were.

00:25:25.540 --> 00:25:26.940
 Oh my!

00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:28.700
 Now listen Natalie!

00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:41.220
 You have some scrambled eggs, Henry?

00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:42.460
 No, thank you Father.

00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:43.340
 Mary!

00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:44.260
 Yes Mother?

00:25:44.260 --> 00:25:47.620
 Will you please tell your brother he just spilled some marmalade?

00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:50.340
 But I'm not speaking to him either Mother.

00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:51.220
 Why not?

00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:55.460
 Well look at him Father, his head is practically shaved.

00:25:55.460 --> 00:25:57.220
 Well, she whiz, Mary.

00:25:57.220 --> 00:26:00.340
 After you've gone to the barbershop as many times and one day as I did yesterday,

00:26:00.340 --> 00:26:02.260
 you can't expect to have much hair left.

00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:05.180
 Let's not even mention Henry's hair anymore.

00:26:05.180 --> 00:26:07.140
 I'm going to get ready to go to church.

00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:09.020
 I'll be ready to go with you just a minute, mother.

00:26:09.020 --> 00:26:11.340
 Oh, no, you're not going with me.

00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:13.980
 Well, she whiz.

00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:16.500
 I mean, I can't appear in public with anyone in the family.

00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:19.100
 Henry, have you been down to corner to get the times?

00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:19.820
 No, Father.

00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:20.820
 Did you forget it?

00:26:20.820 --> 00:26:22.020
 No, sir. I...

00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:24.620
 I just thought you'd like to eat breakfast and peace.

00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:26.420
 Without worrying about anything.

00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:27.980
 As soon as you finish your breakfast,

00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:29.500
 would you please go and get the paper?

00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:30.980
 Yes, sir.

00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:33.580
 But first, could I make a proposition with you?

00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:35.580
 What kind of a proposition?

00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:37.780
 Well, if I go down and get the paper,

00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:40.140
 not only this morning, but every Sunday morning

00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:44.540
 for the next six months, could you advance me a dollar and a half?

00:26:44.540 --> 00:26:47.460
 To buy a box of candy.

00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:49.220
 A box of candy?

00:26:49.220 --> 00:26:50.820
 Oh, but what do you mean by that?

00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:53.260
 I thought you were rolling in money.

00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:54.860
 I'm rolling in it.

00:26:54.860 --> 00:26:56.940
 After all, when your allowance runs out,

00:26:56.940 --> 00:26:59.500
 there's always plenty more where it came from, isn't there?

00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:00.460
 Who told you that?

00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:02.460
 - Just Tom and Gossett. - A Mary?

00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:03.380
 Yes, Mother.

00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:06.620
 Will you please tell your brother that Toby Smith is very anxious

00:27:06.620 --> 00:27:08.420
 to speak to him on the phone?

00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:11.860
 Mother, could you please tell him I can't possibly come to the phone?

00:27:11.860 --> 00:27:12.900
 Why not?

00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:14.220
 I'm sick in bed.

00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:15.340
 But you're not.

00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:17.900
 Couldn't you say he's been scalped?

00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:21.260
 Please, Mother, tell him I can't come to the phone.

00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:22.260
 Who's that?

00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:24.900
 Excuse me. Excuse me, but is Henry here?

00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:25.860
 What do you want, Homer?

00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:28.260
 Did you see the paper? Did you see the paper?

00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:29.420
 Not even interested in it.

00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:32.620
 Did you see the front page? Here, take a look.

00:27:32.620 --> 00:27:33.940
 What? At this?

00:27:33.940 --> 00:27:36.820
 What is it? Just three pictures of their putting up that new sign

00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:38.060
 in front of the Times office.

00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:41.140
 Don't you see yourself? Me? Where?

00:27:41.140 --> 00:27:44.180
 Sitting in Thompson's barbershop in the chair.

00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:46.940
 I am? Well, how do they have the print back?

00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:48.820
 Well, why don't you read what it says?

00:27:48.820 --> 00:27:52.140
 These three unusual photographs were snapped in front

00:27:52.140 --> 00:27:57.140
 of the Times building yesterday at 11 a.m., 1 p.m., and 3 p.m.

00:27:57.140 --> 00:28:00.140
 (audience laughing)

00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:04.220
 Which one am I in?

00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:05.140
 All three.

00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:08.080
 (audience laughing)

00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:09.060
 All three.

00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:12.740
 Look at yourself under my magnifying glass, Henry.

00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:16.020
 You can even see the sky where Mr. Thompson cuts you.

00:28:16.020 --> 00:28:17.900
 Well, gee, where's?

00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:19.220
 Look pretty good, don't I?

00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:23.940
 My other is told we still on the phone.

00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:26.940
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:36.700
 You would be a poor businessman to invest money

00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:39.500
 without determining what your dividend would be.

00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:41.140
 So I'd like to tell you what return

00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:44.820
 you'll receive on your investment in your community test.

00:28:44.820 --> 00:28:49.220
 Well, normally, about 40% of 100 families received directly

00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:53.900
 Services of some kind from one or more red feather agencies during the year.

00:28:53.900 --> 00:28:56.460
 So that services include aid to the handicap,

00:28:56.460 --> 00:28:59.900
 to orphan children, to the agent, and to the sick and needy.

00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:04.860
 All families benefit indirectly because these services work to make your community

00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:08.260
 a healthier, happier, better place in which to live.

00:29:08.260 --> 00:29:11.220
 Well, this year it's a bigger red feather because

00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:13.420
 the United Red Feather Campaign

00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:16.460
 must raise $17 million extra

00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:19.460
 to provide for the United Defense Fund services,

00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:23.980
 which include 257 USO clubs, USO camp shows,

00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:27.200
 American Relief for Korea, and many others.

00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:28.720
 So when you make your contribution,

00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:30.820
 give enough to cover normal needs,

00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:33.300
 plus an extra amount for the added services

00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:36.540
 made necessary by this defense emergency.

00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:38.660
 It's a bigger red feather this year.

00:29:38.660 --> 00:29:40.420
 Give the United Way.

00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:43.000

 She homer, am I sore at Toby?

00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:59.160
 Why, Henry?

00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:01.520
 Didn't he give you the box of candy to give to Natalie?

00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:02.600
 Sure he did.

00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:04.800
 But I didn't know he was going to put my pictures in it.

00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:06.320
 Those three getting your hair cut?

00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:07.120
 Sure.

00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:09.920
 And on the bottom he wrote, "Charmon of the Class Debt

00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:12.280
 Committee, going into debt."
