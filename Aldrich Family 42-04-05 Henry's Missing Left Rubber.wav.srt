 Come in, Southern!

00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,240
 Tom Sawyer, Uxpin, Ken Rock, Scofield, they're more than characters in fiction

5
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:39,440
 for the things they do and say are the things real boys do and say.

6
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,880
 And now Henry Alrich joins the ranks of typical teenage American life.

7
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:46,880
 He's a boy in your block perhaps in your own home.

8
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,640
 Now it's just after breakfast on Saturday.

9
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,880
 The scene is in the Alrich sitting room.

10
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,680
 Well, Henry, have you any ideas to where it is?

11
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,080
 No mother, that's the parts of the castle's man.

12
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,420
 But where did you leave it, Les?

13
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:01,980
 I thought I left it in the whole closet right beside my right one.

14
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:04,420
 Well, do you cancel out, Les, I did only one rubber.

15
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:07,620
 But, Mother, there's some shining. It's a beautiful day.

16
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:09,420
 I know, but it's terribly muddy.

17
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:12,820
 Now, just sit down here and try to remember where you wore your rubber, Les.

18
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:14,300
 I'm trying to remember.

19
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:16,360
 I'm actually another thing that puzzles me.

20
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,260
 Will you sit down, please? Yes.

21
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:20,640
 Hey, hey, hey, hey.

22
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:20,640
 Oh, look at you, Hey, hey, hey.

23
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,340
 Oh, look at you, look at you.

24
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:24,540
 Hey, look, listen, Mother.

25
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:26,080
 Don't you think I ought to go out?

26
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,320
 At least three toes and I do not.

27
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,740
 There's no reason why I don't learn.

28
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:31,580
 Well, they can't wait for you.

29
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:35,080
 But Mother, it's cold out there on the front porch.

 He has father-only mother feels.

 But she feels--

00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:46,080
 What are you doing with one rubber house?

39
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,080
 70 says the other one disappeared.

40
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,080
 Right off his foot.

00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,080
 She's father.

42
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,080
 I've looked at every place.

43
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,580
 And it just isn't here.

44
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:55,580
 Couldn't I just be careful with this when I do have a book?

45
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:57,180
 How would you do a thing like that?

46
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:00,180
 Well, I could put most of my weight on just my right foot.

 Yes, Bob.

 And Henry, is this--

55
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,880
 You told them you'd come back here?

56
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,880
 Yes, Bob.

57
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,780
 About how much longer shall I tell them I'll be tied up?

00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:16,780

 I think it's getting worse.

 Very well, I'll have a chocolate in tomorrow.

 Why don't you do it now?

00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,280
 Well, the fact here is that I planned to do something else.

67
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,280
 It's Saturday morning, actually.

68
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:34,280
 Don't you think you should follow this up right now, so the next time you remember?

69
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,280
 No.

70
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:42,280
 Yes. I was reading an article in the Sunday paper, and they said that most parents let so much time go by that the child forgets what it's being punished for.

71
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,280
 And that, really, leaves a very bad mood.

72
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,280
 On whom, the parents?

73
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,280
 Team Mother, do you harm and will we have a great idea?

74
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,280
 Henry, I think your father would like to have a talk with you with me.

75
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,040
 He'll tell me what it's about.

76
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,040
 Yes, Mother.

77
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,440
 Hey, hey.

78
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,880
 Do you realize how serious this rubber business is?

79
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,320
 I think so, Father.

80
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,720
 You bet three pairs of rubber is this winter, have you?

81
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,720
 Yes, Father.

82
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:09,120
 And I just don't see how they could have gone that fast.

83
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,120
 Yes, I think so.

84
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,440
 Now suppose I lost everything I own.

85
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,840
 What would you think?

86
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,400
 Well, I love, Father.

87
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,880
 You wouldn't think I had a great deal of character, would you?

88
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,880
 Well, it would all depend on what your reasons were

89
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:26,040
 from losing them. Now let's not start reasoning. You and I have been through

90
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:30,640
 reasoning before. Yes. Do you realize all the rest of this winter and all through

91
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,840
 this coming spring you're going to have only one rubber to your name. What are we

92
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:39,720
 going to do about it? Can we buy another pair? Another pair. Do you realize how much

93
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,920
 another pair costs? And that is a matter of fact there probably isn't even another

94
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,040
 pair for sale in this entire town. I saw some in the Emporium window yesterday.

95
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:53,640
 father. It is nothing to do with it. Don't you know that this country is facing a

96
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:57,340
 shortage of rubber. Yes. Think of it at a time when our army and our navy both

97
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:01,040
 need all they can get. You come home without the left rubber and ask me to buy

98
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,760
 a new pair. Well I guess I just didn't think. Let me tell you something you're

99
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,360
 going to find that rubber if it takes you all day. Yes. You will start looking

100
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,240
 for it and you'll keep on looking for it until you find it. That's clear. Yes.

101
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:18,240
 - Hey, what are you doing? - I thought you told those boys to go home.

102
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:22,240
 Well, I'll go tell them to come back and I know I guess it's late.

103
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,240
 - Yes, fellas? - I even know.

104
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,240
 I am.

105
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:29,240
 Here. I couldn't help hearing you guess now, and I wonder.

106
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,240
 You wonder what?

107
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,240
 Well, frankly, I think you were a little hard on Henry.

108
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,240
 - And you want me to be? - It's fair, not nearly. I have to give him a talking.

109
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,240
 And I did.

110
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,240
 I told you that to find the rubber in the uncertain terms.

111
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:48,240
 Let's say I'm not the point. Don't you realize that this is Saturday, the first night's day we had in weeks, and now Henry has to say, "And just to find a rubber."

112
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,240
 Well, should we get you my last?

113
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,240
 Hmm, what's the more he has to do?

114
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,240
 Naturally.

115
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,240
 Do you think I was a bit hard on him?

116
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,240
 Frankly, I do.

117
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:01,240
 Well, I can't very well turn around now and tell him he doesn't have to look for it.

118
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,240
 That would be worse than if I just let the whole thing go.

119
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,240
 And I agree with you. I'm just sorry that you made an issue with.

120
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:11,240
 Well, well, how is I getting ready to care about it, Robert?

121
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:15,240
 I just happened to walk into the room here, and the first thing I knew, you would ask me to speak to it.

122
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,240
 No, sir, let's not try to shift the blame onto me.

123
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,240
 But what do you want me to do?

124
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:24,240
 I don't know. This is your problem. But I do hope this doesn't leave a mark on Henry.

125
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:30,240
 Oh, Henry!

126
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,240
 -How's it going? -I'm going to be in the area right now.

127
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,240
 -What are you doing here? -It's in place.

128
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,240
 -And it's inside, Omar. -Oh.

129
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,240
 -Mr. Orr? -Is it anything in size?

130
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,240
 -I'm afraid he is. -Oh.

131
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,240
 -Well, Mr. Orr, we went here.

132
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,240
 You said he'd be ready in about an hour. -You did?

133
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,240
 -Yes, sir. That was about an hour ago.

134
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,240
 -I see how he's getting along. I'm going right in.

135
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,240
 -Homer? -Yes, Mr. Orr.

136
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,240
 -Did your father know you're out today without any rubber?

137
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,240
 -No, I'm sorry. I don't think he does.

138
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,240
 No parents worry about it.

139
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,240
 It's pretty muddy.

140
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,240
 I've got my rubber Thomas for all of us.

141
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,240
 Yes, well that's fine.

142
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,240
 That's fine.

143
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,240
 You keep them on.

144
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,240
 We all look longer.

145
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,240
 Here is going to be.

146
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,240
 Stay in.

147
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,240
 Yes, that is.

148
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,240
 We've been swimming out there on the back floor.

149
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,240
 Oh, nothing much.

150
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,240
 Just poking around.

151
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,240
 Head around.

152
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,240
 Yes, Father.

153
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,240
 Have you found that, Robert?

154
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:23,240
 We haven't found that one exactly, but I found an old goliath, though.

155
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,240
 That is not yours, it's me.

156
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,240
 Mary says her foot is big and bare.

157
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,240
 Oh, dear.

158
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:33,240
 Oh, I'm never going to go out and tell them you're still looking for your rubber.

159
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,240
 Father, couldn't I just try this a lot, huh?

160
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,240
 Henry, you're not going out through the streets of Ixanway.

161
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,240
 One rubber and one made it over to you.

162
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,240
 Put 'em over here.

163
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,240
 You can actually go out there and speak to them.

164
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:47,240
 Yes, Father. The only thing is, what can I tell them?

165
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,240
 Hi, Father.

166
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,240
 Well, because you already did start.

167
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,240
 Well, here's the situation, Homer.

168
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,240
 I know.

169
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,240
 Please I can get away right now.

170
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,240
 Now listen, ever if you fall as early this morning and say, "Boy, it looks like a slow

171
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,240
 baby let's talk unless you can take us up on our bikes and go, "Yeah, it's just sure,

172
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:07,240
 Willie, but I didn't mean we should start off as soon as I hung up the sister of the receiver."

173
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,240
 I didn't give him just a hand.

174
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,240
 This is a fair time leaving here.

175
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,240
 But Homer, I didn't even know yet.

176
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,240
 You want to go up on a trip now.

177
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,240
 She whizzes.

178
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,240
 It's only a fish can.

179
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,240
 Why don't you come back, Sam?

180
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:24,040
 Hand-masked 11, and that'll give us just a 9/10 hour to get out some places.

181
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,540
 He was our lunches, okay? So a lot better.

182
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:29,140
 Why? Because, Willy.

183
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:31,640
 And what is there to do until hand-masked 11?

184
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:34,140
 Um, there are a lot of things.

185
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:37,040
 Have you seen the new factory they're putting up on the other side of town?

186
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,440
 I know, but pretty sure.

187
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:42,740
 And over at the railroad station, they're building a whole new place platform on the, uh, sure.

188
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:45,740
 And how about the Shinling job? They're doing it on the courthouse.

189
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:47,540
 Oh, yeah, I forgot about that.

190
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:50,900
 You are there all kinds of things to see around this town.

191
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:54,100
 And here you are, you're spinning around, waiting for me.

192
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,100
 Now go on.

193
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,100
 How are you?

194
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,100
 We'll be back in a no.

195
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,100
 Okay.

196
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,100
 Goodroom.

197
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,100
 Yes, Father.

198
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,100
 You're not under the fella's tears?

199
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,100
 Yes, sir.

200
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:05,300
 Do you remember where you might have worn your rubber last?

201
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,740
 Well, I'll tell you.

202
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:10,740
 I think it was just a week ago today, and it's been raining all night.

203
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:15,420
 And I remember waking up and looking out the window and thinking, "Gee, mother's gonna

204
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:16,740
 make me wear my rubber."

205
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,740
 Where did you go?

206
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:22,740
 Well, I got dressed and after you left the house.

207
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:27,740
 Well, I left the house and went over to watch the enforcement men.

208
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:28,740
 Where?

209
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,740
 Very terrible, I've reached that spot.

210
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:35,740
 And then I remember going over to the railroad station and watching men force them cement.

211
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:37,740
 Then where did you go?

212
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:40,740
 Well, directly from there I...

213
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:42,740
 I don't remember.

214
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:45,740
 But I was a little tired, I remember that.

215
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:49,420
 For your be hot yes father that I can say well

216
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:54,780
 Suppose son you go in the living room where you'll be alone and just sit down and try to remember

217
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:59,580
 But will you please go in there?

218
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:10,060
 Just got into think the why can't I get in to forget the whole thing

219
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:15,020
 One rubber

220
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:19,180
 Of course the thing I'm really sorry about is he's missing a piggy.

221
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:19,680
 I think you're...

222
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:25,680
 Stand the boys were going on a picnic on their bicycles and I told him that he couldn't possibly go and I can first clean up the back yard.

223
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,680
 Alright, gotta make him skip cleaning up the yard.

224
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:32,180
 Now, you're a justice impotence of me to uphold my position as it is for you to uphold yours.

225
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:33,180
 I see.

226
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:34,180
 Where you going?

227
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:35,180
 No, please.

228
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,680
 That's not the thing.

229
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,180
 Mother, yes?

230
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:41,180
 I just don't remember where I went into the railroad station.

231
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:46,140
 Where down on the street to watch the steam shovel but then my mind goes blank again

232
00:09:46,140 --> 00:10:02,000
 Now getting back to the troubles of Henry Alfred

233
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:10,260
 I don't remember.

234
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,260
 Great view quick.

235
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:14,260
 If you didn't spend all your time stepping out and seeking to home by the mother, I only

236
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:17,260
 step out about once an hour and that's reasonable.

237
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:19,260
 Well, how do you have to say yes, mother?

238
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:23,260
 And mother, in case I don't find my rubber and time to go with them, you wouldn't want

239
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:25,260
 them to stay here for lunch, would you?

240
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,260
 I certainly would not.

241
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:28,260
 That's what I thought, so I won't invite them.

242
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,260
 Great.

243
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:32,260
 Listen, Homer, how would you and Willie like to do this?

244
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:34,260
 We are going to do anything.

245
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:35,260
 We need to start.

246
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,260
 Are you interested in going?

247
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,260
 Of course, Homer.

248
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:40,260
 Naturally, I wouldn't be coming out here on the porch every day limit.

249
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:44,260
 But, oh, my God, you think we all enjoy our lunch if we waited until we got even hungrier?

250
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:46,260
 No, I'm so hungry, I think.

251
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:48,260
 Now, all right, why don't we eat right here?

252
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:51,260
 Wait, I hear in my backyard on the back tree.

253
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:52,260
 What's the name?

254
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,260
 You mean you being a friend of each other sounds like a punishment?

255
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:56,260
 No, no, what do you mean, punish?

256
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:59,260
 Do you wish I just want to find my left rubber first?

257
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:01,260
 Oh, so that's it, you can't go out with that, you're a rabbit.

258
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,260
 I can too, it's just a...

259
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:08,840
 What you was not even I care anything about even my country your country

260
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:15,140
 Yeah, that shows how much you know Homer don't you realize there's a shortage of rubber and my father's very upset?

261
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:17,140
 Why I think I care?

262
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:23,500
 Shuri has but I'm going to the whole house trying to find mine. Don't you think I want to do my share now?

263
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:29,300
 What she was rubber's are practically priceless today. How do you know my father said so well?

264
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:36,820
 I need you to tell me, I'll go tell Willie. Where is he? He's gonna go home and change his trousers. He's just too intimate to when they announce the time.

265
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:48,820
 Well, Gee, would the V's gonna do things like that? We're never going to get started. Henry, the telephone rings out in the basement. Yes, Marvin. Doing what? Tracing up your phone and work face!

266
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:53,820
 (music)

267
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:58,820
 (music)

268
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:01,820
 Homer, for the last time I can't come right this minute!

269
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:04,820
 Why not? You being tiny? No, I'm not!

270
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:08,820
 The only reason I can't come now is my mother says I've gotta find my Fortaloy band first!

271
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,820
 Oh, gee, isn't it?

272
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,820
 Well, wait, it's been this Saturday!

273
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,820
 What have you got those three robbers in your hand for?

274
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:15,820
 I'm checking it over.

275
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,820
 You can join with I left you.

276
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,820
 All of everything I tell you are for the last place.

277
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:20,820
 How much have you been talking about?

278
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:21,820
 How did he pay for this?

279
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:22,820
 He paid.

280
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:23,820
 What do you mean, he paid?

281
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:26,820
 Why, he said Mr. Rogers said that what he loved was practically priceless.

282
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:27,820
 It is.

283
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:28,820
 Well, let's turn home.

284
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:33,820
 I know if you realize that every time we collect in them for a father, he's paying good money for them.

285
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:34,820
 Sure.

286
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:35,820
 Boy, am I young.

287
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:39,820
 You certainly don't think Henry would throw away a whole enemy before he could keep one foot dry, do you?

288
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:42,820
 Well, you know, really, I wanted him out there myself.

289
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:43,820
 Sure.

290
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:48,320
 Oh, she was yes mother

291
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:59,940
 Hello hello is this Dr. Bennington a doctor you two made it a drop in sometime this afternoon

292
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:04,260
 For no nothing serious. This is always called her hand in my vice

293
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:06,580
 in my fight

294
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:12,020
 For some reason she decided to clean up my workbench in her hand caught in the vice and she got panicky and turned it the wrong way

295
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:18,400
 No, I'm sure it's perfectly all right, but I feel better if you could take a look at her hand. Thank you doctor. Goodbye

296
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:27,060
 No idea broiling as quickly as you can in service to a clock and I'm hungry

297
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:33,180
 Operator I won't tell them 4 4 6

298
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:46,640
 Hello, is this the economy repair shop? Listen to all rich. I wonder whether you could come over and pick up our sewing machine and vacuum cleaner on electric fans

299
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:54,680
 Well, they were stored in a closet and my daughter accidentally pulled the fan down off the shelf and it fell onto the sewing machine and then bounced onto the vacuum cleaner

300
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:58,480
 No, she's all right. But thank you. Goodbye

301
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,480
 Yes, Alex.

302
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:02,480
 He's going to hang me in the room and see whether he's wet

303
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,480
 and comfortably.

304
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,480
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

305
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,480
 He wins, will we?

306
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,480
 You come out?

307
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,480
 I told you ten times.

308
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,480
 Oh, we might.

309
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,480
 Their cupboard was summoned.

310
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,480
 Oh!

311
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,480
 Here, can you text these rubbers when I throw them out the window?

312
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,480
 Sure!

313
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,480
 How much do you say Mr. Long, which is paying for?

314
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,480
 Well, from the way Homer talks, we'll pay at least 50 cents a piece.

315
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,480
 I think.

316
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,480
 It's all right.

317
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,480
 Just move.

318
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,480
 I'm going to get a little bit of money.

319
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,480
 I'm going to get a little bit of money.

320
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,480
 I'm going to get a little bit of money.

321
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,480
 I think.

322
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,480
 It's all right.

323
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,480
 Just the whole rubbing?

324
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,480
 Sure.

325
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,480
 It's the chance of a life chart.

326
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,480
 Well, we'll be right if you only find the one cigarette.

327
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,480
 Sure, that's it, Toby.

328
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,480
 Always asking questions.

329
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,480
 You know there's a man for tin foil, don't you?

330
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,480
 Yes.

331
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,480
 He ever asked what they used him for?

332
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,480
 No.

333
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,480
 He ever asked why they rather have the tin foil flat and rolled up?

334
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,480
 No.

335
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,480
 And only it's why they want his left rubber.

336
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,480
 [Laughter]

337
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,480
 And maybe a military safety.

338
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,480
 Oh!

339
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,480
 And Toby, when you see Homer count up the start on the stick, it without me.

00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,480

 - Bobby.

343
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,480
 - Yes, Mary.

344
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,480
 - You're fine, in fact.

345
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,480
 You never know anything that happened.

346
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,480
 - Oh.

347
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,480
 - How's lunch coming?

348
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,480
 - It'll be waiting just a few minutes, Father.

349
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,480
 I had to get a double nose, two cans of beans.

350
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,480
 - Beans.

351
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,480
 - Yes, Father.

352
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,480
 When I told Mother what happened to the chop,

353
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,480
 she told me where she had to be and put away.

354
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,480
 What was the matter with him, Lee?

355
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,480
 - Nothing but an attack of haypaper.

356
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,080
 He got it rummaging through something in the attic.

357
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,980
 - Oh, do I have anything when you're being spotted?

358
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:29,880
 - But just what? - Oh, when you're spotted.

359
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,880
 We got the raw cat.

360
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:35,380
 - Thank you, very good for you. - Yeah, man, if you were having just heard.

361
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:38,580
 - Yes, on it. - Yes?

362
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:41,880
 - We're going to go to the attic. - Real carefully, and don't stir up any dust.

363
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,880
 Don't you think I can fit one more look?

364
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,480
 - Hey, I have a little surprise for you. - For me?

365
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,480
 - There is your rubber. - Oh, he wouldn't.

366
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,480
 Where did you find it?

367
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,480
 In the back of the car.

368
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,480
 Oh, Jim, now you can go right along on your picnic.

 Oh, gee, Liz, what's the matter?

372
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,480
 Well, this isn't my rubber.

373
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,480
 But what difference does it make?

374
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,480
 Where is it?

375
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,480
 The farmer, if this isn't my rubber, I really do.

376
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,480
 Why not?

377
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,480
 Father, I didn't even find it.

378
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,480
 And they put it back on and where?

379
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,480
 Oh, no, Father.

380
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,480
 That wouldn't be right.

381
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,480
 Then they put some other...

 Where this?

384
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,540
 And where I put father to hold the trouble of finding it

00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:20,880

00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,000

 Now wait a minute, but anyway, I'm not in the market for fans.

00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:09,280

 - Good-bye.
