00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 Henry! Henry Oldrich!

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 Coming, mother!

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 The Oldrich family!

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 A special rebroadcast for you, soldier, sailors, and Marines of the United Nations!

00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 Through a teenage boy each new day is a new world, and each moment of it is filled with all sorts of discoveries and excitement and even mishaps, which grownups can somehow always envy.

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,960
 So it is with Henry Aldrich.

9
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:57,080
 The scene opens at the Aldrich breakfast table.

10
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,480
 You didn't answer my question, mother.

11
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,320
 Can I?

12
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,240
 I mean, may I?

13
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,200
 Henry, will you please eat your cereal?

14
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:02,800
 I am.

15
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:03,760
 I'm eating it.

16
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,520
 Only may I, please.

17
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,040
 Alice, may I have to cream, please?

18
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,720
 Here you are, Sam.

19
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:09,640
 Mother, excuse me.

20
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,920
 But did you say I'm I?

21
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:11,880
 Sam, what do you think?

22
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,400
 Alice is nothing to begin by drawing me into this.

23
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,400
 Henry knows exactly how I stand on the matter.

24
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,880
 But, Father, that's a beautiful part of it.

25
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,160
 I'm not asking you.

26
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,600
 I'm not relieving asking mother.

27
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,100
 I'm just suggesting it.

28
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:24,900
 Henry, were you pleased with your spoon back in your cereal?

29
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:25,700
 Oh.

30
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:26,600
 Was I pointing?

31
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,300
 You were?

32
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:28,700
 Excuse me.

33
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:32,400
 Henry, didn't you ask me to advance you a dollar on your allowance last week?

34
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,100
 And didn't I make it clear this is the only way you could ever be taught a lesson?

35
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:37,500
 Yes, Mother, sure.

36
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,500
 And now I've learned how important money is.

37
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,100
 So couldn't you advance it?

38
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,400
 Ben, what do you think?

39
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,900
 What do I think about what?

40
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:46,600
 Alice, do you see this piece of court plaster on my chin?

41
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,300
 Yes, dear.

42
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:48,700
 I'll tell you what it is, Mother.

43
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:51,140
 I shouldn't have asked him for the dollar while he was shaving.

44
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:52,860
 - Honey, would you like another piece of toast?

45
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,060
 - No, thank you, Virginia.

46
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:54,900
 - Virginia?

47
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,780
 - Oh, gee, what's Murray, did I call you?

48
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:58,580
 No, thanks, I don't care for any toast.

49
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:00,140
 - Virginia who? Virginia who?

50
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,500
 - Nobody, Mary, nobody.

51
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,780
 I just happened to be thinking about a problem I have,

52
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,380
 and I wasn't thinking.

53
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:06,740
 - Mary, may I have a piece of toast?

54
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,620
 - He or her father?

55
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:10,620
 - Mother, and now that father doesn't have

56
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:13,300
 his knife and fork in his hand, may I have your decision?

57
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,540
 - Henry, what is it you want the dollar for?

58
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,700
 - Nothing special, Mother.

59
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:20,940
 I just...boy, if I don't have it, then what do you think?

60
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:21,860
 Where's the sugar?

61
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:23,860
 Right here, Father. Let me give it to you.

62
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:24,420
 Oh, she's...

63
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:27,380
 Henry, oh, did you part half the bow into Father's egg?

64
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:28,740
 And there you are.

65
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,980
 Henry, until you were able to concentrate on breakfast,

66
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:32,900
 instead of thinking about...about...

67
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:35,140
 Then your sleeves in the butter.

68
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:36,180
 But then...

69
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,620
 Oh, wipe it off for him, Mother. Father, hold your elbow up.

70
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:39,500
 Where's the napkin?

71
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,700
 Here, Virginia, use mine.

72
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:41,180
 What's that?

73
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:43,220
 Oh, she was... I call you Father, Virginia.

74
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:45,220
 Henry, it's just what I suspected.

75
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:48,020
 You've got a crush on that redheaded girl over on Maple Street.

76
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:49,540
 - Virginia Lee. - On who?

77
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:51,820
 Isn't her father the head of the Board of Education?

78
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:54,220
 You're just trying to get a passing mark in all your subjects.

79
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:56,920
 Mary of all the wild rumors of all the...

80
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,860
 Mary, I hardly even know Virginia Lee.

81
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,540
 Why, Harry Aldrich.

82
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,780
 Didn't I see you talking with her yesterday?

83
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:03,940
 Who I?

84
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,000
 Sure.

85
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,620
 Maybe I was saying I'd be glad to come to her party tonight, but...

86
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:10,140
 That's all I said.

87
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:12,020
 But for anybody to go around saying,

88
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:14,300
 "Why so far as I'm concerned, Virginia Lee...

89
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,660
 - Virginia Lee Henry, we'll take your word for it.

90
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,740
 You're not even slightly interested in it.

91
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,100
 Now please quiet down and finish your breath.

92
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,900
 - Yes mother, excuse me.

93
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,220
 - Henry it's just as well you're not interested in it.

94
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:27,220
 If you ask me she has the quickest temper.

95
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:28,660
 - Who, Virginia Lee?

96
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:30,180
 Virginia Lee has a temper.

97
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,180
 - Mary she's got one of the nicestest dispositions.

98
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,020
 - Henry.

99
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:33,860
 - Yes father?

100
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:35,340
 - That's my toast you're waving.

101
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,060
 - Oh excuse me.

102
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:39,020
 - Gee how'd I ever get ahold of that?

103
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:42,180
 - And what's more Mary, her hair is not red, it's all blue.

104
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,500
 - So it certainly looks red to me.

105
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,980
 And that's just the kind of a statement that that that's that's how you if you're choking

106
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:47,980
 drink some water.

107
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,620
 I'm not choking mother.

108
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,460
 Look I'm reading fine.

109
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:55,540
 I just want to make it clear that when you're invited to a party at Virginia Lees, it's

110
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:56,900
 a very great honor.

111
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,820
 She doesn't ask everybody Mary.

112
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,380
 And besides it's just a way she has.

113
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:02,220
 She doesn't mean what she says.

114
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:03,220
 She was Mary.

115
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,380
 Whatever made you think she has a temper.

116
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:08,060
 Henry all I know is the one time in my life I had ever spoken to Virginia Lees.

117
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:09,060
 She snapped at me.

118
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,060
 She why?

119
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,060
 She snapped at me.

120
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:12,460
 It was a Jane Prescott tea.

121
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:18,660
 I said Virginia which will you have my men are clean and she said neither just like that said what neither father

122
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:22,920
 What's your chief said couldn't she have at least said please when she didn't want either

123
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:26,380
 Homer's at you

124
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:32,620
 Is that Homer? I'm going to the office you want to look out mr. All Richard slippery out. Thank you. Good morning Homer

125
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:36,500
 I miss his old which you having hot cakes for breakfast. No, dear. Oh, oh

126
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,060
 Hey, Henry

127
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:42,780
 You know what George Bigelow and Jimmy Violet and Harry would now Graham and I are all gonna do tonight boy

128
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:46,100
 Wait, I tell you what I'm gonna do with going to a party over at Virginia Lee's

129
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:51,580
 Where and to say the least it certainly sounds exclusive now wait a minute Mary listen Homer

130
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:56,380
 What time did she tell you to be there eight thirty there Mary see what time did you tell you to be there?

131
00:04:56,380 --> 00:05:00,340
 Not a minute later than eight fifty. What are you gonna do move the furniture for?

132
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:07,460
 Why come on? Let's get started. Oh well first Homer. Oh look mother. Could I speak to you alone for just a minute alone?

133
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:08,960
 Yes, mother. I'll get you.

134
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,460
 Henry, is it about that dollar?

135
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:12,960
 Mary, have I even mentioned a dollar to you in?

136
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,960
 Henry, what is it you want to speak to me about?

137
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,460
 All I ask you to do is put enough confidence in me to come out here.

138
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:32,960
 Hey, George. Wait a second before you go in the classroom.

139
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,960
 What did you want?

140
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:34,960
 Could you lend me a dollar?

141
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:35,960
 A dollar, Homer?

142
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:36,960
 To you?

143
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:43,960
 Well, it isn't for me exactly. It's really for Henry Aldrich. He has to have it so we can't see it up anyplace.

144
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,460
 Don't you think I have any respect for my money?

145
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:48,960
 Look at him, Homer. Look at him. Look at who, Agnes.

146
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,960
 Henry, he's right out there in the car at a showing off in front of Virginia Lee.

147
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,960
 What's he doing, Agnes?

148
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,960
 He's got his coat on inside out and he's trying to make her laugh.

149
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:59,960
 My goodness, Tommy, you ought to bring him to a census of all girls, Virginia Lee.

150
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,960
 Don't you like Virginia Lee, Agnes? Boy, I think... boy.

151
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,960
 What do you mean by that?

152
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,960
 Nothing, Agnes, nothing.

153
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,960
 This is how we make Henry's stuff.

154
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:10,960
 I'm dying.

155
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:11,960
 Hi, Virginia.

156
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,960
 You've got his coat on wrong side out. He's forgetting to be a camel.

157
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:15,960
 Hey, Virginia.

158
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:16,960
 Moo!

159
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:17,960
 [laughter]

160
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,960
 Henry, if you ask me, you're making a public spectacle.

161
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:21,960
 Look at that.

162
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,960
 I can just look at me. I can go two weeks without water.

163
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,960
 Moo!

164
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:26,960
 [laughter]

165
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,960
 How far is I? I'm concerned I'm going into assembly.

166
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:30,960
 Homer, you've come.

167
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,960
 Why are you?

168
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,960
 I always forget out of my way.

169
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,960
 Look at him. George is Henry as free.

170
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,960
 Bring!

171
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,960
 Virginia, come over here a second.

172
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:37,960
 I want to ask you something.

173
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:38,960
 I can't.

174
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,960
 Your dad got to go into a sample.

175
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:40,960
 Goodbye, Virginia.

176
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,560
 Can we put your coat on right before somebody comes along and sees you?

177
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,560
 She wins.

178
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,560
 Who's coming, Homer?

179
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,560
 I can wear it anyway.

180
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,560
 I'd please if I want to.

181
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,560
 I bet you don't dare wear it that way all day, Henry.

182
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,960
 Well, I would if I wanted to.

183
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:52,960
 I just don't want to.

184
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,960
 Yeah?

185
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,960
 You haven't got enough nerve to.

186
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,960
 What do you mean I haven't got enough nerve to?

187
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:57,960
 I'm just not going to wear it.

188
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:58,960
 So what'd you tell me to?

189
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,960
 All right.

190
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:00,960
 I'll call you a bluff.

191
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,960
 You wanted to borrow a dollar, didn't you?

192
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,960
 So why?

193
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:08,000
 inside out and I'll loan it to you. You will? Now wait a minute Henry don't do it.

194
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,480
 Homer you please keep out of this. You're afraid to Henry you're afraid to.

195
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:16,520
 Georgia doesn't be cause of that I just... you know... cause she got dollar again here.

196
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:20,420
 Now wait Henry. There isn't any girl in the world that's worth that.

197
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:24,160
 Homer will you stop pulling me? Let him alone Homer. George will you stop pulling

198
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,360
 in yourself? Now wait a minute fellas wait a minute let me be the one to decide this.

199
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:38,360
 [Music]

200
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:42,640
 I have also been asked to announce to the student body that there will be a

201
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:46,880
 concert of chamber music in this auditorium tomorrow evening at 8.30.

202
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,960
 Those wishing tickets will be seen as Hopkins.

203
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,040
 No, not with Hopkins.

204
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,400
 Yes, Ms. Hopkins.

205
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,960
 I was little ahead of myself there.

206
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:03,560
 And I trusted all of you who work with a young man in about the 10th row

207
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:07,160
 who is forced to teach him from the aisle please rise.

208
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,060
 To why?

209
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:11,360
 Yes, I mean you young man.

210
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,860
 I'm Mr. Bradley.

211
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:15,560
 That's right. Will you please stand?

212
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,860
 Yes sir.

213
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:20,960
 May I ask just what that is you are wearing in this assembly?

214
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,160
 My coat.

215
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,360
 Your coat.

216
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,560
 And may I ask why you are wearing it wrong side out?

217
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,560
 I'll take you what I'm going to do, young man.

218
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:33,560
 I'm going to give you the opportunity of coming up here onto this platform

219
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:38,560
 so that everyone downstairs and up in the balcony can share the pleasure of looking at you.

220
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,560
 Now?

221
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:44,560
 Step right along, please. Our time is limited and we want to get on with the program.

222
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:51,560
 Your name is Orange, isn't it?

223
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,560
 Yes, sir.

224
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,880
 Do you remember my giving a talk only last September

225
00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:00,120
 on how the young men in this school should be careful of their appearance and assembly?

226
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,220
 No sir.

227
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:03,160
 Quiet please.

228
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,160
 This is hardly a laughing matter.

229
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,720
 You don't remember?

230
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,320
 I... I guess I was sick that day.

231
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,920
 Yes, you were sick that day.

232
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,440
 Exactly what is it you think you look like?

233
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,400
 Well, why...

234
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,120
 Before I came in here, I...

235
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,480
 I was a camel.

236
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,120
 Right?

237
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,280
 Whatever possessed you to do a thing like this?

238
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,600
 Why, will you see Virginia Lake?

239
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,600
 I mean...

240
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,440
 (audience laughs)

241
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,280
 - Why you...

242
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,860
 (upbeat music)

243
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:40,720
 - Henry!

244
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,640
 Henry, aren't you in the dining room?

245
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,800
 - Yes, sure, Mother.

246
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,880
 I'm in here.

247
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,720
 - Bye, goodnight Henry.

248
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,320
 You haven't touched a thing.

249
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,520
 But Mother, I'm not hungry.

250
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,600
 - Henry, are you talking

251
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,520
 Because I wouldn't let you have that dollar to buy a box of candy for Virginia Lee.

252
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,820
 She was no mother.

253
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:57,620
 I'll give you my word.

254
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:58,880
 I'm not shocking.

255
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,320
 Well then, what is it?

256
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,920
 Don't you feel well?

257
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,020
 Yes, sure.

258
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,840
 I feel fine.

259
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,200
 Don't you remember the big breakfast I ate?

260
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,800
 Gee, I had toast.

261
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,800
 Note me, you're rude.

262
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:13,440
 Just the same, you're going to sit up there like a gentleman and eat.

263
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,400
 Did you do nicely in assembly, dear?

264
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,560
 In assembly?

265
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,840
 Yes, I was just talking on the phone with Agnes Lawson's mother before you came in.

266
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23,120
 She said something I didn't quite understand.

267
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,160
 It was something about you, you understand, Blake?

268
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,780
 Oh, yes.

269
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:29,280
 Yes, I was in the assembly this morning.

270
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,180
 And you took part in the program?

271
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:32,280
 Yes.

272
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:35,320
 Yes, I guess you'd say I took part in it, sort of.

273
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,160
 Well, it wasn't that nice here.

274
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,200
 You didn't tell me it back that you were going to.

275
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,160
 Well, it was sort of all of a sudden.

276
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,760
 What did you do, lead the Bible?

277
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,160
 No, nothing like that, Mother.

278
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,640
 I-- I don't want anything more.

279
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,840
 I think I'd better be going.

280
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,440
 Henry, you're here to eat your dessert before you leave.

281
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:53,680
 My dessert mother, but don't just see I've got a lot of my.

282
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,200
 If I don't get started back for school, I'm going to be late.

283
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,600
 Now you have plenty of time before you get back.

284
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,680
 What was it we were talking about?

285
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,440
 A white.

286
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,000
 I don't know.

287
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,080
 Oh, you wanted to tell me about your appearance in a sandblaze.

288
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,600
 My appearance?

289
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,760
 Yes, I thought you said you made an appearance.

290
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,480
 Oh, that.

291
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,520
 Henry, I'm just a bit provoked with you.

292
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,960
 There's no sense in being as modest as all that.

293
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:20,400
 I remember now Mrs. Lawson said something about you wearing a costume.

294
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,600
 A costume?

295
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,780
 Yes, and the students all laugh and say they've never seen anything so funny in their lives.

296
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:28,280
 Well, were you in a little sketch of some kind?

297
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,200
 A sketch?

298
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,320
 Your Uncle John, you know, was awfully good at entertaining like that.

299
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,600
 You almost went on the stage one, and you've always been very much like him.

300
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:41,400
 Like Uncle John, well, to tell you the truth of life, I just went up on the stage.

301
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,120
 That Mr. Bradley's request.

302
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,320
 Yes, and he held me up as an example.

303
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,800
 An example?

304
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,400
 An example of what?

305
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,960
 Well, it was this darn coat and I'm--

306
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,160
 Henry, what do you mean?

307
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,760
 Didn't you wear a costume?

308
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,360
 No, Mother, just a suit.

309
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,560
 Now I've got to go.

310
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:00,280
 Henry, do you mean Mr. Bradley didn't like the way you looked?

311
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,120
 Yes, I mean no, I mean--

312
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:02,680
 Goodbye.

313
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,600
 Henry, you mean it criticized your clothes?

314
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,960
 And, Mother, I've got to go.

315
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,080
 But Henry, wait!

316
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:10,120
 Hello?

317
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,480
 Hello, Alice, this is Sam.

318
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,920
 Sam, I'm glad you called.

319
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,440
 Alice, I've been thinking it over.

320
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,920
 If you want to let Henry have a dollar, go ahead.

321
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,520
 But first make it clear out that it's alone and not a gift.

322
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,720
 But Sam, he isn't upset about that dollar.

323
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:26,920
 Mr. Bradley called him up on the platform in assembly this morning and made a public example of his suit.

324
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:27,620
 What's that?

325
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:30,420
 That's what he did, Sam. And don't you think that's awful?

326
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,920
 Alice, what suit are you talking about?

327
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,420
 That nice brown tweet of yours that I had the tailor cut down for Henry.

328
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:36,920
 And Bradley said something about it?

329
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:41,320
 Yes, Sam, right in front of the whole school. And here he is exactly what I'm going to do.

330
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:55,500
 [Music]

331
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:58,320
 Hi, Henry. Wait a second. I'll walk to school with you.

332
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,200
 She was home. Have you seen George Bigelow?

333
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,080
 No. And listen, Henry is Virginia Lee in Paris.

334
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,920
 Is Virginia Lee in Paris?

335
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,920
 She was home and what she's so embarrassed about.

336
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:07,920
 What do you mean?

337
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,920
 Do you know what I heard her say to somebody? She's gonna change schools.

338
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:15,180
 Now there isn't anything to worry about Homer. All I have to do is collect my dollar from George Bigelow.

339
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:18,700
 Well, geez, you- you forget the whole thing.

340
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:22,800
 He means you'll forget your standing up there in the platform and assembly and shouting your name.

341
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:27,420
 Homer, I didn't shout it. It just- just slipped out. And incidentally, there he is.

342
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:31,520
 Hey George! George, come here a second. I guess you've forgotten something.

343
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,320
 Yeah? What did that I forgot?

344
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,420
 That dollar? That dollar you said you'd loan me.

345
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:37,720
 You're crazy, Henry. I'm not gonna loan you any dollar.

346
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,000
 You're crazy yourself.

347
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,920
 Homie, here was a witness to the whole thing.

348
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,200
 Sure, I was. Sure, I was.

349
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,920
 No, wait. Let me ask you something.

350
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:48,360
 Didn't I say I'd loan you the dollar provided you'd wear your coat inside out all day?

351
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,680
 But it wasn't my fault, Mr. Bradley made me change it.

352
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,000
 Well, was it my fault?

353
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 Now, listen, George, quick pushing Henry.

354
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,560
 Then tell him to get out of my way.

355
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,200
 Oh, no, George. You can't get by me until I get that money.

356
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,000
 What do you mean?

357
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,760
 Now, listen, George, let him alone.

358
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,160
 Hey, George, stop!

359
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,160
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

360
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:15,160
 Good afternoon, Mrs. Aldridge, how are you?

361
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,160
 Very well, thank you.

362
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,160
 I came over to the school to have a little talk with Mr. Bradley.

363
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,160
 Oh. Have you on a part of Mrs. Aldridge?

364
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,160
 An appointment?

365
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:26,160
 No, but it's rather important that I see him and I decided to come right over.

366
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:30,160
 Well, I'm sorry, but Mr. Bradley is going to be in conference during most of the afternoon.

367
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,160
 Why don't you come back tomorrow?

368
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,160
 Oh, no, I... Oh, just a minute, please.

369
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:36,160
 Hello? Oh yes, Mr. Digglow.

370
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,160
 George? He was in a fight.

371
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,160
 You don't say so, Mrs. Digglow.

372
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:51,160
 Well, Mr. Bradley's in a conference right now, but if you call over a little later, we might be able to squeeze you in. Yes. Good-bye.

373
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:55,160
 Now, Miss Shea, would you please tell Mr. Bradley that I'm out here?

374
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,160
 I'm quite sure he'll be only too glad to see me.

375
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:00,160
 Well, I'm sorry, but I have orders not to disturb him.

376
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,160
 You can't tell him I'm here?

377
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,460
 Then I'm afraid there's only one thing I can do.

378
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:06,860
 I'll sit down here and wait until he can see me.

379
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:09,160
 After all, there's a limit to everything.

 Hello.

383
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:21,660
 Doesn't anybody answer Homer?

384
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:22,360
 Not yet.

385
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,460
 How much time do we have before class, Henry?

386
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:25,660
 Three and a half minutes.

387
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:27,060
 If a clock in the store is right.

388
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,060
 Hello.

389
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,960
 Here, let me push you off a little more.

390
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,360
 Boy.

391
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,640
 How does my coat look in the back?

392
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,920
 Well, there's one nice thing about it, Henry.

393
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:35,920
 It isn't torn.

394
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,080
 I mean, the clock really isn't torn.

395
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:38,720
 It isn't?

396
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,840
 No, it's just nicely ripped, the whole length of the scene.

397
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,000
 Boy.

398
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:43,600
 Hello?

399
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,000
 Hello, is this Mr. Olrich?

400
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:45,520
 It is.

401
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,280
 Well, this is Homer Brown.

402
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,800
 Henry's banged up a little, and I've been asked to deliver a message for him.

403
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,360
 What's that?

404
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,920
 We've been trying to call Henry's mother, Mr. Olrich, and she doesn't seem to answer, see?

405
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,280
 Oh, but exactly. What is the trouble?

406
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,920
 That's what I'm going to tell you.

407
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,920
 Henry doesn't want to wear his coat to class this afternoon.

408
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:06,920
 And he wondered whether you are too busy to hop in the car and pick up one of his other coats

409
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,920
 and bring it over here to the Havens drugstore.

410
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:11,920
 Oh, but what's the reason he can't wear the coat he has on?

411
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,920
 Well, frankly, he's ashamed to wear it.

412
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,920
 Oh, Murr, you tell Henry that I said he's to wear that coat to class. Is that clear?

413
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:18,920
 He is.

414
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:22,920
 Yes, sir. And if anybody asks him why he's wearing it, he's to say that I told him to.

415
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:23,920
 Yes, Mr. Allers.

416
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:24,920
 Is that clear?

417
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:25,920
 Yes, sir.

418
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:26,920
 Very well then.

419
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:27,920
 Goodbye.

420
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:34,360
 Hey, Homer, what do you say? Well, I'll tell you you won't believe it, Henry, but here's what he told me to tell you

421
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:43,760
 We'll be back with the Aldrich family in just a moment right now

 Now getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldrich. Henry wore his coat wrong side

455
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:25,800
 out of the assembly this morning in order to borrow a dollar to buy chocolates for

456
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:30,960
 its latest girl and Henry's mother misunderstanding the entire episode as

457
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:35,840
 decided to call on the school principal. The scene opens in the Aldrich front hall

458
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,640
 and Harriet is speaking.

459
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,640
 Mary, is your mother here?

460
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,640
 No, she isn't, Anne-Harry.

461
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,640
 She isn't.

462
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,640
 No, she hasn't been home all afternoon.

463
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,640
 Well, is your father here?

464
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:50,640
 No, the only one that's here is Henry, and he's up in his room and he won't speak to anyone.

465
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,640
 What's the matter with him?

466
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:54,640
 He's just completely depressed, Anne-Harry. He won't even let me come near him.

467
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,640
 No.

468
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:59,640
 I warned him, though. I warned him at breakfast he better not get interested in that Virginia league.

469
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:02,640
 My goodness, Anne-Harry, do you know what Virginia league did do it?

470
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,640
 What? Well, you know how she has red hair, and I'll admit she's pretty.

471
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:08,640
 But that's no excuse for her not letting Henry become more party tonight.

472
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:13,220
 What's that and for no reason at all except that she doesn't like Henry's clothes or something

473
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:18,280
 Virginia Lee did that to Henry Mary. I don't believe it, but Ann how he did though

474
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,160
 Well, I know one thing if it's true

475
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:25,160
 I think her mother ought to know about it and I agree with you Anne Harriet and I just wish you call her up called her up

476
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:30,960
 Nothing. I'll go right over and have a talk with Mrs. Lee face to face. No one can break Henry's heart and get away with it

 Yes Alice, where are you now?

00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,360
 I'm still up here at the high school waiting to see Mr. Bradley.

481
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,280
 And he refuses to have anything to do with you?

482
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,240
 Yes, dear, and I think we ought to get this whole matter straightened out.

483
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,840
 Well, here's what I can do Alice.

484
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,320
 Joseph Lee is the head of the Board of Education now, isn't he?

00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,280
 Who is? Joseph Lee? Virginia Lee's father?

486
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,280
 Yes, over on Maple Street. And Alice, I'm going to get in touch with him.

487
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,280
 Well, dear, I think I ought to talk to him too.

488
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:07,280
 I'll call you as soon as I've gotten ahold of him, Alice. Don't worry.

489
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:20,780
 Gee, Henry, why don't you try to look at it this way?

490
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:24,780
 Homer, will you please get out of my room and go on downstairs and go home.

491
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:27,280
 But, Henry, you just don't understand Virginia.

492
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,840
 She's got a little temper, maybe.

493
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:29,940
 Sure, but...

494
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:30,940
 But...

495
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:32,440
 Do you know what I'm gonna do, Henry?

496
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,840
 I've just had an idea.

497
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:34,840
 You sit tight, see?

498
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,640
 I'm gonna fix everything all up for you.

499
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,640
 Now, wait a minute, Homer.

500
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,640
 Go with me, Henry.

501
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,280
 I'm gonna fix things up and you're going to that party tonight and have a swell time.

502
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,280
 But Homer!

503
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:54,920
 Now, wait a minute, Mrs. Orange.

504
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:57,000
 May I get just one word in here before you go off?

505
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 Mr. Lee, when I'm finished, you may say all you want to.

506
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,600
 I realize this is your home.

507
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,900
 But I've just got to get you straight on this matter of Henry and Mr. Bradley.

508
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:07,200
 Mrs. Oldridge, I think by this time I am straight.

509
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,700
 But Mrs. Lee doesn't understand. She says she doesn't understand one word.

510
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:13,700
 Why, of course I do the whole thing as as clear as anything.

511
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,500
 Mrs. Lee, just one minute ago, you say...

512
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,900
 Now, wait a minute, Alice. Let's take one thing at a time.

513
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:20,000
 Sam, I'm sorry, but I'm afraid I'm speaking.

514
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,300
 And so far, dear, you haven't done one bit of good.

515
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:24,600
 Alice, suppose you let me try to explain this whole thing

516
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,000
 And because there are some things about this that you don't know.

517
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,200
 Harriet, I don't like to interfere, but Alice is talking.

518
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,600
 Well, all I want to know is why Henry can't come to the party tonight.

00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:36,400
 I'm sorry, but it's Virginia's party and I don't usually agree with you.

520
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:40,000
 If Henry isn't wanted, he would certainly be the last one who would want to come.

521
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,200
 But the point is, I waited in Mr Bradley's office for two and one-half hours.

522
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:47,800
 And I want to know what the Board of Education is going to do about it.

523
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:50,600
 Mrs. Orridge, I regret to have to tell you that the Board of Education

524
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:54,200
 has absolutely nothing to do with what appointments Mr Bradley keeps or does not keep.

525
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,760
 Well Mr. Lee, under ordinary circumstances, I would say you were right.

526
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:59,100
 Sammy's not right. You're not agreeing with him, are you?

527
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,880
 I was saying he was agreeing with him.

528
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,600
 Now just a minute, Harriet. Just a minute.

529
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,280
 Hello, Mrs. Lee. Where's Virginia?

530
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,780
 Home of Brown, is that you?

531
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:07,400
 Yeah, I've got to see her. I've got to see her.

532
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,080
 Homer, would you mind getting out of this room?

533
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,240
 We happen to be in a conference.

534
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,280
 Oh, excuse me, but isn't Virginia here?

535
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,720
 Homer, we would like to be left alone.

536
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:16,080
 That's all right, Mr. Allrich. I can take care of Homer.

537
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,120
 Listen, Virginia. I've got to tell you something.

538
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,960
 And then we always tend you over here again.

539
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,860
 Virginia, that is no way to speak to a guest.

540
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:22,920
 And, Mother, I agree with you.

541
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,880
 But he isn't my guest, I don't want to see him.

542
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,000
 Virginia, do you know why Henry Warren's

543
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,040
 coat and assembly wrong side out this morning?

544
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:30,640
 What's that?

545
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,000
 I'm not even interested in why he did it.

546
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,400
 What do you mean wrong side out?

547
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,600
 Excuse me, Mr. Oldrich, but I want to tell Virginia something.

548
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,240
 And I want to ask you something.

552
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,720
 Just a second, Father, and I'll look out the back window.

553
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,720
 No, sir, and there isn't a thing in back of us.

554
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,720
 Just a second now while I pull up to the curb.

555
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:13,960
 Oh, now then, just a minute, Henry.

556
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:16,360
 Do you realize just what you did today?

557
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,560
 Yes, Father.

558
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:19,720
 You made a bit of a fool of yourself, didn't you?

559
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,360
 Right in front of the whole school.

560
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,560
 Yes, Father.

561
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:25,360
 You shouldn't have done it, even if it was for a woman.

562
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,560
 Yes, sir.

563
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,920
 I'll have to admit the girl in this case isn't bad looking,

564
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,600
 and in fact, she's rather pretty.

565
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,400
 Yes, Father.

566
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,920
 But that is still no excuse.

567
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:33,960
 Yes, sir.

568
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:37,320
 She, how could I ever happen to do a thing like that?

569
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,120
 She am I ashamed of myself.

570
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,720
 I'm glad to hear you say that.

571
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,120
 Here, let me open the door for you.

572
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,760
 Now, go on into Virginia's party and have a good time.

573
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,200
 Thank you, Father.

574
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,280
 And I want to tell you both how very sorry I am

575
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,040
 that I embarrassed you so much today.

576
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:51,960
 That's all right, dear.

577
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,080
 Now, go on in.

578
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:53,600
 OK.

579
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,960

 Wait a minute, Sam.

581
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:03,280
 Look at the living room window up there on the porch.

582
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,360
 Yeah.

583
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,200
 Quite a crowd.

584
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,240
 Well, they're dancing.

585
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,240
 There's Homer Brown and Agnes and George Bigelow.

586
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:12,240
 I wonder who's playing the piano. It's lovely.

587
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,240
 Alice, was that Henry? I just saw him there.

588
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,240
 Yes, and he's dancing already with Virginia Lee.

589
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:22,240
 Not a bad looking young man, is he? Quite a gentleman.

590
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,240
 He certainly does look nice.

591
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,240
 Only Sam, look at the way Virginia's laughing at him.

592
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,240
 What in the world is Henry doing?

593
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,240
 What's that?

594
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,240
 He's dancing with something on his head.

595
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,240
 Alice, that's a lampshade. What's he doing that for?

596
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:37,240
 - I'm going that far. - Say it, it's not his...

597
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:40,240
 And right after Henry promised faithfully...

598
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:44,240

 No, he isn't. Is there any message? This is his father.

00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:22,440
 Oh, this is Virginia. I just wanted to tell Henry how much he added to the party last night.

603
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,240
 Very well.

00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:26,240
 Oh, my goodness, I never laughed so hard. No, my life.

605
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,740
 I guess he's starting to guess it from that actor.

608
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:33,340
