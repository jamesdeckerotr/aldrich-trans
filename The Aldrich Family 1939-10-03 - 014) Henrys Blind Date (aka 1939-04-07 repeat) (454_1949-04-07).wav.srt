00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,400
 Henry Henry Audrey!

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,600
 Coming, Mother.

00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 The Aldrich family, starring as Restoned, written by Clifford Goldsmith,

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,500
 Brought to you by Jell-O-footing, those delicious new desserts all America's talking about.

00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,800
 The Aldrich family can be seen now in the current Paramount picture of what alive.

9
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,500
 Don't miss it.

10
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:59,500
 And tonight Betty Field, one of the stars of the picture, plays Barbara Pearson, Henry's current girlfriend.

11
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:04,500
 As usual on the air, the part of Henry Aldrich is played by Ezra Stone.

12
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:10,500
 In the living room of the Aldrich home, Mr. and Mrs. Aldrich are talking.

13
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,500
 Henry is just coming in through the hall door.

14
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,500
 Well, then, remember how worried we were a week ago?

15
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:17,500
 Over Henry.

16
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:18,500
 Over Henry.

17
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,500
 And that terrible constant mark.

18
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,040
 Who's interested in this week?

19
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,960
 He's coming back to Barbara Pearson.

20
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,260
 Mother!

21
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:27,180
 Yes, Henry.

22
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:28,720
 May I ask you a question?

23
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,280
 Yes.

24
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,260
 Are you sure you won't mind if I ask him?

25
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:32,560
 Well, no.

26
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,000
 Could I have $3?

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,320
 We're all.

28
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,300
 Could I please?

29
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,160
 What for?

30
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,840
 Well, I've got to get something, mother, before it's gone.

31
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,200
 Can't you tell me what it is?

32
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,000
 Well, you'll just think it's foolish.

33
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,040
 Then I'm afraid, dear.

34
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,200
 You cannot have the $3.

35
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,600
 You mean you don't trust me?

36
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,440
 Well, would you mind not standing directly in my light, Henry?

37
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,800
 I'm sorry, Father.

38
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,760
 Why don't you ask your father, Father?

39
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:56,320
 I know he wouldn't give it to me.

40
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,320
 Would your father?

41
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,000
 Would you?

42
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,680
 No, would I want?

43
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,400
 Well, I'll tell you, this is all I want.

44
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,280
 This is all there is to it.

45
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,320
 Practically every guy I know that's got a girl

46
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,280
 has given her something to wear.

47
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,720
 Henry, you mean the boys give their things

48
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,640
 to wear nowadays?

49
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,040
 Oh, sure, it may sound a little strange,

50
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,480
 but I mean things like class pin.

51
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,560
 Only my class hasn't got a pin.

52
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,120
 - Well, I thought you did give Barbara

53
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,360
 some kind of a pin.

54
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,920
 - I did, mother, but she isn't crazy about it.

55
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,720
 - Why not?

56
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,000
 - Well, in the first place, all it says on it

57
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,240
 is vote the Democratic ticket.

58
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,800
 Would you like it if that was all somebody

59
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,040
 could afford to give you?

60
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,840
 - But the important thing is the sentiment behind it.

61
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,040
 - I know if that's a trouble.

62
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,680
 Her father's a Republican.

63
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,720
 - A Republican?

64
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,560
 - Yeah.

65
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,760
 - But I think you'd better stay away

66
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,260
 from their house in the future.

67
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:49,060
 This is no time to joke.

68
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:50,860
 Here's the position I'm in.

69
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:55,660
 I told Barbara, in fact I practically promised her I'd give her a pin.

70
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:58,460
 You know, the one I saw downtown, the jewelry store.

71
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:01,560
 Henry, dear, knowing Barbara Pearson as I do,

72
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:05,060
 I don't believe that what you give her is even slightly important.

73
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:09,060
 But she was there, thought you wanted me to take an interest in Barbara Pearson.

74
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:13,460
 I even promised her I'd never go inside Constant Marshall's house again.

75
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,060
 Wouldn't you like encouragement?

76
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:19,140
 Henry, you may not under any circumstances have any money.

77
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:20,740
 I'm not asking for money, mother.

78
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:21,820
 You're not.

79
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,380
 I've given that up.

80
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:24,620
 When did you give it up?

81
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:26,100
 Just now.

82
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,220
 This is all I want.

83
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:29,700
 Now, don't fly off the handle, father.

84
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:32,540
 It isn't as bad as it's going to sound at first.

85
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:36,700
 You know that gold five beta cap of key you wear on your watch chain?

86
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:37,580
 I do.

87
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:38,940
 Well, uh...

88
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:41,260
 Do you wear that quite a little?

89
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:43,820
 You mean to say you're going to ask me for it?

90
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:48,140
 Well, don't you ever get tired of it and wish you could wear something else now and then?

91
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:52,380
 In other words, you want to give Barbara Pearson my five-eighter capacity.

92
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:54,300
 You feel that strong about it?

93
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,340
 That's wrong.

94
00:03:55,340 --> 00:04:01,100
 I'm just suggesting you loan it to her father and you can go back to the vote the Democratic ticket pin.

95
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:04,540
 Hi, Henry. Mind the black men?

96
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:05,660
 Come on in, Dizzy.

97
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:08,220
 I want to speak to you alone, Henry.

98
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,420
 Good evening, Dizzy.

99
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:10,940
 Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Aldrich.

100
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:12,220
 Good evening, Dizzy.

101
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:14,140
 Henry, I've got to speak to you alone.

102
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:15,020
 What about?

103
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:15,940
 Just something.

104
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:17,420
 Can't you tell him here, Dizzy?

105
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:20,220
 Oh, this is in strict confidence, Mrs. Alders.

106
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:23,260
 Well, I'm trying to get a decision about something, Dizzy.

107
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:26,620
 Henry, if I were you, I'd go out and see what Dizzy wants.

108
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:27,340
 Okay.

109
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:29,260
 Come on out here in the hall, Henry.

110
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:30,060
 It's private?

111
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,180
 Wait till I tell you.

112
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:35,020
 Can anyone hear through that door?

113
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:35,900
 No.

114
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,820
 What are you doing tomorrow, Eden?

115
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:38,620
 Why?

116
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:39,980
 Well, hold on to something.

117
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,780
 How would you like a blind date?

118
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:43,780
 A blind date?

119
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:44,780
 Sure.

120
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:45,780
 Me?

121
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:46,780
 She's a dream.

122
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:48,780
 Henry, you never saw a prettier girl in your life.

123
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:49,780
 Have you seen her?

124
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:50,780
 No, but my girl has.

125
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:53,780
 But I've got a date tomorrow night with Barbara Pearson.

126
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:56,780
 Listen, Henry, you can see Barbara anytime.

127
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:57,780
 But this girl?

128
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:00,780
 She's visiting my girl only a few days.

129
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:01,780
 Oh, I see.

130
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:02,780
 Well, you see, does he...

131
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:05,780
 I just got one misunderstanding straightened out with Barbara.

132
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:08,780
 You don't help me out, I'm sunk.

133
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:12,240
 Henry, what are you and Izzy talking about out there in the hall?

134
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,580
 Oh nothing mother.

135
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:16,780
 We were just discussing a problem I had Mrs. Aldrin.

136
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:19,140
 If you don't mind, I'll leave this door open.

137
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:21,580
 It's terribly close in the living room.

138
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:24,580
 Well, let's go into the dining room.

139
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:27,380
 Don't you think you ought to get to know other girls?

140
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:29,180
 Do you want to stay in a ruff?

141
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:31,980
 That's what started the trouble I just got over.

142
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,580
 Look, will this help?

143
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:35,980
 Supposing I get the girl on the telephone.

144
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:36,580
 Why?

145
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:37,980
 So you can sound around?

146
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:42,400
 "No." "Then what can I do to convince you?" "Well, uh...

147
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:48,320
 Have you got three dollars?" "For what?" "Well, just as a loan."

148
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:53,640
 "Listen, she's begging for a chance to meet you. Meet me?" "Sure!"

149
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:59,940
 "I think you know about me. If I remember correctly, she thinks she saw you on the street

150
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:04,620
 the other day." "Say come to think?" "I wonder if she's

151
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:09,540
 a one-ice walk does she have a high black hat with a sort of a veil that sure

152
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:16,200
 is that right who has a black hat in the veil nobody father would you mind

153
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:22,560
 talking so I either can hear you or so I can't maybe we better go in the kitchen

154
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,180
 okay

155
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:30,960
 now do you see what's ahead of you Henry the only thing let me call her up and

156
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,600
 ask her whether she's got a bail. Do you have any way of raising three dollars, Dizzy?

157
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:40,080
 I've got to pay you to meet a beautiful girl? I promise, Barbara, that when I see you tomorrow

158
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:45,680
 night, I'll have a pen for it. All right, you wait. You wait. Just you wait until sometime you

159
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:50,080
 ask me to do something for you. I'm sorry, Henry, but you both have to get out of this kitchen

160
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:55,120
 while I do some work here. Where do we go now, Henry? Let's go upstairs. Your father just went

161
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,680
 upstairs, Henry. Well, then let's go out and have him been in the living room yet. That's right.

162
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,180
 Come on, let's go in there.

163
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:03,880
 Would you boys mind telling me what all this is about?

164
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:07,180
 I'm trying to make Henry see the light, Mrs. Allred.

165
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:10,980
 See, Henry, I've got an idea.

166
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:14,380
 I haven't got a pin you could give, Bobber, but I've got a lady's ring.

167
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:15,180
 Where'd you get it?

168
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:15,980
 I found it.

169
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:17,680
 I found it in a trash pile.

170
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,480
 Is it any good?

171
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,180
 It's gold with a black stone and pearls.

172
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:24,080
 And if I help you out tomorrow night, you'll give it to me?

173
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,580
 Well, I won't give it to you, but I'll loan it to you.

174
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:27,980
 Say yes, Henry.

175
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,980
 Well, of shaking, we'll make it a bargain.

176
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:31,980
 No.

177
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:34,980
 If I give you the ring out, right, will you let me?

178
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:37,980
 And I can tell Barbara to keep us sure.

179
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,980
 And it isn't going to cost me anything?

180
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:40,980
 Not a cent.

181
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,980
 All we'll do is sit around in the house.

182
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:44,980
 Something tells me dizzy.

183
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:46,980
 I shouldn't say yes.

184
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:50,980
 And something tells you that you shouldn't say no to, doesn't it?

185
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:53,980
 Remember that black hat with the veil?

186
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:54,980
 Yeah.

187
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:56,980
 Go ahead.

188
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,980
 Hello, operating?

189
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,980
 Alfa, fire!

190
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,980
 I want Elm, free, free, free!

191
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:06,980
 From now on, Henry, your lucky number is free.

192
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:09,980
 Are you going free, free, free?

193
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:11,980
 Yes, ma'am.

194
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:13,980
 I wonder if she's doing anything tonight.

195
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:19,980
 The only thing is to see, even if you do get this girl, you can't tell from her voice what she looks like.

196
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:20,980
 Why not?

197
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:24,980
 All I've got to do is hear one word and I can size up a girl in a minute.

198
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:28,740
 minute. Oh, what was that?

199
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:33,780
 Listen, if that's the girl you're trying to get for me, does he? You can hang up. Who is this

200
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:34,420
 speaking?

201
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:42,820
 Hang up, my girl's aunt. Oh, what is going on here? Nothing, Father. Hello, this is

202
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,340
 Dizzy. All the girls in?

203
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:52,260
 Out? Ask her whether her friend, you know, your girlfriend's friend has a veil. Does your

204
00:08:52,260 --> 00:09:07,440
 Nice have a veil. Mrs. Hopkins you can tell that will be all set for tomorrow. Thank you

205
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:14,060
 Mrs. Hopkins. Goodbye. Your boys find the veil. Well only in the way we did father.

206
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:20,460
 Henry could you walk to the door with me? Sure. All I want to say Henry. If you don't

207
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,720
 I want to all take it.

208
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,460
 Oh, you don't. I saw her first, didn't I?

209
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:25,960
 When do I get that ring?

210
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,360
 I'll get it for you by noon tomorrow.

211
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,660
 Why not before then?

212
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,460
 I've got to get it from my girl.

213
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:32,460
 From your girl?

214
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:33,860
 Sure, she's wearing it.

215
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:34,960
 She's wearing it?

216
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,060
 At night, Henry.

217
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,460
 Hey, Disney.

218
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:41,460
 I wonder whether Barbara will mind if she finds that out.

219
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:44,460
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

220
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:47,200
 (dramatic music)

221
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:57,760
 - What's the matter, grandmother?

222
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,700
 - What are you flying around so far?

223
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,960
 - This is the evening Henry's coming over.

224
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,500
 - Huh, you suppose you bring a box candy?

225
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,900
 - What is the evening paper?

226
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,020
 - Right here.

227
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,820
 - Let me have the movie section.

228
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:12,880
 - Grandmother, will you promise me something?

229
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,720
 - Huh?

230
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:18,040
 that you won't embarrass me by asking him whether he ever sees any other girls.

231
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,960
 Oh my goodness, don't you think you're not alone?

232
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,880
 It makes it look as though I were worried.

233
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,240
 Oh, God, she should be.

234
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,800
 Here's a picture I'd like to see.

235
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:29,560
 All right, if I come in.

236
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,600
 Hello, Henry.

237
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,000
 I've only got a second, then I've got to be going.

238
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,880
 So soon.

239
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,920
 Oh, Henry?

240
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,600
 Good evening, Mrs. Anderson.

241
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,080
 Did I hear you say, young man, you can't stay?

242
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,720
 Well, something came up quite unexpectedly.

243
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:46,720
 You don't say how the constant marshal these days.

244
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,720
 Oh, she haven't seen her for over a week.

245
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,720
 Mm-hmm.

246
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,720
 I'm never going to see constants again.

247
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:57,720
 Well, you know, excuse me, I'll go out in the kitchen and make some candy.

248
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:02,720
 The only reason why I have to go so soon is because I have an examination of Marlborough.

249
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,720
 And what?

250
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,720
 In Geometry.

251
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,720
 By the way, I just happened to think I brought you something.

252
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:10,720
 My section doesn't have an examination of Geometry tomorrow.

253
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,320
 You know? I wonder how you could account for a thing like that.

254
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,120
 Oh, wonder.

255
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,960
 Well, here's what I brought you.

256
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,920
 What is it?

257
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,360
 It's instead of a pin.

258
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,040
 Henry, I hope you didn't go and get me something expensive.

259
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,960
 Well, I just hope you'll like it.

260
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:28,960
 Henry, oh, look at it. It's a ridge.

261
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,840
 Sure.

262
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,880
 Oh, Henry, you shouldn't have brought anything like this.

263
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,480
 Oh, I didn't pay much for it.

264
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,960
 It's a little too large for that thing, dude.

265
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,240
 Well, try the next thing.

266
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,080
 Too large for that one.

267
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,080
 Well, how about the next one?

268
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,080
 It's still too big.

269
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,080
 Do you suppose you could wear it on your thumb?

270
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:50,080
 I know. I'll wear it on this chain around my neck.

271
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:54,080
 Hey, do I make a candy? Why don't we all go to the movie tonight?

272
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:57,080
 It's a picture called Man Crazy that I want to see.

273
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:02,080
 But Mrs. Sanderson, I've got a geometry exam coming.

274
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,080
 I think you've got your schedule mixed in.

275
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:08,080
 I'm sure I am. And Dizzy has the same schedule I have.

276
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:12,280
 Let me give you some advice young man. I never studied geometry in my life

277
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:18,820
 There isn't anything going on that I don't know about well if it's money it's worrying you the trick is beyond me

278
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:23,920
 Oh, that isn't it. I've got you want to go go get your coat on bobber and we'll stop grandmother

279
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:30,600
 Maybe he doesn't want to go. Well, of course, I might be able to you want to call your parents an ask

280
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:35,040
 I don't think you need to you want me to laugh on them. Oh, no, you don't have to

281
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,960
 No, you suppose that is.

282
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,960
 They were all after the door.

283
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:42,960
 Do you think that you really could go with us?

284
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:47,960
 I'd certainly like to, but if I don't get my studying done tonight, when will I?

285
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,960
 Good evening, Mrs. Anderson. This Henry here?

286
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,960
 You certainly are.

287
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:52,960
 Is that you, Dizzy?

288
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,960
 Hurry up, Henry. We're going to be late.

289
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:56,960
 Late for where?

290
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,960
 We plan to study together.

291
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,960
 Study what?

292
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,960
 Our geometry. Our geometry.

293
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,960
 When?

294
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,960
 Now you dope over at my house.

295
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,960
 Oh yeah! You don't say so.

296
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:12,960
 Didn't I tell you it wasn't tonight that you'd have to study in the week?

297
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:17,960
 Well whether it is or not, uh, Dizzy, I think you'll have to study without me.

298
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:22,960
 Huh? Um, could I have a little conference with you out in the hall?

299
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,960
 It isn't necessary to talk it over.

300
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,960
 Speak to me in private?

301
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:30,960
 Uh, Bob, would that's a nice ring you're wearing around your neck?

302
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:35,360
 Yes, you are. Let me see it. It's gold. Now, where did you get it?

303
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,000
 Hand my baby to me. Oh, is that right?

304
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,480
 Uh, I'll go out my hall with you, Dizzy.

305
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:45,520
 Why don't we all stay here and study? Well, I have to be alone when I study,

306
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:48,240
 Barbara. That's why you got to be with Henry?

307
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,720
 Are you sure you understand, Barbara? Of course.

308
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:57,040
 If you tell me you have to study, you have to. Sure.

309
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,840
 It never occurred to me that I shouldn't understand.

310
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,840
 Well...

311
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,240
 Goodbye.

312
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,040
 Goodbye.

313
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,040
 Don't study too late, boy.

314
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,540
 Oh, we won't, Mr. Sanderfuss.

315
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:09,740
 Hurry up, Henry.

316
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:11,740
 Tony's been waiting for us for 20 minutes.

317
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:12,640
 Who has?

318
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,040
 Constance Marshall.

319
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,640
 She's my girl, now, you dulpe.

320
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,440
 Since when?

321
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,640
 Since you finished with her.

322
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,340
 This is a fine time to tell me.

323
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:21,940
 I can't go over there.

324
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:24,540
 I promise, Barbara, I wouldn't see her anymore.

325
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,740
 I'm not seeing her. I'm seeing her.

326
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,940
 You just happen to be going over to her house?

327
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:29,940
 No.

328
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:32,740
 Do you want me to go back and ask Barbara for that ring?

329
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:34,140
 I'd like to see you.

330
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:36,140
 Oh, you don't think I do it, eh?

331
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:37,740
 I'll go right back into my house.

332
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:38,740
 Wait, is he waiting?

333
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:39,940
 Are you going?

334
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:41,740
 I'll stick by you.

335
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:46,340
 But something tells me I'm going to be sorry for as long as I live.

336
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:57,180
 Henry and Disney are just going up the steps of constant smart little town

337
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:01,660
 For some reason or other Henry doesn't look very cheerful

338
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:08,260
 43 high street

339
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:10,340
 Didn't I tell you three years of lucky number?

340
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:17,420
 Hi, ya Connie. Why Henry? Oh, did I thought Connie wasn't ever gonna see you again?

341
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:21,900
 Hi, ya Connie. He got lonesome. I got lonesome. Oh, come on in

342
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:27,440
 Where's uh, where's- Oh, of course. Just a minute now, Cola.

343
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,840
 Gwendolyn! Gwendolyn!

344
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,840
 Is that her name?

345
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,040
 What do you have?

346
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,240
 Dizzy, I'm going home.

347
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:36,440
 Well, well, well. If it isn't Henry himself.

348
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,640
 And you're just as cute as I thought you'd be.

349
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:41,440
 Gwendolyn, that isn't Henry. That's Dizzy.

350
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,740
 You mean... this one here is Henry?

351
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:45,740
 Yes.

352
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:46,740
 Well...

353
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,240
 I'm sorry.

354
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,640
 What are you putting down your hat for, Henry?

355
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,940
 Well, I thought we were going to stay.

356
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:55,280
 Oh my goodness, what can we do here?

357
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,240
 We're going out?

358
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,080
 Don't you like to go out at night, Henry?

359
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,780
 Sure he does, don't you, Henry?

360
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:01,580
 We want to go to the movies.

361
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:02,520
 In the movies?

362
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:05,420
 Yeah, we want to see men crazy.

363
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:06,480
 I know, but...

364
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,420
 Come on, little, get our things on.

365
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:11,620
 I better wear my coat in case we get some ice cream after work.

366
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:14,360
 Dizzy, I haven't got enough money to take them out.

367
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,760
 You don't have to pay for all of this.

368
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,360
 Just for yourself and Glamoury.

369
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,460
 I know, but I haven't even enough for that.

370
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:29,460
 For that? For that? Oh, just some. You told me this wouldn't cost anything. And did you take a look at Gwendolyn? One helping of ice cream isn't going to be enough for her.

371
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:38,460
 Henry, cheer up. 25 years from now you'll be able to look back and laugh at this. Sure. 25 years from now, but this is tonight.

372
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:41,460
 Henry, you're beginning to make me sorry I brought you.

373
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:48,460
 But, Dizzy, she's not the girl I saw on the street. No wonder she wears a veil. What she should do was wear it in the house.

374
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:50,460
 Now I am sorry.

375
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:52,460
 Well, we're already dizzy.

376
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:56,460
 Uh, Quentin and you leave dizzy alone. Henry is your property.

377
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:58,460
 I'm her property?

378
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:00,460
 That's what I'll call ya, my prop.

379
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:03,460
 Come on, prop. Let me take you on.

380
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:07,460
 The only thing is I promised my folks I'd be in early.

381
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:11,460
 But you don't belong to them anymore? You belong to me.

382
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:14,460
 Look at them own, Henry.

383
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:20,940
 Yeah. And look at those three stars right up over us. Yeah. Henry, didn't I tell

384
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:26,300
 you three as your lucky number? Let's get on this street. D.C. go Connie something.

385
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:31,020
 Why did you want me to give back that ring? Well I had to do a favor for

386
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:35,780
 somebody. You didn't give it to any other girl did you? No. Say look

387
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:41,980
 Constance here on the corner. What is it? A soda fountain. Yeah? Oh boy do they

388
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:44,280
 They serve terrible sodas in there.

389
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,780
 Listen, these are good.

390
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:47,480
 Look in the window there, Henry.

391
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,480
 At what?

392
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,780
 Those boxes of candy.

393
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:52,380
 Don't you think we're going to be late for the first show?

394
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,980
 Oh, we don't care whether we're late.

395
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:56,380
 It looks like an awfully nice place inside.

396
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:59,580
 Would you like to go in and get waves?

397
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:02,980
 Say, you can't get me on any scales.

398
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:06,080
 Well, why don't we stop here after the show?

399
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,580
 I never liked to eat anything just before I go to bed.

400
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:10,380
 Come on, Henry.

401
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,700
 You might as well go in and get it over with.

402
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:13,700
 Mmm!

403
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:18,540
 Both those roasted almonds smell good.

404
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:19,540
 Don't they?

405
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:21,660
 Where shall we sit?

406
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:24,580
 Let's take this table here by the candy counter.

407
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:25,580
 Okay.

408
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:26,580
 Good evening.

409
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:27,580
 What do you have?

410
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:30,180
 I'll have a chocolate marshmallow.

411
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:31,180
 Same here.

412
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,180
 Same here.

413
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:35,100
 Make it free chocolate marshmallows.

414
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,700
 I want glass of water.

415
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:37,700
 Why, Henry.

416
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,700
 Aren't you going to eat anything?

417
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:40,960
 I'm in training.

418
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,960
 Oh, isn't that true bad?

419
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,640
 Read chocolate marshmallows in the glass of water.

420
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,640
 Right.

421
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,440
 You ought to change your mind, Henry. They're good here.

422
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,400
 All right, then?

423
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,640
 Why, Henry? What are you worrying about?

424
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,040
 Worried? Worried?

425
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,200
 Who's worried?

426
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,280
 Say, Dizzy, let's go down there to the end of the star and look at those magazines.

427
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,080
 Why do we have to look at those?

428
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,960
 Oh, please, Dizzy, Izzy.

429
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:05,760
 Oh...

430
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,760
 I don't think you'll ask me.

431
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:12,360
 Well, I guess Connie and Henry are all alone.

432
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,560
 I guess we are.

433
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:18,160
 Henry, no thanks normal picturesque.

434
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,260
 You don't think the longs are these?

435
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,260
 Oh, you're not a...

436
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:24,360
 Henry, that Bob repressed in a grandmother.

437
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:27,260
 Constance, would you understand if I should go...

438
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:29,560
 And leave me at the table all alone?

439
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,760
 Where's Henry?

440
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:31,760
 Oh, Richard.

441
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,260
 Good evening, Mrs. Anderson.

442
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:35,260
 Henry!

443
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:37,260
 Oh, your geometry.

444
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,880
 Constance, I guess you know...

445
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,120
 Mrs. Sanderson and Barbara don't know.

446
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,220
 Oh, yeah!

447
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:43,880
 Would...

448
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,360
 Would you like to sit down here with us?

449
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,480
 No, thank you, Henry, all of the time.

450
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,280
 I wouldn't even be slightly interested.

451
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,760
 Oh, you wouldn't, wouldn't you, Barbara?

452
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,760
 What is that you got on that chain?

453
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,760
 That happens to be a ring, thank you.

454
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:59,500
 That happens to be my ring, thank you.

455
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,880
 So that's why he asked me for it.

456
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,880
 I didn't ask you for it.

457
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:08,120
 You'll needn't explain Henry Arch. Take your hard ring.

458
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,400
 But I don't want it.

459
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,400
 This whole thing is a mistake.

460
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,560
 You take it off right away.

461
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:16,840
 I don't know anything foolish, young lady. That's gold.

462
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,600
 What if it is there?

463
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:22,520
 Oh my. Where did it go?

464
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:25,880
 Henry, all the time. I think you're contentable.

465
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,880
 Listen, Barbara, let me tell you.

466
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:30,920
 No. Aren't you going to introduce me to your friends, Henry?

467
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,920
 Gwendolyn, please go away.

468
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,920
 And what's more, Henry Otis?

469
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:37,920
 I think you're the meanest person who never drew the life of breath.

470
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,920
 The life of breath.

471
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,920
 The life of breath.

472
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,920
 Where did that ring go?

473
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,920
 What do I kid?

474
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,920
 I'm going home.

475
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,920
 You're going to let a thing like this spoil the movies for you?

476
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:49,920
 Yes.

477
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,920
 Oh, life of breath.

478
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,920
 A life of breath.

479
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,920
 See, who does she think she is?

480
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,920
 Well, what I want to know is who dizzy thinks he is.

481
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:02,080
 Huh! Giving my ring to that little snip.

482
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,760
 Pardon me. You hear your Sundays and hears you check.

483
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,880
 Say, yeah. Where is Dizzy?

484
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,560
 One day came in, he left.

485
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,560
 He left? Yeah.

486
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,320
 That'll be 45 cents.

487
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,000
 You like to pay for it now?

488
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,160
 I'd like to, but I can.

489
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,560
 This is a nice predicament.

490
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:39,280
 [Music]

491
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,080
 Oh, look y'all, Austin! I'm going to the door!

492
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,840
 [Music]

493
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,600
 Oh, you!

494
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,100
 Yes, Mrs. Sanderson.

495
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:50,600
 Oh, you're the last person in the world, I expected to see tonight?

496
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,600
 If, um...

497
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,600
 If Barbara hasn't gone to bed yet...

498
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,600
 Could you tell her I'm here, please?

499
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:59,600
 Oh, cool. I don't think it'll do any good.

500
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,600
 Barbara?

501
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,600
 Barbara!

502
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,600
 You probably heard you.

503
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,600
 Yes, Grandma.

504
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,600
 From here a minute.

505
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,600
 Where are you?

506
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,600
 I'm in the front hall!

507
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,600
 Well...

508
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,600
 Hello, Barbara.

509
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,600
 Oh.

510
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:18,280
 Oh, all I want to do is tell you exactly what happened.

511
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,720
 I know what happened.

512
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,720
 But you don't.

513
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,080
 Come on in out of the cold, Henry.

514
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,080
 All right.

515
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,480
 I don't think I better come on in.

516
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:25,980
 Come in.

517
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:28,120
 I won't let her hurt you.

518
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,360
 Yes, ma'am.

519
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:33,880
 No matter what you say, Henry, it won't do a bit of good.

520
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,680
 The only reason I didn't stay here

521
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,360
 with you in the first place, Barbara,

522
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:40,640
 was because I had a blind date night.

523
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,080
 A blind date?

524
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,000
 Wait, you've only heard the beginning.

525
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,600
 That's all I want to hear.

526
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,760
 You've got to hear it all.

527
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:51,080
 That ring I gave it didn't even belong to me.

528
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:53,680
 A beautiful sentiment to say the least.

529
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,480
 Oh, wait.

530
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,760
 Now, wait a minute.

531
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,520
 It didn't belong to any girl.

532
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,800
 If it belonged to Dizzy, he found it.

533
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:00,300
 Where?

534
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:02,400
 In a trash pile.

535
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,360
 Yeah, trash pile.

536
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,520
 And that's what I was wearing around my neck.

537
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,160
 But I still haven't finished.

538
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,360
 Well, from the progress you're making young men.

539
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:12,600
 may be just as well if you don't finish.

540
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,080
 And if you excuse me, I'm going upstairs.

541
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:19,240
 You don't want to hear the rest of Christ I don't.

542
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,240
 She was--

543
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,960
 Ah, Henry, old Regeira, genius.

544
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,320
 But she's so unreasonable.

545
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:28,200
 She won't even listen to me.

546
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:33,080
 Mrs. Sanderson, what would you do in a case like this?

547
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,880
 You want me to tell you what I do?

548
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,240
 Yeah.

549
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,640
 I'd stop trying to make things up.

550
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,240
 I tell her what really did happen.

551
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:43,520
 That's what I've been doing.

552
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,440
 That's the truth.

553
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:47,560
 Then I'd start him with something she could believe.

554
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,360
 You mean I should lie to her?

555
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,200
 No, I'm not saying you should lie to her.

556
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,720
 But in this case, I certainly wouldn't tell her

557
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,680
 any more of the truth.

558
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,760
 What should I do?

559
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,080
 Let me tell you something, young man.

560
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,360
 And if you remember, it's going to help you just as much

561
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,080
 as geometry, ever will.

562
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:05,920
 What is it?

563
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:09,420
 No woman is going to believe what you want her to.

564
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:11,520
 Oh, what is she going to believe?

565
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,120
 What she wants to do.

566
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:13,920
 Is that right?

567
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,020
 Yes, sir.

568
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:18,320
 At least that's the way it is to every woman I've ever known.

569
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:21,020
 And when I call Barbara down here again,

570
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:22,820
 don't try to push her into believing

571
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:24,520
 what you think she should think.

572
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:28,820
 Well, if you don't mind, I'd rather not see her.

573
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:29,520
 No, no, no.

574
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,520
 Now you wait for you.

575
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,020
 Barbara?

576
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:35,020
 Barbara?

577
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:37,020
 There's no use in my trying anymore

578
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:45,820
 See what I mean when I say they believe what they want to

579
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:54,500
 You better be careful how you talk young lady up until this evening

580
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:58,800
 I always thought it was the nicest boy I'd ever known and then hello

581
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:02,860
 Didn't I tell you to be careful you've got a listen Barbara?

582
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:10,480
 No, but that wasn't really dizzy's ring now. We have a new story, but it wasn't really his who's was it?

583
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,560
 well

584
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,560
 That's something I can't tell you I

585
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:21,140
 Asked my mother it didn't ever it didn't ever belong to your mother. Did it my mother? Yes

586
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:23,840
 No

587
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,480
 Henry it's dead

588
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:31,420
 Why didn't you admit it in the first place? Well, because I didn't want it. Yeah, man. What?

589
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,280
 I got the anymore stories.

590
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,280
 She's not making this up grandmother.

591
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,280
 How do you know?

592
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:43,280
 Because, Henry, if it did belong to your mother, I'm sorry I pulled the ring away.

593
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,280
 Y'all?

594
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,280
 Of course I am.

595
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,280
 Well, here it is.

596
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,280
 Grandmother.

597
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:52,280
 Have you excused me? I think I'll go up to bed.

598
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:55,280
 I hope you sleep well, Mrs. Anderson.

599
00:25:55,280 --> 00:26:01,280
 By the way, Henry Aldrich, the story's alright as far as it goes.

600
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,640
 Well, what were you doing Constance Marshall?

601
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,040
 With Constance Marshall?

602
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:08,840
 Do you want to know the truth?

603
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,360
 Of course I do.

604
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,880
 Well, that's easy to explain.

605
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,880
 We started out and...

606
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,720
 You what?

607
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:20,040
 Well, my father wanted me to study my geometry.

608
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,680
 But you entered the soda fountain instead?

609
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,640
 Well...

610
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,960
 And that was where you ran into Constance?

611
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:26,480
 Yeah.

612
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,800
 Henry.

613
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,720
 Sure.

614
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:35,260
 Doesn't that just go to show you what a person's imagination can do? I'll say

615
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:40,780
 Are you sure you didn't make that up about your father wanting you to stop it? No

616
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:43,460
 your profit trip

617
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:45,980
 Because the whole thing sounds so simple

618
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:54,940
 At the yes, mr. Sanderson your father just bones you want you to come right home and do your geometry. He does

619
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:57,660
 Well, what do you know about that?

620
00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:02,060
 Don't ever tell me anything but the truth again, Henry.

621
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:04,060
 I'll say I won't.

622
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:13,060
