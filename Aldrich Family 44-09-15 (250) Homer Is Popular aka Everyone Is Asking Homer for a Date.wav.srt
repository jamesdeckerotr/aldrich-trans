 The All-Great Family written by Clifford Goldsmith

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 And me Henry Olvey

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 Coming, Father!

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 An out for the Aldrich family with Dick Jones as Henry and Jackie Kalka Palmer.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,860
 Every once in a while for the fun there is in it, grown-ups like to recall the far away

7
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:44,880
 pleasures of their own teenage days.

8
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:50,040
 And always right in the middle of those memories, they're romped the boy like Henry Ulterich.

9
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,880
 The scene opens on Henry's front lawn.

10
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:57,920
 Listen, Henry, I'm not arguing with you, but why don't you plan to go to the movies with

11
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:58,920
 me to marry?

12
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,720
 Homer, can I help but if Agnes did invite you to her party?

13
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,840
 Why didn't he dance with her at the dance last Saturday night?

14
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:10,240
 and we if Agnes gave me an invitation or an bended niece on a silver platter I wouldn't go.

15
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,640
 You know what the Lawson's give it to eat at their party.

16
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,640
 What? Marshmallow.

17
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,440
 Why, why, why, marshmallow?

18
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:20,440
 Just one marshmallow without anything on it.

19
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:23,640
 Homer, for the last time, I'm going to Agnes's party.

20
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:28,640
 Alright, alright, you wait 'til I get an invitation to go someplace some time and you weren't invited.

21
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,140
 I thought you didn't want to go.

22
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:31,640
 I don't, I don't.

23
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,140
 Can't you have as much pride as I do?

24
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:37,140
 Look Homer, why don't you call up somebody?

25
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,140
 Why don't you call up Marie Saunders National for a day?

26
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,140
 Who? Marie Saunders?

27
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:43,140
 Why not?

28
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,140
 You're crazy about her, you know you are.

29
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:51,140
 Marie Saunders, she was, and we have never even spoken to her, and she's never spoken to me.

30
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:54,140
 So, you're always following her around in school?

31
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:55,140
 I am not.

32
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:58,140
 She was the my fault she's always walking in front of me.

33
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:02,140
 And besides, and we're just trying to change the subject.

34
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:04,740
 Homer, for the last time, I'm going.

35
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,380
 Okay, then, okay.

36
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:09,540
 I always thought you were a social climber, and now I know it.

37
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:11,140
 Why did you call me Homer?

38
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:12,940
 You're gonna live the event, bap.

39
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:15,520
 (upbeat music)

40
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:27,040
 (laughing)

41
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,240
 - Hey, Gary, what's up?

42
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,180
 - He is, this is a swell party.

43
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:32,520
 Is this a swell part?

44
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,960
 - Do you really like it, Colin?

45
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,160
 Did you get some marks now?

46
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,000
 - Sure.

47
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,920
 - All right, everybody, quiet.

48
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,160
 Quiet, let's get out of here.

49
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,240
 - That's what I say.

50
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,400
 - It's Henry's turn came before, but it's a certain body.

51
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,040
 - It's my turn, old boy.

52
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,640
 - How's it on, Henry?

53
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,400
 I'm holding somebody's forces.

54
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,240
 Every heavy hangs over the head.

55
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,400
 What's the Leona Due to a demon's forces?

56
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,520
 - Well, there's a blonde little male or a female.

57
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,840
 - A female, I think.

58
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,120
 - Yeah, of course.

59
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,560
 - What does he have to do, Henry?

60
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,560
 Well, make it good, Henry. Make it good.

61
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,560
 Here's what the owner has to do.

62
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,560
 You want to go to the telephone, see?

63
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,560
 Yeah.

64
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,560
 She has to go to the telephone.

65
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:20,560
 Boy, am I bored.

66
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,560
 Boy, do I wish I had something to do.

67
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,560
 Well, you can be scared about the floor, can't you?

68
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,000
 But mother, what is there to do sitting up?

69
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,360
 Is there any reason why you can't preach something?

70
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,200
 See everybody else.

71
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,000
 See why don't we move out of this town?

72
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,900
 Is it my boat you want more popular?

73
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,200
 I'm popular, I'm popular.

74
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,240
 And what are you lying on the floor, Paul?

75
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:43,880
 [LAUGHTER]

76
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:44,880
 Glenspethone.

77
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,520
 Well, yes, he is going through here with you.

78
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,680
 OK.

79
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,680
 If it's the father, what do I say?

80
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,280
 What do you mean, what do you say?

81
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,080
 Are you in or are you out?

82
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:55,760
 Hello.

83
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,520
 Hello.

84
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,880
 Is it on the ground?

85
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,860
 Yes, who is this?

86
00:03:58,860 --> 00:03:59,680
 Kathleen?

87
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,680
 Oh no!

88
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:03,320
 It's whatever it is you think it was Kathleen?

89
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,520
 It is what Kathleen?

90
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,520
 You want to guess who it is?

91
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,320
 No.

92
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,760
 It's Marie!

93
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,520
 Who?

94
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,240
 Marie Stonders!

95
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,920
 Well, I'll be done!

96
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,280
 Am I my darling?

97
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,160
 No!

98
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,520
 Well, Homer!

99
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,080
 What?

100
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:20,600
 Would you think I would care if I asked you something?

101
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,080
 No.

102
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:23,960
 You would have liked to see me and my wife in room with you.

103
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,320
 Who you?

104
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,140
 Oh gee whiz.

105
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:27,980
 Come on, what's happening?

106
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:30,880
 Nothing, I just knocked over the telephone table.

107
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,580
 Sure, I'd like to see you tomorrow.

108
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:34,280
 Do you want me to come up to your house?

109
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,280
 Oh my goodness.

110
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,380
 Oh wait, there's a minute.

111
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:39,580
 Sure, I don't mind waiting.

112
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,580
 Hello?

113
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,580
 Hello, did you change your mind?

114
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:44,580
 Hello.

115
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:45,580
 Hi, Mom.

116
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:46,580
 Yes, Marie.

117
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:48,280
 Listen, Homer, they just--

118
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,780
 How about your haven't done so?

119
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:50,780
 Okay.

120
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:51,780
 It's not hard to see.

121
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:52,780
 Okay, sure.

122
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:53,780
 Hi.

123
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:55,280
 Is this really Marie Saunders?

124
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,280
 The one with the yellow hair.

125
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,280
 So he wins.

126
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,280
 Goodbye.

127
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,280
 So, boy.

128
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,280
 Hold her.

129
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,280
 What's her thought?

130
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,280
 I dropped the phone right out of my hand.

 [Laughter]

133
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,280
 I was never going back in my life.

134
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,280
 I nearly died.

135
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,880
 I get home and believe you Kathleen.

136
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,880
 I can't believe you.

137
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,680
 But as soon as I thought I'd die,

138
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,380
 I knew I could buy you a Kylie Posh tournament

139
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:32,480
 and a Foshman.

140
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,080
 It's my turn, old boy.

141
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:34,880
 Sit down, darling.

142
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,480
 I'm sitting.

143
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,180
 Go ahead.

144
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:38,480
 See, when I think of home awaiting some warning saunters

145
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,880
 and they haven't struck to all tomorrow afternoon.

146
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,880
 And you can't just see him, Henry.

147
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,980
 But if my brief son has ever found out

148
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,980
 that Kathleen wouldn't that call?

149
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,780
 All right, not quiet, everybody quiet.

150
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,080
 Kathleen's going to start.

151
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,080
 Heavy heavy hangs over the forehead.

152
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,180
 What's the Leona Duda, a dangerous fortune?

153
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,180
 Well, does it belong to a male or a female?

154
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:57,180
 A female?

155
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:59,180
 Oh, boy, a primary chicken.

156
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,180
 Oh, my.

157
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:06,180
 Well, the owner of the article over my head has to go to the telephone and call Homer's mother.

158
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,180
 Oh, my God.

159
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:07,180
 Good.

160
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:08,180
 Sorry, that's good.

161
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:12,180
 And when he answers, he has to say he's Marie Saunders' mother.

162
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,180
 Oh, my goodness.

163
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:18,180
 And she has to tell Mrs. Brown that Homer has been bothering her daughter, and will she please

164
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,180
 see to it that he stops.

165
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,180
 Oh, my God.

166
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,180
 Oh, my God.

167
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,180
 Who asked to do it?

168
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,440
 Egg your castle.

169
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:27,940
 Oh no, you're not going to shove me out on any limb and cook my goose.

170
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:31,040
 But, Magnas, you have to. You won't get your bracelet back.

171
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,680
 It's a lace chowing, maybe Homer's mother's on a bed.

172
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,180
 Okay, then phone her in the morning.

173
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:36,380
 On the morning?

174
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,680
 You smile at breakfast?

175
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,980
 All you have to do is raise the deuce with her, I guess.

176
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:44,380
 Tell her that Marie is practically having a breakdown because Homer bothers her so much.

 Hi, Simone.

00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:59,380
 Hello, thank you, Mother.

180
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:02,380
 Hello, Henry. Did you have a good time at the party last night?

181
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,380
 Oh, boy. Didn't we?

00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:05,380
 Oh, boy, Mother. You know what we did?

183
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:07,380
 I had some time to listen now, then.

184
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,380
 Sam, your breakfast is getting cold.

185
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:11,380
 Well, boy, every time I think of it,

186
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:15,320
 think of it. It's the best darn thing you ever heard of. You certainly must have

187
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:19,180
 had a good job. Let me tell you about it. Leave it to Will Brown. It starts today

188
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:23,860
 all right. What is Will Brown's enough? I've never seen Will go upset. Who is Mr.

189
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:27,620
 Brown? Homer's father? Yes, Henry, and I happen to be talking to your mother. That's

190
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:30,940
 all right. Excuse me. Apparently about five of the brown had a phone call for

191
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:35,200
 Mrs. Saunders. From whom? Marie Saunders mother. Henry, what I don't say about

192
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:39,220
 interrupting me. I'm sorry, father. Then what did Mrs. Saunders own her about? He

193
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:43,460
 He didn't say, but apparently she took Elizabeth over the coast about something regarding Homer.

194
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:45,020
 What do you think Will wants to do?

195
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:45,520
 What?

196
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,620
 He wants to know whether he can sue Mrs. Saunders for "Clander."

197
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:50,520
 Is that good or bad, Father?

198
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:53,620
 I mean, well, was it "Clander"?

199
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:59,220
 I don't know. I asked Will Brown what he said, and he said he wouldn't tell me, and I first told him it was "Clander."

200
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:02,720
 Henry, I want to eat your cereal. This doesn't concern you in the slightest.

201
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,220
 Is that clear, dear? The only thing is that...

202
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,320
 Hey Henry!

203
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,520
 Who is that you?

204
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,280
 Yeah, I want you to finish your breakfast yet.

205
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,720
 Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Haldry.

206
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,720
 Good morning, Homer.

207
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,720
 Why, but you certainly seem to be feeling good.

208
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,720
 I am.

209
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,620
 Boy, Henry, am I glad I decided not to go to that party last night.

210
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:19,820
 You are, Homer?

211
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:20,520
 What happens?

212
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,120
 Don't you wish you knew?

213
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,820
 And listen, if you haven't finished your breakfast, I'm going on.

214
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:27,820
 I want to get to school early and have a chance to see.

215
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:28,820
 To see?

216
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,020
 I want to get there.

217
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:31,820
 Homer, about how long ago did you leave home?

218
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,020
 About a half an hour ago.

219
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:35,120
 I've been over telling Charlie Clark something.

220
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,720
 And Henry, I'll tell you about it when I see you at school.

221
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:41,220
 No one has any rights to feel that good at this hour of the morning.

222
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,520
 It's just temporary, Father.

223
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,120
 He isn't going to be feeling that good by this afternoon.

224
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:46,820
 Henry?

225
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:49,920
 Now tell us all about what you did that you're so funny, last night.

226
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,220
 Oh, uh, why?

227
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:51,920
 Probably.

228
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,120
 It wasn't anything, Mother.

229
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,120
 Wait, just...

230
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,620
 In Mary Out in the Kitchen, I believe she is.

231
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:57,920
 Well, excuse me for a second.

232
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,920
 I want to see whether I can help her cook my eggs.

233
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,920
 Mary!

234
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,420
 What did you want, Henry?

235
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:03,620
 Listen, you're...

236
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:04,920
 Could you do something for me?

237
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,320
 If you are borrowing money, I have it a thing.

238
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,820
 It's much more simple than money.

239
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:11,820
 And would you be willing to phone Mrs. Brown?

240
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:12,320
 Why?

241
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,220
 Well, all you have to do is say you're Marie Saunders' mother

242
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:16,720
 and apologize for borrowing her.

243
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,120
 Oh, no, Henry.

244
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,120
 You won't.

245
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,720
 Neither would you be willing to call over.

246
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,520
 What's wrong?

247
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,320
 Well, he's expecting to meet--

248
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,920
 I mean, you know how crazy he is about Jamari.

249
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:28,520
 He is?

250
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,320
 Sure.

251
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,920
 He practically worships you.

252
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,720
 I'm just asking you to have a date with your behavior

253
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,720
 in structural work for 15 this afternoon.

254
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,720
 Well, all you have to do is time somebody asked you to come over to her plate.

255
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,720
 Well, I had a year old to try and do anything with the car.

256
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,720
 But, Mary, let me tell you what happened last night.

257
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:53,720
 Hey, Henry. Henry.

258
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,720
 What do you want, Homer?

259
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,720
 I want you to do something for me.

260
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,720
 I haven't got time. I gotta go to class.

261
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,720
 But Henry, usually you have to do.

262
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,720
 Well, first, Homer.

263
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:04,720
 I've been thinking things over and I want to tell you something.

264
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,720
 Not till I guess who's telling you about this.

265
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,720
 What do you really think of Marie Saunders?

266
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,720
 Why?

267
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,720
 Well, gee, I think she's a prettiest girl in the school.

268
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:16,720
 But have you ever noticed that she's sort of peculiar?

269
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,720
 I mean, I'm the telephone, for instance.

270
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,720
 She can be just as nice to you as though she was crazy about you.

271
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,720
 And then you're me to hear it's school and boy, she's so bashful she won't even look at you.

272
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,720
 Well, look, let me tell you.

273
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,020
 Let me tell you, Carol, will you stop interrupting?

274
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:34,860
 All you have to do is find the first chance to have and give her this nose.

275
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:35,660
 What does it say?

276
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:36,720
 What gives you this ad-make?

277
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,920
 Just find her and give it to her.

278
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,820
 She'll understand.

279
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,320
 But homo!

280
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,620
 Oh, hi, Kathleen.

281
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:43,620
 You want me to have you caught on your...

282
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:44,120
 No.

283
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,220
 What type of train you have?

284
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:46,220
 Nothing.

285
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,220
 Just sort of a no.

286
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:51,220
 Oh my goodness, I was just talking with Agnes and she said his mother's followed the whole thing,

287
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,320
 looked like a stinker.

288
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,320
 Kathleen, I hope you don't think there's anything funny about this.

289
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,220
 What?

290
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,820
 Frankly, I don't think you should have started this whole darn thing.

291
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:01,120
 Frank, can we ask if it was our your idea?

292
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,620
 You're the one that told me to find him and say I was Maureen.

293
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:05,220
 Sure, but I never dreamed it's...

294
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,220
 You're...

295
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:10,220
 Listen, Popley, would you be willing to have a date with Homer this afternoon?

296
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:11,220
 I...

297
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,420
 You know how crazy Homer's always been about you.

298
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:14,220
 What about me?

299
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:16,920
 But sure, he practically worships you.

300
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:17,920
 Who is that?

301
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,820
 Homer!

302
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:22,220
 And don't you think the least you can do is be at the Haven when it gets her this afternoon?

303
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,520
 Oh, no, Emi.

304
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:26,360
 And what's mine? You think you can put all the blame for this on the moon?

305
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,240
 You're very, very much mistaken.

306
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:28,980
 Goodbye.

307
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,480
 But, Cass, me, you're just taking it in the wrong way!

308
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:41,520
 Homer, you're too like yourself.

309
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,920
 I'm in a hurry, mother.

310
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,440
 Are you three going to hold good about this awful thing, dear?

311
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,760
 Sure, mother. I wouldn't make a thing like that up.

312
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,920
 We had a new year, that.

313
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,600
 Homer, are you sure you're getting homeless, sir?

314
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,160
 What's the truth for you?

315
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:56,800
 Sure, Father. Don't you remember last night when I was going on the floor?

316
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,400
 Well, I've got to go. Goodbye.

317
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,160
 Hey, but you can't leave that even your cup cut.

318
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,720
 I'm gonna eat it, Mother. I'm gonna take it right along with you.

319
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,200
 You're not gonna take a good-cussed cup out of the tree.

320
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,480
 I know what I'm dumping it into my hand.

321
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,000
 Goodbye.

322
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,600
 Over!

323
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,200
 Over?

324
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,800
 I won't do it on anything. I won't be back in the afternoon till making pictures of the trees.

325
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:17,000
 Well, I can't but the life of the other Samoyu won't get eaten.

326
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,200
 Well, it isn't that I doubt you a little bit.

327
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,120
 And simply thinking things over and I don't believe Homer.

328
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,000
 And this morning Marie found his mother phone.

329
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,560
 Your first impulse was a sewer.

330
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,160
 Yes, that was my first impulse.

331
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,720
 But since then I've had a second impulse.

332
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,680
 And may I ask why our own son would make up a story

333
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,960
 that Marie begged him for a date if she didn't?

334
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:37,640
 Well, in the first place you stay home and from a mother's point of view.

335
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:41,600
 And only a mother... I mean, I know Homer better than you do.

336
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,840
 A boy isn't as popular as he liked to be.

337
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,880
 He's close.

338
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,320
 But he got too much pride with me.

339
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,160
 Well, yeah, I'm sorry, but I believe...

340
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:53,160
 Now wait a little bit. Tell me honestly. Why would any girl want a pomer?

341
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:58,160
 And that really shows how little you know your path. Well I know girls.

342
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,160
 Hello. Hello. It's Homer Brown, man.

343
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,160
 Oh.

344
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:05,160
 Homer, is there bell children too? Yes, but Homer isn't here.

345
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:08,220
 So this is Mary Allry. When you come to Institute,

346
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:12,160
 I'll be busy discussing when I suspect Kingdom Downey can they be just so old?

347
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,160
 Today? Homer? Yes, I just thought it'd be nice if you cut a shower together.

348
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,160
 What are you doing with your telling?

349
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,160
 I will.

350
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,160
 Well thank you. Goodbye.

351
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,160
 Goodbye.

352
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,160
 Elizabeth.

353
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,160
 Yes, please.

354
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:26,160
 Our number is L-2-3-2.

355
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,160
 Yes, please.

356
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,160
 I guess that was the mistake then.

357
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,160
 What are you doing?

358
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:34,160
 Why, just a girl for hula.

359
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,160
 Apparently she changed her mind.

360
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,160
 Oh, Homer's name.

361
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,160
 Just tell him I'd like to see him again.

362
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,160
 He hates him.

363
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,160
 Who is this?

364
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,160
 He's traveling on his own.

365
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,600
 I just thought maybe he'd like to sit down and have me have my scream with it.

366
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,600
 Yes?

367
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,960
 Were you telling Mr. Brown?

368
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:50,960
 No, just a minute.

369
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,960
 Yes, Mr. Brown?

370
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,600
 Are you sure it's Homer?

371
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,360
 You want to sit down and have ice cream with me?

372
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,360
 Oh, yeah!

373
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,760
 Very well, I'll put you down.

374
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,760
 Goodbye.

375
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,760
 Goodbye.

376
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,760
 And there's a bag!

377
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,760
 Yes, we do.

378
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,560
 Apparently, I've been misjudging Homer.

379
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,560
 I don't know what it is, but the boy's got something.

380
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,560
 No!

381
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,560
 No!

382
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,560
 No!

383
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,560
 No!

384
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,560
 No!

385
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,560
 No!

386
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,800
 (cheering)

387
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:23,760
 - Come down, baby.

388
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,780
 - Get on me, mom!

389
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,020
 - What are you running, little boy?

390
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:28,320
 - I've been looking for you all lunch hour.

391
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,480
 Would you be willing to put in a phone call for me?

392
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,320
 - No!

393
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:34,240
 - Well, you know how crazy Homer Brown is about him?

394
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,080
 - About me?

395
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:35,920
 - Yeah.

396
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,920
 She practically worships you.

397
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:38,960
 - Me?

398
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,120
 Really?

399
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:40,960
 Homer?

400
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:41,960
 - Sure.

401
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,840
 Would you be wearing the medium at the Haven's at 4.15 this afternoon?

402
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,840
 No Henry.

403
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,840
 Why not?

404
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,240
 He's really a very slow guy once you get to knowing.

405
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,240
 Heeee!

406
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,040
 You mean he is a slave?

407
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,600
 Oh no!

408
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,000
 And boy, if you only knew how crazy he is about him.

409
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 Oh hi Homer!

410
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 So aren't you going home for months?

411
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,640
 Oh I've got to go in this father shop here.

412
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,640
 Hello Homer!

413
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,640
 Homer?

414
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,640
 Wow!

415
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:11,640
 My goodness it's so easy to see those always crazy to see me.

416
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,640
 But that's how that's for you.

417
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,640
 As soon as he's got you, he won't hide.

418
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,640
 He just the same.

419
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:19,640
 It's not you wouldn't be very much fun to go out with some of my friends.

420
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:22,640
 Hey, Henry, what do you want, Charlie?

421
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,640
 You don't seem only going to barber shop there?

422
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,640
 Yeah.

423
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,640
 What do you think he ordered?

424
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,640
 A shave and a lilac water massage.

425
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:35,640
 a side. Hello. Hello. Is it Alice O'Rourke? Is it Elizabeth? Oh, yes, Elizabeth. Alice,

426
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:49,840
 I want to ask you something and I want to serve it in front. Oh, of course. Tell me, what

427
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:55,840
 did you think of Mrs. Taunter? Mrs. Taunter? Oh, I think she's perfectly lovely. You do?

428
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,840
 Yes, and she has a darling daughter.

429
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,840
 You think so?

430
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,840
 Yes, why?

431
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:06,840
 For no reason, Alice. Only her name happens to be coming up with membership and they quill it's next week and um...

432
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,840
 And um...

433
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:08,840
 Yes?

434
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:13,840
 And I don't want to be pregnant, it's just because we're finally decided that you threatened our husband with a tooth.

435
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:18,840
 But frankly, if she called me this morning and accused her we're bothering her daughter.

436
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:21,840
 And so it's my fault of all the girls, how and how they date for them.

437
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:24,840
 They do all the phone rings calling inside.

438
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,840
 It does.

439
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,840
 And now it's...

440
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,840
 When I call Mr. Saltis, that's the best.

441
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,840
 He talked after those he'd never heard of me before.

442
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,840
 Well, my goodness.

443
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,840
 Elizabeth, you're the best he's been overdoing.

444
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:38,840
 I don't know, but the point is, who do you want anyone like that in the club?

445
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:49,840
 Hello?

446
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,840
 Hello?

447
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,840
 Hello, William Brown speaking?

448
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:55,920
 So anyone Mr. Brown is Mrs. Brown by any chance there?

449
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,380
 No sir, this is my office.

450
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:58,580
 You have to call our house.

451
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:00,380
 Well I did and there's no answer.

452
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:02,520
 And can I leave a very important message?

453
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,620
 Who is this?

454
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:08,120
 Wyatt, this is a very close friend of Mr. and Mrs. Sonders.

455
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,400
 Mr. and Mrs. Sonders?

456
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,200
 Yes sir.

457
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,680
 And Mr. Sonders wanted me to phone and say his wife

458
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:15,000
 and very sorry she bothered Mrs. Brown this morning

459
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,800
 and she didn't mean any word of it.

460
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,640
 I see.

461
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,440
 Yes sir.

462
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,540
 And this is a friend of Mrs. Sonders.

463
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,240
 Yes sir.

464
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,240
 Just a second.

465
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,240
 Mr. Saunders is right here in my office, I'll let him talk to you.

466
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,240
 He's where?

467
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:40,240
 Henry Aldrich will be back in just a few minutes.

468
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:44,240
 But now let's listen to "Allowie Soul" from "Porgi and Beth."

469
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,820
 (upbeat music)

470
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:49,400
 (upbeat music)

471
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,980
 (upbeat music)

472
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:54,560
 (upbeat music)

 (music)

520
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:36,960
 [Applause]

521
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,960
 Now getting back to the troubles of Henry Alder.

522
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:44,960
 Homer Brown, because of a practical joke played on him at a party last night,

523
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,960
 is under the impression that he has a date that's afternoon with Marie Zombie.

524
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:53,960
 Missus Brown is under the impression Marie's mother objects to Homer's attention.

525
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:58,560
 And Henry, which is very much that he had had no part in the joke.

526
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:01,160
 The scene opens in the old-rich living room.

527
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,960
 Henry, was that you that just came in the front door?

528
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,460
 Yes, Mother. Has anyone told me?

529
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:07,360
 No, dear.

530
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,960
 Who are you expecting a call from?

531
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,160
 Oh, Homer.

532
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,460
 Are you passing Anderson or Geraldine Long?

533
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:13,460
 No, dear.

534
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:14,960
 May I ask what the trouble is?

535
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:15,960
 The trouble?

536
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,960
 Nothing's the trouble, Mother.

537
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,660
 Well, I know you didn't eat any lunch.

538
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:22,960
 And here you are at 4am afternoon with a face of my lawn.

539
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,660
 Mother, you think girls have the right attitude?

540
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:27,660
 Well, it's what?

541
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:28,660
 Poor anything.

542
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:30,660
 Yeah, I don't know.

543
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:33,860
 You ask the girl to do something, and they all say no.

544
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:36,260
 Boy, I only think about it themselves.

545
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:40,760
 Well, why don't you go out to the ice box and get something to eat and see whether you don't feel better?

546
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:44,060
 Mother, if I ate everything in the kitchen, I still wouldn't feel any better.

547
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:46,660
 And besides, boy, I've got to go out.

548
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:48,060
 May I ask where you're going?

549
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:48,760
 I'm just out.

550
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:49,960
 I'm going to try one more girl.

551
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,460
 Then the truth will evolve.

552
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:52,460
 Hello?

553
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:53,460
 Hello, Alice, this is Sam.

554
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:54,460
 What was it you wanted?

555
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:55,460
 I wanted?

556
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:56,460
 I have a message here saying I'm the phone you.

557
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:57,460
 Oh yes, I almost forgot.

558
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:58,460
 It's about Henry.

559
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:59,460
 Here, I'm finally convinced we ought to do something.

560
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:00,460
 What's the trouble?

561
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:01,460
 Sam, I think he's getting a complex.

562
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:02,460
 A complex?

563
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:03,460
 What about?

564
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:05,460
 Well, dear, I'm not sure, but I think it's about Homer.

565
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:07,460
 You know how terribly popular Homer is these days?

566
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:08,460
 Homer is?

567
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,460
 I didn't know anything about it.

568
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:13,460
 Well, neither did I until a little while ago.

569
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:15,460
 And Sam apparently handed me a message.

570
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:16,460
 I'm not sure.

571
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:17,460
 I'm not sure.

572
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:18,460
 I'm not sure.

573
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:19,460
 But I think it's about Homer.

574
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:20,460
 You know how terribly popular Homer is these days?

575
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:20,460
 Homer is?

576
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:23,060
 Sam apparently Henning must know about it too.

577
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:24,720
 Well, what do you want me to do?

578
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,160
 Call him up and try to make a date?

579
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,400
 Yeah, this is nothing to laugh about.

580
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,640
 My first impulse was to suggest that we send him to some other school

581
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,080
 where you get a brand new set of girls.

582
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,840
 But I don't think that would do it.

583
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:37,340
 No.

584
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:40,840
 No, because frankly, I think the cause of the whole trouble is his look.

585
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,540
 It's look.

586
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:44,320
 Well, that's something we can't help.

587
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,240
 You'll grow too.

588
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,080
 Well, what?

589
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:49,760
 That gray suit of yours, Sam, that we had picked over for Henning to wear.

590
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,760
 He fought it from the start and I think his instinct was right.

591
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:55,760
 Now Alice, we went into that battle and just before school started.

592
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:59,760
 And it was to get 25 cents a week extra provided he was willing to wear that suit.

593
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:03,760
 Alright here, but we didn't know how the girls would react.

594
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:08,760
 And I think the thing to do is to get him a new suit even if it means reducing his allowance.

595
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:13,760
 Alright, tell him beginning next week his allowance will be frozen at the old level.

596
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:22,760
 [Music]

597
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:25,260
 Mother, I give you my word, I don't understand this.

598
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:26,760
 I don't understand any part of it.

599
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:30,760
 Now, Marty, if you did call home around us, why don't you tell me that he has lost your money?

600
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:34,760
 Mother, he's never even said a lot to me, and I never said even that much to him.

601
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:37,760
 Well, there's certainly something about this, I don't understand.

602
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,760
 Exactly what does Mother say when she follows you?

603
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,760
 Frankly, she began dusting those she's got her head.

604
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:45,000
 And I told her, now here, now here!

605
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,600
 You know who you're talking to?

606
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,640
 And what did she say?

607
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,520
 There's no thing!

608
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,120
 I'll see you at his mother.

609
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,320
 Hello?

610
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,760
 Who?

611
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,120
 Homer?

612
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,320
 Oh, is this Homer Brown?

613
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,280
 Is that Homer?

614
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,680
 Mary, let me talk to that young man!

615
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:09,080
 Oh, then Mary Orvis,

616
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,120
 is there anything I can do for you?

617
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:14,120
 And when I get sodas all I want right now, Mr. Goodhaven, I've already had two.

618
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,120
 I think I'll wait a little.

619
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,120
 And what can I do here, Kathleen?

620
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,120
 I haven't got all of anything more right now either.

621
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,120
 But I may want another one.

622
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,120
 When a person I'm waiting for is yes, here.

623
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,120
 Kathleen?

624
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,120
 I'll have another one.

625
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,120
 After all, I've got here a little late.

626
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,120
 Who are you waiting for, Kathleen?

627
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,120
 I think I'm one of the boys.

628
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,120
 I was promised to meet you here.

629
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,120
 When were you waiting for?

630
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,120
 Yes.

631
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,120
 One of the boys.

632
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:41,360
 It's a surprise, we all have to get to go home.

633
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,560
 Yes, isn't it?

634
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:45,600
 Listen to heaven, you want to see any boy waiting here, have you?

635
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,260
 Honey?

636
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:48,400
 No, I didn't see anyone except Homer Brown.

637
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,400
 Oh, get going?

638
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,300
 Just a little?

639
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:51,200
 Just a little?

640
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,040
 You can see me, but I'm playing with you.

641
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:53,800
 Is that right?

642
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,640
 Honey?

643
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,040
 My goodness, how did we go with coming in now again?

644
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,080
 Let's see where--

645
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,880
 Hey, we all, we can't catch you?

646
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,280
 Yes, no, yes, no, we're here.

647
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,080
 No, we are both, hey, isn't it?

648
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,080
 It's not wrong.

649
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:07,480
 Honey, may I take you over just a second?

650
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,480
 Me, Kathleen?

651
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,480
 You mind my asking what you three girls are waiting here for?

652
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,980
 Well, you certainly don't know how many girls you...

653
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:14,980
 Why?

654
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:17,980
 [Inaudible]

655
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:20,980
 Like, I tell you, Adnis, would you like to have a soda?

656
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:22,480
 I'm looking at you to see Homer?

657
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,980
 [Inaudible]

658
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:26,980
 If you hot cross, it will be real.

659
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:28,980
 This one's got queen.

660
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:29,980
 See, where's the phone?

661
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:32,480
 Hey, you don't mind my asking if you're crazy.

662
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,480
 Mary, there's anything you worry about.

663
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,980
 [Inaudible]

664
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:36,980
 Go?

665
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:37,980
 No, I'm two.

666
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:38,980
 Three, two.

667
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:39,980
 Oh, you're right.

668
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:42,980
 You're coming to a practical jail time, Mary.

669
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:44,980
 Why, if you don't have to raise your voice like that.

670
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:46,980
 Oh, you're talking like that, I just...

671
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:47,980
 Hello.

672
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:48,980
 What are those, who's Mary?

673
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:49,980
 Who is this, Mary?

674
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:50,980
 No, it's Henry.

675
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:51,980
 Is this Homer?

676
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:52,980
 Yes, you are.

677
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:54,980
 I got a message to Mary for.

678
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:55,980
 Mary?

679
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:56,980
 My sister?

680
00:25:56,980 --> 00:26:00,980
 Then when you see your teller, I'm sorry, but you'll have to make it some other time.

681
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:02,980
 Listen, Homer, why are you doing?

682
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:03,980
 For me.

683
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:04,980
 I'm watching.

684
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:08,980
 You're walking in a time like this? Don't you ever teach your engagement?

685
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:10,980
 I'm going out to dinner.

686
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:11,980
 Where?

687
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:14,980
 Have Marie Saunders, what do you think I'm laughing for?

688
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:15,980
 Is that wrong?

689
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:17,980
 And you know what my father just decided?

690
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:18,980
 Why?

691
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:22,980
 He said any boy that is as popular as I am would have an allowance increase.

692
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:23,980
 And for you?

693
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:25,980
 Boy, and we are my grit.

694
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:28,980
 And you know what Marie's family and my family just decided?

695
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:29,980
 Wow.

696
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:32,980
 Somebody's been doing some furnaces.

697
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:36,980
 And boy, if we find out who it was, do we hit him then?

698
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:38,980
 Is that right?

699
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:40,980
 But hold on, I'm glad you're happy though.

700
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:42,980
 I'll say I am, and I hope you are.

701
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:43,980
 Goodbye.

702
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:44,980
 Goodbye.

703
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:48,980
 This is probably one sit-through of the section, I showed him.

704
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:51,980
 Oh, yes, Mr. Behaven. I'll sit-through it.

705
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:53,980
 Do you mind if I sit down for a minute?

706
00:26:53,980 --> 00:27:07,620
 The Aldrich family was rebroadcast for the American Armed Forces and the Reliance.
