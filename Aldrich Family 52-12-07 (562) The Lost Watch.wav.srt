00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
 Henry!

00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 Henry Aldrich!

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 Coming, Mother!

00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 Yes, it's the Aldrich family, it's transcribed.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:43,080
 Boys always look forward to growing up and becoming men.

10
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:48,640
 But once that's happened, they often enough look back upon the time when they were boys.

11
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,280
 Those were the good old days, and with a teenage boy like Henry Aldridge around, they were

12
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,240
 also the unpredictable days.

13
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:59,740
 The scene opens in the all-ridge living room. The time is early evening.

14
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:00,740
 Mary.

15
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:01,740
 Oh, Mary.

16
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:02,740
 What is it, Henry?

17
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:04,740
 Have you seen my new wristwatch anyplace?

18
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:06,740
 Your wristwatch? Where did you leave it?

19
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:08,740
 I didn't leave it anyplace. I just can't find it.

20
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:11,240
 Mary, you haven't finished what you were doing in the kitchen.

21
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,240
 I'm going right back there, Mother.

22
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,740
 And, Henry, I want you to go upstairs and get washed.

23
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:17,740
 Yes, Mother. Just as soon as I finish looking for something.

24
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:21,740
 And, wash especially well there. Remember Aunt Harry, it's going to be here for dinner.

25
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:22,740
 You're sure I know.

26
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:25,740
 And you know how closely she looks at things.

27
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:29,040
 May I ask why you're upsetting all the cushions on the sofa?

28
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,040
 Nothing.

29
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:33,240
 Oh, well, I just happened to be looking for something.

30
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:38,240
 I certainly hope you wrote Aunt Harriet and thanked her for the lovely wristwatch she sent you.

31
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,240
 Yes, Mother, I wrote it a minute. I heard she was coming.

32
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:47,240
 You didn't find anything out of the ordinary when you swept under the sofa, did you?

33
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,240
 What would you call out of the ordinary?

34
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,240
 Nothing.

35
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,240
 Just dust or something.

36
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:56,240
 What time shall I put the potatoes on?

37
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,240
 Henry, what time is it?

38
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,240
 Well, it's exactly...

39
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,240
 Well, it's about...

40
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,240
 Well, I would say...

41
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:04,240
 The time is exactly 26 minutes after 6.

42
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,240
 Hello, Father. Boy, am I glad to see you.

43
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,240
 Put the potatoes on right away, Mary.

44
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:11,240
 Henry, I hope you're going to wash before Aunt Harriet gets here.

45
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,240
 You sure, Father? I'll attend to it right after I...

46
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,240
 After I...

47
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:17,240
 May I ask why you're crawling around on the carpet?

48
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:20,240
 I just wanted to look under this chair for a minute, Father.

49
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:26,240
 Father, have you seen anything lying around that sort of round and shiny?

50
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,240
 That's just why.

51
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,240
 Well if you saw it you couldn't help but notice it.

52
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:34,240
 Father, mother wants to know if you'll bring that picture and Harriet gave us down from the attic.

53
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,240
 Which one?

54
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,240
 The Colosseum and ruins.

55
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,240
 Oh yes, I'll go right up and get it.

56
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:43,240
 And Henry, mother says that at dinner you're to sit on and Harriet's right.

57
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:46,240
 On a right? Or she can see my left wrist?

58
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:51,240
 Henry Aldrich do you mean to say you lost that beautiful wristwatch she sent you?

59
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,240
 No, Mary, I'm sure I can find it.

60
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:58,240
 My goodness, if you can't, you know how depressed Dan Harriet gets over a thing like that.

61
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:02,240
 That isn't the half of it. She said if I took good care of it, next time she'd give me a camera.

62
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,240
 Henry, have you dressed yet?

63
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,240
 Right away, Mother.

64
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:08,240
 I want you to spend at least 20 minutes getting clean.

65
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,240
 Yes, Mother.

66
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:14,240
 And don't forget to take your wristwatch off before you get in the shower.

67
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,240
 Oh boy.

68
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:20,240
 Mary, if anyone asks where I am, tell them I'll be right back.

69
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,240
 Where are you going?

70
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:25,240
 I just happen to remember, I left my watch across the street at Elinor's. I'll be right back.

71
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:41,240
 Can't you help me look for my watch, Homer?

72
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,240
 Are you sure you left it here at my house?

73
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:46,640
 house I must have I've just been over Delanois and it isn't there

74
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,680
 Henry I don't see how you could lose a watch in my room

75
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,840
 this is where I remember wearing it last

76
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:57,680
 well she was Homer let me see that watch you have on

77
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,080
 now listen Henry this isn't yours exactly like mine Homer

78
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,960
 well sure it's the same make but is your strap one as much as this

79
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,520
 no was your second hand gone

80
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:11,120
 no but if I could borrow your wrist watch just for the scene

81
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,720
 No, Henry, you don't know how to take care of her watch.

82
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,920
 I've never ruined the strap or busted my second hand, have I?

83
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,920
 No, but you've lost the whole watch.

84
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:22,520
 Listen, Homer.

85
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:26,520
 If I give you a half interest in the camera, somebody might be going to give me.

86
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,520
 Would you let me wear your watch tonight?

87
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,920
 What could what half the camera do?

88
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,020
 All right, then, Homer.

89
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:37,520
 If I give you all of my allowance for the week of February 15th, will you let me borrow your watch?

90
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,620
 Why would I have to wait that long?

91
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,620
 I owe everything until then.

92
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:44,120
 I wouldn't be interested.

93
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:47,120
 But Homer, supposing my aunt Harry had asked me what time it is.

94
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,620
 So supposing my parents asked me what time it is.

95
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:52,120
 All right, give me a phone call. I'll be glad to tell you.

96
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:57,620
 Would you... would you give me, uh, two weeks allowance?

97
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:59,620
 Sure, it's a deal. Okay, it's a deal.

98
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:01,620
 Shake, shake, shake.

99
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:08,120
 And Homer, if there's ever anything I can do for you of any nature whatsoever, just you name it.

100
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,720
 Hey, Henry, here's my watch.

101
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,120
 Boy, thanks, Homer.

102
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,120
 Gee, I've got to run.

103
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,120
 It's a good thing we're eating dinner lights and I'll be careful with it.

104
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,120
 Homer!

105
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,120
 What is it, Mother?

106
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,120
 You have the correct time.

107
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,120
 Why, uh...

108
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:25,120
 Exactly twelve minutes to seven, Mrs. Brown.

109
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,120
 Homer, could you come here a minute, please?

110
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:31,120
 But, Mother, don't you think I ought to straighten up the house first?

111
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,120
 Will you please come here?

112
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,120
 Well, sure.

113
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,120
 Something gone wrong, Mother.

114
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,120
 May I see your watch please?

115
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:45,180
 My watch I didn't buy any chance here you say you were giving it to Henry did I?

116
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:47,460
 Said Henry

117
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:52,320
 Well, I certainly didn't give it to him. I loaned him my watch home a brown

118
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,460
 But mother he's gonna give me his allowance for the last two weeks in February

119
00:05:55,460 --> 00:06:00,100
 Oh, but do you realize how much your father paid for that watch? You mean I should give him part of the money?

120
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:06,960
 I want you to march over to Henry's house and get that wrist watch this minute right now at once

121
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,540
 But mother, isn't a bargain a bargain?

122
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:10,360
 - Former, do you want me to take your father?

123
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,260
 - Okay, I'll go.

124
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:13,400
 - And if you dare come home without your watch,

125
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,640
 you'll go without your allowance for one entire month.

126
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:36,920
 (

127
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,400
 for you Harriet.

128
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,000
 Cabs liver would have been good enough.

129
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 Where's Henry?

130
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,040
 He ought to be down any minute, Anne Harriet.

131
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,600
 I heard him run upstairs just a little while ago.

132
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,400
 Father never let us be late when we were children.

133
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,240
 Henry?

134
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,240
 Yes Father?

135
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:54,080
 Do you realize we're pratting we through with dinner?

136
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,080
 I'll be right there.

137
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,080
 I'm washing.

138
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,040
 Sam, as long as you have so much steak,

139
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,840
 give me that piece next to the bone.

140
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,760
 Certainly.

141
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,760
 What on earth is that?

142
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,040
 Henry!

143
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,440
 Hello Aunt Harriet. How are you, Henry?

144
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,740
 Fine.

145
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,940
 No, I'm awfully sorry I'm late.

146
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:13,640
 Didn't you know what time it was?

147
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,640
 Oh, yes, Father. It's ten minutes after seven.

148
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:19,640
 Henry, you mean your father?

149
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,240
 What, Mary?

150
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,340
 Nothing.

151
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:22,340
 Nothing.

152
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:24,140
 Well, you have some grand Aunt Harriet.

153
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,440
 No, thank you.

154
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,940
 Aunt Harriet, I can't tell you how much I appreciate the watch you gave me.

155
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:30,840
 Why didn't you write me about it?

156
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,240
 I did. Didn't you get my letters?

157
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,340
 I did not.

158
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:35,340
 Oh, let me see the watch, Henry.

159
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,340
 You mean up close?

160
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:40,780
 I hope I got that baby.

161
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:44,060
 No, I'll see who it is. Mary, pass Aunt Harry at the potato.

162
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:44,940
 Yes, mother.

163
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:47,180
 So you really like the watch, Henry.

164
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:49,260
 Aunt Harry, I wouldn't part with it for anything.

165
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,100
 Good evening, Mrs. Albridge.

166
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:53,580
 Hello, Homer. Can I speak to Henry a minute?

167
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,660
 I'm sorry, but Henry's at dinner.

168
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:57,260
 But I just have to see him.

169
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,940
 We're having a guest, Homer.

170
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:01,660
 Well, uh, if I go into the dining room and speak to him...

171
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:04,460
 You'd better go back home and see him tomorrow morning.

172
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:06,860
 Oh no, I can't. I'll wait here until he's through.

173
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,860
 But Henry'll be busy all evening.

174
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,300
 Good Mrs. Aldridge.

175
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:13,820
 I'm quite sure anything you have to say can wait until morning.

176
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,020
 Goodbye, dear.

177
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,700
 Okay, Mrs. Aldridge.

178
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,060
 You feel me?

179
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,340
 Who isn't it, Alice?

180
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:22,780
 My goodness, Homer Brown never comes over to this house,

181
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:24,220
 except when we're eating.

182
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:25,020
 Who doesn't?

183
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:25,980
 Homer.

184
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:26,700
 Oh, Homer?

185
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,460
 Homer Brown?

186
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:30,940
 He's the only Homer you know, isn't he?

187
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:33,940
 Well, what's the matter with him?

188
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:34,940
 Nothing, nothing.

189
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:36,940
 Are you all through Henry?

190
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:37,940
 Yes, Father, I caught up with you.

191
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:38,940
 I'll clear the table, then.

192
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:42,940
 Mary, you help for the dinner. I'm sure Henry would be glad to clear the table.

193
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,940
 Oh, yes, Mother. For sure.

194
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:47,940
 Should Aunt Harriet keep her watch? I mean, or four?

195
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:50,940
 No, dear. We have clean ones.

196
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:51,940
 Oh, okay.

197
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:53,940
 Henry, don't break anything going through that door!

198
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,940
 No, I won't.

199
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,940
 But everything on the big kitchen table, dear.

200
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,940
 Yes, Mother.

201
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:04,940
 You know, if a body meets a body coming through the right...

202
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:06,940
 [Singing]

203
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:07,940
 Henry!

204
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:08,940
 Hey Henry!

205
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:09,940
 She was... who's that?

206
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:10,940
 It's me!

207
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:11,940
 Well, where are you?

208
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,940
 Here, behind the refrigerator.

209
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:15,940
 [Laughter]

210
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,940
 Listen, Henry, I've got to have my watch.

211
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,940
 But listen, Homer, I didn't pay any for the use of it.

212
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:21,940
 But if I don't get it, I'll lose a month's allowance.

213
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:23,940
 Oh, you can't go back in a bargain.

214
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,940
 But you shouldn't have talked me into it.

215
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:26,940
 Listen, Homer.

216
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:27,940
 Do I or don't, I get my watch.

217
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:33,060

 Please sit down. I'll take these things out.

224
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:01,880
 But Mother, why not at least let Mary? She's gonna do things like that.

225
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,880
 Mary's done more than her share.

226
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:04,380
 But I haven't.

227
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:05,380
 Please sit down.

228
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:08,380
 I'll be right back with the pie, Harriet.

229
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:10,380
 What's the matter with you, Henry?

230
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,380
 Well, um...

231
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:15,380
 Well, I just don't like to see my own mother wear herself to pieces.

232
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:19,380
 And must you drink an entire glass of water in one gulp?

233
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:22,380
 Oh! My goodness gracious!

234
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:24,380
 Henry, what are you doing?

235
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:24,880
 What?

236
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,880
 Here, let me slap you on the back.

237
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,880
 All right, Aunt Harriet.

238
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,380
 What do you think I found in the kitchen?

239
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,380
 Listen, Mother, let me explain.

240
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:36,880
 Explain, I let the burner on under a new pan.

241
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,380
 You left the burner on?

242
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:39,380
 I did.

243
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:41,380
 Here, Harriet is a piece of pie for you.

244
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:45,380
 Well, I couldn't eat a piece that big unless there's some cheese to go with it.

245
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:47,380
 Mm, I have the cheese right here.

246
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:47,880
 Fine.

247
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,380
 Where are you going now, Mother?

248
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:51,380
 Back to get the rest of the pie.

249
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:52,380
 I don't want to be.

250
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:54,380
 But Henry, the rest of us might.

251
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,380
 Oh sure.

252
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:56,380
 Of course.

253
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,380
 Mary!

254
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:58,380
 Yes, Mother.

255
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:02,380
 How many pieces of pie did you cut?

256
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:03,380
 Five.

257
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:05,380
 Well, I growed in two.

258
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:08,380
 And when I just went back out, there were only two left.

259
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:10,380
 There's one missing?

260
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:11,380
 There is.

261
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,380
 I guess Mary only cut four.

262
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:15,380
 But I'm sure I cut five.

263
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:16,380
 Well, don't go back, Mother.

264
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:17,380
 I can't eat a thing.

265
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:19,380
 It's the best pie I ever ate.

266
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,380
 (whistling)

267
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:24,380
 - What did that mean?

268
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:26,380
 (whistling)

269
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:28,380
 - That whistle? - Yes.

270
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:31,380
 - Oh, I imagine it's just one of the fellas outside

271
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:33,380
 or something. - Well, it sounded as though

272
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:35,380
 it were right here in this house.

273
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:37,380
 - It sounded as though it was in the cellar.

274
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,380
 - In the cellar, Mary?

275
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:40,380
 - Well, that's ridiculous.

276
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:41,380
 But you is.

277
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:43,380
 What is there in the cellar that would whistle?

278
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:45,380
 (whistling)

279
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:48,380
 - Will you have some saul and heria on my pie?

280
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:50,380
 Some people like it.

281
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:55,380
 My goodness!

282
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:56,380
 Isn't that strange?

283
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:59,380
 Sam, is the hot water heater down in the basement alright?

284
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:01,380
 Perhaps I'd better go down and see.

285
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:02,380
 You just said, "No father, finish your pie."

286
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:04,380
 I'm halfway out to the kitchen already.

287
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:06,380
 It was then just turned the draft off.

288
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:08,380
 Yes, father.

289
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:12,380
 Hey Homer.

290
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:15,380
 Homer!

291
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:20,180
 Home, are you down here in the basement?

292
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:22,580
 Yes, and I want my wrist watch.

293
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:24,980
 Boy, it's dark down here.

294
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:26,180
 Where are you?

295
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:28,980
 In the Colbin.

296
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:31,180
 Listen, Homer, do you want me to get into serious trouble?

297
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:34,580
 Do you want me to go up and tell your Aunt Harriet that's my watch you have?

298
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:35,580
 Homer, I beg of you.

299
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:38,180
 With all that's decent inside you, please don't go off.

300
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:39,580
 I'm going up right now.

301
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:41,580
 All right, Homer, all right.

302
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:43,180
 Here's your watch.

303
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:45,180
 Gee whiz.

304
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,600
 She wears, did you drop it?

305
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,180
 I didn't even have it, you dropped it!

306
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:49,180
 Where is it?

307
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:51,580
 Don't you have any likeness part of yourself?

308
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:54,180
 Why would you want to light Nicole Ben?

309
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,980
 Are you sure you aren't stepping on it?

310
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:58,480
 If I am, Henry, you'll be responsible.

311
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,180
 That's a funny thing.

312
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,180
 Hello around the floor, and there isn't any sign of it.

313
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:05,180
 Let me feel.

314
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,680
 Hey, do you have it?

315
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,680
 No, it's a lump of coal.

316
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,180
 [LAUGHTER]

317
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:11,180
 Hey, what's that?

318
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:13,180
 My foot.

319
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:17,740
 Here, I just found this broom. Stand up in the corner there while I try to find it sweeping.

320
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:18,240
 Okay.

321
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,240
 Edra!

322
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,580
 Yes, Father?

323
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:23,560
 What are you doing down there?

324
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,660
 I'm sweeping the cellar!

325
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:28,660
 Waking it?

326
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:31,260
 Well, it's something I should have done weeks ago.

327
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:34,220
 Homer, Homer, I found it. It's okay.

328
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:34,720
 Oh, yeah?

329
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,860
 Look out, look out, Edra!

330
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:43,860
 [ Laughter ]

331
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,860
 Homer?

332
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:47,860
 [ Laughter ]

333
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,860
 Homer, are you Barry?

334
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:53,860
 [ Laughter ]

335
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:55,860
 Henry.

336
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:58,860
 Just give me my watch and let me go home.

337
00:13:58,860 --> 00:13:59,860
 Henry!

338
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:01,860
 Quick, Homer, my father's coming.

339
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:02,860
 Well, let me up the stairs.

340
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:03,860
 You have to go upstairs. You gotta go in here.

341
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:04,860
 In where?

342
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:07,260
 This little room of my father has his work bench and his tools.

343
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:08,660
 Okay, but to me my watch.

344
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:10,860
 And Ray.

345
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,660
 Don't bother to come down, Father.

346
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,060
 What's the trouble out there?

347
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:14,960
 Are you in there, Homer?

348
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:15,360
 Yeah.

349
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,460
 How close the door tight?

350
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:18,160
 My camp is no latch on the inside.

351
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,060
 You're all close it.

352
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:22,160
 Henry, you didn't give me my watch.

353
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:26,360
 Henry, I asked why you'll keep me in the cello while you're at it.

354
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,760
 Having dinner with us?

355
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,760
 Well, I guess I just didn't stop the thing, Father.

356
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,960
 Who closed the door to my work room?

357
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:33,760
 Could I have?

358
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,160
 I certainly hope you didn't snap that locks on.

359
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,760
 It's not by itself.

360
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,560
 That's a nice state of affairs.

361
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:42,960
 I've told everyone in this house I've lost both keys to that lock

362
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,360
 and it must not be closed.

363
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,760
 You mean it can't be open?

364
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,760

 - Henry! - Yes, Father?

381
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,160
 - Where are you? - I'm in the kitchen asking Mary if there's anything I can do to help her.

382
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:40,760
 Your Aunt Herod has been waiting here in the living room for you to come and play Kana's still with her.

383
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,760
 Yes, Father, I'll be right there.

384
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:45,160
 Listen, Mary, did you put in that phone call?

385
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:47,160
 - Yes, Henry. - What did the Rock Smith say?

386
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,760
 His wife said she'd send him over the minute he got home.

387
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:52,760
 Don't you tell her Homer's been locked in the cellar for more than an hour and a half?

388
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,760
 Yes, and she was very much impressed.

389
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:55,760
 And Ray!

390
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:58,760
 I'm coming right away, Father!

391
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:01,760
 Don't forget, Henry, what you promised to do for me for putting in that call.

392
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:04,760
 All right, Mary, I'll make your bed for you every morning for two weeks.

393
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:08,760
 And if I forget to make it, don't hesitate to remind me.

394
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:09,760
 Coming, Father!

395
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,760
 Well, it's about time.

396
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,760
 Yes, Anne Harriet, all ready to play?

397
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,760
 I am. I'll sit down and deal these cards.

398
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:19,720
 Yes, Aunt Harriet. I give us each 15.

399
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:23,260
 Henry, do you know anything about Homer Brown?

400
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:24,260
 Homer?

401
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:27,760
 Mrs. Brown just phoned he hasn't been home all evening.

402
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,760
 Is that right?

403
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:33,760
 Oh, the way this younger generation stays out nowadays.

404
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,760
 My first job?

405
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,760
 Yes, Aunt Harriet.

406
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,760
 His mother hasn't seen him for two hours.

407
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,760
 Boy, does time fly in a crisis.

408
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,760
 In a crisis?

409
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:43,760
 Out of the door.

410
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,760
 Oh, you stay right here and play canasta.

411
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,000
 But that might be for me.

412
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,160
 I'll see who it is.

413
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,260
 I'm on my way now.

414
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:52,060
 Now if only I can get a few wild cards.

415
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:54,460
 How do you do?

416
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:55,060
 How do you do?

417
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:56,160
 Sorry to kept you waiting.

418
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,760
 Kept me waiting?

419
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,360
 Yes ma'am.

420
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,960
 I'm the locksmith you phone for.

421
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,660
 Who is it, Mother?

422
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:04,760
 Henry, ask your father if he phone for a locksmith.

423
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,260
 Did there one out there?

424
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:07,060
 Yes, sir.

425
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,660
 Well, I can phone for you,

426
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:11,160
 but I do have a job downstairs you might attend to.

427
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,860
 Tomorrow morning, saying?

428
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:14,560
 Father, who is it?

429
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,560
 Henry, would you please discard?

430
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,860
 You got somebody locked up downstairs.

431
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:24,360
 Locked up?

432
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,360
 No, sir.

433
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,560
 Well, this place I was called to has an emergency of some kind.

434
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,660
 An emergency?

435
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:31,360
 Yeah.

436
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,560
 I better go back to shop and check with my wife.

437
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:36,060
 Oh, I'm sorry. This isn't the house you wanted.

438
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:38,260
 Ah, that's okay, lady. All in a day's work.

439
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:39,360
 See you tomorrow, sir.

440
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,360
 Father's the man gone?

441
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,060
 Yes.

442
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:43,360
 Well, well...

443
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,400
 Is Mary still out in the kitchen?

444
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,260
 Yes, dear.

445
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:48,060
 I think I'll get Aunt Harry at a glass of water.

446
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,560
 I don't want any water.

447
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:52,760
 Well, she was-- I'll be very glad to get Aunt Harry.

448
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:53,460
 Mary?

449
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:54,860
 What is it, Henry?

450
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:56,660
 Mary, you got to phone that locksmith again.

451
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:57,460
 Aunt Nicole?

452
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:59,160
 Sure, only they send him away.

453
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,660
 Why'd they do that?

454
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:03,260
 Mary, don't you realize my best friend is down in the basement

455
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:04,960
 locked in that tool room?

456
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,660
 Navy without air?

457
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:09,460
 Henry, if you think I'm going to make myself ridiculous by phoning

458
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:12,460
 that locksmith every 10 minutes, you are crazy.

459
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:13,660
 Look, Mary.

460
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:16,660
 Would you be interested if I also sweep your room out for you every morning?

461
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:17,660
 Well...

462
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:19,660
 Henry, where's that Jack's water?

463
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:21,660
 I'm running at her, if...

464
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,660
 Oh, I...

465
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:26,660
 Henry, I'm putting the full responsibility for homeless condition on your shoulders.

466
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:29,660
 'Cause when Homer comes to will, you'll want to know who did this to him.

467
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:31,660
 Henry, I haven't even seen Homer!

468
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:32,660
 Henry!

469
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:34,660
 Yes, Aunt Harriet, come in!

470
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:37,660
 Here's your glass of ice cold water.

471
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:38,660
 Thank you.

472
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:41,660
 What did you do? Let the hot water run?

473
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:43,660
 That war?

474
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:45,660
 I'll put it down and let it cool.

475
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,660
 I'll put that in a couple.

476
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:49,660
 Now, where are we in our game?

477
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:51,660
 Not very far, I'll tell you that.

478
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:53,660
 Well, let's see.

479
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:55,660
 I discarded it, didn't I?

480
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:57,660
 I discarded it.

481
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,660
 Oh. Well, then it must be my turn.

482
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:10,660
 Sam, is that someone sewing wood?

483
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:11,660
 What?

484
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:14,660
 It's bought someone's saw in wood.

485
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:18,660
 Well, well, well, let's see what cards I've got here.

486
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:21,660
 I thought I heard a saw.

487
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,660
 You still haven't discarded, Henry.

488
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:24,660
 Haven't I?

489
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:31,660
 Let's see now, let's see.

490
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:32,660
 Well, well, well.

491
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:35,660
 What do you mean, well, well, well? Put your card down.

492
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:37,660
 I thought I heard that sawing again.

493
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:39,660
 It's not as though it came from the basement.

494
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:41,660
 Maybe it's the hot water heater again.

495
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:43,660
 I didn't even hear that.

496
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,660
 Well, if you listen there, you'll hear something.

497
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:46,660
 Now listen.

498
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,660
 (humming)

499
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:50,660
 Henry, would you please stop singing?

500
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:52,660
 I'd like to hear where that sawing is.

501
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:54,660
 Oh, excuse me.

502
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:57,660
 Dad, Harry, did you know I've been taking piano lessons?

503
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:58,660
 I'll wait for you.

504
00:20:58,660 --> 00:20:59,660

505
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:00,660
 Yes, mother?

506
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,660

507
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:05,660

00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:36,220
 Oh, Mrs. Alvin's.

514
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:38,220
 Homer!

515
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:39,220
 Mother?

516
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:40,220
 Is that Homer?

517
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:41,220
 Can they stay here?

518
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:44,220
 Homer, what on earth do you have on your clothes?

519
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,220
 Just a little call, Mrs. Alvin.

520
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:50,220
 Do you realize your mother has been worried sick about you?

521
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:53,220
 Well, I'll tell you the truth. I've been a little upset myself.

522
00:21:53,220 --> 00:22:00,220
 Mrs. Alvin, may I please go on the living room and speak to Henry?

523
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:06,020
 speak to Henry? Well, would you mind going upstairs first and washing your face and hands?

524
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:08,920
 Okay, but then do you mind please speak with Henry?

525
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:20,020
 What's the score, Harriet?

 I'm nearly 5,000 and as soon as I've beaten Henry, I'm going home.

527
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,220
 Oh, Marie, how would you like another glass of ginger ale?

528
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:30,220
 You're young men. Do you realize this is the fourth bottle you've had?

529
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:31,220
 It is.

530
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:34,220
 Well, if you drink anymore, you're going to go right up in the air.

531
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,220
 Mr. Palmer!

532
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,220
 Yes, Mary.

533
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:38,220
 Your mother wants to speak to you on the phone.

534
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:40,220
 Okay, I'll be right back, him.

535
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:44,220
 Do you mean to say he's actually going to leave this room for a minute?

536
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:47,220
 Well, I had a nice nap.

537
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:50,220
 Father, you've been asleep for two hours.

538
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,220
 Is that so?

539
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:53,220
 Well, I'm glad to see Homer's gone.

540
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:55,220
 What makes you think he's gone?

541
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:56,220
 think he's gone.

542
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:58,220
 Where is he?

543
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:00,120
 He's phoning for his pajamas.

544
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:06,420
 Oh, Father, it's just a question of time.

545
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:09,020
 As soon as his Aunt Harriet goes, I've got this.

546
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:10,220
 He's got what?

547
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:13,120
 Oh, well, whatever it is, I've had enough for one night.

548
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,120
 You mean, you're quitting?

549
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:14,820
 I am.

550
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:17,620
 Oh, Henry, I never did get to look at your watch.

551
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:19,320
 It's exactly eight minutes after ten.

552
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,820
 Well, I'd like to see it, please.

553
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:24,020
 Well, well, it's just one little thing I'd like to explain.

554
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:25,620
 Please give it to me.

555
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:26,920
 Yes ma'am.

556
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,920
 Here it is.

557
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:28,920
 Henry!

558
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:31,820
 Did you know the second hand is missing?

559
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:33,020
 Well now that you mention it.

560
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:35,720
 And just look how this strap is worn through.

561
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:38,020
 Henry I thought you promised to take good care of your watch.

562
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:39,520
 I didn't do that father.

563
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:44,520
 Henry, how would you like to have me take this down to the jewelers and have it fixed?

564
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,520
 Machine and Harry.

565
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:49,020
 And while I'm there, I can have them put your monogram on it.

566
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:50,520
 Who's monogram Henry?

567
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,520
 Who's monogram on what?

568
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:55,520
 (audience laughing)

569
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,320
 - Who, who do you think?

570
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,680
 - You mean my initials?

571
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,520
 - Naturally.

572
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,640
 - Why don't they channel you like that?

573
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,960
 - How do you know he wouldn't?

574
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,760
 - I mean, oh, and Harriet, she wins.

575
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,560
 - You're supposing Henry wanted to change his name sometimes?

576
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,120
 (audience laughing)

577
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,920
 - Do what, for instance?

578
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,760
 (audience laughing)

579
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:15,240
 - Well, to anything, be sure.

580
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,680
 - The only girls who's their monograph.

581
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,640
 - Nonsense, I hear you let me take this,

582
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,280
 and sometime next week I'll have it engraved.

583
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,720
 And Harry, I look ridiculous.

584
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,960
 That's what I say.

585
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:27,440
 Young man, you aren't jealous of Henry, are you?

586
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,400
 Why?

587
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,080
 No.

588
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:29,920
 You awake.

589
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:32,680
 Someday you may have a watch too.

590
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,840
 Well, I think I'll be going.

591
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,200
 Already, Harry?

592
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,280
 What do you think I am?

593
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,520
 A night owl?

594
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,520
 Now, where did I put that watch?

595
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,880
 You mean you lost it?

596
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,000
 I have.

597
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,320
 Isn't it strange?

598
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,160
 I put it right here on this table.

599
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,400
 You, there, young man.

600
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,200
 Where are you going with Henry's watch?

601
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:53,040
 Oh, I was just going to look at it on a better light.

602
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,360
 Well, please give it here.

603
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,680
 Now put it in my pocketbook.

604
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,800
 Yes, ma'am.

605
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:00,800
 Yeah, Aunt Harriet, would you like to have me carry your things out of the car for you?

606
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:01,960
 What things?

607
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,200
 Well, your pocketbook?

608
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,160
 Anything?

609
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,280
 No, thank you.

610
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:10,800
 Harriet, you're supposing you help your aunt with a coat while I hold her pocketbook?

611
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:14,520
 I'll put my pocketbook down right here, thank you.

612
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:18,800
 Aunt Harriet, don't you want to leave it there and go upstairs and see my new wallpaper?

613
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,720
 You're married. That's a swell idea.

614
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,920
 You wallpaper?

615
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,720
 Well, I'll go up and see it, but I know I won't like it.

616
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,000
 Hand me my pocketbook.

617
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,920
 Do you want to carry a heavy thing like that all the way upstairs?

618
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,200
 Give it to me.

619
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,960
 Henry, don't you think it'll be nice if we helped your aunt Harry it up the stairs?

620
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,800
 Oh, sure. They're very steep.

621
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,280
 Here, Aunt Harriet, we'll sort of surround you.

622
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,440
 Let me take you around with the pocketbook on it.

623
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,040
 That's so bad, boy.

624
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:43,600
 It's Henry!

625
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,840
 Yes, Henry.

626
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:45,840
 This is very good.

627
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,480
 Alice.

628
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,640
 Yes, Sam.

629
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:52,280
 When you please tell me what's gotten into those boys.

630
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:55,200
 They're trying to be nice to Aunt Harriet.

631
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,520
 I just like them.

632
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,280
 [LAUGHTER]

633
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,720
 Home is very nice.

634
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:03,360
 And fond of her, Sam, he stayed near all evening.

635
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,360
 Can't he find any girls his own age?

636
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,120
 [LAUGHTER]

637
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:13,600
 Yeah, the body needs the body coming through the white.

638
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,360
 Yeah.

639
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,960
 Well, Homer.

640
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,280
 Oh, yes, Mr. Harvard?

641
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:19,280
 Did you like the wallpaper?

642
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,280
 Oh, uh, very much.

643
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,280
 Well, Harry, I guess I'll be going.

644
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,280
 About what time is it, Homer?

645
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:28,280
 Well, my friend, it's exactly, uh, 21 minutes after 10.

646
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:30,280
 Thank you very much.

647
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:32,280
 Alice, what do you think I've lost?

648
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,280
 Oh, it's a long Henry.

649
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,280
 You late young man.

650
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:36,280
 I'll drive you home.

651
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,280
 What did you lose, Harry?

652
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:40,280
 I locked my car out in front of left the keys inside.

653
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,280
 What?

654
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,280
 Then go out and get them.

655
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,280
 And how would I do that?

656
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,280
 No, no, no, no, here.

657
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:51,280
 out in my pocketbook. Well, the only thing is...

658
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:55,780
 Now what? Henry's watch! You mean it isn't there, Aunt Harry?

659
00:26:55,780 --> 00:27:00,280
 Henry, I'm going home. It's a long home. Now who's that?

660
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:05,280
 That's my father, I'm on my way. Whoa, hello Eleanor.

661
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:08,280
 Hello Mr. Aldrich. If Henry home, I just found his watch.

662
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,280
 What? His watch!

663
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:15,280
 Where did you find it? He left it over at my house this morning.

664
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:18,780
 Now, how would you account for a thing like that?

665
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:21,280
 Henry, you also let this letter you forgot to mail.

666
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,280
 A letter?

667
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:24,280
 Oh, yes.

668
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,280
 Here, Anne-Harry, it is for you.

669
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,280
 Thank you for my walk.

670
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:40,280
 To keep the mortality rate low among our troops in Korea,

671
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:44,780
 the armed forces must have an adequate reserve of blood plasma at all times.

672
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:49,220
 Every American who can should make a blood donation to the armed forces through local

673
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:52,580
 Red Cross chapters or local blood donor centers.

674
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:56,500
 So call the Red Cross or blood bag in your community and make an appointment.

675
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:59,740
 Do it now because a wounded veteran can't wait.

676
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:02,140
 Remember this message from General Ridgeway.

677
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:06,700
 Every American who has given blood can and should feel that he personally has contributed

678
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:10,300
 directly to the saving of the life of an American boy.
