00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
 Henry! Henry Aldrich!

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 Coming Mother!

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
 The Aldrich family! A special re-broadcast for you soldiers, sailors, and Marines of the United Nations.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:47.080
 In every plan, there is always allowed a margin for error.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.760
 In any day, with Henry Aldrich in it, there is always a margin for error or excitement

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.960
 or mischief or anything else.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.360
 The scene opens in the all-rich living room.

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.960
 But Mother, you don't see my point of view.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.460
 Dear, that's the trouble I do see your point of view,

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.460
 but I don't think you're trying to see mine.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.960
 Yes, I try very hard to see your point.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.060
 Just can't see it.

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.460
 In the first place Kathleen will misunderstand the whole scene.

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.460
 Why should she misunderstand?

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.260
 Look Mother, why don't you try to see it from my point of view?

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:20.260
 Henry, I realize you want to give Kathleen something nice for her birthday, but this...

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.260
 Henry, I still say you're entirely too young.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:24.460
 Too young, mother.

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.060
 You spend $12 and a half.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.460
 The iron.

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.260
 Don't just see my point of view, dear, for the last time

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.260
 when a young man gives the young lady an expensive piece of jewelry,

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.660
 it usually carries some meaning with it.

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:36.660
 What meaning?

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.260
 You mean she'd be insulted because it's not gold?

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:40.560
 I mean, dear.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.760
 I think you should take it back to the jewelry store

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.760
 where you bought it and get something else.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.060
 Not if they have anything else in there but jewelry,

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.060
 except an electric percolator.

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.420
 And don't you think if I get a real thing like that, you'd really misunderstand?

00:01:52.420 --> 00:02:02.860

 - Minute. - Oh, hello, Homie.

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:06.900
 I recognize you with a hat on.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.340
 She has been calling you for three blocks.

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.700
 You mind if I walk along with you now?

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.540
 I hear this is your birthday.

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.620
 - Let me have to return. - Thank you.

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:16.900
 How did you know about it?

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.540
 I even have to know one of the presents you're gonna get.

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:20.200
 You do?

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.700
 Yeah, but I can't tell you.

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.300
 I've gotten enough of much of that.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.500
 I've got ears. I've got ears.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:26.800
 Who's giving it to me?

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.300
 I can't tell you that either.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.300
 I'm sworn to secrecy.

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.300
 Did you know you're two months older than Henry?

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:34.000
 Hello.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.500
 Yes, not too bad.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.700
 Maybe that's why he's buying you such a swell.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:38.500
 I mean...

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.300
 Is he trying to even give me something?

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:41.100
 Yes.

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.300
 And I don't think it'll be too big for your wrist.

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:44.100
 I mean...

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.300
 It's for my wrist?

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.100
 She was not planning to tell you the whole thing.

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.340
 I have an explainer's idea what it is though.

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.860
 Sure you have. Sure you have.

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.860
 You just said yourself it was a bracelet.

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.860
 I did? Sure.

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.860
 I'll bet you didn't know what kind it is.

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.180
 It's a silver bracelet and has it for the cheese.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.460
 What a very color.

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:04.020
 I was going in a store just the other day.

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.740
 How long is he really giving me one of those bracelets?

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:10.500
 Yeah. Go when you open the package pathway and be surprised.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.020

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:22.700
 Hello Sam, can you hear me?

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.220
 Yes, I heard you Alice, but I still don't see what you're worrying about.

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.580
 Of course you don't be, and you're a man.

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:33.460
 But Santa Claus Chappelle is crazy about Henry, and he gives her that very expensive bracelet.

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:35.380
 There's only one thing she can see.

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:36.220
 What?

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.460
 Sam, you're simply being perverse.

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:41.780
 I've just been talking with Harriet, and she agrees entirely with you.

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.780
 Alice, my sister, I'm busy. Can you call me back in half an hour?

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.080
 What is the clear about it?

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.780
 That isn't what I mean. I'm in a conference right now, and I haven't time to discuss Kathy Nanderson's birthday.

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.280
 Very well, then, goodbye.

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.280
 Goodbye.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.780
 Now, then, Mr. Roberts, I'm sorry we were interrupted.

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.780
 Mr. Roberts, what I want granted is a complete right-of-way.

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.280
 I agree. But I think they should give you something.

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.280
 They forgive a girl a piece of jewelry.

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.280
 You mean, besides my wife?

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.780
 Well, let me put it this way. Have you any children?

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.780
 No, sir. I'm sorry to say we haven't.

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.780
 Nothing for you to be sorry about, you should be glad you don't have any children.

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:15.780
 Well, what's your problem?

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.780
 We have a son in high school, Steve, and he's a parent and a plan to give some girl.

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:22.780
 She's a very nice girl, I'll say that for him. An expensive bracelet.

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:27.780
 Yes? Diamonds? Diamonds? No, I don't think he went as far as diamonds.

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.780
 I didn't hear it, it cost around $12. And you feel you ought to give her something better?

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.780
 No, because all it feels is too much.

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.780
 Oh, that is in proportion to...

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.980
 Well, now, sitting back to that right of way.

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:39.980
 Oh, yes, yes.

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:43.780
 When you drop the papers, Mr. Alrich, I want it to make clear in the first paragraph that...

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:45.780
 What is it that's troubling you?

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:46.780
 I don't know.

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.580
 Do you think a girl would assume she would engage if she received a bracelet?

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:51.380
 Why would she?

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:52.980
 That's exactly what I told my wife.

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:56.780
 As long as Henry earned the money himself, where do women get these ideas?

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:58.980
 Well, getting back to that right of way, Mr. Alrich.

 You have leaned for the last time, I think you'd be making a great mistake.

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:18.980
 Mother, it's just an innocent, an innocent bracelet with a padlock to shape of a horse.

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:20.980
 And I've always had my heart set on long.

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:23.980
 Well, dear, perhaps someday your father and I will give you one.

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:25.980
 Coming from Henry, it means so much more.

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:26.980
 That's just the point.

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:27.980
 Mother, where you got?

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:30.980
 I'm going in the living room and I have a talk with your father.

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:32.980
 And if he tells you so, I'll ask him to answer.

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:36.980
 That's a very serious question, dear, because you know very well your father is going to say no.

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:38.980
 I'm going to say no to what?

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:42.980
 You know what Kathleen just told me. Henry's coming over here to see me.

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:45.980
 Give her a very expensive silver bracelet.

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:47.980
 I wonder where you got the money.

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:51.980
 Don't you realize we have to assume a little responsibility in raising our daughter?

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:55.980
 There's nothing wrong with Kathleen. And besides, do you realize the front doorbell is ringing?

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:57.180
 I'll go to the door.

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.780
 Elizabeth, don't you think we ought to see the place

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:03.980
 that before we decide anything?

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:05.180
 I'll see who's at the door, mother.

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:06.780
 I'll see who it is.

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:08.480

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:19.880
 What about?

 I've been worrying.

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:24.480
 If I was lost and asked you what Henry gave you for your birthday,

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:26.280
 Just say it was a padlock.

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:28.720
 Don't mention the fact that it was on a bracelet.

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:29.920
 Well, yes or not.

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:32.680
 Well, she wants one and I haven't got the money.

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:35.280
 Say, have you been crying?

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:36.920
 Crying of course I haven't.

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:37.920
 Oh.

 What is it, sunburn?

 No, would you mind going home, Homer?

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:41.760
 No.

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:43.760
 Yes, please, just get out of this park.

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:45.320
 You mean I said something I shouldn't be?

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:46.600
 I didn't say you said anything.

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.760

 Henry, can you tell me where you're going?

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:06.200
 I told you, Homer, I'm going downtown here.

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:07.200
 Oh.

 Are you upset about something?

 Where are you going?

 Homer, will you please stop bumping into me?

 All right, and we're all right if you're not interested.

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:24.200
 I was just gonna tell you something interesting.

 What about Kathleen?

 Listen, Homer, Kathleen has one of the most cheerful dispositions of any girl I've ever known.

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:38.200
 Sure, I agree with you.

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:41.200
 And then the next minute she can kick your right off her friend porch.

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:20.720
 No, now go away! Go away Homer!

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:23.320
 You know, Henry, you're moodier than Kathleen!

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:25.720
 And don't hang around outside that window!

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:27.720
 Something I can help you young man?

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:30.720
 Yes sir, I want to have a little talk with you.

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:34.720
 Yes sir, you're the young fellow who bought that very beautiful silver hand-rot bracelet.

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:37.720
 Yes, could we step back here a ways?

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:39.720
 I beg your pardon?

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:41.720
 Well, I brought this bracelet back because...

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:42.720
 Well you see...

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:43.720
 Is there something wrong with it?

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:45.720
 No, there isn't anything wrong with it.

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:47.720
 But when I got home, my mother...

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:49.520
 That is, she had some bad news for me.

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:51.320
 You mean your mother doesn't want you to keep it?

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:52.820
 No, it isn't that.

00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:54.320
 You see my girl...

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:55.620
 You see it this way.

00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:57.420
 Doesn't she like it?

00:08:57.420 --> 00:08:58.620
 She hasn't even seen it.

00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:00.120
 Oh, she's gone away?

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:01.420
 Why?

00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:02.820
 In a way, she has.

00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:05.020
 Well, that bracelet will be a nice surprise for her.

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:06.420
 Here, I'll wrap it up and send it to her.

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:08.020
 Oh, no, you can't do a thing like that.

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:09.020
 Why not?

00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:10.020
 Why?

00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:12.020
 It's too late.

00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:14.020
 My mother says the way things are now.

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:15.820
 It wouldn't be right for me to give it to her.

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:17.820
 Oh, she's marrying someone else, eh?

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:20.020
 Well, why not give her wedding presents?

00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:21.020
 A wedding present?

00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:23.220
 How about that percolator up there for three more dollars?

00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:24.220
 Oh, no!

00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:26.420
 I wouldn't want her to give her a thing like that.

00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:28.420
 I think I'd just like to get my money back.

00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:29.220
 Your money back?

00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:31.420
 Well, before we do anything as rash as all that,

00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:33.020
 have you seen these ladies' rings?

00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:35.320
 They look just like diamonds, imported precious stones

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:37.420
 from Denver, and I challenge you to tell the difference

00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:38.620
 between these and diamonds.

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:40.620
 But-- couldn't I have my money back?

00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:47.620
 (music)

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:50.960
 Will you have some salary or who?

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:52.300
 No, thank you, Gary.

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:54.780
 Now, what was it you started to tell me about Mr. O'Rourke?

00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:56.820
 Well, I was in this office today, see?

00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:59.060
 And his wife calls and she's all upset.

00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:02.460
 They've got a boy in high school and wants to give this girl some kind of a piece of jewelry,

00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:03.860
 and she doesn't think he should.

00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:05.500
 Well, I certainly agree with her.

00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:06.620
 You agree with her?

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:09.420
 What's wrong with the boy giving this girl a birthday present if he wants to?

00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:11.180
 That's because you've never had any children.

00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:12.940
 What do you mean I've never had any children?

00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:14.140
 You've never had any either.

00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:17.100
 But I'm a woman.

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:20.740
 And Gary, it isn't necessary for you to point out every at me.

00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:22.020
 I'm not pointing at you.

00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:24.140
 I just want to know what's wrong with a kid doing it.

00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:25.100
 What's wrong with it?

00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:26.740
 He just isn't done, that's all.

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:29.260
 Who said so? Who passed the law that says it isn't done?

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:33.420
 Gary, in the first place, any present from a boy means a great deal to a girl.

00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:34.540
 Let alone you.

00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:35.980
 Why should it mean anything?

00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:39.280
 Do you remember on my 15th birthday when you gave me some handkerchief?

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:41.080
 Handkerchief. What's that got to do with it?

00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:42.880
 Well, we got married, didn't we?

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:43.980
 Is that what did it?

00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:49.480
 Gary, for the last time, stop shaking that curry in my face.

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:59.780
 Oh, Mary!

00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:00.680
 What, Mary?

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:02.780
 I speak here for one minute.

00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:05.280
 It's about only a second. What is it, Henry?

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:09.520
 Well, look, are you keep something in your hat from not bother mother about it?

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:12.240
 I guess so. Didn't you pass no of your subjects this year?

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:16.160
 Yes, sure. But I was downtown just now and a man. I mean...

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:21.440
 Well, how would you like to buy a nice 12-dollar and a half bracelet?

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:24.000
 Gee. Why Henry, oh, which way did you get there?

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000
 No, don't wave it around like that. Listen, I'll show up to you for $10.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.280
 I haven't got $10.

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:31.120
 Uh-huh. Have you got mine?

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:33.760
 No. No. How about eight?

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:35.760
 Henry, I have a gunny dollar, I broke!

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:36.760
 But, gee!

00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:37.760
 Gee whiz.

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:39.760
 Whoa, look!

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:41.760
 As long as you can't buy it, Mary.

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:44.760
 You see anything against my giving a thing like this is a present?

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:46.760
 Sorry, Henry, that's awfully sweet of you!

00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:48.760
 No, wait a minute, Mary, give it back to me!

00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:49.760
 I didn't mean it!

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:51.760
 I was just asking you a hypercritical question!

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:53.760
 You mean you're taking it back?

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:55.760
 I haven't even got seven dollars!

00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:56.760
 Henry!

00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:57.760
 Yes, you know, Mary!

00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:58.760
 Would you please come here a minute?

00:11:58.760 --> 00:11:59.760
 Why?

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:01.760
 Yes, you're in just a second!

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:03.360
 You're very Holistarn thing.

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:06.360
 Henry, I want you to bring that bracelet right along with you.

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:07.360
 You do?

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:08.660
 Hi, do you...

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:11.160
 Look, Mother, I'm not disobeying you.

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:14.260
 I just thought maybe you know you would like to buy it and keep it in the family.

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.860
 Yeah, I thought you told me you returned that bracelet.

00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:17.760
 No, Mother.

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:20.260
 What I told you was I took it down to the jewelry store.

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:21.760
 But the follow was so nice to me,

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:24.260
 said I thought I was making a great mistake and not keeping it.

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:27.160
 See, do you tell him I said you were to get your money back?

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:28.160
 Yeah, sure.

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:30.360
 And he said you probably neckwipped very well.

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:38.360
 But he said you didn't know what was going on in the world. He said what? She said phones give a girl present like that. Like this one every day in the year.

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:43.360
 Henry, I want you to take that bracelet and go down to that jewelry store and get your money back at once.

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:49.360
 Letting think our whole family's old-fashioned. I don't care about anything. Now please go. Yes mother.

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:54.360
 As a matter of fact, I think he took advantage of you. Of me. How do anyone take advantage of me?

00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:56.160
 - Hi, Chris. - Yes, Sam.

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:57.960
 - Siddin' Marshall was just on the phone.

00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:00.660
 Have you been spreading Henry's problem all around town?

00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:02.460
 - No, Sam. I give you my word.

00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:04.860
 I hadn't even mentioned it to anyone, except Harriet.

00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:07.860
 [cheering]

00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:10.860
 [music playing]

00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:16.960
 - So will you give me six dollars for it?

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:18.960
 - Do I have to pay the whole six dollars?

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:19.960
 Will cash?

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:21.860
 You mean, you want a little time on it?

00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:23.860
 She just goes for closing in an hour, Homer.

00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:25.860
 And I've got to get Kathleen something for a birthday.

00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:27.860
 I just can't.

00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:30.860
 She may be pretty disappointed if she doesn't get this bracelet.

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:32.860
 All of them so much as mentioned it, too.

00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:33.860
 No.

00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:34.860
 They know you have it.

00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:35.860
 Have a hunch.

00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:37.860
 A very story, hunch.

00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:41.860
 This bracelet is what she's looking forward to getting just the sport.

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:43.860
 For, I think this would be crazy about her, Homer.

00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:47.860
 I know, but you know what, but the second time, he said there was war.

00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:49.860
 And even then they made it a war.

00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:51.860
 And even then they may not make them.

00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:52.860
 Why?

00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:53.860
 That isn't the point.

00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:56.860
 He said we're going to give us racial, we're doubling value.

00:13:56.860 --> 00:13:57.860
 It will.

00:13:57.860 --> 00:13:59.860
 And then a fabulous gift's mad and gives it back to you.

00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:01.860
 Look at the poverty you've made.

00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:12.860
 - Alice? - Yes, Sam.

00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:14.860
 Did Enra get the bracelet thing settled?

00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:15.860
 Yes, he apparently did.

00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:17.860
 He said he's going back downtown in just a few minutes

00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:21.280
 a few minutes and see whether he can find a nice present for Kathleen for four

00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:26.060
 dollars. I know but what I agree to that part of it although I still say the

00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:30.060
 whole thing is a tempest and it's a pot now Sam. It's all the boys in town are

00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:34.060
 apparently doing it. Can I tell you about Homer? He's giving Agnes a bracelet

00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:38.300
 exactly like the one Henry was going to give Kathleen. Really? And Homer's folks

00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:42.420
 don't have Jeff? No Alice. Homer's father agreed with me. What's wrong with this?

00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:46.500
 Well don't get Henry all upset again. He's come round to our point of view and

00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:48.500
 taking the whole thing very nicely.

00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:50.500
 That's more than that Harriet did.

00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:52.500
 Just what was it she said when she phoned Sam?

00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:58.500
 She said she just discussed the whole thing with her bridge club and they all agreed Henry shouldn't give Kathleen the bracelet.

00:14:58.500 --> 00:14:59.500
 Really?

00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:03.500
 And then I asked her to take a standing vote on it and she hung up.

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:05.500
 There she is right now.

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:08.500
 I bet anything that's Harriet calling back to say they're taking a week out on it.

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:11.500
 You'd better let me take it Sam.

00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:13.500
 Hello?

00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:14.500
 Hello?

00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:15.500
 Is this Mrs. Olrich?

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:22.720
 Yes, this is Robert. Hello, this is over. My husband was down at your husband's office this morning

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:27.120
 I know you'll think it's none of my business, but Gary and I have just really what is it?

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:31.560
 Well, we have some friends who have a boy and they had exactly the same problem you have

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:35.520
 You wanted to say every Sunday could make on a pair of hearings for some girls

00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:38.800
 And do you know how his parents from him away from it?

00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:42.460
 Oh, they send him on a trip to the Canadian Rockies and

00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:49.640
 And hired a guy that took him into the woods, and he didn't even see a girl for a month.

00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:50.940
 You don't say so.

00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:56.640
 And like any normal boy, when they came out, he'd forgotten all about the girl and was crazy about the guy.

00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:58.140
 Anyway.

00:15:58.140 --> 00:16:04.640
 And instead of hearing, you said this girl a lovely deer is head with actors.

00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:05.640
 Really?

00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:10.140
 Of course, you can't send Henry that far. The government doesn't want to travel.

00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:15.140
 But the meeting of the photos could find some pictures of me at home here, ready to forget?

00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:16.140
 Yes.

00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:17.140
 Well, thank you very much.

00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:19.140

 Goodbye, Mother. I'm going downtown to see what I can find.

00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:43.700

 Mother, I still don't understand your point of view.

00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:57.640
 Kathleen, your father and I were both several years older than you and Henry before he gave me anything.

 And even then, do you know what his first present was?

 Why? It was simple and it was in good base, but it was very nice.

00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:07.640
 Oh, right. I let it bound by the most poems by Lord Tennyson.

00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:32.360
 Will you step out here to the front hole, please?

00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:33.360
 Yes, my dear.

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:36.360
 Only I think you're unnecessarily worried because I give you my words.

00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:38.360
 I haven't accused you of anything.

00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:39.960
 I simply want to speak to you.

00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:41.360
 What about Mother?

00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:43.460
 Well, your father and I have just been talking

00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:45.460
 with Agnes Lawson, folks again.

00:25:45.460 --> 00:26:06.860
 Helping Sarah apparently going to the

00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:09.460
 I'm sorry to keep you waiting like this, Henry.

00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:12.060
 What was it you were gonna say about that present you have?

00:26:12.060 --> 00:26:13.960
 Well, I tell you a week.

00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:15.560
 Why don't we just wait?

00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:17.760
 You really have to do anything like that, Henry.

00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:21.360
 Well, Henry, sometimes when a boy gives a girl some meat,

00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:23.360
 completely misunderstood.

00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:24.960
 You know what I mean?

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:25.960
 It is.

00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:29.800
 But if a girl is sensible and realizes that it's just a presence without any special

00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:31.160
 settlement connected with it,

00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:32.260
 she's just a saying, Kathleen.

00:26:32.260 --> 00:26:33.560
 I think...

00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:36.260
 No, I don't think I'd better give you this.

00:26:36.260 --> 00:26:39.260
 Henry Orgage, you mean I got to make your give me that?

00:26:39.260 --> 00:26:40.260
 You mean you're gonna take a...

00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:43.260
 Henry, I can hardly wait to open this!

00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:45.260
 I don't think you're gonna like it though!

00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:46.260
 Oh yes I will!

00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:50.260
 Oh and I know what you've done, you put it in this big box, just hold me.

00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:52.260
 But, Catherine, it isn't the bracelet.

00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:53.260
 It isn't?

00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:56.260
 It isn't?

00:26:56.260 --> 00:26:58.260
 It really isn't a bracelet?

00:26:58.260 --> 00:27:00.260
 No.

00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:02.260
 Do you want to give it back?

00:27:02.260 --> 00:27:03.260
 Oh no!

00:27:03.260 --> 00:27:07.260
 My goodness, it's very acceptable about what a person gives her.

00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:09.260
 Or he doesn't make any difference.

00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:10.260
 What it is.

00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:13.260
 I don't understand how I happen to think.

00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:16.260
 You can go ahead and open it if you'd like.

00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:17.260
 Hi.

00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:21.260
 My goodness.

00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:22.260
 What is it?

00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:23.260
 It's a...

00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:25.260
 It's a book.

00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:26.260
 A book?

00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:28.260
 Well, isn't that nice?

00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:29.260
 It's leather.

00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:30.260
 Leather?

00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:35.520
 Henry, it's Tennyson, the poms of Mard Tennyson.

00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:38.520
 Sure, the bookstore was the only store still open.

00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:44.400
 Henry, if all the things you could have given me, anything else would have been just another present.

00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:48.800
 But Mard Tennyson, you and I were having a mind-mother.

00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:51.000
 You like it? You mean you really like it?

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:55.200
 Henry, as long as I live, it's going to mean Mardin, is it anything I own?

00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:57.540
 And would you write something on the fly, please?

00:27:57.540 --> 00:27:59.920
 Sure, only my handwriting isn't very good.

00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:01.460
 That part is important.

00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:03.520
 Just take your fountain can and write

00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:06.180
 so many words, so much to do,

00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:09.520
 so little done, such things to be.

00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:12.100

00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:15.260

 - Well, we're wide be upset.

00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:29.220

00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:33.300

00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:39.780

00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:48.740
