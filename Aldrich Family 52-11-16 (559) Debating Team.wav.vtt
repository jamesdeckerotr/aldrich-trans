00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.360
 Thursday, meet the new Plymouth.

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.560
 Thursday, enter the big Plymouth contest.

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.360
 But right now, Plymouth presents Henry--

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:17.760
 Henry Oldridge.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:18.640
 Coming, mother.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:24.880
 [APPLAUSE]

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.200
 Yes, it's the Oldridge family.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.520
 Written by Clifford Goldsmith, transcribed

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.920
 brought to your family by Plymouth.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.720
 Get set for a new kind of low priced car.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.240
 Go to your nearby Plymouth showroom Thursday.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.440
 Meet the new Plymouth.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:48.640
 Yes, the 1953 Plymouth is a new kind of car.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.400
 First truly balanced car in the low priced field.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.720
 And what a difference Plymouth's true balance makes.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.680
 A beautiful new look, a remarkable new ride.

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.000
 And Thursdays the day, the day your Plymouth dealer says,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.480
 "Come on in and meet the new Plymouth."

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.760
 There's going to be a big Plymouth contest too, starting Thursday.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.760
 Your chance to win yourself a beautiful new Plymouth free,

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.720
 or one of hundreds of cash prizes.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.800
 Full details from your nearby Plymouth dealer on Thursday

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.120
 when you go in to meet the new 53 Plymouth.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.480
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:30.080
 Families today are pretty much the same as families

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.200
 yesterday.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.960
 Fathers and mothers and children never change very much

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.040
 from one generation to another.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.400
 And the ever-present spark plug is always

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.200
 a typical teenage boy like Henry Aldridge.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.000
 The scene is the Aldridge dining room.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 The time is morning.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.760
 Could you please pass the toast, Mary?

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.160
 Another piece, Henry.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:50.360
 Yes, please. And father?

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:50.920
 Well...

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:51.920
 I please have another egg.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.800
 Yeah, that'll make three eggs.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:54.640
 Yes, mother.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.200
 Henry, your normal appetite is rather frightening,

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.520
 but now you're eating like a man with a purpose.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.320
 She is? I do have a purpose, father.

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.080
 I'm building myself up.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.280
 I'm on the debating team.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.560
 You're on the debating team, dear?

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.000
 Well, I'm not exactly on it, mother.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.720
 I'm really just trying out for it.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.520
 They're having the trials this afternoon.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.200
 How did you happen to go out for debating, Henry?

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.800
 Well, it's just sort of the kind of thing that appeals to me.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.120
 Mother, wouldn't be too much trouble going to Canisardines.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.200
 Sardines for breakfast?

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.360
 Well, everyone says the fish is brain food.

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.800
 Isn't that so, Father?

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:26.560
 Oh, I don't know.

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.040
 I didn't keep them from getting caught.

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.040
 Aren't you going to finish your toast, Mary?

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.760
 Here you can have it.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:34.120
 Thanks.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.760
 And will you please pass them arm aloud?

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.920
 How much do you have to weigh to make the debating team?

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.600
 I don't have to weigh anything.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.160
 But I don't see any point in going to a thing half-heartedly.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.080
 Well, there if you do make the team, I hope Aunt Harriet will come to hear you speak.

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.960
 She just won't believe her ears.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.860
 Well, she was. Why should everybody be so amazed?

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.360
 Just because I'm anxious to improve my mind.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.960
 I think everybody ought to improve their mind.

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.860
 No sense in overdoing it, though.

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.860
 Well, I won't go overboard, Father.

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.360
 Oh, which side of the debate are you speaking?

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.460
 On which side?

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:05.360
 You have two sides, haven't you?

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.760
 Father, they don't even have a team yet.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.960
 Do you really think you can make the team, dear?

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:10.860
 Well, I hope so, Mother.

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.060
 I hate to be doing all this eating for nothing.

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.560
 - Oh, I don't think it'll be entirely wasted.

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:16.640
 - Oh, would you excuse me, please?

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.440
 Well, I run upstairs and get some notes I've got to use.

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:19.700
 - Yes, dear.

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.600
 Sam, I'm simply delighted.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:22.940
 - I wouldn't be a bit surprised

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:24.900
 if Henry made a good debater.

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.100
 He sort of a chip off the old block.

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.560
 He has a quick mind.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:29.740
 Thanks fast on his feet.

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:31.260
 (phone ringing)

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.180
 - Who do you suppose that is, mother?

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.940
 - Don't bother to come to the door, anybody.

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:35.900
 Is Henry for waiting?

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:36.740
 - Oh, hello, Willy.

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:38.220
 Henry'll be down in just a minute.

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.940
 - How does he feel this morning, Mrs. Allrich?

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.020
 Is he a little nervous?

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:42.260
 - Why should he be nervous?

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.020
 Well, you know, trying out for the debating team.

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:46.540
 It can be pretty nerve-wracking.

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.420
 Henry didn't act like he was nervous.

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.220
 He didn't eat like it either.

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.900
 Are you going to try out for the team, Willie?

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.820
 Oh, no, I'm on it.

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:57.060
 How many eggs do you eat a day?

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:57.900
 Eggs?

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.740
 Yes, to keep yourself in good condition for debating.

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:03.820
 Oh, I'm not on the talking end of the team.

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:05.860
 On which end are you?

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:07.180
 I'm the manager.

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.620
 What I really went out for was the track team,

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.300
 but my legs went back on me.

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.700
 What are the duties of a manager?

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.900
 Well, for one thing, I correspond.

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.300
 You correspond with who?

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:18.300
 With all the other managers.

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:20.300
 We get together and correspond.

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:22.300
 Sort of write letters, you know.

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.300
 Oh, yeah. That's quite an accomplishment.

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.300
 I'm sure you do it very well, Willie.

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.300
 Yes, ma'am. I worry about it quite a lot.

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.300
 And you persuaded Henry to go out for the debating team?

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.300
 Oh, no, sir. That was on account of Ellen.

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.300
 Ellen? Yes, sir. Ellen Stanish.

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.300
 What does she have to do with it?

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:38.300
 She's very pretty.

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.300
 And she's also on the team.

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.500
 I know who she is! Mother, she's that girl that can talk your head off!

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:45.640
 That's the one!

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:46.840
 Ellen, Sandy?

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:47.980
 She's very pretty, though.

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:49.720
 But she is the one that talks a lot.

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.220
 Sure. To everyone except Henry.

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:55.480
 And he figured that if he could get on the team, she'd talk to him.

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:59.220
 Well, that explains Henry's sudden craving for the finer thing.

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:02.260
 Yes, sir. What she's pretty, Mr. Alrich.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.760
 It's been a great pleasure for me, just a manager.

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:18.140
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:19.000
 Ellen.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.040
 Ellen Standish.

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.480
 Well?

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:24.280
 I just finished my tryout for the debating team.

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:25.280
 Oh, did you?

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:26.400
 Sure.

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.560
 I thought perhaps you'd be glad to know I may be on the team

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:29.680
 with you.

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.120
 Are you going down the hallways?

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.320
 I'm going into the library here.

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:33.680
 Oh.

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:34.960
 Say Henry, is that you?

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:35.840
 What is it Homer?

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:36.680
 Hello, Ellen.

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.200
 I just finished my tryout.

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.400
 Are you going out for the team too?

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:40.900
 Sure.

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:42.320
 We'll all be together.

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:43.520
 Oh.

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:44.360
 Goodbye.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:45.000
 Goodbye.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.520
 Goodbye, Ellen.

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:47.320
 Ellen?

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:48.520
 Henry, they said you and I should

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.000
 wait in the classroom across the hall

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.560
 until the tryouts are all over.

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:52.560
 OK, let's go in.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.120
 Boy, I sure hope I make the team.

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.800
 Oh, what subject did you talk about?

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.840
 Let me talk about how I helped my mother grow tomatoes last

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:58.560
 summer.

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:01.240
 Henry, it isn't pronounced tomato.

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:01.760
 It isn't?

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:02.500
 No.

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:05.740
 In parliamentary procedure, it's tomato.

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:07.420
 Tomato?

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:09.980
 Well, who do you know that calls it tomato?

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:12.380
 Do you ever hear anybody talk about French fried potatoes?

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:14.900
 [LAUGHTER]

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:16.580
 That isn't the point, Henry.

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:18.380
 Common people call it tomato.

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:20.380
 But when you're trying to make the debating team,

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:21.460
 it's tomato.

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:23.780
 Hey, fathers, I got some great news for you.

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:25.100
 You have Willie, did we make the team?

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:27.220
 The faculty is in conference right now.

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:28.900
 I'll let you know as soon as they tell me.

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:30.180
 Hey, Willie, Willie.

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:31.660
 What were you going to ask him, Henry?

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:34.300
 I could give part of my speech over.

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:36.380
 As a matter of fact, Homer, I know a lot of people

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:38.140
 who aren't common who say tomato.

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:40.660
 Well, Henry, all I know is that if I had to stand up

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:42.260
 before three members of the faculty,

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.820
 I'd be mighty sure I said tomato.

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:46.020
 Boy.

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:47.340
 The part that makes me mad, Homer,

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:49.100
 is I could have just as well said asparagus

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:50.860
 and been unsafe ground.

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:52.580
 Hey, fellas, the meaning's over.

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:53.540
 What did they decide, Willie?

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:54.340
 Yeah, what?

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:56.900
 Well, what are you guys just going to be awfully disappointed?

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:58.100
 We are?

00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:59.540
 Tell us which one it is.

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:01.540
 Now, listen, Henry, I'm the manager

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:03.980
 and I'll make the announcement when I'm good and ready.

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:06.860
 Besides, it shouldn't make any difference to you how they decided.

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:07.820
 You mean I didn't make it?

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:08.620
 No.

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:10.180
 They liked Homer's voice better.

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:11.340
 They did?

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:12.020
 No kidding.

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:12.540
 Sure.

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:13.860
 It carries farther.

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:17.300
 They say they can hear your voice even in the last role of the balcony.

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:19.060
 Lucy Adams also made the team.

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:22.420
 Well, I got to go back and attend to some correspondence.

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:24.460
 Gee, Henry, I'm sorry.

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:27.540
 Oh, she has nothing to be sorry about Homer.

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:30.060
 If you want to know the truth, I'm glad I didn't make it.

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:32.220
 Lucy Adams on it and everything.

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:35.220
 Ellen Standish is on it.

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:38.940
 You know Homer, we've been friends for a long time, haven't we?

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:39.740
 Sure.

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:41.300
 Well, I was just thinking.

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:43.500
 You've done a lot of nice things for me,

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:45.740
 so I'm going to do you a favor.

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:46.300
 You are?

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:47.100
 Sure.

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:48.900
 I'm willing to take your place on the team, just out

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:50.700
 of friendship, and I won't charge you a cent.

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:52.020
 Why?

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:54.460
 Well, don't you want to get off the team?

00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:56.100
 When did I say that?

00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:58.060
 Well, I shouldn't think you'd want to be on it.

00:07:58.060 --> 00:07:59.540
 Hey, Henry, what are you--

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:00.380
 - And what, Willie?

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:01.540
 - You made the team.

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:02.380
 - And I didn't?

00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:03.860
 - No, you're on it too, Homer.

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:04.900
 - I am?

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:06.700
 Henry, that kid's rid of Lucy Adams.

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:07.540
 - No, it doesn't.

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:09.220
 She's on the team too.

00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:10.460
 - Whose place do I take?

00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:12.140
 - Ellen Stanishes.

00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:13.260
 - Ellen's?

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:14.100
 - Ellen's?

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:15.940
 - Yes, she just resigned.

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:17.780
 - There, Homer, not even see what you've done.

00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:19.140
 - It isn't Homer's fault.

00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:21.820
 - Ellen says she's entirely too nervous to debate.

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:23.900
 - Hello, Henry, congratulations.

00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:25.020
 - Oh, hello, Lucy.

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:26.460
 - Isn't it wonderful?

00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:27.780
 - Henry, I'm going home.

00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:29.420
 - But Homer, haven't you heard?

00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:32.020
 Lucy, you don't think debating is gonna make you nervous, do you?

00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:33.980
 Oh, no, I feel wonderful.

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:35.520
 I think I'll resign.

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:39.820
 Henry, you aren't gonna resign just as we've got our first debate scheduled, are you?

00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:40.820
 For when, Willie?

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:43.220
 Didn't you know? For a week from next Friday night.

00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:45.620
 I've been corresponding about it since last August.

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:46.820
 Who are we debating with?

00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:48.020
 Middletown High School.

00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:54.420
 The subject has resolved that the steam engine has contributed more to the progress of civilization than the horse.

00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:55.820
 Well, on which side are we?

00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:56.620
 The horses.

00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:58.420
 We take the negative?

00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:01.060
 Sure, we're not believing steam engines.

00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:11.940
 Henry, don't you think the horse has done more than the steam engine?

00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:12.980
 I don't know, Lucy.

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:14.820
 Henry, you don't seem interested.

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:17.300
 Lucy, I just don't think I'm gonna be any good at this.

00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:20.740
 If I can't convince myself, how am I gonna convince a whole auditorium full of people?

00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:22.660
 But that's the way I felt at first.

00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:24.420
 Here we have a cookie in my mother's bag.

00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:25.300
 And no, thank you.

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:26.580
 They have fudge fillings.

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:28.020
 Fudge fillings?

00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:30.020
 Well, I'll try just half of one.

00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:34.020
 Here. Think of what the horse has done for agriculture, Henry.

00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:37.020
 Sixty percent of the farms in this country still use horses.

00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:41.020
 Now, Ryan, may I have the other half of that cookie?

00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:46.020
 Sure, here. And Henry, how did the covered wagons cross the plains?

00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:48.020
 - Why horse? - By horse.

00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:50.020
 Our forefathers didn't know what a steam engine was.

00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:52.020
 Well, that's true, Lucy.

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:54.020
 - And you always have cookies like this? - Of course.

00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:56.020
 See how interesting it is?

00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:58.020
 Let's begin to show some possibilities.

00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:00.020
 Excuse me for reaching in front of you.

00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:03.020
 When you get through with those cookies, Henry, there are some more in the kitchen.

00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:06.020
 Oh my goodness, I wonder whether that's Willy phone.

00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:07.020
 Willy?

00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:08.020
 Hello?

00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:09.020
 Hello Lucy.

00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:11.020
 Oh, is that you Homer?

00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:12.020
 Yes, is Henry there?

00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:13.020
 Henry.

00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:15.020
 She was what his Homer won?

00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:16.020
 Here.

00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:17.020
 Oh, Homer.

00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:18.020
 Can't you get away from her Henry?

00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:19.020
 No, exactly.

00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:21.020
 Boy, do I pity you.

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:23.020
 Do you know when I dug up in the library this afternoon?

00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:24.020
 What?

00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:24.860
 What?

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:26.380
 All about the eo-hippus.

00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:28.260
 The what of us?

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:29.780
 The eo-hippus.

00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:33.820
 It was a prehistoric horse, and it stood less than two feet high.

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:35.260
 What was it used for?

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.460
 I don't think it was used for anything.

00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:38.980
 But I think we ought to mention it, Henry.

00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:40.660
 It'll show we dug into it.

00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:42.420
 They had four toes.

00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:43.340
 Four?

00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:44.260
 Imagine.

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:45.500
 Henry, we have another cookie?

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:46.540
 Sure, thanks, Lucy.

00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:47.460
 Cookie?

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:49.460
 And Homer, did you ever think of this?

00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:51.180
 How do they speak of a steam engine?

00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:51.620
 How?

00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:52.980
 By its horsepower.

00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:53.820
 Sure.

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:55.620
 Boy, Henry, that's wonderful.

00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:56.620
 Write it down, Lucy.

00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:58.020
 And I'll write down about the U-H-E-F.

00:10:58.020 --> 00:10:59.020
 Sure!

00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:02.020
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:14.260
 Mr. Chairman, honorable judges, were the opponents.

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:18.260
 The subject we've been asked to discuss this evening is resale.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.980
 Enra, do you have to wave your arms?

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:22.620
 Was I waving my arms, Father?

00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:29.620
 When we are through ladies and gentlemen, it will be clearly seen that the horse is one animal that cannot be replaced.

00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:31.620
 What time does the debate begin this evening?

00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:35.620
 An eight fifteen and boy father were a cinch to win. Where was I?

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:38.620
 The horse is an animal that cannot be replaced.

00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:42.620
 Oh yeah. What are steam engines made of ladies and gentlemen?

00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:48.620
 Steel and iron and steel and coal. And how do they first get them out of the mines?

00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:55.400
 the mines. I'll tell you how it'll be a pleasure. Buy a horse. Father don't you

00:11:55.400 --> 00:12:02.180
 think that's gonna knock him for a loop? I'm afraid it will. I prepared this whole

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:08.800
 thing in a week and what makes pulleys go round? Belts? And what are belts made

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:14.880
 of? From horses hides. And what was the first machine ever made? A cart. And what

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:17.880
 Pull the cart, a horse.

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:19.760
 Then how about Paul Revere?

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:22.480
 It's common gossip, known by every school child,

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:26.000
 how he saved America with a horse.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.360
 And then father, I go on and they end up

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:29.680
 with a long speech about the Eohippus.

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:30.840
 Eohippus?

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:31.680
 Yes, sir.

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:34.680
 It was a prehistoric horse that hardly came up to my knees.

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:36.160
 Don't you think it's pretty good?

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:40.080
 Well, it has one or two weak points, Henry.

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:42.760
 If it, father, what you heard is only one third of our argument.

00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:44.800
 We've divided it into three parts.

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:47.440
 I cover the horse as a historical contribution.

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:48.920
 The Homer covers it during the present,

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:51.520
 and Lucy covers it from the female point of view.

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:54.560
 Henry, I've just pressed your blue-seared suit for you.

00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:55.400
 Thank you, Mother.

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:56.920
 And when you get up on the platform,

00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:58.840
 don't turn your back to the audience.

00:12:58.840 --> 00:12:59.680
 Why not, Mother?

00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:01.000
 The seat is shiny.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.680
 (audience laughing)

00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:05.600
 Henry, do you mind if I raise one or two questions?

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:07.400
 I mean, there's something about my speech that puzzles you?

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:10.600
 Well, in the first place, iron is not whole out of mines

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:13.320
 by horses, but by mules.

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:15.520
 Well, Father, I don't like to argue,

00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:17.180
 but when you get right down to it,

00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:19.640
 a mule is sort of a horse.

00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:21.280
 A mule is a mule.

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:24.560
 I could show you a book that says a mule is a horse.

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:25.960
 I'd like to see it.

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:28.440
 Well, anyway, I don't think that's the point, Father.

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:31.720
 The question is, which is done more for civilization?

00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:33.320
 Well, supposing you're worthy of opponents

00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:35.320
 remind your audience that the first cart

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:38.480
 was not pulled by a horse, but by a man.

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:40.040
 No horse? No horse.

00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:41.400
 Not even a neo-hippus?

00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:42.560
 No, sir.

00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:48.360
 And supposing I mentioned the fact that very good driving belts are made not only from horse hide, but from cow hide.

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:53.360
 And with Bob you keep evading the issue. What I'm talking about is horses.

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:55.360
 Alright then let's talk about them.

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:58.760
 In what way did Paul Revere's horse help promote progress?

00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:04.160
 Well it stands the reason. If he hadn't had a horse he wouldn't have been able to spread the alarm before the enemy came.

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:06.960
 Supposing he had to wait around until the steam engine was invented.

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:09.760
 And by what means was the enemy approaching?

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:10.560
 On horseback.

00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:14.360
 In other words, it was a case of one horse trying to get away from a number of other horses.

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:18.060
 Therefore, the horses all cancel each other out and have nothing to do with the case.

00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:21.060
 Did you say that again, Father?

00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:24.060
 Make it a little clearer?

00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:26.560
 I'm a lawyer. I don't have to be clear.

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:28.760
 Henry?

00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:29.560
 Yes, Mother?

00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:31.360
 It's time for you to go upstairs and watch.

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:31.960
 Already?

00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:33.560
 Yes, dear, dinner's on the table.

00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:34.260
 Dinner?

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:37.060
 Well, she, Mother, it's a funny thing, but...

00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:39.360
 All of a sudden, something happened to my stomach.

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:41.960
 What's the matter, dear, if you lost your confidence?

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:44.660
 I just wish I hadn't got mixed up in this darn debate.

00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:47.520
 Now, dear, you go upstairs and get washed. You'll feel better.

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:49.000
 Yes, mother.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.860
 You and Father are going to sit down in front, are you?

00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:51.460
 We are.

00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:54.260
 Well, don't do that, Father. Every time I see your face, I'll forget all about horses.

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.160
 Henry, please go upstairs.

00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:57.060
 Yes, mother.

00:14:57.060 --> 00:14:59.360
 I feel just as though I was sitting on the gillow thing.

00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:02.760
 Sam, did I overhear you criticizing Henry's talk?

00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:06.960
 I was simply pointing out one or two of his weak spots. There's nothing wrong with that.

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:09.220
 My goodness, Sam, now you're just rude about it.

00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:10.660
 You know how Henry is.

00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:13.560
 I'll answer the phone, maybe the face being called off.

00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:16.800
 There, Sam is a very good example of how you've unnerved him.

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:18.040
 Alice, I give you my word.

00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:19.680
 I was simply trying to help the boy.

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:22.280
 Well, I'm quite sure that if I had to stand up

00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:24.240
 before an audience of several hundred people,

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:27.480
 I wouldn't want my father to upset me just before I went on.

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:28.120
 Henry!

00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:28.720
 Yes, Father?

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:30.160
 When you threw on the phone, come in here.

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:31.120
 Yes, sir.

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:33.320
 Sam, you're going to wear your best suit, aren't you?

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:34.760
 Just to go over to the high school.

00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:36.000
 Well, dear, I bought a new hat.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.360
 But after all, we don't want to be a disgrace to Henry.

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:42.600
 And I do want Henry to win, if only because of that Ellen's stand-ish.

00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:43.600
 What is he done?

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:47.000
 Well, Mary heard that Ellen got off the team just because Henry was on it.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.360
 She was as Lucy Nervous, poor kid.

00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:51.480
 Well, don't you be nervous, Henry?

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:54.400
 Your father and I are trying not to be.

00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:55.800
 What a loosely call you about.

00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:57.600
 Just to say she's so scared she can't eat her dinner.

00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:59.880
 Well, you should have told her to have a cup of tea.

00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:01.400
 That's all I'm going to have.

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:02.400
 [LAUGHTER]

00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:03.400
 Henry.

00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:04.400
 I'm going up and finish washing.

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:05.900
 Before you go up...

00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:07.200
 There's something more wrong with my speech.

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:11.200
 Well, I'd like to explain that the only reason I criticized your talk was to...

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:13.600
 find out how much you believed in it.

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:14.200
 Oh!

00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:17.100
 You see, if you don't believe with all your heart and soul

00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:20.800
 that the horse has been more important than the judges won't believe you.

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:22.800
 Oh, but I do believe it, Father.

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:25.000
 I suppose I'm a little sentimental about it,

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.900
 but it isn't just for my second for yours that I want to win.

00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:29.900
 It's really for all horses in general.

00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:32.400
 [phone ringing]

00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:34.400
 Henry, could I speak to you for a minute?

00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:35.900
 What did you come from, Willie?

00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:38.400
 I just met the middle town debating team at the station.

00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:40.900
 And boy, have they made a mess of things.

00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:43.900
 Oh, well, we're taking a negative of the argument, aren't we?

00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:45.900
 Yeah. Well, so are they.

00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:47.900
 You mean they've taken our side?

00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:50.400
 Yes. Can you imagine our dirty trick like that?

00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:52.900
 I could have thing like that have happened.

00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:56.900
 Well, something seems to have gone wrong with the correspondence.

00:16:56.900 --> 00:17:00.400
 Willie, you mean it was really your fault?

00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:04.400
 Henry, I'd like you to see all the correspondence I've handled on this.

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:06.600
 I bet you'd make one or two minor mistakes yourself.

00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:07.900
 What are you going to do about it?

00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:11.900
 Well, Mr. Bradley, our principal says our team has to take the other side.

00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:13.400
 The other side?

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:16.400
 Willie, you mean I have to be a traitor to the horse?

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:29.900
 We'll return to the Aldrich family in just a moment.

00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:31.420
 [POPPING]

00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:33.260
 What's new?

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:36.620
 The '53 Plymouth, it's news.

00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:39.540
 The '53 Plymouth, the low-price field,

00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:41.540
 has a brand new star.

00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:46.340
 The truly balanced Plymouth, a new kind of car, a new kind of car.

00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:47.780
 New kind of car is right.

00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:49.900
 The '53 Plymouth is new from the wheels up,

00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:51.980
 a whole new concept of car design.

00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:54.100
 New styling, new beauty, inside and out.

00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:55.580
 A wonderful new ride.

00:17:55.580 --> 00:17:57.740
 Plymouth announcement day is this coming Thursday.

00:17:57.740 --> 00:18:01.340
 So plan now to make tracks to your nearby Plymouth Dealers Thursday.

00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:07.440
 You'll be thrilled when you see the new Plymouth, delighted when you get behind the wheel and handle the controls.

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:11.640
 And here's a tip, pay particular attention to the new features of the Plymouth,

00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:18.640
 75 new features in all, because there's a big Plymouth contest this year with $25,000 in prizes,

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:21.940
 just for telling what you like most about this great new beauty.

00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:25.040
 First prize, a sleek, racy, 53 Plymouth convertible,

00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:27.240
 win it and be the envy of the neighborhood.

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:31.640
 Next five winners get new Plymouth sedans and there are hundreds of cash prizes.

00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:35.440
 It's fun, easy to enter and you get full details from your Plymouth dealer.

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:39.640
 See him Thursday for your entry blank and meet the new 53 Plymouth.

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:51.240
 And now getting back to the troubles of Henry Allridge.

00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:54.240
 Well after working on a debate for ten days,

00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:58.240
 Henry has just learned that his team has been preparing the wrong side.

00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:01.240
 The scene opens in the High School Principal's office.

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:03.240
 The time is that same evening.

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:06.240
 But Mr. Bradley, it isn't fair to the team. It isn't fair to the audience.

00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:12.240
 Henry, the mistake was made by our manager. The least we can do is take the affirmative and go ahead with the debate.

00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:14.240
 But in the meantime, how about the horse?

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:16.240
 I think the horse will understand.

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:21.240
 But Mr. Bradley, we memorized our speeches word for word. I've even learned a whole eulogy to the horse.

00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:25.000
 I can't just give the whole thing and insert the word steam engine instead of horse, can I?

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.040
 Enray, why do we have debates?

00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:30.440
 Well, in order to develop our faculties for thinking and reasoning.

00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:33.440
 Don't you see Mr. Bradley? I'm no good at a thing like that. I can't argue.

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:35.440
 You're doing a pretty good job of it right now.

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:36.440
 But I'm losing.

00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:37.440
 Yes.

00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:38.840
 [audience laughter]

00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:40.840
 How'd you develop it in your faculties?

00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:41.840
 Come in.

00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:43.640
 Mr. Bradley, is Henry in here?

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:44.640
 Yes, Lucy.

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:45.640
 Well, look, Henry.

00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:47.440
 Could we ask Mr. Bradley to do this?

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:48.440
 To do what?

00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:49.640
 Why do both teams agree?

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:52.940
 Right at the start, the horse has made the greatest contribution to civilization,

00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:56.280
 and then let the judges decide which team is the most sincere.

00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:59.080
 Sure, Mr. Bradley, that would be interesting.

00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:02.220
 No. The Middletown team are our guests,

00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:04.780
 and the least we can do is have a difference of opinion with them.

00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:05.780
 [knocking on door]

00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:06.780
 Yes?

00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:09.120
 Mr. Bradley, is the school nurse here?

00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:10.320
 What's the matter, Homer?

00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:12.720
 Well, it's a funny thing, but I have chills and a headache.

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:14.120
 Chills and a headache?

00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:16.120
 Yes, sir. And my jaws hurt.

00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:17.960
 I think I'm coming down with the mumps.

00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:20.960
 Didn't you have the month's last fall, Homer?

00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:23.960
 But, Mr. Bradley, I've just been talking with the Middletown team.

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:26.960
 They don't feel half as keen about the horses we do.

00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:28.960
 Why don't we be generous and give them the steam engine?

00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:32.960
 Henry and Homer, you have exactly 30 minutes in which to prepare your arguments.

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:34.960
 Middletown will take the negative.

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:38.960
 And if Centerville is half the high school, I think it is, we shall take the affirmative.

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:42.920
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:54.560
 What is more, ladies and gentlemen, members of the faculty?

00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:56.960
 Since the center of ill team has just

00:20:56.960 --> 00:21:00.520
 learned at the last moment that it must change sides,

00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:04.240
 it will, so to speak, be swapping horses

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:07.720
 in the middle of the stream in favor of the steam engine.

00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:10.720
 [laughter]

00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:22.720
 And I suppose that the picture of water that rests on this stand is for the affirmative to make steam with and for the negative to give to their horses.

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:27.720
 [laughter]

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:32.720
 And the first speaker for the negative by meaning the affirmative.

00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:37.720
 I mean, yes, the affirmative is Homer Brown.

00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:41.400
 (audience applauding)

00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:44.420
 - The question we have been asked to discuss was,

00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:47.940
 oh boy, I mean, ladies and gentlemen,

00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:49.400
 and honorable judges.

00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:52.400
 (audience laughing)

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:58.400
 Speaking of man's best friend, the horse,

00:21:58.400 --> 00:21:59.400
 the steam engine,

00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:06.400
 Instead of boring you for my full six minutes, I believe I can prove my point in practically less than a minute.

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:11.200
 [MUSIC]

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:18.040
 And what is more, ladies and gentlemen, when a lady who lives in Chicago sees a hat that she wants in New York, how do they get it to him?

00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:20.040
 By horseback? No!

00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:24.280
 [MUSIC]

00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:29.240
 The next point I wish to bring to your attention is that little run of a beast, the E.O. Hepace.

00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:31.240
 That was never good for anything at all.

00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:33.240
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:38.240
 [APPLAUSE]

00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:45.640
 Ladies and gentlemen, you have heard both sides

00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:49.000
 of the argument and the rebuttal for the negative.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.280
 The center of L-Team did not utilize

00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:54.040
 all of its original time, and I do not

00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:55.800
 know whether any of its members would care

00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:57.720
 to take part of the rebuttal.

00:22:57.720 --> 00:23:01.160
 If so, we will now hear from Henry Eldridge.

00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:04.160
 [APPLAUSE]

00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:07.320
 Mr. Chairman, Senator Bill High School has several things

00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:07.820
 to say.

00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:13.440
 My worthy opponents have tried to impress on you

00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:15.880
 that if it weren't for the horse, we wouldn't have any steel

00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:19.120
 or iron with which to build steam engines.

00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:22.480
 May I ask, will they ever got any such idea as that?

00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:24.680
 Horses aren't used in mines.

00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:27.760
 Mules are the next point.

00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:34.680
 My worthy opponent says that the first cart was pulled by a horse.

00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:38.000
 For his information, a man pulled the first cart.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.160
 And now they're glad to ride in steam engines and relax.

00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:43.080
 Then out of the middle-town jean getter this evening

00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:44.640
 by another steam engine.

00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:48.840
 [APPLAUSE]

00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:49.640
 And another point.

00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:57.240
 My opponents would have you believe that if it hadn't been for Paul Revere's horse,

00:23:57.240 --> 00:24:00.440
 we wouldn't be here in this happy, carefree land.

00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:03.440
 But what was Paul Revere's horse trying to get away from?

00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:05.640
 More horses.

00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:09.800
 It was horses, ladies and gentlemen, that was causing all the trouble.

00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:13.480
 And I ask you, is that what you could call progress?

00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:14.480
 No.

00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:17.760
 No, a thousand times no.

00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:18.760
 The affirmative rest.

00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:22.160
 [APPLAUSE]

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:25.560
 Ladies and gentlemen, while the judges

00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:27.720
 retire to try to reach their decision,

00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:30.320
 a very difficult decision, I'm sure.

00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:33.280
 The orchestra will entertain us with the number

00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:36.040
 which they had rehearsed before they discovered

00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:38.200
 their own team was to take the affirmative.

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:41.520
 It is called light cavalry overture.

00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:44.520
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:51.520
 [Music]

00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:54.520
 Sam, haven't the judges reached the decision yet?

00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:56.520
 I think they're coming on stage right now.

00:24:56.520 --> 00:24:57.520
 Do you think Henry won?

00:24:57.520 --> 00:24:58.520
 I don't know, Alice.

00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:03.520
 Well, I thought he talked beautifully, and he certainly looked better than any of the boys on the middle town team.

00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:06.520
 Ladies and gentlemen, I doubt it's Mr. Badis going to announce the decision.

00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:13.520
 After careful consideration, the judges have voted unanimously in favor of the negative.

00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:20.000
 negative. Which side is the negative side? Middle time. You mean Henry Laws? He did.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:25.000
 I sure would like to congratulate not only the winners but our team as well in

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:29.500
 spite of the fact that we lost. Never have I heard final examples of

00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:34.400
 extemporaneous speaking. If I hadn't known to the contrary I would have said

00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:39.360
 that the last speaker Henry Aldrich had prepared his rebuttal in advance. Mr.

00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:42.400
 chairman yes mister uh...

00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:44.800
 i have to be one of the judges of may i ask

00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:46.640
 was the negative middle town

00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:47.400
 uh...

00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:48.640
 the negative

00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:50.080
 was middle town

00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:53.200
 well uh... the manager who gave us our slip to paper to mark the verdict on

00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:55.080
 apparently got things twisted

00:25:55.080 --> 00:26:00.080
 regardless of which side they had a decision went to centerville

00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:01.520
 everyone

00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:03.080
 shake his head

00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:06.320
 i don't wish that i understand issues mother could have been here tonight

00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:07.920
 Hello, Mother, how are you?

00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:09.320
 Let me take your hands.

00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:11.720
 It was because of you, Father, that we got the decision.

00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:14.520
 Well, I was worried for a few minutes, though.

00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:16.400
 I was afraid Middletown would mention the fact

00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:18.720
 that most of the British troops were not on horseback,

00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:20.840
 but on foot.

00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:22.240
 You mean they weren't on horseback?

00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:25.160
 Not so far as I know.

00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:26.400
 Well, she was.

00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:29.900

00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:36.900
 [Music]

00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:38.900
 Sam, have you seen the morning paper?

00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:39.900
 No Alice, watch the news.

00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:40.900
 Listen to this.

00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:43.900
 Before a capacity audience last night,

00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:46.900
 Centerville High School defended the negative side of a heated battle,

00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:50.900
 in which they were particularly effective in arguing for the affirmative.

00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:55.900
 Henry Aldridge kept the visiting opponents completely baffled to the very end

00:26:55.900 --> 00:26:58.900
 as to whether he favored the colonists or the British.

00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:01.900
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:13.900
 Henry, is that you in the kitchen?

00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:14.700
 Yes, Father.

00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:16.660
 Henry, are you eating more cookies

00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:19.300
 after cleaning out the cookie jar at Lucy's house?

00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:20.580
 Well, gosh, Father.

00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:23.060
 I felt like it's hungry all over again after walking home.

00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:24.220
 Nah, Henry.

00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:25.580
 No wonder I'm always hungry.

00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:27.140
 All I ever do is walk.

00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:28.380
 Walk here, walk there.

00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:34.180
 If there's a hidden meaning to this walkie-talkie conversation, please bring it out in the open, because I'm going to bed.

00:27:34.180 --> 00:27:35.340
 Hidden meaning, Father?

00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:42.580
 I think the last time you acquainted me with your walking expeditions, it ended with a sales talk to buy you a car.

00:27:42.580 --> 00:27:45.280
 Oh, you won't have to buy this one, Father. It's free.

00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:48.980
 Now, Plymouth convertible, first prize in the big Plymouth contest.

00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:52.980
 If I wasn't too young, I'd enter myself. But I figured with my help, you'd be a sic-to-win.

00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:55.180
 Oh, please, Henry, not tonight. I'm a bit tired.

00:27:55.180 --> 00:27:58.180
 Not tonight, Father. The contest doesn't start till Thursday.

00:27:58.180 --> 00:27:59.780
 That's when the new Plymouth comes out.

00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:02.980
 All right. Remind me Thursday and we'll go down and see the new Plymouth.

00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:04.380
 Now would you get up to bed?

00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:06.880
 Yes, Father. Just as soon as I finish these cookies.

00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:10.180
 Boy. A new Plymouth convertible.

00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:20.180

 Mr. and Mrs. Aldridge, a house Jameson and Catherine wrought. Your announcer is Dick Dudley.

00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:37.600
 Good night everybody and remember you have an important day Thursday to meet the new 53 Plymouth.

00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:49.480
 Tonight it's the Phil Harris Alice Fayshow on NBC.
