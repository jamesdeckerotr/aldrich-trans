00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.840
 The Aldrich family based on characters originated by Clifford Goldsmith and starring Ezra Stone

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:17.840
 of Henry with Jackie Kalk as Homer. Henry! Henry all of it! Coming, mother!

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.820

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.580

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:57.100
 In the comfortable home at 117 Elm Street, Centerville, USA,

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.100
 live friends and neighbors of yours, the Aldrich family.

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.100
 You know Sam and Alice Aldrich and their daughter Mary,

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:09.700
 And if you'd rather come in contact with a teenage boy, you'd certainly know Henry Aldrich.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.300
 Now that it's Saturday morning, the scene opens in the Aldrich living room.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:15.900
 Is it father, is it?

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.200
 - Hey, is it water, Henry? - Oh, I want to know with what a youth think it is.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.600
 - So that I think what water is? - Peanut butter, father, is it ration?

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.800
 Henry, do you realize I put aside this whole day to work on my income tax?

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.700
 And you begin by mixing me up with a thing like peanut butter?

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.060
 Oh, excuse me. Only are they both under the government now.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.300
 Is there any reason why you can't ask your mother?

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.980
 Well, she's up on the third floor and I thought if I yelled or weren't,

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:40.140
 what only disturbed you?

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.620
 Henry, I have no idea

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.140
 if the what the government is going to do about peanut butter.

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.540
 But I do know what they do if I don't get my tax in.

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.060
 Yes, sir. And I'm very sorry to have bothered you.

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.500
 Mother!

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:51.620
 Mother!

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:52.860
 Mother!

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.020
 Henry!

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.180
 Father, do you realize the terrible things you've gotten me into?

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.820
 What's that, Mary?

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.620
 My goodness, I'll never be able to face your gram again for as long as

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.120
 Mary, I'm trying to do my income tax.

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.420
 Now, please get away.

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.320
 But, Father, you told me we were going to have a snowstorm

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:07.920
 and it would last two or three days.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.620
 All right, if I told you, then we'll probably eventually have it.

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:11.620
 Now, get away.

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:12.620
 What are the days again?

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.820
 I took the word and called everybody up and told them,

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.220
 "Joe Graham and I were giving a sleigh ride party tonight."

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.220
 Everything's all arranged in no love.

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:20.220
 What?

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.620
 The sun's shining, isn't it terrible? It's just like a spring day.

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.220
 Mary, for the last time, I am not interested in the weather or in peanut butter.

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.620
 What, sir? Mary, you're not the daughter you're for.

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.220
 Father, all I'm doing is telling him how upset I am.

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.160
 No, the urge is about your slay right party.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.060
 It isn't your father's fault. It turned warm.

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.220
 My goodness, even the crocuses are coming out.

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.820
 What father said we rent for a terrible three-day splitter?

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.160
 Mary, anybody can make a mistake like that.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.620
 But not that much of a mistake.

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.960
 I'm sorry, I agree with your father, Mary.

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.400
 It isn't important. Now, please run along and let him get his income tax done.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.660
 Yes, mother, I'll go.

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.100
 Only I've got the phone practically.

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.740
 Everybody in this town and apologize for father.

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:55.820
 Thank you, Alice.

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.580
 Sam, do you want any of the things that in this box thrown out?

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:59.820
 I'd love for you talking about.

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.380
 I just wrote it down from the attic.

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.660
 Alice, how do I know whether I want any of those things?

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:04.420
 Look at them all.

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:05.260
 All right, dear.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.260
 Can't you go through it if I'm willing to wait for you?

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
 Just put the box under the table for now.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.020
 Dear, I'm trying to clean this house up,

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.500
 not make it look worse in my goodness.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.100
 So, here I don't see how you needn't begin to figure your tax.

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:18.300
 Alice, what are you doing?

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:19.860
 I'm opening the window.

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.060
 Time we ate out the house.

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.420
 Alice, my papers.

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:23.620
 Put a book on them.

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.340
 Just a nice little breeze.

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.420
 Anyhow, I want you to go up to the attic with me

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:28.740
 and bring down all the blankets.

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:29.580
 - What for?

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.380
 - I wanna hang them on the line, dear.

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.500
 This is too nice a day not to take advantage of it.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:34.340
 - No, Alan.

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:35.880
 - I'll be back and help you just as soon

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.460
 as I've taken care of something.

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:38.300
 - Henry!

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.100
 - Yes, mother, I'm out in the kitchen.

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:41.460
 - Henry, where in the world did you get

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:42.900
 that caramel layer cake?

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.140
 - I got some cake, mother.

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.980
 - What is it?

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:46.980
 - That's a triple deck of peanut butter sandwich.

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:48.900
 - And exactly how are you gonna get your mouth

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.140
 around anything that big?

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:51.740
 - That's for me, Mrs. Aldrich.

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:53.180
 I can handle it all right.

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:54.100
 (audience laughing)

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.340
 We're going in a picnic.

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:56.180
 - A picnic?

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:57.020
 - Sure.

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:58.820
 They're going half a month late.

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:00.420
 But the peanut butter isn't racist.

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:01.720
 It isn't old boy.

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.020
 Hand me that knife, Henry.

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:04.320
 Now wait a minute, Homer.

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.720
 Henry, all I want to do is make one for Wilbur.

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:07.920
 For Wilbur?

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.020
 You're going to laugh here?

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.720
 Sure.

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.520
 Is he visiting you this weekend, Homer?

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:12.620
 Yes, Mrs. Aldrich.

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.620
 His folks seem to like to leave him with us.

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.920
 If you boys don't mind taking a famous butter,

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:18.520
 I'll make some hot soup for you.

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:19.720
 Hot soup, mother.

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:20.720
 I'm a hot morse.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:21.720
 Stay like this.

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.020
 Mrs. Aldrich, we're taking some ice cold milk.

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:25.520
 And how are you going to keep it cold?

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.520
 We'll put it in the same spot and caulk it up real quick.

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:33.520
 Now listen, Homer, do you mean to say you're pointing to what little Wilbur will ruin our party?

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.520
 Henry, I can't help it if I have to take care of him.

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.520
 I know, but listen, I'm his uncle, aren't I?

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.520
 Sure, but I'm not.

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.520
 Henry, if I don't take him along my allowance, gets cut off.

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.520
 Now that's all there is to it. Okay, Homer.

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:49.520
 If you want to spoil the first 12th Spring Day we've had this winter, you can count me out.

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:50.520
 You're not going?

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:51.520
 No.

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.520
 And you can also stop spreading our peanut butter around as though we're free as well.

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:55.920
 I'm the soloist for you, sir.

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.120
 Now, wait, Henry.

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.420
 Give me one good sound reason why we'll be shouldn't go.

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:03.120
 I mean, outside of the fact that you just don't like them.

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.120
 We're going on our bicycles, aren't we?

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.520
 And how could Wilma possibly run along beside us and keep up with us?

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.520
 He was, he always has, hasn't he?

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:14.920
 You mean he can talk for 11 miles? That little kid?

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:17.620
 Sure, that's why I want to give him a peanut butter sandwich.

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:21.120
 And besides, it isn't 11 miles to Kenlow Point. It's only eight.

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.520
 It's a lot, it's eight.

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.920
 And if he gets tired, he can ride our handlebars.

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:26.520
 Hold on, I'm telling you, it's a webinar!

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.620
 Okay, where's your father? Where's your father?

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:29.920
 He'll know how far it is.

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:31.820
 Surely, well, I know how far it'll stay.

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:32.520
 Father!

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.920
 Mr. Aldrich, we want you to settle something.

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:35.520
 What's that?

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.020
 Father, how far would you say it is over to Kendall for?

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:40.520
 How far? 13 miles.

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:42.920
 13? 13. Not eight.

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:44.520
 Are you sure it is no webinar, Ray?

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.520
 13. Now, please get away from all these papers.

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:50.320
 But, Father, don't you think it's entirely too far

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:55.600
 a little kid that's only 12 during 13 miles all the way out there and 13 miles all the way back

00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:00.840
 just so Homer can take care of him now listen Henry part of the way would be on handlebar

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:05.040
 Homer will you please stop waving that knife with a big gob of peanut butter on it

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:11.000
 oh she was I didn't even know I had it in my hand I'll just stand back better yet get out of the room

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.140
 boy what are you making your sound because in here for we aren't mother fathers just trying to show

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:17.740
 What a big mistake he's making.

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:21.820
 Mrs. Aldrich, wouldn't you say Kendall point is about eight miles from here?

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:23.260
 At the far end of the lake?

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.380
 Well, that must be about 50 miles.

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:27.140
 15 miles?

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:31.420
 Homer, will you look at that garb of peanut butter right in the middle of my income tax?

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:32.860
 Oh, he was.

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:34.100
 That my peanut butter.

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:34.860
 Homer Brown.

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:35.860
 I can scrape it up.

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:37.620
 The government will never know what it was.

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:39.180
 [LAUGHTER]

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:43.420
 Alice, is there any reason why I can't put Homer's name down as one of my dependents?

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:45.340
 [LAUGHTER]

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:47.840
 I don't know why you shouldn't, Mr. Holley.

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:50.640
 My father does, and my uncle does.

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:51.940
 Your uncle does, Homer.

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:54.840
 Sure. He sends me $25 every Christmas

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:56.840
 and puts me down every March 15.

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:59.040
 Homer, do you mean your uncle Wilbur?

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:00.840
 Oh, no. Wilbur's my nephew.

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:02.040
 He depends on me.

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:04.240
 Homer, stop waving that peanut butter.

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:05.440
 I know why I'll do, will it?

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:07.940
 Well, now you're safe.

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:10.040
 Homer, did you put all that in your mouth at once?

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:11.040
 Uh, fine.

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:13.640
 - Oh, oh, oh, oh. - Oh, are you all right?

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:15.640
 - Right. - Oh, oh, oh.

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:18.240
 - Henry, take him out and force the water down.

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:20.640
 - Oh, come on, Homer. I'm gonna try to look for you.

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:22.440
 Going out, you'll plead you.

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:24.940
 (loud music)

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:26.840
 - Come on, let's go, let's go.

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:29.440
 (loud music)

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:31.440
 - Father!

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:33.440
 - Mary, I'm out here in the backyard.

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:36.040
 - Oh, Father is on the phone and wants to know

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:39.040
 whether it's legal to the desperate, broken fishing tackle.

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:41.840
 The limit's not unless he was fishing for business reasons.

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:44.760
 He also wanted to explain about the surf tax or something.

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:47.880
 Jerry Marv call him just as soon as I get this wash hung up.

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:49.880
 Now Sam, all we're hanging up is blankets.

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:51.600
 Blankets and bathing suits.

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:54.640
 I haven't been near my income tax for an hour and a half.

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:58.080
 The idea of hanging bathing suits out in broad daylight at this time of year.

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:00.760
 Sam, I found them screwed all over the attic floor.

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:02.520
 And incidentally, have you any ideas

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:04.360
 to what could have become of Henry's suit?

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:05.520
 Isn't it here?

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:07.240
 Mother, Mother, what do you think has happened?

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:07.840
 What, Mary?

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:11.640
 I was just talking with Jimi Anderson and you know how his father's editor of the paper, don't you?

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:12.140
 Yes.

00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:17.440
 Well, Jimmy says he thinks it's the funniest thing he's ever heard and he's going to have his father put a whole story about it.

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:18.240
 About why?

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:21.340
 Why am I inviting everybody to a sleigh ride party on the hottest day of the year?

00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:23.640
 Just because father said we were going to have a blessing.

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:27.440
 Mary, it isn't the hottest day of the year. Look at me. I've still got my coat on.

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:32.440
 What father? I've been trying to phone the livery stable all morning to cancel my order for the sleigh and they don't answer.

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:32.840
 So what?

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:36.540
 Mary, no one in his right mind is going to deliver a sleigh on a day like this.

00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:38.540
 or they couldn't even move a sleigh without any snow.

00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:40.100
 But, Martha said there would be snow.

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:43.420
 All right, Mary, but I can't go out and buy some for you.

00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:45.620
 Incidentally, Sam, do you see what I see?

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:46.380
 Where?

00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:48.140
 Off there in the sky, right over there.

00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:50.340
 What do you mean, that little cloud off to a candle point?

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:51.820
 Yes, Sam, what a boy's went.

00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:53.620
 Doesn't that look as though it might rain over there?

00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:55.780
 Now, Alice, there isn't a drop of water in that cloud.

00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:57.380
 It looks like rain to me, Martha.

00:08:57.380 --> 00:09:00.500
 Mary, it isn't as large as one of these blankets.

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:02.220
 Alice, Alice.

00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:03.020
 Sam, where are you?

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:04.180
 - Get out of the clothesline, bro.

00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:05.620
 He's under all those blankets.

00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:06.620
 - Alice!

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:08.620
 - Then get up before you get some dirty.

00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:11.360
 (dramatic music)

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:17.940
 (dramatic music)

00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:24.540
 - Henry, did you see me dive off that rock?

00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:27.220
 - Yeah, boy, cold, isn't it?

00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:29.180
 - Cold? It's wonderful.

00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:30.700
 - Oh, I didn't mean cold.

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:32.180
 I mean, it's just a little cooler

00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:33.180
 I thought it would be.

00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:36.180
 Well, this is the first time we've been in this year.

00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:38.180
 Naturally, we've got to get used to it.

00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:42.180
 Listen, the light gets still warmer than if we've gone all the way up to Kenlow Point.

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:44.180
 I think sure it is.

00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:46.180
 Talk me that towel, Homer, here.

00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:50.180
 When you get through, they've hung it on that bush that our clothes are under.

00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:51.180
 Okay.

00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:53.180
 Well, I'm glad we didn't bring Wilbur.

00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:54.180
 Same here.

00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:57.180
 Even if it did cost me the price of a movie to get rid of him.

00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:58.180
 Sure.

00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:00.180
 And the beautiful part of it is, Homer.

00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:04.560
 He won into that movie before I was ever in a clock and he hoped he out before a phrase.

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:05.560
 Sure.

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:07.560
 Do you want him to take a sandwich and with him?

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:08.400
 Sure.

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:10.720
 The big triple deck of peanut butter.

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:12.360
 Wasn't that being fair with him?

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:13.840
 Sure, she was.

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:15.840
 I thought it was more than generous.

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:17.680
 Henry, what are you shaking for?

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:19.040
 Oh, I'm not shaking.

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:19.600
 Oh, come on.

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:21.040
 Let's give him for the water again.

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:23.200
 Henry, could you see that island out there?

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:23.700
 Yeah.

00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:25.400
 And do you see that cabin on it?

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:27.160
 Let's warm out and explore it.

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:29.000
 Oh boy, why not?

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.680
 By the time we get there the sun will be out again.

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:33.480
 OK, come on.

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:36.280
 Come on yourself.

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:39.040
 Oh boy, oh boy.

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:42.040
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:51.360
 Hello, Sam, all you speaking.

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:52.520
 Sam, this is Alice.

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:53.440
 Hello, where are you?

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:54.800
 I'm downtown shopping, dear.

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:56.480
 Did you take the blankets in?

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:57.080
 Take them in.

00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:58.280
 I didn't know I was supposed to.

00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:00.000
 I thought you wanted them to air all day.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.280
 But, Sandra, did you realize it's raining?

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:03.760
 Raining when it began to rain.

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:05.480
 At least a quarter of an hour ago,

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:07.360
 and Sam, you said it wasn't going to.

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:08.000
 I did?

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:08.720
 Yes, of course.

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:11.120
 And I took your word and wore my brand-new spring coat

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:12.120
 and hat down here.

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:13.000
 Overline a second.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.000
 I want to look out the window.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.600
 What for?

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:16.720
 Yes, Alice, it's raining.

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:18.200
 It's raining quite hard.

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:18.920
 But that's the side.

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:20.760
 It's going to stop as quickly as it begins.

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:22.200
 Sam, it's even turning cold.

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:24.680
 Now, please bring the blankets in right this minute here.

00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:26.800
 But Alice, my income tax.

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:28.080
 And they're all wet anyhow.

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:30.080
 Yes, Alice, I'll get them in.

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:31.080
 Goodbye.

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:32.080
 Goodbye.

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:34.080
 Is that you, Mary?

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:35.080
 Yes, my goodness.

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:36.080
 It's Mrs. Nivet Johnson, phone.

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:37.080
 Mary, you're just the person I want to see.

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:39.080
 Go out, please, and bring in the bedding.

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:41.080
 But, Father, I guess I'm told to get an umbrella

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:42.080
 because you were wrong about it.

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:43.080
 It's not raining, and I simply have to run back

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:44.080
 over to the town then.

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:45.080
 What for?

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:46.080
 Because I haven't been able to get worded

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:48.080
 and then I'm not having a sleigh ride.

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:51.080
 But Mary, well, that's a fine thing.

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:52.080
 Hello.

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:53.080
 Hello.

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:54.080
 Is this, Sam?

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:55.080
 Yes.

00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:56.080
 This is Elizabeth Brown.

00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:57.080
 Who?

00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:59.080
 Oh, yes, yes, hello.

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:02.080
 Sam, I'm sorry to bother you, but his little billboard over there.

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:06.080
 Wilbur, no, he went along with the boys out to Kendall Point.

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:08.080
 Oh, my goodness. They took the billboard all the way?

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:10.080
 Yes, they're going to spend the day on a picnic.

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:13.080
 And you let them? Sam, I don't want to criticize.

00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:15.080
 But didn't you realize it was going to rain?

00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:17.080
 Elizabeth is probably going to stop any minute.

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:19.080
 Just to say, but it's time global probably ringing with.

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:21.080
 There isn't anything to worry about, Elizabeth.

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:24.080
 I know some people that live down there on Kendall Point the year round

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:25.080
 and I'll give them a call right away.

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:26.080
 What good will that do?

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:30.640
 I'll tell them to take an umbrella and go out and look for the boys and make them come into the house.

00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:31.840
 Now don't you worry.

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:49.120
 Hey, there's no use looking out the door every 10 minutes when

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:51.300
 Stop writing!

00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:54.160
 I wonder why they built this cabin without any window.

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:55.460
 That's what I was thinking.

00:12:55.460 --> 00:12:57.160
 You closed the door, Henry.

00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:59.320
 Hold on. You getting cold?

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:00.360
 No.

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:01.960
 What makes you think I'm cold?

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:04.080
 I can't remember if you were shivering.

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:05.320
 Oh, no.

00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:07.400
 Ever since I squeezed my bathing suit out,

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:09.800
 I feel a lot more comfortable.

00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:12.320
 You know, Homer, I sort of wish we had gone

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:13.840
 of that movie with Wilbur.

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:16.800
 Same here, even if I have seen it once.

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:18.560
 Did you say it was pretty good?

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:22.260
 Boy, it's one of the most exciting movies I ever saw.

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.860
 Here's the daylights out of you for about two days.

00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:26.060
 Hey, God?

00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:27.660
 She will below the like it.

00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:29.160
 And the best part of it is Henry,

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:30.960
 his folks don't like him to go to the movie.

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:32.260
 No, why not?

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:33.360
 I don't know.

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:35.860
 You've only let him see about two in his life.

00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:39.060
 It's what it be a special treat for him.

00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:41.060
 It's in a lumber camp, see?

00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:43.660
 And there were two men fighting by a river.

00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:45.160
 And a tree starts to fall on,

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:47.160
 and then they jump in the river to get out of the way.

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:50.460
 Boy, the time carries a mite down to the dam.

00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:51.460
 Yeah?

00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:52.460
 So the dam?

00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:53.460
 Yeah.

00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:57.260
 Boy, when I saw that tree fall, I yelled right out loud.

00:13:57.260 --> 00:14:01.860
 And then boy when the dam broke, did I make a fool of myself.

00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:03.660
 Oh, I think it stopped raining.

00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:04.660
 I don't hear anything.

00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:06.860
 Oh boy, didn't I tell you it was clear?

00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:07.860
 Oh, come back.

00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:09.360
 You were gonna warm this up.

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:10.560
 Open the door.

00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:13.060
 [crying]

00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:14.060
 Oh boy!

00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:17.060
 Henry, what did you trip on?

00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:21.060
 I didn't trip, I slept on the ice on what ice.

00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:24.060
 Oh boy, forget all of me.

00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:27.060
 You went with all this ice come from.

00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:29.060
 You can't even see the ground.

00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:33.060
 Imagine if I was at home, I'd be supposed to water a little bit.

00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:37.060
 Why worry about that, Henry? How are we going to get to the water?

00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:38.060
 Oh, come on.

00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:41.060
 Oh, well, you might be cold on my ice.

00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:43.060
 Henry, let go of me. Do you want me to slip again?

00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:45.560
 How about you let it go, a mejo boy?

00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:47.760
 You have no comers in the beginning of the snow?

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:50.760
 He was imagined to know at a time like this.

00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:53.260
 Homer, do I see a cross on the lake?

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:55.360
 No, I don't think so.

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:56.960
 But you dive in first.

00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:58.960
 [ [Laughter]

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:01.360
 Homer, hello, who's that over there?

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:01.860
 Where?

00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:04.360
 That's almost standing on the shore, he's watching us.

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:06.760
 Oh, it looks like an admit cap.

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:07.660
 Oh, yeah.

00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:09.260
 Fuck, he's going on.

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:12.360
 Oh, well, it has to be done, it's got to be done.

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:14.360
 You mean you're going in?

00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:16.360
 How is it?

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:18.360
 Oh boy, come on in!

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:19.360
 Oh boy!

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:20.360
 Hello!

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:21.360
 I can't open my eyes!

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:22.360
 I can't even breathe!

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:23.360
 Oh boy!

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:24.360
 Oh boy!

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:28.360
 You know, I'm sort of glad that camp's off to win.

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:29.360
 Why?

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:31.360
 I think we've gone to school all the morning.

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:33.360
 I'm trying to tell them we've been swimming in the snowstorm.

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:35.360
 They wouldn't have believed it.

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:38.360
 I'll say, they would have just said we were crazy.

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:41.120
 (dramatic music)

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:49.240
 - But look, Father, it's a regular blizzard out.

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:52.200
 - Of course it is, Mary, didn't I tell you all the time?

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:53.280
 - And what am I going to do?

00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:54.640
 - You shouldn't believe me in the first place.

00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:55.960
 Never canceled your party.

00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:57.400
 - There's at least four inches out there

00:15:57.400 --> 00:15:58.560
 on the ground already.

00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:00.280
 - I've never been able to account for it,

00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:02.440
 but whenever there's a three or four day blizzard

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:05.000
 on the way, I just feel it in my left knee.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.040
 - Well, my goodness, there isn't any reason

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:08.720
 We couldn't have the sleigh ride party.

00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:09.400
 Of course not.

00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:11.520
 You better go right to that phone and start calling people up.

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:12.240
 Yes, I will.

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:14.000
 I wonder what Joe Graham's going to say.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.000
 Sam.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.160
 Yes, Alice, are you back?

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:17.160
 I certainly haven't.

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:19.120
 Frankly, I was never thought said in my life.

00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:20.720
 Mother, just look at your hat and coat.

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:21.160
 Yes, Steve.

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:22.280
 Now, Alice, calm down.

00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:24.320
 When your things dry up, there'll be as good as new.

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:26.640
 You told me, Sam, it wasn't going to rain.

00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:28.760
 I said it wasn't going to rain very long,

00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:29.440
 and it didn't.

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:30.320
 It turned to snow.

00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:32.040
 But Sam, if you forgot the hen rain.

00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:32.600
 Hen rain.

00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:34.440
 Don't you realize what's happened?

00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:36.000
 I just saw Ned met Cap down.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.500
 How many said he'd seen Henry in Homer in swimming?

00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:39.800
 Where in the YMCA?

00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:41.600
 No, dear, in a blizzard at the lake.

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:43.100
 Now, Alice, don't be ridiculous.

00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:44.900
 That's where we went, send this morning.

00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:46.400
 Alice, that'd be sensible about this.

00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:48.500
 Henry and Homer are all warm and comfortable.

00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:49.300
 How do you know they are?

00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:51.700
 Because I call down to Kendall Point and told her family

00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:53.000
 that I'd go out and get them.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
 Oh, who part into filming?

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.300
 And, Mother, I'm sure there isn't anything to worry about.

00:16:57.300 --> 00:17:00.000
 You know, you can't believe has the things, Ned Metcalf says.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.000
 You can't believe?

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.200
 That's right, Alice. You know his father.

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:04.600
 All right, Sam.

00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:08.000
 If you say there's nothing to worry about, then there's nothing to worry about.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:37.000
 [Music]

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.000
 Now getting back to the troubles of Henry Olgrich.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:45.000
 Henry and Homer have gotten rid of Homer's young nephew Wilbur by sending him to a movie

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000
 in order that they might go on a picnic.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:53.000
 But what started off to be a pleasant spring day has become a mid-winter blizzard.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:58.000
 The scene opens with the two boys standing near the edge of the lake in their bathing suit.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000
 Oh, the brothers will go on a thing I don't know.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.000
 Have you found him yet?

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000
 No, of course I have him.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.000
 We have them.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000
 Now, let's wait a second, Henry.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.000
 Let's try to remember exactly which bush we left our things under.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:16.000
 Well, I thought it was this bush here, but everything looks so different.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.000
 Call me Snow.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000
 I know one thing.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:25.000
 I'm not going all the way back to town in the snowstorm on a bicycle wearing the star and bathing suit.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.000
 Oh, pig in the snow.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000
 Oh, no, a cause must be here full-class.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000
 Which treated we hang the tower on.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.000
 How would I know?

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.000
 Oh, well all we have to do is look for a white towel, Henry.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.000
 Sure, that's covered with white snow.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.000
 Homer!

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000
 Homer, I found something! I found something!

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.000
 Oh, where? Come on, help me dig!

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.000
 But he was where.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000
 Something hard, it must be my shoe!

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.000
 Oh, boy!

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.000
 Look at it, Henry.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000
 Homer, is that my shoe?

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000
 We'll hit it against that tree and not some of the snow.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.000
 Okay.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:59.000
 She was not a poor my shoe, but the peanut butter sandwich.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000
 It is. Give me a bite.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.000
 You know, Hor, I should think both of peanut butter would be very good.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.000
 Sure. It ought to taste like peanut brittle.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:15.000
 Hor, Hor, look, I found my pants.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.000
 Oh, she's looking for the frozen sift.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000
 Wait a second, I'll help you un-bend them.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000
 Go easy, Hor, go easy, you want to pray?

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.000
 Oh.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.000
 You said we can't put them on until we un-fold the legs, can't you?

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.000
 Good boy, even if I get them straightened out, how can I get into them?

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.500
 Hit me, hit me, take a look away, just step turned.

00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:34.000
 What is it?

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.000
 It's a famous bottle. Didn't you let a point hot soup in it?

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000
 No, we put ice cold milk in it.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.000
 What did we do that for?

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.000
 What color look like you picked up? What is it?

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.000
 Oh, you're blind, it's my sock.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000
 Stand back, why not the snow?

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:53.000
 Hit me, are you sure that's a sock?

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.000
 Well, oh boy.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.600
 He was I'm not for he or I know.

00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:10.300
 I said Joe, you made me look ridiculous.

00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:13.000
 And you owe my father an apology for doubting his word.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.880
 He said it was going to snow all the time.

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:17.280
 And Mary did do say he thought you ought to give the pardon?

00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:18.560
 Yes, Mother, of course.

00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:21.000
 And I'd call the stable and hired to spray and everything.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.400
 I'll let you find it.

00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:23.440
 Look out the window, Mother.

00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:25.400
 Did you ever see the snow come down nice and?

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:26.760
 It is pretty, isn't it?

00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:29.240
 What are those boards fathers carrying into the basement?

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:30.680
 Those are not boards.

00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:32.040
 Those are our blankets.

00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:33.360
 Oh, my goodness.

00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:35.720
 They can hardly get them through the cellar door.

00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:36.760
 How do you suppose that is?

00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:38.200
 I'll answer it.

00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:38.760
 Hello.

00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:39.400
 Hello.

00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:40.120
 Is this Alice?

00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:40.680
 Yes.

00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:41.720
 This is Elizabeth Brown.

00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:42.520
 Oh, hello.

00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:44.440
 Oh, Alice, I have something terrible to tell you.

00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:44.920
 What's that?

00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:46.120
 We found Wilbur.

00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:46.680
 Who?

00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:48.040
 Wilbur, we found him.

00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:49.000
 What are we going to do?

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.040
 What do you mean, dear?

00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:51.720
 He saw his way back to the snowstorm,

00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:54.040
 and he came running into the house just frightened of this.

00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:54.540
 Really?

00:20:54.540 --> 00:20:56.640
 And Alice, I've never seen anyone so white.

00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:58.640
 He was so upsetting and hardly talk.

00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:00.040
 But where are Henry and Homer?

00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:01.140
 That's the terrible part.

00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:01.840
 What's that?

00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:04.140
 All I could get out of Wilbur was an enormous tree,

00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:05.140
 almost fell on them.

00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:06.140
 Oh, my goodness.

00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:08.940
 In the police, jumping in the water, and then Wilbur says,

00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:11.340
 the current started carrying them down to the dam.

00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:12.640
 Oh, my goodness, and then what?

00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:15.140
 Wilbur said he was so frightened he just got up and ran home.

00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:16.040
 Oh, my goodness.

00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:16.840
 It's Wilbur.

00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:17.340
 Yes.

00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:18.540
 Well, Elizabeth, hold the line.

00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:19.540
 Sam!

00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:20.240
 Sam!

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:21.540
 You called your father.

00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:22.440
 I'm right here, Alice.

00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:22.940
 What happened?

00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:25.380
 - And the blizzard blew a tree down. - Where? After the thought.

00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:28.380
 No out on Kendall Point where the boys are, and I'll send him into the lake.

00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:31.980
 - What's that? How do you know? - Wilbur ran back 15 miles through the blizzard.

00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:34.940
 Just to get home with me. They've got a line right now.

00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:39.060
 Well, Alice, tell her to tell Will to get some warm clothes on, and we'll start in 15 minutes.

00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:41.180
 Yes, Sam. Do you want to take along some hot soup?

00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:43.580
 No, get in to get an axe with a length of chain if you have it.

00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:45.580
 But, Sam, I don't think you can get the car, too.

00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:47.260
 I'm not going to take the car. Mary.

00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:47.860
 Yes, Father?

00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:52.740
 As soon as your mother hangs up, call the livery stable and tell them you want that play you wanted right away with a team of two horses.

00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:54.540
 - Really, Father? - Yes, Alice.

00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:57.340
 Elizabeth, Santa has to tell Willy's coming over to pick him up.

00:21:57.340 --> 00:21:58.820
 Alice, I forgot to tell you.

00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:01.420
 Willy said it was a tree, sir. It broke the dam.

00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:02.340
 Oh, my goodness.

00:22:02.340 --> 00:22:04.260
 Sam, the dam is a lake in broken.

00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:06.100
 He said it was going to be flooded.

00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:16.100
 - Well, how do your boys feel now? - See, we feel fine, Mr. McDowell.

00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:17.940
 - You good and warm? - Oh, sure.

00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:19.700
 We never felt better in our lives.

00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:22.380
 And, gee, this is good hot soup you're life-six for.

00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:24.980
 And so one of you boys didn't get pneumonia out there.

00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:28.080
 Oh, gee, pushing our bicycles up the road kept us warm.

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:28.880
 Sure.

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:29.980
 And for where were we up?

00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:33.480
 He was probably three minutes from where we found our clothes until we got here.

00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:34.980
 So where's Mrs. Macau?

00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:37.280
 She's out in the kitchen getting your clothes dried out.

00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:38.780
 She says they're almost ready.

00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:40.380
 Look, look, it stops knowing.

00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:41.980
 Yes, stop the half an hour ago.

00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:43.780
 It's cleared up real nice.

00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:45.280
 Say, what's that I see out there?

00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:46.180
 Where are Bob?

00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:47.780
 Up on the hillside.

00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:50.020
 That's a team of horses pulling a sleigh.

00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:52.820
 Oh, gee, that's a squall idea. I wish I were on it.

00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:53.460
 Me too.

00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:54.740
 I wonder where those two fellows in

00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:56.020
 think they're going.

00:22:56.020 --> 00:22:57.500
 Boy, they're traveling fast.

00:22:57.500 --> 00:22:58.660
 Oh, I guess what they're trying to do

00:22:58.660 --> 00:23:01.060
 is take a shortcut over the Kendall point.

00:23:01.060 --> 00:23:03.260
 But I wish they keep off my wheat.

00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:05.780
 Just a second while I answer this phone.

00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:06.380
 Hello?

00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:06.700
 Hello.

00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:09.700
 This is an emergency call lining up all a bill-bodied man.

00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:10.500
 Yeah, with the trouble.

00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:11.860
 The dam is in the lake, it's been blown up.

00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:12.340
 What's that?

00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:12.780
 Who did it?

00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:13.780
 Nobody knows.

00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:25.280
 - Mother, Mother, what do you think?

00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:26.120
 - What happened there?

00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:27.480
 - Hey, look, it's coming up the front wall.

00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:29.160
 - There is, it's your father with Henry and Homer.

00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:32.320
 - It's Henry and Homer, all right, the father is no more.

00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:34.440
 - Henry, you poor thing, come here.

00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:36.400
 - Oh, Mother, I was just going around and back

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:37.800
 and hanging my bathing suit up.

00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:39.840
 - See, you're coming here, are you all right?

00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:40.680
 - Yes, you are.

00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:42.280
 - Why do you ask that, Mrs. Aldrich?

00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:44.000
 We never felt better in our life.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:45.600
 - Oh, I don't see how you can, Homer.

00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:47.940
 I happen to know exactly what happened.

00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:49.300
 What happened, Mother, what do you mean?

00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:50.680
 - Wilbur is home, dear.

00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:51.520
 - Oh, is he?

00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:52.800
 - Yes, Homer.

00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:54.100
 - Who told my folk?

00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:57.000
 - Yes, and the poor boy was never so frightened in his life.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:57.840
 - You are?

00:23:57.840 --> 00:23:58.680
 - Oh boy.

00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:00.640
 - Oh, his mother said he was simply hysterical.

00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:01.800
 He still can't talk.

00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:03.880
 - Didn't I tell you he'd be scared, Henry?

00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:04.960
 - See, I can't blame him.

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:05.960
 I was myself.

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:07.560
 - And I should think you would be.

00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:09.720
 - She, when that tree started coming down,

00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:12.040
 I thought, boy, I can't stand this.

00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:13.240
 - You poor boy.

00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:15.520
 - And then when I saw the water pouring over the dam,

00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:18.820
 and I thought, "She'll close my eyes and it'll be alright."

00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:21.920
 And Henry, do you remember the whole thing with horror too?

00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:23.520
 Why, Mother, I don't remember any of them.

00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:26.520
 Why, Mother, why don't you suddenly take a look out the window?

00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:27.520
 What's happened?

00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:28.520
 There was no other person.

00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:29.520
 There was an address on the ground.

00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:30.520
 Of course not, Mary.

00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:32.020
 They haven't been any for the last hour.

00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:34.520
 What am I going to do about my sunrise party?

00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:36.520
 My goodness, the sun's just raining down.

00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:37.520
 I think I'll open the window.

00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:39.520
 I feel like some fresh air.

00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:40.520
 Sure, Henry.

00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:42.520
 Mother, I'll never be able to face anybody again.

00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:47.720
 You know, Homer, if you look out of here, it probably seems possible that this was the

00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:49.020
 day we had that blizzard.

00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:51.020
 Henry, I'm worried about Wilbur.

00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:53.520
 No, there is one thing for you to worry about.

00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:55.320
 Just look out there on the lawn.

00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:57.020
 There's another croak coming up.

00:24:57.020 --> 00:24:59.120
 Oh, she was--look what's coming down the street.

00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:00.420
 Oh, boy.

00:25:00.420 --> 00:25:01.920
 Two men on horseback.

00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:02.920
 Really?

00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:04.920
 And they haven't got any saddles.

00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:07.520
 What's up, I look at Father and Mr. Brown.

00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:08.720
 Oh, my goodness.

00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:10.720
