00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,800
 And now the Jell-O family presents...

3
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:15,240
 Henry! Henry Oldridge!

4
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,500
 Coming, Mother!

00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:21,900
 [Applause]

6
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:26,000
 Yes, it's the Oldridge family, based on characters originated by Clifford Goldsmith,

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,800
 and starring Ezra Stone as Henry with Jackie Kelk as Homer.

8
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,260
 And yes, it's the Jello family with its three famous desserts.

9
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:35,520
 Jello and those six delicious flavors,

10
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,760
 Jello Puddings with that old-fashioned homemade flavor,

11
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,720
 and Jello Tathioca Puddings,

12
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:43,780
 a miracle of goodness, a marvel of speed.

 And now for the Aldrich family.

16
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:19,540
 To a typical teenage boy like Henry Aldrich, every holiday is naturally a red letter day.

17
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:23,540
 And whatever the celebration, Henry is always certain to be right in the center of it.

18
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:25,540
 Adding a little color of his all.

19
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:30,040
 The scene opens at the Aldrich breakfast table. It's the week before Christmas.

20
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,740
 Sam, I'm just as pleased as I can be.

21
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:33,540
 Yes, what about?

22
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,540
 Henry, he's been so helpful this past week.

23
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,540
 And dear, do you know what I think?

24
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:39,040
 What?

25
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,040
 He's really growing up.

26
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,040
 You know what I think?

27
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,040
 What?

28
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,540
 Christmas is just around the corner.

29
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:47,040
 Sam Aldrich, you're just being cynical.

30
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,040
 No, Alice, I'm just experienced.

31
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,540
 Anytime now he'll start in dropping hints.

32
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:52,540
 What hints?

33
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:54,540
 Is that what he'd like us to give in for Christmas?

34
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:57,500
 Sam, if he does, it's just because he's trying to be helpful.

35
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,780
 Father, are you in the dining room?

36
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:00,780
 Yes, Hadra.

37
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,700
 Hi, you father old-timer.

38
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,060
 There we go.

 I thought you might like your pipe here.

 Thank you, Ed.

00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:09,860
 No, thank you.

 Would you care to smoke it for me?

 Sam!

48
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:22,540
 Henry, is there something special on your mind?

49
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:23,940
 Something you want to say?

50
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:28,260
 Why, no sir, I'm just passing the time of day.

 I see.

52
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:35,380
 Only, now that I think of it, did I mention that swell football game I saw?

53
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:37,140
 Wendy, Thanksgiving day.

54
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,100
 Boy, it was some game.

55
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,100
 It was?

56
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,460
 Yeah, too bad I didn't enjoy it.

57
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:43,460
 Still didn't?

58
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:44,460
 Why not?

59
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:46,020
 I don't know.

60
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:50,820
 You take a football game and you sit way back in the stands, see?

61
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:53,700
 And if you're not equipped, where are you?

62
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,700
 You're right. It sure makes you angry.

 Oh, gee, I'll be right with you, Homer. Excuse me.

66
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:04,700
 Hi, Henry. Wouldn't you like to be a little more explicit?

67
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:10,700
 Sure, Father. The game I missed the best part of was the one we came closest to winning all season.

 Hi, Homer.

69
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:16,700
 Listen, Henry, when are you going to casually show that advertisement to my father?

70
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:17,700
 What? I'll tell you.

71
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:20,700
 Oh, gee, you wish. Don't you want him to make me happy for Christmas?

72
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,700

73
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,860
 Oh, my intent is show it to him.

74
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,420
 Just as soon as I find it.

75
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,420
 You lost it?

76
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:27,580
 Not permanently.

77
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:30,340
 I was eating some cookies the other night, see?

78
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:33,580
 And the next thing I knew, your ad had disappeared.

79
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:34,580
 Temporarily.

80
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:36,380
 You mean you ate it?

81
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:37,380
 Aiden?

82
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:40,380
 Now that I think about that last cookie was kind of chewy.

83
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:45,660
 And you'll never get that piccolo if you go around eating up my head.

84
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:49,900
 Besides, Homer, if you ask me, you ought to be more subtle about that piccolo.

85
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,900
 Who's not subtle? I'm not subtle.

86
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:56,460
 Look, for Christmas, I want those binoculars down into Havens, right?

87
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:57,460
 Right.

88
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:03,060
 So I just subtly drop a few hints and mention that I wasn't able to see the Thanksgiving

89
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:06,060
 football game from way back where I sat.

90
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:08,580
 And right away, they know what's binoculars I want.

91
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,940
 They do, sure.

92
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:15,340
 Only, they just try to worry me by pretending they don't understand.

93
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:18,540
 She, Henry, are right. You have to be subtle.

94
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:19,860
 You know what I'm going to do?

95
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:24,260
 Just a few days before Christmas, I'm gonna give my father a box of good cigars.

96
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:25,060
 Cigars?

97
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:28,260
 Sure, and right inside I'll put a copy of that piccolo ad.

98
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,860
 How's that for being subtle?

99
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:30,860
 Henry!

00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:31,860

101
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,460
 Maybe one of you could help me.

102
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:34,660
 With what, Mary?

103
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:35,860
 Well, look, Homer.

104
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,860
 Suppose you were a man, see?

105
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,860
 Mary, are you insulting me?

106
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:41,860
 Of course not, Homer.

107
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,860
 I just said "suppose you were."

108
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:44,860
 Oh.

109
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:49,660
 So if you were this certain party, would you prefer a pen and pencil set or a three-speed

110
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:53,660
 You're buying me a blanket that travels at three speeds.

111
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:57,660
 I should have known better than to ask you a simple question, mother!

112
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:00,660
 Wait a minute, Mary. Ask me again.

 Mother, are you in the kitchen?

 Mother, I just want to ask you what I should buy, Kermit for Christmas.

 Sam, look what I just found in the cookie jar, an advertisement.

 Someone's advertising in our cookie jar.

 Oh, let me see him.

 Are you never the life of the party?

121
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:25,660
 Buy one of our piccolo's and start playing second fiddle.

 San, that's what he wants for Christmas.

125

 In grade with bluebirds, one dollar extra.

 That would be lovely.

127

 But Alice, where does a football game enter into a piccolo?

128
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:40,660
 Here it's obvious.

129
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:43,660
 Of course Henry wants to play in the school band.

130
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:44,660
 What?

131
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:47,940

 Mr. Dehaven, I like a box of your best cigars.

 Yes, sir. We have an excellent brand here that comes all wrapped for Christmas.

 Oh, that's swell. I'll take it.

 Good. That'll be $11.50.

 Gee, thanks.

 - No, I'm afraid not.

 Why don't I get your father something else?

157
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,700
 - Not cigars.

158
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:51,440
 - We have some nice simulated plastic picture frames.

 - Picture frames?

160
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,040
 - Yes, you could slip your picture

180
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,420
 Who are you, phone?

181
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:37,320
 My father to drop another hen.

182
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,120
 Number three.

183
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,480
 Al 992.

184
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,480
 Yeah, 992.

185
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,880
 I think I'll join Ag.

186
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:42,560
 What for?

187
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,480
 I wrote her a treat for a long while.

188
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,440
 And boy, this looks like a good time to pick up her check.

189
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,120
 Hello?

190
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,520
 Hello, Father.

191
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,040
 Henry, I've got to meet your mother.

192
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:51,800
 What is it?

193
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,280
 Why, nothing in particular.

194
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:58,440
 I just happen to be down here in de Haven's drug store.

195
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,000
 And I saw--

196
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,960
 I saw--

197
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,400
 Saw what?

198
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,120
 Nothing, Father.

199
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:11,280
 But don't you think it's pretty interesting to be able to see a check from as far off as 20 feet?

200
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:11,920
 See a what?

201
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,380
 A check, a check!

202
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,520
 Henry, what are you driving at?

203
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,320
 Driving at Father, I?

204
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:20,320
 Well, Gee, I just called to pass the time of day!

205
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,420
 Yes, but...

206
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:24,920
 Well, now that I've passed it, so long, Father!

207
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:28,120
 Henry, where's Homer?

208
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,520
 Over there with Agnes and Mr. de Haven.

209
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:35,720
 If things go right, my parents ought to be in for these binoculars sometime today.

210
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,720
 Good. Did I mention there's no extra charge for the leather case?

211
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,220
 They come in a case?

212
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,220
 Oh yes, with a strap that goes around your neck.

213
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:44,620
 Boy, that's a fine thing.

214
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:49,020
 Say Homer, I found a sample box of 15 cigars that I can let you have for a dollar and a quarter.

215
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:51,620
 But Mr. Dehaven, I have narrows a dollar.

216
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:52,120
 What?

217
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,320
 Agnes' check was 25 cents.

218
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,320
 I thought it was only five.

219
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,320
 So did I.

220
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:00,420
 Only she was deliberately holding her thumb over the two.

221
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:11,420
 [Music]

222
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,420
 [Music]

223
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:13,420
 May I help you, sir?

224
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,420
 Yes, do you sell a checkers at this counter?

225
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,420
 Oh, we do indeed.

226
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:19,420
 Would you like to see them in wood, plastic, or reinforced cardboard?

227
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:23,420
 Well, or if you want to go whole hog, we have a dandy set and hand-carved ivory.

228
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:29,420
 Well, it really doesn't matter what the checkers are made of, just so that they're big enough to be seen from 20 feet off.

229
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:33,620
 Twenty-three? Yes. Oh, wouldn't it be rather inconvenient to play from that distance?

230
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:38,420
 Oh, it sounded ridiculous to me too, but as near as I can figure out, that's what my son wants for Christmas.

231
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:42,820
 Well, if you'll, uh, just wait a minute, I'll see if we have any large checkers and stuff.

232
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,820
 Thank you! Mother! Oh!

233
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:47,020
 Father, what are you doing down here at the Apario?

234
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:50,620
 I was supposed to meet your mother at the information counter ten minutes ago.

235
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:53,020
 Oh. Well, she still has time.

236
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:57,820
 By the way, Father, does a letter case with a strap that goes around your neck mean anything to you?

237
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:58,620
 No, I...

238
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:03,420
 I ran into Henry and he said if I saw you to casually mention that what he wants for Christmas comes in one.

239
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:04,520
 You don't say.

240
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,520
 And Father, I have a problem.

241
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,420
 Yes.

242
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:11,120
 Well, if you knew a certain party that was...

243
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,120
 well, close to you.

244
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,220
 Uh... close to you?

245
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:16,220
 Yes.

246
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:21,620
 And suppose you wanted to get him something very special for Christmas to show him how you feel about him.

247
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:22,620
 What would you get?

248
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:26,620
 Well, I really don't feel I should say.

249
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,320
 Father, you must tell me.

250
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,920
 Well, naturally, Mary, I'm sure whatever you get him, he'll be crazy about.

251
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,760
 But if I were that man, you know what I'd really like.

252
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,360
 What?

253
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,000
 Well, a new hunting rifle?

254
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,860
 My goodness.

255
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:40,200
 You're right, Mary. It's too expensive.

256
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,760
 Oh, I'm not worried about the money.

257
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,200
 No.

258
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,640
 No, it's coming out of my special campaign fund.

259
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,200
 Well, Mary, I hardly know what...

260
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,800
 Well, that is. I'm certainly... Mary.

261
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:55,040
 Father, my goodness, you kissed me right in the middle of the Emporium.

262
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,440
 [LAUGHTER]

263
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,780
 I don't mean to interrupt, huh? Oh, that's quite alright.

264
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:02,000
 And could you please tell me which way to guns?

265
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,740
 I beg your pardon?

266
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:04,240
 Oh, I know, and sporting goods.

267
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,740
 Now, don't you go spending too much, Mary?

268
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:07,980
 Nice girl, Mary.

269
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:08,980
 Lovely.

270
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:10,880
 Friend, daughter.

271
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,680
 Oh.

272
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:15,380
 Oh, I'll say, isn't your jewelry department nearby?

273
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:19,220
 Two miles over, but as long as she's going as far as a hunting rifle,

274
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,020
 I wonder how she'd like a pearl necklace.

275
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:25,460
 But, sir, about those checkers, I've measured all of them in the largest as an inch and a quarter in diameter.

276
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:26,900
 Oh, well, I'll tell you, uh...

277
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,340
 Does the set come in a leather case?

278
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:31,180
 - Why no? - And it doesn't have a strap that goes around your neck.

279
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:32,180
 - No. - Well, thanks.

280
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:35,340
 The more I think of it, the more I'm sure we're on the wrong track with checkers.

281
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:37,420
 Well, we have this chest-set in leather case,

282
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:40,060
 - Chests. - And it's been reduced, and we could have a strap put on it.

283
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:41,900
 No, no, I'm afraid not.

284
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,940
 If I don't like Chests, why should Henry?

285
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:46,340
 - Sir! - Oh, that's my wife. Excuse me.

286
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:50,700
 Yeah, I'm sorry. I've laid but I've finished every last bit of our Christmas shop.

287
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:53,180
 No, you haven't, Alice. We still need a gift for Henry.

288
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:55,940
 Henry? Didn't you send away for that piccolo?

289
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:58,700
 Yes, but he wasn't heading for a piccolo.

290
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:59,700
 He wasn't?

291
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:02,020
 Not unless a piccolo has something to do with checks.

292
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:04,980
 You can see 20 feet off when it goes around your neck.

293
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:05,500
 What?

294
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,020
 Incidentally, Alice, what do you think of pearls?

295
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,020
 Pearls?

296
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,140
 What?

297
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,980
 Why, dear, they're very lovely.

298
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:14,300
 They'd make a nice present for a young lady, wouldn't they?

299
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,060
 Oh, my goodness.

300
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:18,340
 Yes, but aren't they rather expensive?

301
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:20,100
 Alice, in this case, nothing's too good.

302
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:23,900
 Well, well, naturally, Sam, it's up to you

303
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:27,900
 And dear, while you're doing your shopping, there's something I ought to take care of too.

304
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:30,900
 Very well, dear, and try to think why it is Henry's been handing out.

305
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:31,900
 I will.

306
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:34,900
 Excuse me, madam, could you let me buy, please?

307
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:35,900
 Young man.

308
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:36,900
 Young man.

309
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,900
 Well, back again, madam.

310
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:42,900
 Yes, these ties I bought a little while ago, I'd like to return them.

311
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:43,900
 So soon?

312
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:44,900
 Well...

313
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:47,900
 Our ties don't usually start coming back until after new years.

314
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:51,900
 Well, you see, I think I'm getting a pearl necklace from my husband,

315
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:55,180
 and I couldn't very well give him just ties in return.

316
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:57,620
 I see. Very well. I'll make out a refund slip.

317
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:58,620
 Thank you.

318
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:02,580
 Incidentally, you've had quite a bit of experience with gifts, haven't you?

319
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,820
 I certainly have.

320
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:08,220
 Well, what would you say it was that handy at football games

321
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:11,220
 comes in loud checks and goes around your neck?

322
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,740
 Why, madam, that's obvious.

323
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:13,540
 It is?

324
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:16,340
 Yes, you will find our mufflers right over there at the next count.

325
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:17,340
 [LAUGHTER]

326
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:20,940
 But that's incredible. Henry would never...

327
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,300
 Why, it's incredible.

328
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,100
 What matter, what else could it be?

329
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:36,580
 Mary, you bought Kermit, what, for Christmas?

330
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:38,220
 A gun, mother, a gun.

331
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:40,380
 Do you really think you should be giving a man

332
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,660
 you might eventually marry a thing like that?

333
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:45,820
 What about it, though, that's just what Kermit would like?

334
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:49,020
 And, mother, my problem is, what should I have engraved on it?

335
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:50,020
 and grave?

336
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:55,060
 And on the barrel, I was thinking of something like, "To Kermit, peace on Earth, goodwill

337
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,060
 toward men."

338
00:13:56,060 --> 00:14:00,260
 Here I wouldn't have it engraved until after Christmas.

339
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:01,260
 Why not?

340
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:04,500
 Well, suppose it's the wrong size and has to be returned.

341
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:07,980
 And Mary, wait till you hear what I'm getting from your father.

342
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:08,980
 Hey, Henry!

343
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:11,180
 Mrs. Alvich, have you seen Henry?

344
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:13,740
 Well, I believe he's up in his room home or I call it.

345
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,380
 Before you tell me what you're getting?

346
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:17,260
 Mary, maybe you can help me out.

347
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:18,260
 With what?

348
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:21,140
 I've never had any experience rolling cigars.

349
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:22,140
 Rolling, what?

350
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:23,500
 Cigars.

351
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,500
 I thought if I bought the raw materials

352
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:30,340
 and eliminated the middleman, I might get by for a dollar.

353
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:32,780
 I've never rolled a cigar in my life.

354
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:33,620
 Hi, Homer.

355
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:35,020
 And I don't think it's a bit nice of you

356
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:36,500
 to infer that I have.

357
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,860
 My goodness.

358
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:40,060
 Homer, Mary didn't mention anything about my family

359
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:41,660
 buying those binoculars, did she?

360
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:42,260
 No.

361
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:44,340
 She, I went through every hiding place in the house.

362
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:47,420
 And the only Christmas present I found was a muffler.

363
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:48,220
 For you?

364
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,420
 Gee whiz, no.

365
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:53,740
 My parents wouldn't palm a thing like that off on me.

366
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:55,500
 You should see it, Homer.

367
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,260
 Chex is big as that, although--

368
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58,180
 [LAUGHTER]

369
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:59,180
 No, kid.

370
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:01,140
 Boy, it looked like it was on fire.

371
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:02,140
 [LAUGHTER]

372
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:02,640
 Henry.

373
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,460
 Yes, Homer?

374
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:05,340
 I hate to mention this, but--

375
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:07,740
 Well, maybe your parents didn't get your hints straight

376
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,300
 and watch you something else instead of binoculars.

377
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,540
 Henry, will you please answer the phone?

378
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:13,980
 Yes, mother.

379
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:17,100
 Homer, what else could they have thought I was heading for?

380
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,780
 Hello? Hello, is this Aldrich? Yes.

381
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:23,140
 L-303? That's right. Well, this is the Emporium calling.

382
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:26,540
 Have you decided on what sort of engraving you want on that hunting rifle?

383
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:29,140
 Hunting rifle? Yes. Hunting rifle?

384
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:31,100
 But you bought this afternoon for the young man.

385
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:34,100
 Are you sure you're calling Aldrich? Yes.

386
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,500
 L-303? Yes.

387
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:40,900
 And somebody here bought a hunting rifle? Yes.

388
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:44,260
 Hello? Oh, boy.

389
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:46,220
 Only maybe you shouldn't have told me that.

390
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:47,420
 Oh, it's for you?

391
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:50,780
 You better call back later and speak to either my mother or father.

392
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:52,280
 Goodbye.

393
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,220
 Homer, did you hear that?

394
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:57,220
 I'm getting a hunting rifle for Christmas.

395
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:00,620
 Oh, anything fall I asked for was a piccolo.

396
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:05,660
 Boy, that just goes to prove what a few subtle hints can do.

397
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:09,140
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

398
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:17,140
 [Music]

399
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:19,140
 [Applause]

400
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:24,140
 Now we'll hear something holiday hints from Meredith Wilson and this fucking piece.

401
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:25,140
 You know Meredith?

402
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:26,140
 What?

403
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:30,140
 That wonderful, colorful, jello family sure had a lot to holiday cheer.

404
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:36,140
 Oh, there's no doubt about it. Those big red letters are just as friendly and cheerful as...

405
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:42,180
 Santa's red suit? Yeah. Hey Prancer. Come on boy, come on boy up,

406
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:47,440
 that's a whooow now. Take it either on that chin. Okay. And after the holidays too, the

407
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:51,560
 same big red letters stand for the same good cheer, the year round.

408
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:58,120
 J. E. L. L. O. Also means satiny smooth, jello pudding.

409
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:04,200
 Every day of the year. J. E. L. O. Also means jello, tappy ochopunny.

410
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:09,720
 And J. E. L. O. Also means jello, the world's most famous shimmering dessert, and nothing

411
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:14,600
 could taste better or sparkle prettier on your table through the holidays, or any day

412
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:21,480
 than any or all of the six delicious fruit-like locked-in flavors of shining, shimmering jello.

413
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:25,980
 Listen to that man go I'll take strawberry, we we we we we we.

414
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,480
 Cherry, we we we.

415
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,480
 Lemon, we we we we.

416
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,480
 Lemon, you're not.

417
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,480
 Mmm.

418
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,480
 Jake, eat, help, help.

419
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,480
 Oh, and back to the Aldrich family.

420
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:46,480
 Now getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldrichs.

421
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,480
 Henry wanted a pair of binoculars for Christmas, but the subtle hints he's been dropping have led his parents to the first place.

422
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,680
 have led his parents to buy him a muffler and a piccolo. Only now Henry

423
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:57,920
 believes they've bought him a hunting rifle, which is really Mary's present to

424
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:02,880
 her boyfriend. The scene opens in the Aldrich living room and it's Christmas Eve.

425
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:07,280
 A snow shovel? Mother, you're giving father a snow shovel for Christmas? Mary,

426
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:12,160
 let me finish. First, your father will give me my pearl necklace. Then I'll give him

427
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,560
 his snow shovel. And Mary, you're going to see the longest face you've ever seen.

428
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,800
 Well, I should think so.

429
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:22,360
 And then I'll give him his real present, a lovely chess set and a leather cage.

430
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,400
 A chess set?

431
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,200
 Yes, I saw him admiring it in the Emporium the other day.

432
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,160
 Oh, Mother, you're so sweet.

433
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,880
 Oh, and Mary, I feel so warm.

434
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,000
 So do I.

435
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,440
 The house has been so different since Father insulated it.

436
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,600
 I didn't mean that.

437
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,480
 I mean, everything's so perfect.

438
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,560
 Hello, Mother.

439
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,600
 Hello, dear.

440
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,560
 Hello, Mary.

441
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,720
 Hello, Henry.

442
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,520
 Would anybody like me to make them a glass of eggnog?

443
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,680
 Eggnog, Henry?

444
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,360
 Sure.

445
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:53,160
 That's just the thing I'm in the mood to make.

446
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,960
 Thank you just the same, dear.

447
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,560
 Mary, please phone Mrs. Dixon, and make sure she

448
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:01,000
 launders our good tablecloth in time for Christmas dinner.

449
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,520
 Henry, I got that box of cigars from my father.

450
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,400
 I did for a dog?

451
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,600
 Sure, from Willie Moore.

452
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,320
 I don't know Willie smoked cigars.

453
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,960
 He does, and this is a box his uncle send his father.

454
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:10,800
 No kidding.

455
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,240
 Sure.

456
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:14,240
 Mr. Marshall said the way he feels about his wife's family,

457
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,640
 He wouldn't smoke them with a 10 foot pole.

458
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,940
 (phone ringing)

459
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,440
 - I don't mind answering it, ma'am.

460
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,040
 - I'm practically there.

461
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:21,880
 Hello?

462
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,040
 - Hello, Mary.

463
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,000
 This is Kermit.

464
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,800
 - Oh, hello, Kermit.

465
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:26,640
 - Hello.

466
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,460
 - Hello.

467
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:28,540
 - Hello.

468
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:29,800
 How have you been?

469
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,160
 - Fine, Kermit.

470
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,120
 - You had the sniffles when I left last night

471
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,120
 and I've been worried.

472
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,220
 - You have?

473
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:37,160
 Isn't that sweet?

474
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,240
 - How are they?

475
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,080
 - Who?

476
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:39,920
 - The sniffles.

477
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:40,760
 - Oh, why?

478
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,600
 (audience laughing)

479
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,600
 I just finished my Christmas shopping.

480
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,600
 You have?

481
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,600
 Kermit, I certainly hope you didn't get anything from me.

482
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,600
 Well, I...

483
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,600
 Oh, Kermit, you shouldn't have.

484
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,600
 It's something you wear on your hand.

485
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,600
 Really?

486
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,600
 Kermit, you're teasing.

487
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,600
 No, I'm not.

488
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,600
 And they're made of pigskin.

489
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,600
 Oh!

490
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,600
 Oh!

491
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,600
 Oh!

492
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,600
 That's only if I'm going to give you.

493
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,600
 Oh.

494
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:08,600
 Well, I certainly hope you won't ask me to give you any hints about what I got you.

495
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,600
 I won't.

496
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,600
 You won't?

497
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:14,320
 I'll give you a tiny hint. Just keep your eye on the bull's eye.

498
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,700
 On the bull's eye?

499
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,960
 And I'm not going to say another word.

500
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,060
 Gee, that's a puzzle.

501
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:21,160
 It is.

502
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:24,560
 Well, I can't think of what it could be unless it's a gun.

503
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,380
 A gun?

504
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:28,000
 But I know you wouldn't be foolish enough to buy a thing like that.

505
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:28,500
 What?

506
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:31,200
 Not for a guy who served four years in the infantry.

507
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,680
 [LAUGHTER]

508
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,840
 Well, naturally, I didn't.

509
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,640
 Oh my goodness.

510
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,720
 Is anything wrong, Mayor?

511
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,280
 No, no, but I have to hang up.

512
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,780
 Are your snipples coming back?

513
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:43,280
 Kermit, I haven't time to explain goodbye.

514
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,280
 Oh my goodness.

515
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:44,880
 What is Mary?

516
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,480
 What's her?

517
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,480
 Can we out of my way?

518
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,680
 Don't you realize all the stores closed at seven tonight?

519
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,780
 Are you looking for something in that closet, Mary?

520
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:52,780
 My goodness, I hope it isn't too late.

521
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:54,280
 Mary, Mary, what are you doing?

522
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:54,980
 Mary, let go.

523
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:56,380
 I've got to return this right away.

524
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,480
 Return to listen, Mary.

525
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,380
 What's that down?

526
00:20:58,380 --> 00:20:58,380
 What's that down?

527
00:20:58,380 --> 00:20:59,380
 Mary, out of my way.

528
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:00,180
 Mother--

529
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:01,380
 Mary, don't you move another step.

530
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:01,880
 Mother--

531
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,880
 Mary, I warn you.

532
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,880
 What's all the shouting about?

533
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,780
 Mother, Mary's going to return my Christmas present.

534
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:10,340
 That mufflers for Henry.

535
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:11,340
 Mufflers!

536
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:15,540
 I'm returning comets gone.

537
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,540
 Kermit's gone.

538
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:17,540
 Kermit.

539
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:18,740
 Now please let me go, Henry.

540
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:20,740
 I'll never be able to return it in time.

541
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:27,780
 But Henry, Henry, you didn't think that gun was for you instead of Kermit, did you?

542
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:28,780
 Why?

543
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:29,780
 For Henry Alice.

544
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:30,780
 For Henry.

545
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:33,780
 If that gun was for anyone, it was for...

546
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:35,780
 For whom?

547
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:36,780
 Kermit.

548
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:37,780
 Kermit.

549
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:38,780
 Excuse me.

550
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:40,780
 Where are you going?

551
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:43,620
 Up to my room.

552
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:46,700
 And I hope Mary's very happy with her pearl.

553
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:47,700

558
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,860
 How, mother?

559
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:58,860
 Just out.

560
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,620
 Dear, you haven't got your coat on.

561
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:01,860
 Gee, who cares?

562
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:04,580
 Well, at least take your new muffler.

563
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:06,020
 Mother, I...

564
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:09,020
 I'd rather not even mention that muffler.

565
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:11,860
 (classical music)

566
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:23,260
 - Hey Henry.

567
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:25,060
 Henry, what are you doing on the curb?

568
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:27,460
 - He's sitting at Homer, Gee Whiz, what does it look like?

569
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:30,340
 - I've been looking for you for nearly two hours.

570
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:31,340
 Merry Christmas.

571
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:33,620
 - Sure, Merry Christmas.

572
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:34,700
 - Right.

573
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:37,300
 I heard about the gun being for Kermit.

574
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,300
 Tough luck.

575
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,600
 That's okay, Homer.

576
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,360
 That's okay.

577
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,100
 Maybe the better man won.

578
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,400
 Henry, don't say that.

579
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,400
 Why not?

580
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,400
 Why not face facts?

581
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,400
 Gee.

582
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:52,700
 And to think I've been looking forward to this Christmas since last Christmas.

583
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:55,300
 I know how you feel.

584
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:57,700
 I'm not getting my piccolo either.

585
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:58,700
 No?

586
00:22:58,700 --> 00:22:59,700
 I'll be lucky to get anything.

587
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,500
 Didn't you give your father those cigars?

588
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,500
 Sure.

589
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,500
 He lit one.

590
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,500
 You know what happened?

591
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:09,940
 up in his face. It did? And Willy won't even give me my money back. He says, "Is it his

592
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:14,880
 fault? His uncle doesn't like his father." What's that? A bunch of kids singing

593
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:19,320
 carols on the library steps. Boy, you'd think they'd know better than to disturb the

594
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:29,060
 piece. I'll say. Oh, are you humming? Me? She was, I was just checking to see if they're

595
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:31,060
 - Are they? - No.

596
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:33,060
 - Hi, fellas. - Who's that?

597
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:35,060
 - She was at Staches Johnny Dixon again.

598
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:37,060
 - Merry Christmas to you all.

599
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:39,060
 I just delivered your mother's table clock, Henry.

600
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:41,060
 Aren't we lucky? - Lucky?

601
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:44,060
 - Sure. Look, snow on Christmas Eve.

602
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:45,060
 Isn't it neat?

603
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:48,060
 - What's so neat about snow? All it does is get under your collar.

604
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:50,060
 - And when do you mind leaving us alone?

605
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:52,060
 - Whoa, sure, fellas.

606
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:54,060
 And I hope your mother's cold gets better, Henry.

607
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:56,060
 - Cold? She's got a cold?

608
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:58,060
 - Whoa. That's the way she looked to me.

609
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:02,420
 to me. Say that I show you the swell present I got for my mother. Look, a real

610
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:09,680
 aviator's helmet. Yeah, fur line. That swell. With real fur. Well, I better get home and help

611
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:17,040
 her trim the tree. Merry Christmas to you all. Chee. Yeah, gee. Imagine getting all excited about a hat.

612
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:23,040
 Henry, what? I'm going home.

613
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:26,040
 Oh, you're going to leave me alone? On Christmas Eve?

614
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:30,040
 I'm sorry, Henry. That's where I'd rather be.

615
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:33,040
 She was. Good night.

616
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,040
 And Henry.

617
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:38,040

 She was. Mother, what are you doing out in the street?

621
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,040
 Here's your coat.

622
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,040
 Gee.

623
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,040
 Thanks, Mother.

624

 Don't think I'm forgiving you, Henry.

00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:53,920
 But if you get sick, I'm the one who'll have to suffer for it.

626

00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:55,920
 Yes, Mother, and look.

 Sam, I know we agreed not to speak to Henry, but...

 Father, what's that under your arm?

633
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:05,760
 Why, uh...

634
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,200
 Gee, whiz, it's my lumberjackin'.

00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:11,560
 Henry, I'm still the one who has to pay the doctor.

636

 Gee, thanks.

 Well, Alice, can we go home?

 And God bless you as a whole, Father.

646
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 Father, could I apologize for thinking that gun was for me?

647
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,500
 Well, that's all right, son.

 Hey, I'm just curious.

651
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,500
 What was it you were heading for, always?

652
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,500
 G-Father, it was silly.

653
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,500
 Forget it.

00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,500
 I'm curious.

655
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:55,500
 Well, a pair of binoculars, I saw in the haven.

656
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,500
 Binoculars?

657
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:59,500
 But, G, they don't compare to a muffler.

658
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,500
 Yeah.

659
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,500
 Well, shall we all go home now and trim the tree?

660
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:03,500
 Right.

00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:07,500
 I'll tell you, Alissa, suppose you go home and start without me.

 I just remembered I, I ran out of cigar.

 Well, Leah, shall we start for home?

 What, before we do, could I go into this store here and put in one phone call?

 To whom?

 If you ever get the feeling that you'd like to squeeze the cat,

673
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:58,500
 or tie a tin can to the dog or sit on father's hat,

674
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:03,620
 is hat, or pull the lamp from off the desk or overturn the ink, better stop before you

675
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:06,180
 do, better stop and think.

 Just two days from now it'll be Christmas day.

678
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:15,420
 You can squeeze the cat in April, you can tease the dog in June.

00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:18,500
 In August you can dig the yard with Mother's Silver Spoon.

 Fathers had a squash in March and next month they'll still be ink.

 As you know what's coming, and it's not so far away.
