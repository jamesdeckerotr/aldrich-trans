00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 Henry! Henry Oldrich!

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
 Coming, mother!

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.000
 The Oldrich family!

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 A special rebroadcast for you, soldier, sailors, and Marines of the United Nations!

 [Music]

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:52.000
 Through a teenage boy each new day is a new world, and each moment of it is filled with all sorts of discoveries and excitement and even mishaps, which grownups can somehow always envy.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.960
 So it is with Henry Aldrich.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.080
 The scene opens at the Aldrich breakfast table.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.480
 You didn't answer my question, mother.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:00:59.320
 Can I?

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.240
 I mean, may I?

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.200
 Henry, will you please eat your cereal?

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.800
 I am.

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:03.760
 I'm eating it.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.520
 Only may I, please.

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.040
 Alice, may I have to cream, please?

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.720
 Here you are, Sam.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:09.640
 Mother, excuse me.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:10.920
 But did you say I'm I?

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:11.880
 Sam, what do you think?

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.400
 Alice is nothing to begin by drawing me into this.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.400
 Henry knows exactly how I stand on the matter.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.880
 But, Father, that's a beautiful part of it.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.160
 I'm not asking you.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:20.600
 I'm not relieving asking mother.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.100
 I'm just suggesting it.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.900
 Henry, were you pleased with your spoon back in your cereal?

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:25.700
 Oh.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:26.600
 Was I pointing?

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:27.300
 You were?

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.700
 Excuse me.

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.400
 Henry, didn't you ask me to advance you a dollar on your allowance last week?

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.100
 And didn't I make it clear this is the only way you could ever be taught a lesson?

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.500
 Yes, Mother, sure.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.500
 And now I've learned how important money is.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.100
 So couldn't you advance it?

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.400
 Ben, what do you think?

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.900
 What do I think about what?

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.600
 Alice, do you see this piece of court plaster on my chin?

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:47.300
 Yes, dear.

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:48.700
 I'll tell you what it is, Mother.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.140
 I shouldn't have asked him for the dollar while he was shaving.

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:52.860
 - Honey, would you like another piece of toast?

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.060
 - No, thank you, Virginia.

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.900
 - Virginia?

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.780
 - Oh, gee, what's Murray, did I call you?

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.580
 No, thanks, I don't care for any toast.

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.140
 - Virginia who? Virginia who?

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.500
 - Nobody, Mary, nobody.

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.780
 I just happened to be thinking about a problem I have,

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.380
 and I wasn't thinking.

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:06.740
 - Mary, may I have a piece of toast?

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.620
 - He or her father?

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:10.620
 - Mother, and now that father doesn't have

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:13.300
 his knife and fork in his hand, may I have your decision?

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.540
 - Henry, what is it you want the dollar for?

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:16.700
 - Nothing special, Mother.

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.940
 I just...boy, if I don't have it, then what do you think?

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:21.860
 Where's the sugar?

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.860
 Right here, Father. Let me give it to you.

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:24.420
 Oh, she's...

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.380
 Henry, oh, did you part half the bow into Father's egg?

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:28.740
 And there you are.

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.980
 Henry, until you were able to concentrate on breakfast,

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.900
 instead of thinking about...about...

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.140
 Then your sleeves in the butter.

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:36.180
 But then...

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.620
 Oh, wipe it off for him, Mother. Father, hold your elbow up.

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:39.500
 Where's the napkin?

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:40.700
 Here, Virginia, use mine.

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:41.180
 What's that?

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.220
 Oh, she was... I call you Father, Virginia.

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.220
 Henry, it's just what I suspected.

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.020
 You've got a crush on that redheaded girl over on Maple Street.

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:49.540
 - Virginia Lee. - On who?

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.820
 Isn't her father the head of the Board of Education?

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.220
 You're just trying to get a passing mark in all your subjects.

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.920
 Mary of all the wild rumors of all the...

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.860
 Mary, I hardly even know Virginia Lee.

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.540
 Why, Harry Aldrich.

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.780
 Didn't I see you talking with her yesterday?

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:03.940
 Who I?

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.000
 Sure.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.620
 Maybe I was saying I'd be glad to come to her party tonight, but...

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.140
 That's all I said.

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.020
 But for anybody to go around saying,

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.300
 "Why so far as I'm concerned, Virginia Lee...

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.660
 - Virginia Lee Henry, we'll take your word for it.

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.740
 You're not even slightly interested in it.

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:21.100
 Now please quiet down and finish your breath.

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.900
 - Yes mother, excuse me.

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.220
 - Henry it's just as well you're not interested in it.

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.220
 If you ask me she has the quickest temper.

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:28.660
 - Who, Virginia Lee?

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.180
 Virginia Lee has a temper.

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.180
 - Mary she's got one of the nicestest dispositions.

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:33.020
 - Henry.

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.860
 - Yes father?

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:35.340
 - That's my toast you're waving.

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.060
 - Oh excuse me.

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.020
 - Gee how'd I ever get ahold of that?

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:42.180
 - And what's more Mary, her hair is not red, it's all blue.

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.500
 - So it certainly looks red to me.

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.980
 And that's just the kind of a statement that that that's that's how you if you're choking

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:47.980
 drink some water.

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:49.620
 I'm not choking mother.

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.460
 Look I'm reading fine.

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:55.540
 I just want to make it clear that when you're invited to a party at Virginia Lees, it's

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:56.900
 a very great honor.

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:58.820
 She doesn't ask everybody Mary.

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:00.380
 And besides it's just a way she has.

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.220
 She doesn't mean what she says.

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:03.220
 She was Mary.

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:04.380
 Whatever made you think she has a temper.

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:08.060
 Henry all I know is the one time in my life I had ever spoken to Virginia Lees.

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:09.060
 She snapped at me.

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:10.060
 She why?

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:11.060
 She snapped at me.

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:12.460
 It was a Jane Prescott tea.

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:18.660
 I said Virginia which will you have my men are clean and she said neither just like that said what neither father

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.920
 What's your chief said couldn't she have at least said please when she didn't want either

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.380
 Homer's at you

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:32.620
 Is that Homer? I'm going to the office you want to look out mr. All Richard slippery out. Thank you. Good morning Homer

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.500
 I miss his old which you having hot cakes for breakfast. No, dear. Oh, oh

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.060
 Hey, Henry

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:42.780
 You know what George Bigelow and Jimmy Violet and Harry would now Graham and I are all gonna do tonight boy

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.100
 Wait, I tell you what I'm gonna do with going to a party over at Virginia Lee's

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:51.580
 Where and to say the least it certainly sounds exclusive now wait a minute Mary listen Homer

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:56.380
 What time did she tell you to be there eight thirty there Mary see what time did you tell you to be there?

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:00.340
 Not a minute later than eight fifty. What are you gonna do move the furniture for?

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:07.460
 Why come on? Let's get started. Oh well first Homer. Oh look mother. Could I speak to you alone for just a minute alone?

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:08.960
 Yes, mother. I'll get you.

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.460
 Henry, is it about that dollar?

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.960
 Mary, have I even mentioned a dollar to you in?

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.960
 Henry, what is it you want to speak to me about?

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:18.460
 All I ask you to do is put enough confidence in me to come out here.

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:32.960
 Hey, George. Wait a second before you go in the classroom.

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:33.960
 What did you want?

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:34.960
 Could you lend me a dollar?

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:35.960
 A dollar, Homer?

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:36.960
 To you?

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:43.960
 Well, it isn't for me exactly. It's really for Henry Aldrich. He has to have it so we can't see it up anyplace.

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.460
 Don't you think I have any respect for my money?

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:48.960
 Look at him, Homer. Look at him. Look at who, Agnes.

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.960
 Henry, he's right out there in the car at a showing off in front of Virginia Lee.

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:52.960
 What's he doing, Agnes?

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.960
 He's got his coat on inside out and he's trying to make her laugh.

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:59.960
 My goodness, Tommy, you ought to bring him to a census of all girls, Virginia Lee.

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.960
 Don't you like Virginia Lee, Agnes? Boy, I think... boy.

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:05.960
 What do you mean by that?

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:07.960
 Nothing, Agnes, nothing.

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:09.960
 This is how we make Henry's stuff.

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:10.960
 I'm dying.

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:11.960
 Hi, Virginia.

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:14.960
 You've got his coat on wrong side out. He's forgetting to be a camel.

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:15.960
 Hey, Virginia.

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:16.960
 Moo!

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:17.960
 [laughter]

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.960
 Henry, if you ask me, you're making a public spectacle.

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:21.960
 Look at that.

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:24.960
 I can just look at me. I can go two weeks without water.

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:25.960
 Moo!

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:26.960
 [laughter]

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:29.960
 How far is I? I'm concerned I'm going into assembly.

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:30.960
 Homer, you've come.

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:31.960
 Why are you?

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:32.960
 I always forget out of my way.

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:34.960
 Look at him. George is Henry as free.

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:35.960
 Bring!

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:36.960
 Virginia, come over here a second.

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:37.960
 I want to ask you something.

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:38.960
 I can't.

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:39.960
 Your dad got to go into a sample.

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:40.960
 Goodbye, Virginia.

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:44.560
 Can we put your coat on right before somebody comes along and sees you?

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:45.560
 She wins.

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:46.560
 Who's coming, Homer?

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:47.560
 I can wear it anyway.

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:48.560
 I'd please if I want to.

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:50.560
 I bet you don't dare wear it that way all day, Henry.

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:51.960
 Well, I would if I wanted to.

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:52.960
 I just don't want to.

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:53.960
 Yeah?

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:54.960
 You haven't got enough nerve to.

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:56.960
 What do you mean I haven't got enough nerve to?

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:57.960
 I'm just not going to wear it.

00:06:57.960 --> 00:06:58.960
 So what'd you tell me to?

00:06:58.960 --> 00:06:59.960
 All right.

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:00.960
 I'll call you a bluff.

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:02.960
 You wanted to borrow a dollar, didn't you?

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:03.960
 So why?

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:08.000
 inside out and I'll loan it to you. You will? Now wait a minute Henry don't do it.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.480
 Homer you please keep out of this. You're afraid to Henry you're afraid to.

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:16.520
 Georgia doesn't be cause of that I just... you know... cause she got dollar again here.

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:20.420
 Now wait Henry. There isn't any girl in the world that's worth that.

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:24.160
 Homer will you stop pulling me? Let him alone Homer. George will you stop pulling

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:28.360
 in yourself? Now wait a minute fellas wait a minute let me be the one to decide this.

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:38.360
 [Music]

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:42.640
 I have also been asked to announce to the student body that there will be a

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:46.880
 concert of chamber music in this auditorium tomorrow evening at 8.30.

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:49.960
 Those wishing tickets will be seen as Hopkins.

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:52.040
 No, not with Hopkins.

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:54.400
 Yes, Ms. Hopkins.

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:56.960
 I was little ahead of myself there.

00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:03.560
 And I trusted all of you who work with a young man in about the 10th row

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:07.160
 who is forced to teach him from the aisle please rise.

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:09.060
 To why?

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:11.360
 Yes, I mean you young man.

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:12.860
 I'm Mr. Bradley.

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:15.560
 That's right. Will you please stand?

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:16.860
 Yes sir.

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:20.960
 May I ask just what that is you are wearing in this assembly?

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:22.160
 My coat.

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:23.360
 Your coat.

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:26.560
 And may I ask why you are wearing it wrong side out?

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:29.560
 I'll take you what I'm going to do, young man.

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:33.560
 I'm going to give you the opportunity of coming up here onto this platform

00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:38.560
 so that everyone downstairs and up in the balcony can share the pleasure of looking at you.

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:39.560
 Now?

00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:44.560
 Step right along, please. Our time is limited and we want to get on with the program.

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:51.560
 Your name is Orange, isn't it?

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:52.560
 Yes, sir.

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:55.880
 Do you remember my giving a talk only last September

00:08:55.880 --> 00:09:00.120
 on how the young men in this school should be careful of their appearance and assembly?

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:01.220
 No sir.

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:03.160
 Quiet please.

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:05.160
 This is hardly a laughing matter.

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:06.720
 You don't remember?

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:09.320
 I... I guess I was sick that day.

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:10.920
 Yes, you were sick that day.

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:13.440
 Exactly what is it you think you look like?

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:14.400
 Well, why...

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:16.120
 Before I came in here, I...

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:17.480
 I was a camel.

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:19.120
 Right?

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:22.280
 Whatever possessed you to do a thing like this?

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:24.600
 Why, will you see Virginia Lake?

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:25.600
 I mean...

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:26.440
 (audience laughs)

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:27.280
 - Why you...

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:29.860
 (upbeat music)

00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:40.720
 - Henry!

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:43.640
 Henry, aren't you in the dining room?

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:44.800
 - Yes, sure, Mother.

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:45.880
 I'm in here.

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:46.720
 - Bye, goodnight Henry.

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:48.320
 You haven't touched a thing.

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:50.520
 But Mother, I'm not hungry.

00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:51.600
 - Henry, are you talking

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:55.520
 Because I wouldn't let you have that dollar to buy a box of candy for Virginia Lee.

00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:56.820
 She was no mother.

00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:57.620
 I'll give you my word.

00:09:57.620 --> 00:09:58.880
 I'm not shocking.

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:00.320
 Well then, what is it?

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:01.920
 Don't you feel well?

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:03.020
 Yes, sure.

00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:04.840
 I feel fine.

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:07.200
 Don't you remember the big breakfast I ate?

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:08.800
 Gee, I had toast.

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:09.800
 Note me, you're rude.

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:13.440
 Just the same, you're going to sit up there like a gentleman and eat.

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:15.400
 Did you do nicely in assembly, dear?

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:16.560
 In assembly?

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:20.840
 Yes, I was just talking on the phone with Agnes Lawson's mother before you came in.

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:23.120
 She said something I didn't quite understand.

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:25.160
 It was something about you, you understand, Blake?

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:26.780
 Oh, yes.

00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:29.280
 Yes, I was in the assembly this morning.

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:31.180
 And you took part in the program?

00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:32.280
 Yes.

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:35.320
 Yes, I guess you'd say I took part in it, sort of.

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:37.160
 Well, it wasn't that nice here.

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:39.200
 You didn't tell me it back that you were going to.

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:42.160
 Well, it was sort of all of a sudden.

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:43.760
 What did you do, lead the Bible?

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:45.160
 No, nothing like that, Mother.

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:46.640
 I-- I don't want anything more.

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:47.840
 I think I'd better be going.

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:50.440
 Henry, you're here to eat your dessert before you leave.

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:53.680
 My dessert mother, but don't just see I've got a lot of my.

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:56.200
 If I don't get started back for school, I'm going to be late.

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:58.600
 Now you have plenty of time before you get back.

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:00.680
 What was it we were talking about?

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:01.440
 A white.

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:03.000
 I don't know.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.080
 Oh, you wanted to tell me about your appearance in a sandblaze.

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:07.600
 My appearance?

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:09.760
 Yes, I thought you said you made an appearance.

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:11.480
 Oh, that.

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:13.520
 Henry, I'm just a bit provoked with you.

00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:15.960
 There's no sense in being as modest as all that.

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:20.400
 I remember now Mrs. Lawson said something about you wearing a costume.

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:21.600
 A costume?

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:25.780
 Yes, and the students all laugh and say they've never seen anything so funny in their lives.

00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:28.280
 Well, were you in a little sketch of some kind?

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:29.200
 A sketch?

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:32.320
 Your Uncle John, you know, was awfully good at entertaining like that.

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:36.600
 You almost went on the stage one, and you've always been very much like him.

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:41.400
 Like Uncle John, well, to tell you the truth of life, I just went up on the stage.

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:43.120
 That Mr. Bradley's request.

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:46.320
 Yes, and he held me up as an example.

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:47.800
 An example?

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:49.400
 An example of what?

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:51.960
 Well, it was this darn coat and I'm--

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:53.160
 Henry, what do you mean?

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:54.760
 Didn't you wear a costume?

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:56.360
 No, Mother, just a suit.

00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:57.560
 Now I've got to go.

00:11:57.560 --> 00:12:00.280
 Henry, do you mean Mr. Bradley didn't like the way you looked?

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:02.120
 Yes, I mean no, I mean--

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:02.680
 Goodbye.

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:04.600
 Henry, you mean it criticized your clothes?

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:05.960
 And, Mother, I've got to go.

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:07.080
 But Henry, wait!

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:10.120
 Hello?

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:11.480
 Hello, Alice, this is Sam.

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:12.920
 Sam, I'm glad you called.

00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:14.440
 Alice, I've been thinking it over.

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:16.920
 If you want to let Henry have a dollar, go ahead.

00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:19.520
 But first make it clear out that it's alone and not a gift.

00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:21.720
 But Sam, he isn't upset about that dollar.

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:26.920
 Mr. Bradley called him up on the platform in assembly this morning and made a public example of his suit.

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:27.620
 What's that?

00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:30.420
 That's what he did, Sam. And don't you think that's awful?

00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:31.920
 Alice, what suit are you talking about?

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:35.420
 That nice brown tweet of yours that I had the tailor cut down for Henry.

00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:36.920
 And Bradley said something about it?

00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:41.320
 Yes, Sam, right in front of the whole school. And here he is exactly what I'm going to do.

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:55.500
 [Music]

00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:58.320
 Hi, Henry. Wait a second. I'll walk to school with you.

00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:00.200
 She was home. Have you seen George Bigelow?

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:03.080
 No. And listen, Henry is Virginia Lee in Paris.

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:04.920
 Is Virginia Lee in Paris?

00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:06.920
 She was home and what she's so embarrassed about.

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:07.920
 What do you mean?

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:10.920
 Do you know what I heard her say to somebody? She's gonna change schools.

00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:15.180
 Now there isn't anything to worry about Homer. All I have to do is collect my dollar from George Bigelow.

00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:18.700
 Well, geez, you- you forget the whole thing.

00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:22.800
 He means you'll forget your standing up there in the platform and assembly and shouting your name.

00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:27.420
 Homer, I didn't shout it. It just- just slipped out. And incidentally, there he is.

00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:31.520
 Hey George! George, come here a second. I guess you've forgotten something.

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:33.320
 Yeah? What did that I forgot?

00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:35.420
 That dollar? That dollar you said you'd loan me.

00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:37.720
 You're crazy, Henry. I'm not gonna loan you any dollar.

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:39.000
 You're crazy yourself.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.920
 Homie, here was a witness to the whole thing.

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:42.200
 Sure, I was. Sure, I was.

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:43.920
 No, wait. Let me ask you something.

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:48.360
 Didn't I say I'd loan you the dollar provided you'd wear your coat inside out all day?

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:50.680
 But it wasn't my fault, Mr. Bradley made me change it.

00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:52.000
 Well, was it my fault?

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
 Now, listen, George, quick pushing Henry.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.560
 Then tell him to get out of my way.

00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:58.200
 Oh, no, George. You can't get by me until I get that money.

00:13:58.200 --> 00:13:59.000
 What do you mean?

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.760
 Now, listen, George, let him alone.

00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:02.160
 Hey, George, stop!

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:05.160
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:15.160
 Good afternoon, Mrs. Aldridge, how are you?

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:16.160
 Very well, thank you.

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:19.160
 I came over to the school to have a little talk with Mr. Bradley.

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:21.160
 Oh. Have you on a part of Mrs. Aldridge?

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:22.160
 An appointment?

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:26.160
 No, but it's rather important that I see him and I decided to come right over.

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:30.160
 Well, I'm sorry, but Mr. Bradley is going to be in conference during most of the afternoon.

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:31.160
 Why don't you come back tomorrow?

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:33.160
 Oh, no, I... Oh, just a minute, please.

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:36.160
 Hello? Oh yes, Mr. Digglow.

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:40.160
 George? He was in a fight.

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:42.160
 You don't say so, Mrs. Digglow.

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:51.160
 Well, Mr. Bradley's in a conference right now, but if you call over a little later, we might be able to squeeze you in. Yes. Good-bye.

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:55.160
 Now, Miss Shea, would you please tell Mr. Bradley that I'm out here?

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:57.160
 I'm quite sure he'll be only too glad to see me.

00:14:57.160 --> 00:15:00.160
 Well, I'm sorry, but I have orders not to disturb him.

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:02.160
 You can't tell him I'm here?

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:04.460
 Then I'm afraid there's only one thing I can do.

00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:06.860
 I'll sit down here and wait until he can see me.

00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:09.160
 After all, there's a limit to everything.

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:12.160

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:19.460
 Hello.

00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:20.260
 Hello.

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:21.660
 Doesn't anybody answer Homer?

00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:22.360
 Not yet.

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:24.460
 How much time do we have before class, Henry?

00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:25.660
 Three and a half minutes.

00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:27.060
 If a clock in the store is right.

00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:28.060
 Hello.

00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:29.960
 Here, let me push you off a little more.

00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:31.360
 Boy.

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:32.640
 How does my coat look in the back?

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:34.920
 Well, there's one nice thing about it, Henry.

00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:35.920
 It isn't torn.

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:38.080
 I mean, the clock really isn't torn.

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:38.720
 It isn't?

00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:41.840
 No, it's just nicely ripped, the whole length of the scene.

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:43.000
 Boy.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:43.600
 Hello?

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:45.000
 Hello, is this Mr. Olrich?

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:45.520
 It is.

00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:47.280
 Well, this is Homer Brown.

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:50.800
 Henry's banged up a little, and I've been asked to deliver a message for him.

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:51.360
 What's that?

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:55.920
 We've been trying to call Henry's mother, Mr. Olrich, and she doesn't seem to answer, see?

00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:57.280
 Oh, but exactly. What is the trouble?

00:15:57.280 --> 00:15:58.920
 That's what I'm going to tell you.

00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:01.920
 Henry doesn't want to wear his coat to class this afternoon.

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:06.920
 And he wondered whether you are too busy to hop in the car and pick up one of his other coats

00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:08.920
 and bring it over here to the Havens drugstore.

00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:11.920
 Oh, but what's the reason he can't wear the coat he has on?

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:13.920
 Well, frankly, he's ashamed to wear it.

00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:17.920
 Oh, Murr, you tell Henry that I said he's to wear that coat to class. Is that clear?

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:18.920
 He is.

00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:22.920
 Yes, sir. And if anybody asks him why he's wearing it, he's to say that I told him to.

00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:23.920
 Yes, Mr. Allers.

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:24.920
 Is that clear?

00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:25.920
 Yes, sir.

00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:26.920
 Very well then.

00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:27.920
 Goodbye.

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:34.360
 Hey, Homer, what do you say? Well, I'll tell you you won't believe it, Henry, but here's what he told me to tell you

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:43.760
 We'll be back with the Aldrich family in just a moment right now

00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:48.840
 It's intermission and time for our intermission guests the one and only Tommy Dorsey. Okay, Tommy

 Now getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldrich. Henry wore his coat wrong side

00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:25.800
 out of the assembly this morning in order to borrow a dollar to buy chocolates for

00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:30.960
 its latest girl and Henry's mother misunderstanding the entire episode as

00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:35.840
 decided to call on the school principal. The scene opens in the Aldrich front hall

00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:39.640
 and Harriet is speaking.

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:41.640
 Mary, is your mother here?

00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:42.640
 No, she isn't, Anne-Harry.

00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:43.640
 She isn't.

00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:45.640
 No, she hasn't been home all afternoon.

00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:47.640
 Well, is your father here?

00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:50.640
 No, the only one that's here is Henry, and he's up in his room and he won't speak to anyone.

00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:51.640
 What's the matter with him?

00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:54.640
 He's just completely depressed, Anne-Harry. He won't even let me come near him.

00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:55.640
 No.

00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:59.640
 I warned him, though. I warned him at breakfast he better not get interested in that Virginia league.

00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:02.640
 My goodness, Anne-Harry, do you know what Virginia league did do it?

00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:05.640
 What? Well, you know how she has red hair, and I'll admit she's pretty.

00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:08.640
 But that's no excuse for her not letting Henry become more party tonight.

00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:13.220
 What's that and for no reason at all except that she doesn't like Henry's clothes or something

00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:18.280
 Virginia Lee did that to Henry Mary. I don't believe it, but Ann how he did though

00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:20.160
 Well, I know one thing if it's true

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:25.160
 I think her mother ought to know about it and I agree with you Anne Harriet and I just wish you call her up called her up

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:30.960
 Nothing. I'll go right over and have a talk with Mrs. Lee face to face. No one can break Henry's heart and get away with it

00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:41.760
 [Music]

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:43.360
 Hello Sam, can you hear me?

00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:44.640
 Yes Alice, where are you now?

00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:47.360
 I'm still up here at the high school waiting to see Mr. Bradley.

00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:49.280
 And he refuses to have anything to do with you?

00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:52.240
 Yes, dear, and I think we ought to get this whole matter straightened out.

00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:53.840
 Well, here's what I can do Alice.

00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:56.320
 Joseph Lee is the head of the Board of Education now, isn't he?

00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:59.280
 Who is? Joseph Lee? Virginia Lee's father?

00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:02.280
 Yes, over on Maple Street. And Alice, I'm going to get in touch with him.

00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:04.280
 Well, dear, I think I ought to talk to him too.

00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:07.280
 I'll call you as soon as I've gotten ahold of him, Alice. Don't worry.

00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:20.780
 Gee, Henry, why don't you try to look at it this way?

00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:24.780
 Homer, will you please get out of my room and go on downstairs and go home.

00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:27.280
 But, Henry, you just don't understand Virginia.

00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:28.840
 She's got a little temper, maybe.

00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:29.940
 Sure, but...

00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:30.940
 But...

00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:32.440
 Do you know what I'm gonna do, Henry?

00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:33.840
 I've just had an idea.

00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:34.840
 You sit tight, see?

00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:36.640
 I'm gonna fix everything all up for you.

00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:37.640
 Now, wait a minute, Homer.

00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:38.640
 Go with me, Henry.

00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:42.280
 I'm gonna fix things up and you're going to that party tonight and have a swell time.

00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:43.280
 But Homer!

00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:54.920
 Now, wait a minute, Mrs. Orange.

00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:57.000
 May I get just one word in here before you go off?

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.000
 Mr. Lee, when I'm finished, you may say all you want to.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.600
 I realize this is your home.

00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:04.900
 But I've just got to get you straight on this matter of Henry and Mr. Bradley.

00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:07.200
 Mrs. Oldridge, I think by this time I am straight.

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:10.700
 But Mrs. Lee doesn't understand. She says she doesn't understand one word.

00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:13.700
 Why, of course I do the whole thing as as clear as anything.

00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:15.500
 Mrs. Lee, just one minute ago, you say...

00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:17.900
 Now, wait a minute, Alice. Let's take one thing at a time.

00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:20.000
 Sam, I'm sorry, but I'm afraid I'm speaking.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.300
 And so far, dear, you haven't done one bit of good.

00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:24.600
 Alice, suppose you let me try to explain this whole thing

00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:27.000
 And because there are some things about this that you don't know.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.200
 Harriet, I don't like to interfere, but Alice is talking.

00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:32.600
 Well, all I want to know is why Henry can't come to the party tonight.

00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:36.400
 I'm sorry, but it's Virginia's party and I don't usually agree with you.

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:40.000
 If Henry isn't wanted, he would certainly be the last one who would want to come.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:44.200
 But the point is, I waited in Mr Bradley's office for two and one-half hours.

00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:47.800
 And I want to know what the Board of Education is going to do about it.

00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:50.600
 Mrs. Orridge, I regret to have to tell you that the Board of Education

00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:54.200
 has absolutely nothing to do with what appointments Mr Bradley keeps or does not keep.

00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:56.760
 Well Mr. Lee, under ordinary circumstances, I would say you were right.

00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:59.100
 Sammy's not right. You're not agreeing with him, are you?

00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:00.880
 I was saying he was agreeing with him.

00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:02.600
 Now just a minute, Harriet. Just a minute.

00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:04.280
 Hello, Mrs. Lee. Where's Virginia?

00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:05.780
 Home of Brown, is that you?

00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:07.400
 Yeah, I've got to see her. I've got to see her.

00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:09.080
 Homer, would you mind getting out of this room?

00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:10.240
 We happen to be in a conference.

00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:12.280
 Oh, excuse me, but isn't Virginia here?

00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:13.720
 Homer, we would like to be left alone.

00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:16.080
 That's all right, Mr. Allrich. I can take care of Homer.

00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:18.120
 Listen, Virginia. I've got to tell you something.

00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:19.960
 And then we always tend you over here again.

00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:21.860
 Virginia, that is no way to speak to a guest.

00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:22.920
 And, Mother, I agree with you.

00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:24.880
 But he isn't my guest, I don't want to see him.

00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:27.000
 Virginia, do you know why Henry Warren's

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:30.040
 coat and assembly wrong side out this morning?

00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:30.640
 What's that?

00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:33.000
 I'm not even interested in why he did it.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:34.400
 What do you mean wrong side out?

00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:37.600
 Excuse me, Mr. Oldrich, but I want to tell Virginia something.

00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:39.240
 And I want to ask you something.

00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:42.720

 And right, can you see whether there's any car coming in back of us?

00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:04.720
 Just a second, Father, and I'll look out the back window.

00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:06.720
 No, sir, and there isn't a thing in back of us.

00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:09.720
 Just a second now while I pull up to the curb.

00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:13.960
 Oh, now then, just a minute, Henry.

00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:16.360
 Do you realize just what you did today?

00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:17.560
 Yes, Father.

00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:19.720
 You made a bit of a fool of yourself, didn't you?

00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:21.360
 Right in front of the whole school.

00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:22.560
 Yes, Father.

00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:25.360
 You shouldn't have done it, even if it was for a woman.

00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:26.560
 Yes, sir.

00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:28.920
 I'll have to admit the girl in this case isn't bad looking,

00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:30.600
 and in fact, she's rather pretty.

00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:31.400
 Yes, Father.

00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:32.920
 But that is still no excuse.

00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:33.960
 Yes, sir.

00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:37.320
 She, how could I ever happen to do a thing like that?

00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:39.120
 She am I ashamed of myself.

00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:40.720
 I'm glad to hear you say that.

00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:43.120
 Here, let me open the door for you.

00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:45.760
 Now, go on into Virginia's party and have a good time.

00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:47.200
 Thank you, Father.

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:49.280
 And I want to tell you both how very sorry I am

00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:51.040
 that I embarrassed you so much today.

00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:51.960
 That's all right, dear.

00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:53.080
 Now, go on in.

00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:53.600
 OK.

00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:54.960
 And thanks again for everything.

00:25:54.960 --> 00:26:00.160
 Wait a minute, Sam.

00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:03.280
 Look at the living room window up there on the porch.

00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:04.360
 Yeah.

00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:05.200
 Quite a crowd.

00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:06.240
 Well, they're dancing.

00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:09.240
 There's Homer Brown and Agnes and George Bigelow.

00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:12.240
 I wonder who's playing the piano. It's lovely.

00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:15.240
 Alice, was that Henry? I just saw him there.

00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:18.240
 Yes, and he's dancing already with Virginia Lee.

00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:22.240
 Not a bad looking young man, is he? Quite a gentleman.

00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:24.240
 He certainly does look nice.

00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:27.240
 Only Sam, look at the way Virginia's laughing at him.

00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:29.240
 What in the world is Henry doing?

00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:30.240
 What's that?

00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:32.240
 He's dancing with something on his head.

00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:35.240
 Alice, that's a lampshade. What's he doing that for?

00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:37.240
 - I'm going that far. - Say it, it's not his...

00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:40.240
 And right after Henry promised faithfully...

00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:44.240
 I wonder if I hear as Alice that women can make such fools out of men?

00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:15.240
 Hello? Hello, is Henry there?

00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:17.540
 No, he isn't. Is there any message? This is his father.

00:27:17.540 --> 00:27:22.440
 Oh, this is Virginia. I just wanted to tell Henry how much he added to the party last night.

00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:23.240
 Very well.

00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:26.240
 Oh, my goodness, I never laughed so hard. No, my life.

00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:28.740
 I guess he's starting to guess it from that actor.

00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:29.540
 What's that?

00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:31.540
 You know, Tommy, don't go kill him. That came attack.

00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:33.340
 He had me tell me all about farming.

00:27:33.340 --> 00:27:35.140
 What's that? No, wait a minute.
