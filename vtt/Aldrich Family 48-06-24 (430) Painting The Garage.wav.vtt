00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.680
 [Music]

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.240
 And now, Jello Pudding's present...

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.760
 Henry! Henry Aldrich!

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.040
 Coming, mother!

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.960
 [Applause]

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.800
 The Aldrich family based on characters originated by Clifford Goldsmith,

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.400
 and sorry, as was shown as Henry with Jackie Countess Holberg,

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.400
 And here they are.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:36.400
 Just a taste of jello puddings. And believe me, you will know

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:42.400
 They are made by famous J-E-L-L-O

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.400
 Yes, and more people eat jello puddings than any other prepared puddings in the world

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.400
 Because you never tasted anything better

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.400
 Jello chocolate, butter, scotch, and vanilla puddings

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.400
 A trio of treats, chock full of old-fashioned, homemade goodness

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:02.200
 Goodness try it see if you don't say that Jell-O-puttings are richer creamier

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:08.220
 More all-round delicious they're made with milk and nourishing and they cook to perfection in just about five minutes

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.960
 But the great thing about Jell-O-puttings is you never tasted anything better

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:20.880
 And now for the Aldrich family

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:28.120
 As summer arrives everybody makes plans for a change of scenery, but a teenage boy needs no such change

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:35.480
 for every new activity is impulsive mind touches on opens up new avenues toward trouble and excitement

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:41.020
 It's Saturday morning and the scene opens in the Aldrich front hall where Henry is on the telephone

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.020
 Is everything all set Homer?

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.780
 Sure, I hope you like mustard sandwiches.

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:46.780
 I love them.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.780
 With a little chili sauce.

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:49.280
 Yeah?

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:57.160
 Are you bringing something to wash them down? Sure. There's water. Well, anyway once we get out to my corkos rocks

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:03.400
 We won't care if we eat or not. We won't. I'll get my bike and come right over. Look. Why don't I come over there?

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.060
 I want to get out of the house. Why? My mother's on the war path

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:12.880
 Boy, wouldn't you know she'd pick the first decent day this year to decide the garage had to be painted?

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.680
 She was there. She expect you to paint it? Well, she's working on my father right now

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.920
 But something tells me she'll be after me in a minute.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.420
 You mean your father's putting up an argument?

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.920
 With my mother, don't be crazy.

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.420
 He's pretending he's asleep.

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.420
 Well, in that case, in that case you better get out quick.

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.420
 That's what I say. If I can just get past the breakfast dishes.

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.920
 Gee whiz, Homer. I don't know why it is every time I plan something with you,

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.420
 some member of your family tries to throw a monkey wrench into things.

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.920
 Well, get out, Henry. Don't worry. I'll be over there in five minutes.

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.420
 Well, okay.

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.420
 What's that, Mother?

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:49.420
 Hello, Henry.

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:50.420
 Yeah?

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:51.420
 I'll be right over.

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.420
 Just as soon as I bring in the washing.

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.420
 Listen, Homer, why do you let your family walk all over you like that?

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:59.420
 Gee, I don't know.

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.420
 Why don't you stick up for your rights?

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:02.420
 Sure.

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:03.420
 Okay.

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:04.420
 Sure.

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.420
 I'll be there as soon as I bring in the washing.

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.420
 Homer, I'm counting on you.

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:10.420
 Sure.

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:11.420
 So long.

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:12.420
 Goodbye.

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:13.420
 Yes, Mother?

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:14.420
 What are you doing, dear?

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.020
 Well, Jean, I'm not doing anything.

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:19.660
 Well, then please come out here and do the breakfast dishes.

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.420
 Well, mother, when I said I wasn't doing anything,

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.420
 I didn't mean I wasn't doing anything.

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.540
 I mean, Henry, don't stand up there and yell.

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:29.420
 I know, but--

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:30.260
 Henry!

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:31.660
 Father, is that you?

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:32.340
 It is.

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.180
 And Henry, do you see the package?

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.620
 Sure only, I thought you went to the office, Father.

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.900
 I started to, but Henry, wait until you step outside.

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:40.740
 What's outside?

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:42.100
 Somewhere, my boy, summer.

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.740
 The sun shining, the birds are singing.

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:46.660
 It's no day to sit in an office.

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:47.260
 Look here.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:48.300
 Let me show you what I bought.

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:49.660
 Gee, Father, why?

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:50.300
 You'll see.

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:51.860
 You'll see.

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.140
 Um, seeds.

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.980
 Yes, sir.

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.500
 Vegetables, flowers, enough for a whole late planting.

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.300
 And I've got another surprise for you.

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:00.020
 You have?

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:03.540
 I'm going to turn this entire day over to the garden and to you.

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:04.420
 To me?

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.540
 I've been pretty busy this winter, son.

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.820
 I haven't been able to see as much of you as I would have like.

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:10.620
 I know, but I--

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:11.780
 You've got a remedy that.

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.680
 When I go to spend one grand day working in our garden.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.180
 Today?

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.780
 Yes, sir.

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:22.080
 We'll put her around in the sunshine and catch up on each other's news.

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:25.580
 Maybe top the whole thing off with a soda at the Haven Drug Store.

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:26.780
 How's that sound?

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.580
 That sounds swell, Father.

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:29.580
 Only...

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:30.480
 Only what?

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.980
 Well, Homer and I...

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.480
 Well, Gee, if I had any idea you were planning on...

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:37.080
 You made some plans with Homer?

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.380
 Well, that's all right, son. I don't mind if Homer joins in.

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:40.980
 The only thing is...

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:41.480
 Yeah?

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:45.380
 Well, it's just that Homer was kind of looking forward to...

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.180
 to these other plans we've made.

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.880
 Oh, I see.

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:51.980
 Father, I...

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:53.980
 That's perfectly all right, Henry.

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:57.980
 Naturally, I wouldn't force you to spend the day with me.

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:59.480
 Father, I don't want you to thank...

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:02.480
 Please don't give it another thought. Just forget the whole thing.

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.480
 Gee.

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:07.480
 Gee, what kind of seeds have you got there anyway?

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:09.480
 Nothing at all, just the same old thing.

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:13.480
 But father I'd be very interested in seeing them.

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:14.480
 Henry Oldridge.

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.480
 I've never been so ashamed of you in my life.

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:20.480
 I just feel as though I've failed somewhere along the line as a mother.

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:21.480
 You mean you've been listening?

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:27.480
 Henry, do you realize that you spend practically 365 days a year with Homer Brown?

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:28.480
 That's right.

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:31.480
 And all that time your father is out working his fingers to the bone

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:34.480
 so he can feed and clothe you and give you a good education.

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.480
 See, mother, I didn't mean to hurt his feelings.

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:38.480
 Well, you did, dear.

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:43.480
 -Gee, what do you think I should do? -I'm sure I don't know.

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:45.480
 The whole thing is entirely in your own lap.

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:46.480
 Mother, where are you going?

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:50.480
 I'm going to leave you alone so you can think things over.

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:53.480
 Why, Sam, what are you doing out there?

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:55.480
 I'm sitting, Alex.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:58.480
 Can't you find any place more comfortable than the stairs?

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:00.480
 I don't want to be comfortable.

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:03.480
 -No, Sam. -Allis, please go on with your housework.

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.480
 What are you going to do, dear?

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:09.480
 Well, I need to go to the office, so get a haircut.

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:11.480
 I haven't decided which.

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:12.480
 So I'll answer the phone.

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.480
 Thank you, Sam.

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:15.480
 Hello?

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:16.480
 Hello, Sam. This is Will Brown.

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:17.480
 Yes, Will.

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:20.480
 Look, I only have a minute while Elizabeth's talking to the milkman.

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:22.480
 You doing anything today?

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:23.480
 Not a thing.

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:26.480
 What do you say we run out to Fletcher's pond and get him some fishing?

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.480
 Well, I had planned on working in the garden, but...

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:32.480
 On a hot day like this, bring your back over a hole and shovel?

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:36.320
 Well when you could stretch out in the grass and watch the clouds roll by

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:40.620
 Well, you're 100% right. I don't know what I was thinking of. I'll be right over

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:46.880
 No, I'll come over there. Huh Elizabeth's got our garage on our mind and if I don't oh here she comes what's that?

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:51.500
 Yes, sir. Yes indeed mr. By all means I'll drop in a cheaper

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:55.740
 I'll drop in right away and we'll sign the contracts on that deal what goodbye?

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:58.360
 Well, well, what are you talking about?

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:00.560
 Yes, Henry.

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:03.560
 Father, I've been thinking it over in G. Let's go.

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:04.560
 Let's go where?

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:05.560
 Out to the garden.

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:08.560
 Oh, Henry, why don't we just leave the garden for some other day?

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:11.560
 G, Father, you don't have to pretend with me.

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:12.560
 Huh?

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:13.560
 Well, look at it this way.

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:15.560
 The sun's boiling hot.

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.560
 And the first thing you know, you're breaking your back over a hole.

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:19.560
 Well, of course, if you'd rather not.

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:21.560
 Oh, no, don't feel it.

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:25.560
 Well, I mean, naturally, what I want to do is work in the garden with you, of course.

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:28.560
 Well, then, I guess it's all settled.

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:29.560
 I guess.

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:32.560
 Yes, I guess it is.

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:45.560
 Listen Henry, why don't you come right out and tell your father.

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:46.560
 And break his heart home?

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:47.560
 She was.

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:50.560
 Are we going to have to spend the whole day planning your garden?

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:55.560
 Listen, Homer, can you casually look down at the other end of the garden without my father seeing you?

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:56.560
 Sure.

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:57.560
 What's he doing?

00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:00.720
 seems to be having an argument of some kind with my father.

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:01.720
 Yeah?

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:03.800
 Listen, Henry, just tell me one thing.

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:04.800
 What?

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:07.240
 Do you really want to go out to Macquarkle's rocks with me?

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:08.800
 Because if you don't, just say so.

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:09.800
 I'll understand.

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:10.800
 Sure I do, Homer.

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:11.800
 Sure I do.

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:15.960
 But first, I have to think of some way to get my father occupied here.

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:16.960
 You'll be planning this row.

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:21.160
 But if I'm going to spend the day working, I might just as well be home, painting my

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:22.160
 garage.

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:23.160
 Painting your...

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:24.160
 Painting your...

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:25.160
 Homer.

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:26.160
 Why?

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:27.160
 Homer, you're a genius.

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:32.400
 Oh, Lee. Listen. Listen, I know how I can get my father to kick me out.

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:34.040
 Yeah, Gee, whiz how?

00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:36.600
 Look at our garage, Homer. Isn't it a mess?

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:38.660
 Now that you mention it, sure.

00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:43.200
 Well, all I have to do is get my father interested in painting it, and I'll be free.

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:44.700
 I don't follow you, him.

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:47.640
 Whenever he gets painting the garage, he always throws me out.

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:49.720
 That's one thing he'll never let me touch.

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:51.000
 Why would you want to?

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.000
 Why do you think?

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.200
 Because he won't let me.

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:54.640
 But, Henry, where are you going?

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:56.320
 To start the ball rolling.

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:59.160
 Bam, all you have to do is come right out and tell Henry.

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:00.160
 Tell me what, Father.

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:01.420
 Oh, well, nothing, Henry.

00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:02.320
 Not a thing.

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:03.680
 How's the garden coming along?

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:04.920
 I'm just fine.

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:06.080
 How's your end?

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:07.520
 We're getting there.

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:09.160
 Well, look, Father.

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:12.040
 Have you happened to notice our garage recently?

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:13.200
 Isn't it a site?

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:14.240
 Why, uh--

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:16.160
 Don't you think it could use a coat of paint?

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:18.040
 Why, yes, Henry.

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:19.680
 That's an excellent idea.

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:20.400
 Look at it, Will.

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:21.400
 Isn't it a site?

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:22.640
 It looks all right to me.

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:23.960
 Will.

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:24.480
 What?

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:25.760
 You stay right here, Father.

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:31.760
 I'll go and get the paint. You do that, son. Sam, have you gone crazy? Look, Will, this is a chance to get away and go fishing.

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:35.760
 Yeah? For as long as I can remember, Henry's wanted to paint the garage and I've never let him touch it.

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:38.760
 Is that right? But today, Will, I'm going to let him paint the whole thing himself.

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:53.760
 No, I'm not busy, Elizabeth. I'm glad you've followed. But I won't keep you, dear. I just wanted if you had any large paintbrushes.

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:55.040
 How large?

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:56.360
 For painting a garage.

00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:58.560
 Oh, you're having your garage painted?

00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:00.960
 No, Alice. I'm painting it myself.

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:01.960
 Really?

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:03.960
 And I might even fall off the ladder and break my neck.

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:04.960
 What's that?

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:05.960
 Then perhaps they'll be sorry.

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:06.960
 Who, Elizabeth?

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:07.960
 Will and Homer.

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:11.560
 Honestly, Alice, those two would go to the end of the earth to avoid a little work.

00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:15.160
 Are you sure they wouldn't do it for you, Elizabeth, if you asked them nicely?

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:18.160
 Alice, dear, I've asked them nicely in every other way.

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:20.560
 Oh, well, men are all the same, I guess.

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:22.960
 Well, I guess I'm pretty lucky.

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:23.960
 Are you dear?

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:29.260
 Yes, it's quite a coincidence, but Sam and Henry are getting ready to paint our garage right now.

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:30.260
 They are?

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.460
 Well, how long did you have to work on them?

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:34.960
 As a matter of fact, I didn't say a word about it.

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:38.960
 They always seem to know what I want done without my even having to say.

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:39.960
 Really?

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:43.560
 Well, of course Homer and Will think a lot of me too.

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:44.560
 Oh, certainly.

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:48.260
 I don't believe in judging a man by how much work he does around the house, do you?

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:49.460
 Oh, of course not.

00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:52.860
 And Elizabeth, if you want to come and pick it up, I'd be glad to lend you a paintbrush.

00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:57.760
 All right. And Alice, do you think people will talk if I come over in my overalls?

00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:10.360
 Father! We're around behind the garage, son.

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:12.360
 And well, Henry, have you got all the paint out?

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:15.860
 Yes, sir, and here, Father. I thought you might like to start with this big brush.

00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:17.360
 Henry, I have a big surprise for you.

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:17.860
 You have?

00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:19.360
 He sure has, Henry.

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:21.360
 Yes, sir. You may keep it.

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:22.360
 Keep what?

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:26.600
 brush father watch for I've been pretty unfair in the past Henry when you wanted

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:30.440
 to paint the garage I realize that now so you have my permission to go to it but

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:35.120
 but but but I had quite believe it as well it's a fact but father I can't be

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:41.920
 trusted with a paint brush well who said so you said so I was wrong Henry you go

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:45.400
 ahead and enjoy your I know but you were getting right out of your way and leaving

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:48.520
 you a clear feel and Homer can help you

00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:50.440
 The paint's already here.

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:53.440
 Yeah, well listen Homer, I have something to tell you.

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:54.680
 And did you see his face?

00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:58.480
 Well, I don't think I've ever seen anybody so surprised.

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:00.840
 I have to hand it to you Sam, it worked like a charm.

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:03.040
 Now just dash in the house and grab my fishing tackle.

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:04.480
 OK, I'll only be five minutes.

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:06.360
 Say, these are pretty nice brushes.

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:08.840
 While I'm waiting, do you mind if I dog a little red trim

00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:10.080
 around the door here?

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:11.320
 I don't mind if Henry doesn't.

00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:13.000
 Just a few inches here.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.880
 I can't resist red paint.

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:16.520
 Help yourself, Will.

00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:19.860
 [humming]

00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:20.860
 Is that you, Sam?

00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:23.960
 Yes, Alice. Oh, oh, I didn't know we had company.

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:25.120
 Good morning, sir.

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:26.200
 What's that?

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:27.400
 By Elizabeth.

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:29.800
 In those with your back turd, I thought--

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:32.300
 And Elizabeth came over to borrow a paintbrush, Sam.

00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:34.040
 Oh, well, they're all out in the backyard.

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:35.500
 Excuse me. How are you, Elizabeth?

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:37.100
 Oh, not too bad, Sam.

00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:39.400
 I've been having a little trouble, though, with my--

00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:41.920
 with my-- well, I guess he's gone.

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:43.940
 Reminds me as well, go out and get that brush.

00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:46.440
 Oh, yes, and I do appreciate your--

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:48.440
 Elizabeth, what are you staring at?

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:51.440
 My goodness, what do you see out in the backyard?

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:55.940
 Unless my eyes deceive me, I see my husband Will and my son Homer.

00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:56.940
 Yes?

00:12:56.940 --> 00:12:58.940
 Hinking your garage.

00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:03.440
 My goodness!

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:04.440
 Excuse me!

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:06.440
 Elizabeth, where are you going?

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:07.440
 Wheel down!

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:08.440
 Hello Elizabeth!

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:09.440
 Homer!

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:11.940
 Gee, Liz, what are you doing over here?

00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:12.940
 Is anything wrong, Elizabeth?

00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:14.440
 We'll put down that paintbrush.

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:15.440
 Put it down?

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:17.840
 No, on second thought, keep it.

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:18.980
 You too, Homer.

00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:20.280
 Now march, both of you.

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:22.000
 March, in which direction?

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.760
 In the direction of our garage.

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:25.560
 Listen, Mother, I'll come quietly

00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:27.840
 and meet you as I go in my ear.

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:30.560
 Now march, right, left, right, left.

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:34.560
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:44.760
 There are miracles of goodness, a marvel of speed.

00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:49.800
 So sensational new Jello Tapioca puddings, newest members of the famous Jello pudding

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:50.800
 family.

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:55.360
 Try these delicious new desserts, and you'll find here's another reason why more people

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:59.640
 eat Jello puddings than any other prepared puddings in the world.

00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:03.040
 There's luscious light and delicate Jello vanilla tapioca.

00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:06.320
 There's rich candy-good Jello chocolate tapioca.

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:11.040
 And newest of all, there's Jello Orange coconut tapioca, tempting orange flavor with coconut

00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:12.040
 added.

00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:14.640
 creamy, smooth treat of tropical goodness.

00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:17.000
 All three jello puddings are ready prepared,

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.880
 quick as a flash to fix and nothing to go wrong.

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:21.280
 All you do is add the milk,

00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:23.360
 then cook in an ordinary saucepan.

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:25.320
 And jello puddings cook to perfection

00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:27.120
 in just about five minutes.

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:30.320
 So remember, now you can get jello vanilla tapioca,

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:31.800
 jello chocolate tapioca,

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:35.120
 and newest of all, jello orange coconut tapioca.

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:37.840
 Ask for jello tapioca puddings,

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:40.760
 a miracle of goodness, a marvel of speed.

00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:47.760
 And now getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldrich.

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:51.480
 After having made plans to go on a picnic with Homer, Henry was led to believe that his

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:53.640
 father wanted a Sherry's company today.

00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:57.800
 But actually Mr. Aldrich is anxious to get away fishing with Will Brown.

00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:02.240
 As a result of their efforts to get away from each other, each has lost his partner.

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:06.040
 It's just after lunch and the zine opens in the Aldrich living room.

00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:07.040
 Henry?

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:08.040
 Yes, Father.

00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:10.480
 Do you think you should be fiddling in the living room?

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:14.480
 I'm being careful father. Besides, what else is there to do?

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:16.480
 You have a point there.

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:18.480
 It isn't that I'm not enjoying your company father.

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:21.480
 Oh, of course. It's grand having to stay together.

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:26.480
 Sure. How's business?

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:28.480
 Had any interesting cases lately?

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:32.480
 Yes, but they're rather complicated if you wouldn't understand.

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:35.480
 Oh. How's school?

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:38.480
 It's fine. It's all over.

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:42.280
 (audience laughing)

00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:45.320
 - Did you know the baseball team tied Abbott City last week?

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:46.400
 - Yes, that's too bad.

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:47.280
 - Too bad?

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:49.400
 I guess you didn't hear me, Father, they tied.

00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:50.240
 - Yes, but--

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:53.000
 - It's the closest we've come to winning in two years.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.080
 (audience laughing)

00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:55.960
 - Oh, oh well, that's fine.

00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:59.760
 - Gee, do I feel sorry for Mr. Brown and Homer

00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:00.960
 painting their garage?

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:02.760
 They don't have any rights at all.

00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:03.720
 - Apparently not.

00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:05.680
 - Wouldn't you think on a nice day like this,

00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:07.840
 Mr. Brown would let Homer go out in the woods

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:12.080
 be wanted to you certainly would what was that you said about going out in the

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:15.720
 world that's what Homer and I am planned on doing today but I thought you wanted

00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:21.200
 to stay around home I wish you wanted to do that no I want to go fishing you do

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:26.000

 - You're gonna have fun.

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:37.760
 - Sam, you must be joking.

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:38.600
 - What do you mean?

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:40.600
 - Well, my goodness, you certainly can't walk out

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:42.600
 and leave our backyard in the state, it's in.

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:43.700
 - What's the matter with it?

00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:45.400
 - Well, the garden have dug up,

00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:47.840
 packages of seeds all over the place,

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:50.240
 and what's more important, the garage has painted.

00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:52.040
 - Alice, we'll paint the garage tomorrow.

00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:53.680
 - Why can't you go fishing tomorrow?

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:55.360
 - Because the paper says it's gonna rain.

00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:57.680
 - Well, dear, how can you paint the garage in the rain?

00:16:57.680 --> 00:16:59.560
 - We'll cross that bridge when we come to it.

00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:00.560
 - I'll answer the phone.

00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:02.120
 You two stay right there.

00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:03.920
 - Father, why don't we stick up for our ride?

00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:04.920
 Hello?

00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:06.920
 Alice, this is Elizabeth.

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:07.920
 Oh, hello Elizabeth.

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:10.920
 I just called to tell you how nicely things are going.

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:12.920
 Honestly, I'm so pleased.

00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:13.920
 Really?

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:15.920
 I wish you could see what a good time Homer and Will are having.

00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:16.920
 What are they doing?

00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:17.920
 Paining the garage.

00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:19.920
 I've been watching it from the window.

00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:22.920
 Wheels painting one side and Homer's painting the other.

00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:24.920
 And I've never seen him so engrossed in anything.

00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:26.920
 Well, isn't that nice?

00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:29.920
 Sam and Henry painting your garage must have set a good example.

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:30.920
 Sam and Henry?

00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:31.920
 Yes.

00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:34.700
 How did you ever train them to be so helpful, Alice?

00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:38.800
 What? Well, I believe in taking the bull by the horns.

00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:39.300
 Yes.

00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:43.520
 And when I have a problem to face, I feel the only thing to do is...

00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:44.800
 Well, face it.

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:46.320
 Oh, that's so true, Alice.

00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:48.140
 Oh, would you excuse me now, dear?

00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:49.140
 Of course. Goodbye.

00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:50.040
 Goodbye.

00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:51.560
 Sam!

00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:52.740
 What in the dalas?

00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:53.880
 Please come here!

00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:55.680
 Mother, just take the bull by the horns.

00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:56.680
 Yes, Father.

00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:58.180
 Yes, I will.

00:17:58.180 --> 00:17:59.720
 Now listen, Alice.

00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:00.880
 Now listen, Sam.

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:02.080
 You listen to me!

00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:13.980
 [Music]

00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:14.780
 Homer!

00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:15.980
 Yes, Mother!

00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:17.980
 How's the painting coming along, dear?

00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:19.980
 Why, I'm fine, Mother!

00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:21.580
 Don't bother coming over!

00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:24.380
 I guess, won't death or I'd come and see how you were getting along!

00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:25.980
 Well, listen, Mother, you wouldn't...

00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:26.980
 Homer, Brown!

00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:28.380
 I'm gonna paint over!

00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:32.380
 Do you mean to say you spent an entire hour playing pick that toe with perfectly good paint?

00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:35.880
 Not entirely. I painted this strip along the bottom.

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:37.880
 And what's this over here?

00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:38.880
 What's why?

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:41.380
 This heart with Agnes loves Homer printed inside.

00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:44.880
 Or you should be ashamed of yourself smearing a thing like that all over the garage.

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:47.880
 But mother, she said she didn't care if the whole world knew it.

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:48.880
 Where's your father?

00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:50.380
 He's around the other side.

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:51.880
 Wait till he sees this.

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:52.380
 Will!

00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:54.380
 But mother, I'm gonna paint over.

00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:54.880
 Will!

00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:55.880
 What do you want, Elizabeth?

00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:57.880
 I want to tell you what your son's been doing.

00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:00.840
 Look Elizabeth, why don't you run along in the house?

00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:02.820
 Since you apparently weren't interested enough to...

00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:04.320
 Will Brown.

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:05.320
 Now look Elizabeth.

00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:07.620
 May I ask whose art work this is?

00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:08.620
 Mine.

00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:09.620
 Oh!

00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:12.140
 But don't get excited, I'm going to paint over them.

00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:13.140
 What are they?

00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:15.540
 Smallmouth bass.

00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:18.940
 This one here's a guppy.

00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:21.140
 Honestly Will, I don't know what to say to you.

00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:23.580
 Now look, do I tell you how to do your housework?

00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:26.100
 But these horrible fish, what were the neighbors' things?

00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:28.580
 I'll have them filled in before the neighbors even see them.

00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:30.780
 Besides, it's nobody's business but my own.

00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:31.300
 But will!

00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:35.580
 If a man has to work, there's no law that says he can't enjoy himself is there.

00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:36.340
 All right, Will.

00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:37.940
 Go ahead and do it your way.

00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:39.540
 But don't expect another meal in this house

00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:41.100
 to do that garage is painted properly.

00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:42.260
 Don't worry, Elizabeth.

00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:43.260
 Father!

00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:44.100
 Yes, Homer.

00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:46.140
 Father, can we have another can of paint?

00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:48.460
 What happened to all the paint we had in the garage?

00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:49.500
 We used it.

00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:51.300
 You mean to say we haven't any more?

00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:52.620
 I guess not.

00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:55.020
 Say, those are pretty good submarine.

00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:57.820
 Well, come on, we'd better get down to the paint store and get some.

00:19:57.820 --> 00:19:58.820
 I'll say.

00:19:58.820 --> 00:19:59.180
 Adri-

00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:01.020
 Well, what do you mean, submarine?

00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:13.620
 Ouch!

00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:14.820
 Henry, hold still.

00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:16.220
 How can I?

00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:18.220
 Well, lean back against the garage.

00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:22.020
 But the turpentine's running down my face and it stings!

00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:24.920
 Well, that's unfortunate, but I either have to scrub

00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:27.000
 your head or cut your hair off.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.320
 Now take your choice.

00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:29.840
 - Scrub.

00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:30.920
 - All right.

00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:31.840
 Oh still.

00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:33.080
 - Gee, what time is it?

00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:34.120
 - It's 2.30, it's no use,

00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:35.760
 and no matter how fast we paint,

00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:37.400
 we won't get any fishing done today.

00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:40.840
 - Unless there was some way to speed things up.

00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:41.680
 - For example.

00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:45.320
 - Well, look, did I tell you about that swell gadget

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:47.080
 I saw in Springer's hardware?

00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:47.920
 - Oh, what is it?

00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:48.840
 - It's a paint sprayer.

00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:51.440
 You take the fan belt off of your car, see,

00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:52.880
 and attach the sprayer,

00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:55.880
 And boy, you can paint a whole house in four hours.

00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:56.540
 You can?

00:20:56.540 --> 00:20:58.380
 Sure.

00:20:58.380 --> 00:21:00.000
 What are you doing, Father?

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.200
 Taking the fan belt off.

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:03.400
 And we'll walk down to Springer's

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:04.480
 and look at one of those things.

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:05.560
 Do you mean it, Father?

00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:06.640
 You just hand me that wrench, please.

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:07.280
 Sure.

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:09.280
 And then I can go hunt up my fishing pole.

00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:12.280
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:22.560
 Well, Homer, there's no use hiding outside, you.

00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:24.560
 Oh,

00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:26.560
 Hello Elizabeth, this is Alice.

00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:27.560
 Yes, Alice.

00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:31.560
 This is a little embarrassing, Elizabeth, but are Henry and Sam over there?

00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:34.560
 No, they aren't. And neither are we'll and Homer.

00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:37.560
 You mean they disappeared too? Well, that's settled.

00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:38.560
 Set us what?

00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:42.560
 I know very well where they've gone, Elizabeth, the whole four of them.

00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:43.560
 Where?

00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:45.560
 Fishing. Out at Fletcher's pond.

00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:46.560
 Alice, they wouldn't dare.

00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:51.560
 They've been talking about it all day, and if I know anything about men, that's where they are.

00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:52.960
 I can't believe it.

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:55.360
 What sort of condition is your garage in?

00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:57.160
 You wouldn't believe it if I told you.

00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:58.660
 Well ours is the same.

00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:00.660
 And do you know how I feel Elizabeth?

00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:01.360
 How?

00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:02.960
 If we let them get away with this,

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:05.160
 we'll never be able to do another thing with them.

00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:06.560
 I'll do whatever you say Alice.

00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:08.160
 You're so good at managing them.

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:10.860
 Alright I'll be right over with a car to pick you up.

00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:12.060
 But where are we going?

00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:14.860
 Up to Fletcher's Pond and take the bull by the horn.

00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:24.860
 [Music]

00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:25.860
 Come on in the house, Will.

00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:28.360
 The only thing is I should be getting home.

00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:29.860
 Only I don't dare.

00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:30.860
 Come on in for a few minutes.

00:22:30.860 --> 00:22:34.360
 You can explain to Elizabeth how we ran into each other down at the hardware store.

00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:37.860
 Yeah, but how am I going to explain that I can't find any of the right color paint?

00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:38.860
 Well, just...

00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:40.360
 Just stand up for your rights, Will.

00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:42.360
 Tell her you'll finish painting the garage next week.

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:44.760
 But you haven't seen what I painted on the toe.

00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:46.760
 Well, I never liked our neighbors anyway.

00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:48.160
 [audience laughing]

00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:49.960
 Father, I've been walked through the house

00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:51.360
 and mother seems to be out.

00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:53.360
 Cheers. Sit down, Will.

00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:54.860
 Why don't I make some lemonade

00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:56.360
 and we'll all relax for a while?

00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:58.860
 That'd be great. Henry, go make some lemonade.

00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:02.360
 Oh, me? Father, you mean we don't have to go home?

00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:03.360
 Not right away.

00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:04.360
 Didn't mother say so?

00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:05.860
 I said so.

00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:07.860
 You, Father.

00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:10.860
 We are sure wish they'd had one of those paint sprayers left.

00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:13.860
 Let's not talk about paint. Let's enjoy ourselves while we can.

00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:18.860
 Say, Father, didn't you leave your car in the driveway when we went down to the hardware store?

00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:19.860
 Yes, of course.

00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:21.860
 Well, look out the window. It's gone.

00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:23.860
 Good heavens, you don't suppose your mother took it, do you?

00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:28.860
 Sure, that's probably it. But I took the fan belt out. She won't get ten miles with it.

00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:29.860
 Is that the phone?

00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:30.860
 I'll answer it.

00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:31.860
 How about that lemonade?

00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:33.860
 Hello.

00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:34.860
 And let me speak to Matt.

00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:36.860
 Wait a minute. Who is that?

00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:37.860
 Alice, is that you?

00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:39.860
 Sam, I'm Stuart.

00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:43.860
 Did you go? Are you at home?

00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:44.860
 Of course I'm at home.

00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:45.860
 Oh my goodness.

00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:46.860
 Where are you?

00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:50.860
 I'm coming from a roadside stand out near Fletcher's pond.

00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:51.860
 You're where?

00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:54.860
 At the... I don't know quite how to tell you, but...

00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:56.860
 There seems to be something wrong with the car.

00:23:56.860 --> 00:23:58.860
 Oh, is that so?

00:23:58.860 --> 00:23:59.860
 Alice, what did you do to it?

00:23:59.860 --> 00:24:01.860
 I didn't do anything.

00:24:01.860 --> 00:24:04.860
 Elizabeth and I were just driving along and it got very hot inside

00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:06.860
 and then the whole thing started smoking.

00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:07.860
 Now look, Alice.

00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:09.120
 - Hello, you're getting angry.

00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:10.480
 Sam, I give you my word.

00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:12.180
 I didn't brace the motor.

00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:15.320
 And I know I put the emergency break off before I started.

00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:16.160
 - I see.

00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:17.800
 Well, we'll discuss that later.

00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:18.640
 - Yes, Sam.

00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:22.440
 And do you think you and Will could come out and get us?

00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:25.120
 - Yes, I suppose we'll have to.

00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:27.240
 But on our own terms, you understand?

00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:28.080
 - Yes, Sam.

00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:29.120
 - All right, goodbye.

00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:30.240
 - Goodbye, dear.

00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:31.600
 And thank you.

00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:32.880
 - Will, boys!

00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:33.720
 - Yes, Sam.

00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:34.560
 - Yes, Father.

00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:37.520
 - Elect to tackle everyone, we're going fishing.

00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:52.520
 [applause]

00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:55.920
 That's gratitude, Henry. That's gratitude for you.

00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:56.920
 No, listen, Homer.

00:24:56.920 --> 00:25:00.520
 If you don't want to go over to Agnes's for dinner tomorrow, okay.

00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:01.520
 Well, gee, Homer.

00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:05.520
 Only I happen to know they're having Jell-O butterscotch pudding for dessert.

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:08.880
 I guess they'll be glad to have me eat your dish of it too.

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:10.560
 Now, wait a minute, Homer.

00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:13.920
 It has better change your mind and a hurry about that invitation, Henry,

00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:17.920
 because you never tasted anything better than jello puddings.

00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:21.040
 Jello chocolate, butter scotch, and vanilla puddings.

00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:22.480
 A trio of treats.

00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:27.760
 And that's why more people eat jello puddings than any other prepared puddings in the world.

00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:29.440
 Sure, jello puddings are nourishing.

00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:33.200
 Sure, they're luscious to look at and sure they're easy to fix.

00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:36.660
 But first and foremost, Jello Pudding's taste so grand.

00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:40.600
 Smooth as cream, chock full of old-fashioned homemade goodness.

00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:43.700
 Jello Pudding's made with milk cooked in just about five minutes.

00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:45.900
 But above all, there are treat to eat.

00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:47.600
 That's Jello Pudding's.

00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:50.000
 You'll never taste it anything better.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:26:02.200

00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:05.800
