00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000
 [Music]

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
 And now the Jell-O family presents...

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
 Henry... Henry Oldridge!

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.000
 Coming, mother!

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 [Applause]

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
 Yes, it's the Oldridge family based on characters

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.520
 is originated by Flippard Goldsmith and starring Ezra Stone as Henry with Jackie

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.680
 Kelka's home. And yes, it's the Jell-O family with its three famous desserts.

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:42.060
 Jell-O in those six delicious flavors, Jell-O puddings with that old-fashioned

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:48.000
 homemade flavor and Jell-O tapioca puddings, a miracle of goodness, a marvel of

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 speed.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:59.240
 Everyone's a jello good fellow, a very good jello good fellow, so rich so tempting and

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:04.920
 mellow, J-E-L-L-O.

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:13.520
 And now for the Old Rich Family.

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:25.020
 It's difficult to imagine and even more difficult to remember either a neighborhood

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.300
 or a home without a typical teenage boy somewhere in it.

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.500
 Henry Aldrich for instance is always right in the center of everything.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.300
 The scene opens in the Aldrich front hall.

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.100
 It is mid-morning.

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.940
 I'm coming.

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:42.580
 Well, Willie Marshall.

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.880
 Mr. Orr, did you know it's snowing cats and dogs outside?

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.360
 It's also snowing cats and dogs inside. Come in so I can shut the door.

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.820
 Sure. I've got special rates for shoveling the last snow of the year, Mr. Orr, which is dollar an hour.

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:55.820
 A dollar?

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:56.980
 That shocks you?

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:57.780
 It does.

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.080
 Well, did I mention I have an easy payment plan?

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.980
 Well, no plan could make paying a dollar an hour easy.

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:05.820
 But for snow, that's dirt cheap.

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:06.720
 No, thank you.

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.280
 Besides, it isn't necessary to hire anyone. Henry's already out there shoveling our driveway.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.780
 He is?

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.540
 Yes, he started nearly an hour ago.

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.740
 Gee, I guess the snow's coming down so fast I couldn't see him.

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.060
 So thank you just the same.

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.980
 Well that's okay, would you like some firewood hole?

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:21.500
 No thanks.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:22.620
 Lambs rewired?

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:23.420
 No thanks.

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.100
 How about having your house repainted?

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.300
 (audience laughs)

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.220
 But I have a tie in with an uncle.

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.180
 No thank you, Willie, and now if you'll excuse me

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.860
 I'm helping Mr. Brown make out his infant tax return.

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.540
 Okay, I'll move along.

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:35.380
 Here, Mr. Orrin.

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:36.220
 What's this?

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:37.780
 My card, so long.

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.380
 Goodbye.

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:40.220
 Say Sam.

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:41.220
 I'm coming, Will.

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.920
 I've been looking over these exemptions.

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.860
 There must be a typographical error.

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:45.700
 - That's impossible.

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.120
 - But Sam, according to this form,

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.380
 all I'm allowed to deduct for home are $600.

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:51.220
 - That's right.

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.700
 - After all, I go through Sam it isn't fair.

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:55.780
 - Yes, Alice.

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.860
 - Don't you think he's been out there long enough?

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:58.700
 - Who?

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.500
 - Henry, he'll be simply warned of nothing,

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.340
 shoveling all that heavy snow.

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:03.660
 - I'll get the ball, brother.

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:04.500
 - Thank you, Mary.

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:05.900
 - Alice, don't worry about Henry.

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.460
 Boys have been shoveling ever since the first snowfall.

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.300
 - But when we had his tonsils out,

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.060
 Dr. Bennington warned us not to let Henry over-exert.

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.660
 Henry was three years old then.

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.460
 There is the easiest thing in the world to have a relapse.

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:21.540
 Mr. Brown, that phone call for you.

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:22.040
 Me?

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.800
 And here's your part of Hot Chocolate, Mother.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:24.940
 Thanks, Mary. Here's some.

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:25.740
 I'll be right back.

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:27.740
 You know I don't care for Hot Chocolate.

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:29.780
 Here, I want you to take it out to Henry.

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:30.340
 Alice.

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.140
 This man has energy food.

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.980
 Hello?

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:34.300
 Will, this is Elizabeth.

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:35.060
 Who?

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.260
 Elizabeth Brown, your wife.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.580
 Oh, yes, Elizabeth.

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:43.580
 home over there the aldrices from course not he's shoveling snow off our driveway

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:47.260
 well I did see a dark object out there but I thought it was a trash can

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.580
 Elizabeth it's about time you began to recognize the difference between your

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:55.700
 own son and a trash can yes dear and will you know how the poor boy suffers

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:00.700
 from sinus only when there's work to be done but there Elizabeth let's not coddle

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.540

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.020
 quick about it is Henry in our house he's not here in our driveway hasn't been

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:12.700
 touched. Elizabeth, how many trash cans did you see outside?

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:17.100
 One. And excuse me, Will, I've got a pot of hot chocolate on the stove.

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:17.700
 What?

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.780
 Henry isn't at our house,

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:24.020
 that's a fine thing. Alice, where's Henry?

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:28.060
 Were you calling? I, Father. Henry, all rich. Where did you come from?

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:32.300
 The basement and father, did you know our aluminum snow shovel has disappeared?

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.740
 Henry, we gave that to the government in 1942.

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.540
 We did? She was. What for?

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.500
 We were fighting a war.

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.040
 With our snow shovel?

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:43.540
 [laughter]

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:44.140
 Henry.

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:46.540
 But father, the one I'm using weighs a ton.

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:47.640
 No alibi, Henry.

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:49.440
 If Homer's clearing away the brown snow,

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.040
 the least you can do is clear ours.

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.840
 Homer is?

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.240
 That's right, Henry.

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:54.240
 Homer?

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.740
 Did someone call me?

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:56.740
 Homer!

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:57.740
 Homer!

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:00.240
 So you were the trash can after all?

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:00.940
 Why?

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:02.540
 Why aren't you at home shoveling snow?

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.140
 Because I'm gonna help Henry,

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:06.240
 then he's coming over to help me.

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.640
 Oh, don't say.

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:11.560
 Sure, boy, if there's one thing two people can do faster, it's driveways.

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.240
 Very well then, suppose you start.

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:14.080
 Yeah, now?

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.680
 No.

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.800
 Before we find the lighter shovel.

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.320
 Homer start shoveling.

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:19.480
 Yes, Father.

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.800
 But she wish you'd never seen us know the way so much.

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.320
 Come on, well, let's get back to your income tag.

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:30.160
 Father, Father, did I mention the weather report I heard on the radio?

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.120
 What about it?

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:35.080
 They predicted we're practically sure to have sun tomorrow.

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:35.840
 Yes?

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.240
 or by Saturday at the latest.

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.000
 Good hot sun.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:40.840
 - Well?

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:44.080
 - I don't think I just thought I'd mention it.

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:46.760
 (audience laughing)

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.560
 - You know what our trouble is, Sam?

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:50.200
 Our wives coddle those boys too much.

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:51.120
 - Not this time, Will.

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.080
 This time, Henry's going to finish that job.

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.560
 - Right, Sam, home or two.

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:57.040
 - Well, there, mother just put on her boots and shawl

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:59.320
 and your old Mackinac went out to the driveway.

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:00.160
 - What for?

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.120
 - That's what I was wondering.

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:02.920
 She was carrying the coal shovel.

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:03.760
 - What?

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:06.160
 Alice! Alice, come back in here!

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.160
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:20.400
 Listen, Henry, be careful.

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:21.560
 What do I do now?

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:22.440
 What do you do?

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:23.280
 What do you do?

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.800
 Look at the space I cleared in your driveway.

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:26.440
 What space?

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:27.320
 That's just it.

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.480
 You threw a shovel full of snow over here,

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.880
 and there goes 15 minutes of work.

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:35.920
 Homer, with this shovel that's as far as I can throw it.

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:38.160
 - I've been thinking, Henry.

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:41.360
 How much snow do we take up with each shovel for?

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:43.080
 Six inches at the most.

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:44.040
 - So what?

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:46.920
 - So if we take one shovel every 10 seconds,

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:48.440
 you know how long we'll be?

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:49.280
 - How long?

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:51.040
 - I don't know.

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:52.960
 But I have a date with Agnes tonight,

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:54.160
 and by the time we're through,

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.440
 I won't be in shape for anything.

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:57.800
 - Homer, what can we do?

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:59.040
 - Use our brain.

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:00.520
 - You think that's practical?

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.320
 I mean like Tom Sawyer.

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:03.160
 - Who?

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.720
 - Remember, he got this kid to think white washing

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:08.280
 was so much fun, he did the fence for him

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:10.880
 and gave Tom an apple besides.

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:13.080
 - Homer, those things only happen in books.

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:16.000
 Who'd be dumb enough to fall for a thing like that?

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:16.960
 - Hi, fellas.

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:19.760
 - Oh boy, here's somebody who's dumb enough.

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:22.440
 Charlie Clark, start enjoying yourself.

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:24.440
 Henry, start enjoying yourself.

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:25.680
 - Homer, it won't work.

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:27.720
 - We can at least try.

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:31.120
 Boy, Henry, did you ever have so much fun?

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:32.120
 We!

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:34.120
 Henry.

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:34.960
 - Why?

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:35.880
 - We.

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:36.720
 - Oh!

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:37.560
 (coughing)

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:38.400
 We!

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:41.120
 - We!

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:42.160
 - What's up, fellas?

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:43.720
 - Charlie, don't stop us.

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:46.440
 Boy, are we having fun.

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:49.200
 - Fun, Homer, have you got sunstroke or something?

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:51.200
 - She was no.

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:52.040
 We!

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:53.840
 We!

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:56.200
 We!

00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:57.280
 Oh boy.

00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:58.120
 Homer, what happened?

00:07:58.120 --> 00:07:59.560
 - Oh boy.

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:01.240
 - Homer, why are you bent over?

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:02.920
 - It's nothing, Charlie.

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:06.280
 Didn't you ever laugh so hard you couldn't straighten up?

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:08.480
 - Henry, does he mean he's really enjoying

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:09.560
 shoveling snow?

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:10.480
 - Oh, sure.

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:11.520
 - You know what I think?

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:12.360
 - Why?

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:13.840
 - You guys sure have sunstroke, all right?

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:14.680
 So long.

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:15.520
 - Charlie, wait!

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:18.360
 - I imagine thinking a thing like shoveling snow is fun.

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:21.200
 - But it is, Charlie, look.

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:22.600
 Weee.

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:24.400
 - Homer, he's gone.

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:25.240
 - Weee.

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:29.200
 I told you it only worked in books Homer.

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:33.600
 Well, all I can say is that's a good example of our entire school system.

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:34.100
 What is?

00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:35.400
 Tom Sawyer.

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:39.600
 They give you a book like that to read and when you put it to work what happens?

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:41.500
 No wonder I flunked French.

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:42.600
 Fringe?

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:44.600
 What's that got to do with Tom Sawyer?

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:48.400
 It's all tied together Henry, it's all tied together.

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:52.000
 Come on, we'd better get back to shoveling or we'll never get done.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.600
 Okay.

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:55.200
 Ugh, glee.

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:57.200
 Homer never mind weying.

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:59.200
 Oh, I forgot.

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:00.200
 [Sigh]

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:03.200
 Boy, did you ever shovel heavier snow?

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:04.200
 Hiya fellas!

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:05.200
 Who's that?

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:06.200
 Willie Marshall, keep shoveling.

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:08.200
 Hiya fellas, whatcha doin'?

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:09.200
 [Sigh]

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:10.200
 Yes.

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:11.200
 Okay.

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.200
 Shovelin' snow?

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:14.200
 You win, Willie.

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:16.200
 Now whatcha like to do me a favor?

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:17.200
 What?

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:18.200
 Jumpin' the lake.

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:20.200
 I can't, it's frozen.

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:22.200
 Ohhh boy.

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:24.200
 I can crack a joke as well as a next guy.

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:28.760
 Willy for the last time beat it and let us finish.

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:32.040
 Say you guys wouldn't consider what?

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:34.240
 Gee, no, I guess you wouldn't.

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:35.440
 Wouldn't want.

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:37.720
 Well, you guys look like you're having so much fun.

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:40.520
 I was wondering if you'd let me try for a while.

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:42.040
 What?

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:43.840
 You mean you want a shovel?

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:45.720
 I guess you wouldn't consider it, huh?

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:46.840
 Sure we would.

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:48.640
 Or here, Willy, try mine.

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:49.880
 Well, Gee, thanks.

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:52.080
 You're holding this package.

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:53.560
 Weee!

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:56.060
 Henry, do you suppose he's got sunstroke?

00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:57.760
 Weee!

00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:01.260
 Well, well, thanks for letting me try fellas.

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:02.660
 Here, here's your shovel.

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:03.560
 You're quitting?

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:06.060
 When you just started to enjoy yourself?

00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:08.360
 Gee, I really don't want to quit only.

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:11.360
 Only I have to deliver this package to my Aunt Mildred, see ya.

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:18.160
 Willie, you mean you're gonna let a little thing like your Aunt Mildred stand between you and the most fun you've ever had in your life?

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:19.560
 Gee, what can I do?

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:23.920
 Willie, look Willie, suppose Homer and I deliver the package for you.

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:26.120
 What fellas you'd really do that for me?

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:29.800
 She'd be a pleasure Willie. Here's your shovelback.

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:32.880
 Well gee, thanks her name's Mrs. Hopkins on Maple Street.

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:34.320
 Sure we know, come on Homer.

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:35.760
 Well thanks again, fellas.

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:39.200
 You're welcome Willie. Boy Henry.

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:41.920
 It just shows how you can misjudge people.

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:45.920
 Here I've been going through life thinking Willie was one of the smartest guys around.

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:47.040
 I'll say.

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:49.160
 And you know what I'm gonna do when I get home?

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:50.160
 What?

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:51.160
 Retarm Sawyer again.

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:54.160
 Maybe there's something in there that can help my French.

00:10:54.160 --> 00:11:04.160
 Hi Mrs. Hopkins.

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:05.160
 Hi Mrs. Hopkins.

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:07.160
 Well, come in boys.

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:09.160
 I thought you were my nephew Willie.

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:10.160
 I've been expecting him all morning.

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.160
 Well that's the whole thing Mrs. Hopkins.

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:13.160
 What is?

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:17.160
 Willie got sort of tied up in a little deal and sent us over instead.

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:19.160
 Instead, you're taking this place?

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:21.480
 Well, sure. Here's your package, Mrs. Hopkins.

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:23.760
 Package? Oh, that must be.

00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:25.880
 But wait here. I'll be right back.

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:27.400
 Wait, Mrs. Hopkins?

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:29.640
 She was. Why does she want us to wait?

00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:32.000
 She probably wants to give us a little something

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.480
 for delivering the package.

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:36.920
 Oh, boy. You mean we're getting paid to boot?

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:40.240
 Homer, if she gives us money naturally, we won't keep it.

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:41.080
 Why not?

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:44.480
 Because if anyone really deserves it, it's good old willing.

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:46.440
 With all the fun he's having.

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:49.440
 Here you are, boys.

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:51.440
 The brushes, they're here in the package.

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:54.440
 But Mrs. Hopkins, what's in this can?

00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:55.440
 White wash.

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:56.440
 White wash?

00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:57.440
 White wash.

00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:59.440
 Didn't you say you were taking Willy's plate?

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:00.440
 Well, sure, only it was.

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:04.440
 Well, that's why he was coming over to White Wash my basement.

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:05.440
 What?

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:07.440
 Oh, boy.

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:09.440
 Henry, we've been swindled.

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:19.440
 [Music]

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:22.440
 Sam, what are you doing over there by the window?

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:24.440
 Just checking on the boys, Will.

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:26.440
 Homer doesn't look as always wheezing, does he?

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:28.440
 I can only see one of them from here.

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:29.440
 Which one?

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:32.440
 It's hard to tell, but he seems to be shoveling right along.

00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:37.440
 You know, Sam, it sure makes you feel good, knowing your son has learned to really stick on the job.

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:38.440
 That's right, Will.

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:44.200
 Sarah just goes to show you Sam that a mother's a mother, but a father will Sam

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:48.880
 every boy really needs a father. After all, who else can teach him how to finish

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:53.120
 whatever he starts? Well, speaking of finishing what you start, let's get back

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:59.980
 to your tax return. My return. Where were we? On Schedule D, page 2. Have you got it?

00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:04.200
 Yeah. Sam, why don't I just tell them how much money I've got left over and let

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:06.200
 the government take what it needs.

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:08.200
 Sam, can you answer the front door?

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:09.200
 Very well, Alice.

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:11.200
 We'll start totaling your deduct.

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:13.200
 Oh, but Sam, that's why I really go to pieces.

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:17.200
 Hi, Mr. Alberts.

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:19.200
 Willie, you have already asked me.

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:20.200
 We don't need our plumbing fix.

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:21.200
 Our furnace is fine.

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:22.200
 Well, she was Mr. Alberts.

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:24.200
 I'm not here for that.

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:25.200
 No.

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:26.200
 Come in.

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:29.200
 I've got a path cleared from the sidewalk to your back door, Mr. Alberts.

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:30.200
 What?

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:31.200
 Not naturally, that's for free.

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:34.860
 for free but if I make it wide enough to get your car out don't you think I'm

00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:39.340
 entitled to a little something extra? Well it may I ask why you are doing our

00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:44.760
 driveway? I made sort of a deal with Henry and Homer. You don't say? Yes sir

00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:49.020
 you look upset Mr. Aldrich. Upset? If you aren't naturally considering the

00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:52.820
 circumstances I wouldn't think of charging you full price. Well it won't be

00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:56.260
 necessary for you to clear our driveway. But Mr. Aldrich I made a bargain with the

00:13:56.260 --> 00:14:00.540
 boys. The boys were in no position to make such a bargain. You may go home

00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:02.540
 Well, Gee, if you say so, Mr. Alders.

00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:03.540
 I say so.

00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:05.540
 Well, if you say so, goodbye.

00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:06.540
 Goodbye.

00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:08.540
 If you ever need your pipe filling out or anything like that...

00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:11.540
 Yes, Willie, I have your card.

00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:13.540
 Goodbye.

00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:14.540
 Sam.

00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:16.540
 Yes, Will. I'm coming.

00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:18.540
 I can't figure out what...

00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:21.540
 Sam, you look awful. Did you fall down the front steps?

00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:23.540
 That would have been a pleasure.

00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:24.540
 What?

00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:28.540
 Well, the night Henry was born and I found out he was a boy.

00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:32.340
 I had to pinch myself to make sure it was true

00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:37.580
 But I never realized I'd go through life pinching myself for the same reason watch Henry done now

00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:41.880
 And it is known a Henry well you might as well sit down and start pinching yourself, too

00:14:56.500 --> 00:15:02.060
 And now while Mr. Albridge and Mr. Brown are pinching themselves, let's listen to

00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:04.860
 Meredith Wilson and his talking people.

00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:08.060
 "All information, information.

00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:11.660
 Meredith, we just love information."

00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:12.660
 "All you do?

00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:13.660
 Well, why may I ask?"

00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:14.660
 "Because it's so short."

00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:15.660
 "I see."

00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:25.240
 "Unless the

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:27.240
 Jell-O-Vanilla tapioca.

00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:29.240
 Jell-O-Vanilla tapioca.

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:31.240
 Jell-O-Vanilla tapioca.

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:33.240
 Jell-O-Vanilla tapioca.

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:35.240
 Jell-O-Vanilla tapioca.

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:37.240
 Rigg, two luscious vanilla.

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:39.240
 Jell-O-Chocolate tapioca.

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:41.240
 Candy, good chocolate.

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:43.240
 And Jell-O-Orange coconut tapioca.

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:45.240
 Tangy, refreshing orange combined with tropical coconut.

00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:47.240
 But, uh, I don't think you'll like them.

00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:49.240
 Oh, yes, we will.

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:51.240
 Oh, no, you won't.

00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:53.240
 Oh, yes, we will.

00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:59.520
 Okay, I guess you will. Everybody loves Jello Tabioca Pudding. Put them on tomorrow's shopping

00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:04.800
 list today. And remember the Big Red Letter stand for the whole Jello family of desserts.

00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:12.440
 J-D-L-L. Oh, the Big Red Letter stand for the Jello family. Oh, the Big Red Letter stand.

00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:20.560
 Oh, the Jello family. That's Jello. Jello, putting. Jello, that's the Oka pudding. Yes,

00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:23.560
 And now back to the Aldrich family.

00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:38.560
 Yes, getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldrich.

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:45.560
 Sam Aldrich and Will Brown have been shocked to learn that their sons have passed their snow shoveling on to Willie.

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:50.560
 And Henry and Homer have been tricked into whitewashing a cellar for Willy's end.

00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:54.560
 The scene opens in her cellar. It is that afternoon.

00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:56.560
 Henry, quiz!

00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:59.560
 What did you do again with the whitewash, Homer?

00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:01.560
 Sure you did, Dorneo.

00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:03.560
 My fourth brush splatters.

00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:06.560
 But look at my sweater. It's practically polka dotted.

00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:09.560
 Oh boy, it's even in my hair.

00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:12.560
 Homer, gray hair is very becoming on you.

00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:14.560
 Where do I lay my hands on Willy?

00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:17.440
 - Well, come on, we're practically through.

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:21.440
 Just a couple more feet of this ceiling and we're free men.

00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:23.400
 - Boys, how are you coming along?

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:25.200
 - Coming along, Mrs. Hopkins?

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:27.240
 Well, you might say we're there.

00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:28.640
 - You don't say.

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:31.480
 - Homer, your is quite as a sheet, are you, you?

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:34.160
 - No, ma'am, just whitewashed.

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:36.000
 So if you don't mind, Mrs. Hopkins,

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.920
 now that we've finished the whitewashing--

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:40.000
 - Don't you think you ought to take a little rest first?

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.760
 - Rest first?

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:44.440
 - Yes, before you start removing these ashes.

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:46.040
 What? What ashes?

00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:47.720
 There's a pile right over there.

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:49.160
 Just shovel them into those barrels.

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:49.720
 But, but, but,

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:52.600
 And remember, when you've done with that, come upstairs.

00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:54.360
 I got something for ya.

00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:56.600
 Henry, did she say ashes?

00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:57.240
 Yeah.

00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:58.680
 That whole pile?

00:17:58.680 --> 00:17:59.240
 Yeah.

00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:00.840
 Into those six barrels?

00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:01.480
 Uh-huh.

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:02.520
 If I'm going home.

00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:04.200
 Homer, wait.

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:07.880
 Henry, I'm not gonna kill myself at this stage in my life.

00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:11.000
 But don't you realize Mrs. Hopkins might give us something?

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.520
 Henry, money isn't every.

00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:15.560
 Besides, we made a bargain with Willie Hillsoula.

00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:18.520
 Let him all sue him right back out of my way.

00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:20.200
 Homer, look out for the white wash!

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:22.760
 Oh boy.

00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:23.720
 Homer.

00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:25.960
 She was looking my shoes.

00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:28.440
 Now I've got one black one and one white one.

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:33.160
 Homer, why don't you put your other shoe in the bucket?

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:34.920
 You think I want to look ridiculous?

00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:37.720
 Oh boy!

00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:39.560
 What? Yes Mrs. Hopkins?

00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:40.760
 I forgot to laugh.

00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:43.400
 Can either of you change a $20 bill?

00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:45.320
 Twenty? Twenty?

00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:47.320
 Yes, I need $5.50.

00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:49.000
 Oh boy.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:50.360
 Gee, you was.

00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:52.600
 No, we can't, Mrs. Hopkins.

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:54.200
 Oh, well I'll get it somewhere.

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:55.160
 Thanks anyway.

00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:56.120
 Henry, did you hear that?

00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:57.720
 She's giving us $5.50.

00:18:57.720 --> 00:18:59.560
 Did it sound like that to you too?

00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:02.040
 Oh boy, let me add those ashes.

00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:03.480
 Then you're not quitting me.

00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:04.440
 Are you crazy?

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:06.120
 Not a boy, Homer.

 You know, Sam, snow was never this heavy when I was a boy.

00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:29.680
 Careful, Will, you're spilling it down my galoshes.

00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:35.680
 Wouldn't it be better for their characters if we got into your car and tracked them down and put them back on the job?

00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:39.680
 No, Will. This way we'll show them how easily the job could have been done.

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:44.680
 - It only applied themselves. - Yes, but naturally I don't propose to let them off Scott Free.

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:49.680
 We'll charge them for doing their work for them and take it out of their allowances.

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:52.680
 Say, that's a good idea, Sam. How much do we charge?

00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:55.680
 Oh, I'd say about 30 cents an hour would be a sharp lesson to them.

00:19:55.680 --> 00:20:01.680
 30? I can't work for that kind of money. Let's make it 50 and really teach them a lesson.

00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:03.680
 We'll start shoveling.

00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:05.680
 Sam, now what?

00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:07.680
 You think Henry's right.

00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:09.680
 Right, what about?

 The sun coming out tomorrow.

00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:13.680
 Now will.

 - Listen, Mrs. Hopkins is gonna pay us $5.50, right?

00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:45.880
 - Yeah.

00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:47.840
 - Just as soon as we get these barrels of ashes

00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:49.120
 out to the curb, right?

00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:49.960
 - Yeah.

00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:51.800
 - How else can we get them out there?

00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:54.640
 - Henry, do you realize Mrs. Hopkins driveways

00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:56.320
 twice as long as yours?

00:20:56.320 --> 00:21:01.320
 Sure I realize it now. Start shoveling this snow or we'll never get done.

00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:23.220
 Are we moving, Will?

00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:26.120
 No you, Sam. Your car wheels just keep spinning.

00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:28.200
 at the high peak.

00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:31.480
 Here we are stuck in a ditch miles from nowhere.

00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:33.120
 Well, you shouldn't have told me to take that short.

00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:35.800
 Now, Sam, don't go blaming everything on me.

00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:38.160
 Besides, things aren't hopeless.

00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:41.280
 Once we get moving and get our hands on that flame forward,

00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:43.920
 those driveways will be a sense.

00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:45.200
 Hey, Will.

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:46.040

00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:47.520
 It's a snowplow, Sam.

 Hey.

00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:50.240
 Hello there.

00:21:57.180 --> 00:21:59.400
 And, gosh, what are you doing on that plow?

00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:01.720
 - Driving it? - In the junk business?

00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:03.280
 - Not anymore.

00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:05.440
 Sheila decided to retire.

 - Sheila? - Yeah, my heart.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.980
 She's been pulling that junk wagon,

00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:12.480
 man and boy, for 15 years.

00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:16.240
 Then, one day last month, she told me she was going to up and retire.

00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:18.140
 - She told you? - Yeah.

00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:20.360
 Me and Sheila was pretty close, you know.

 After 15 years in the junk business,

00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:25.480
 Yes, you just couldn't take it anymore.

 - Yes, and could you haul us out of this ditch?

 - Oh, yeah.

 - Fine.

 not the proprietor.

 - Yes, how much?

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:51.400
 - Well, now, first, I'd like to point out

00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:54.040
 that this ain't no ordinary plow that you're hiring.

00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:54.960
 Yes, I know.

 $5 saying?

 Why, it has a nice ring.

 $10?

 Henry, now are you gonna get it?

00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:58.140
 Mary, your father sounds as though he could use a glass of hot milk, too.

00:24:58.140 --> 00:25:00.840
 But, Mother, just when he's going to Mary, please get it.

00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:04.740
 My goodness, I might as well be an outsider in this family.

00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:06.140
 I see your home, Henry.

00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:09.140
 Yes, Father, and Father, as soon as my mittens throw out,

00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:11.240
 I'm gonna get started on the driveway.

00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:12.040
 Don't bother.

00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:14.740
 Sam, before you fly off the handle, why don't you?

00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:17.480
 Sam, are you taking off your jacket?

00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:18.880
 Father, if I don't make any happier,

00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:21.640
 I won't even wait for my mittens to thaw.

00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:22.920
 I'll start right now.

00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:25.720
 Enray the driveway is cleared.

00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:26.720
 It is?

00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:28.640
 Sam, are you rolling up your sleeve?

00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:29.480
 I am.

00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:31.520
 Father, if you're worried that I haven't learned my lesson,

00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:33.840
 she was I give you my work.

00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:36.760
 Father, you're rolling up both your sleeves.

00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:37.600
 I am.

00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:38.440
 And now Sam?

00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:41.820
 Would you please go up to our bathroom and get something for me?

00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:43.820
 You mean your razor strap?

00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:45.820
 I mean the Linamans.

00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:46.820
 Sam.

00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:50.420
 No, I never remembered snow being that heavy.

00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:52.580
 Oh, gee, Father, then you're not...

00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:54.860
 Henry, suppose you run upstairs and get the Linamans.

00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:56.900
 Yes, Father, and I give you my word.

00:25:56.900 --> 00:25:59.500
 From now on, I'm gonna pitch into everything.

00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:01.740
 Yes, well, now let's not overdo it.

00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:04.900
 Sam, I thought you controlled yourself beautifully.

00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:07.620
 Alice, I couldn't very well blame Henry.

00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:14.720
 when... Yes, son. Alice, suppose we just forget it. Yes, dear. Did you do the whole

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:21.560
 driveway yourself? I had it done, Alice, by Gus. Gus? At a slight additional cost.

00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:27.460
 But how did he do it so quickly? He had the widest snowplow in the state. What?

00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:33.600
 Ever mind, Alice. But you know that fence between our driveway and kilmers? Yes.

00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:38.600
 What would you think if we removed it and widened our driveway three feet?

00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:56.600
 Boy, Willy Boy, are you a swindler tricking us into doing all that work at your aunt, Mildred?

00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:58.600
 I'll say, Willy Boy.

00:26:58.600 --> 00:26:59.600
 Who's a swindler?

00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:00.600
 Who's a swindler?

00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:02.600
 I got that idea right out of a schoolbook.

00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:04.200
 So that makes it perfectly legal.

00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:05.200
 What?

00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:07.800
 Sure, that one about a guy whitewashing a fence.

00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:10.600
 Only, of course, I had a spruce up the idea, some.

00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:13.100
 Well, ladies, when it comes to jello,

00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:17.100
 whether you spruce it up with extra fixings or serve it just as is,

00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:20.700
 that rich fruit-like jello is always tops and treats.

00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:24.600
 Yes, those luscious shimmering jello desserts are lovely to look at

00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:27.200
 and grand to eat in all six flavors.

00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:30.600
 Strawberry, raspberry, cherry, orange, lemon, and lime.

00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:34.440
 Every jello flavor has that famous locked-in goodness.

00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:37.400
 Flavors sealed right in by a special process,

00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:41.080
 so it can't get out till your first delectable spoonful.

00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:45.240
 No wonder jello tastes so good it makes you think of the real ripe fruit.

00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:49.320
 No wonder jello is America's favorite gelatin dessert.

00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:51.800
 Look for those big red letters on the box.

00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:55.240
 Those big red letters stand for the jello family.

00:27:55.240 --> 00:28:04.920

 For 39 years now, the Boy Scouts of America has carried on a program of character building and citizenship training.

00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:20.520
 So this coming week, we salute 2,200,000 Boy Scouts as they go forward with their crusade to strengthen the arm of liberty.

00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:24.920
 The more scouts we have today, the better citizens we'll have tomorrow.

00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:43.720
 The Old Rich family starring Ezra Stone is Henry with Jackie Kalka's Homer,

00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:48.440
 is written by Norman Tokar and Ed Joris with music by Jack Miller.

00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:59.440
 Mr. and Mrs. Aldrich are House Jamison and Catherine Roth. And this is Dan Seymour in New York saying, "The Aldrich family is brought to you by the Jell-O family."

00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:14.440
 Everyone's a Jell-O good fellow, a very good Jell-O good fellow, so rich, so tempting and mellow. J-E-L-L-O.

00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:21.440

00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:28.440
