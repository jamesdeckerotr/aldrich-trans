 [Music]

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 Some weeks ago our listeners were made acquainted with young Ezra Stone.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
 Meeting member of the cast of the judge have a comedy success, thought of life,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
 and a scene from that play.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.800
 The occasion was pleasant. Some joy in fact that we commissioned Kevin Dole Smith, author of What A Life,

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:43.200
 to ride a new sketch based on the same patterns. Chief of which is Henry Aldrich, age 17, and constantly in hot water.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:50.400
 Your head was out now with Lea Pemun, Betty Field, and Clyde Fillmore supporting Mr. Stone.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:55.400
 as a stone in the early life of Henry Aldrich.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:05.400
 [Music]

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:14.400
 The time 7.30 in the morning, the place the Aldrich home, located in any American town.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.000
 As our coven rises, Henry, son of the house,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 is apparently on the wrong side of a door,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.400
 as he greets the day with a mean determinant song.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.400
 [SINGING]

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:34.400
 Henry Eldrich.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.400
 [SINGING]

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.400
 Yes, Father?

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.400
 How much longer do you want to be in that bathroom?

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.400
 I'm practically small now.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.400
 Oh, don't say so.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:47.440
 I'm the case of none of the other members of this family kid who was what's that father nothing just hurry up and get out of there

00:01:47.440 --> 00:02:02.520
 Not bothered me

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.760
 Yeah, well, oh go away

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.520
 I didn't even know when Harriet was here.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:11.520
 Well, she is.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.520
 You arrived in the night.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.520
 Well, well, well.

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.520
 I have a no parent to be here.

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.520
 That is a no parent to be here.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.520
 That is a no parent to be here.

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.520
 That is a no parent to be here.

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.520
 That is a no parent to be here.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.520
 That is a no parent to be here.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.520
 That is a no parent to be here.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.520
 That is a no parent to be here.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.520
 That is a no parent to be here.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.520
 That is a no parent to be here.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.520
 What do you want?

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.020
 Honey, my vanishing cream is right there on the glass shelf.

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:44.020
 There is an enigmatic vanishing cream on the glass shelf.

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.020
 Evidently, it must have vanished.

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.020
 [LAUGHTER]

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.020
 It isn't 8 o'clock yet, while I be saying by 9.

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:51.020
 [LAUGHTER]

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.020
 I can tell you one thing you'll be saying,

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:54.520
 if you're not afraid, I can get out of there.

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.520
 Dad, please, I can give you my vanishing cream.

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:58.520
 [LAUGHTER]

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:59.520
 There it is.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.020
 My gosh.

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:02.520
 You're welcome.

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.020
 Mary?

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:05.020
 Yes, Mother?

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.420
 Did I hear him the order come out of that bathroom?

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.420
 You did, but he went back in again.

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.820
 He just came out to see what months it was.

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.420
 [LAUGHTER]

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.720
 When he comes out, he'll hear him all over the scene.

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.620
 He made a clothing you were asking what he gave to the car

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.620
 to the electric toaster.

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:22.620
 Henry?

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.620
 Well, he wants to know what he did with the car to the toaster.

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.220
 Ask him to watch the toaster.

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.220
 So the only toaster we had.

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.520
 He took the car down in the basement for something last night.

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:34.360
 What's that?

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.200
 Henry!

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.720
 What did you do with the cord?

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.480
 I didn't do anything with it!

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:39.880
 I can fix it!

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:40.540
 I think...

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:41.540
 You think?

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.440
 That's a pretty picture!

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.280
 We can't wash our own bathroom!

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.480
 And we can't even have toast for breakfast!

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.760
 We might all be living in a restaurant!

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.720
 Shaggy!

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.680
 Now watch, sweetheart!

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.040
 Please hand me some of my facial tissues!

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.240
 You're hand me this!

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:59.200
 Hand me that!

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.480
 No wonder I can't get anything done!

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.480
 What do you think I do work here?

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:08.480
 If you ever do any work, it'll have to be in there.

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.480
 After all, if you want to take possession of that, please, you've got to take some of the responsibility to go with it.

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:17.480
 Listen, I'll give you your face and watch him of course, if you'll go get me my neck tie.

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:21.480
 So, that's what you've been doing in there. You're dressing!

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.480
 Father, please get him out of there!

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:25.480
 Just how would you go about it?

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.480
 I don't know, but it must be some way.

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:28.480
 You should talk.

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:32.480
 You watch everything you want in here three times a day.

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.480
 [laughter]

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:38.480
 And if I want to watch no more than my right hand,

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.480
 the whole family jumps on me.

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.480
 Anybody thinks that anybody else under this fair point

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.480
 was committing a major offense.

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.480
 [squeaking]

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:51.480
 Say you're right. What'd you do? Get your left hand with?

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:52.480
 Is that so?

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.480
 Here, look out. I want to speak to you.

00:04:55.480 --> 00:05:06.720
 I'm calling you for. Why did this entirely aside from the issue? What did you do with

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:11.560
 a lawnmower when you finished with it yesterday? I didn't do anything with it. I put it right

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.120
 back in the garage. I see. Yes sir.

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:21.560
 I'm calling you for you. Henry Alvarish. Yes, Father. The next time I'm speaking to you,

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.560
 I'm sorry, I thought you were finished.

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:28.560
 Supposing you look at the bathroom window and see what you see the same thing I just saw.

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.560
 Out the bathroom window?

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.560
 You're in the bathroom, aren't you?

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.560
 Yes.

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:35.560
 Holy gee.

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.560
 Why don't you think I'm the one that left that out there?

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:39.560
 No.

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:40.560
 A point of the lawn.

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.560
 I got up in the middle of the night and went out there under its own power.

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.560
 You don't think you could have left it out there, do you, Father?

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.560
 I could have left it out there.

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:53.120
 I could have left it out there and they just paid two dollars and a half to have that machine started.

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:57.040
 Did that guy charge two dollars and a half of a lousy job he did?

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:00.440
 Well, I too thought leaving it out in the rain would improve what he did.

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.200
 Oh, I'll pay for it.

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:03.280
 I'll have what?

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:06.360
 If you've got any money coming, suppose that you pay me with your own me.

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:07.160
 Sure.

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.240
 That's a nice way to start the day.

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:14.000
 Go around reminding everybody of the death failure, even before they're watched.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.360
 Well, if I remember correctly, your hands were in any too clean when you asked to borrow that money

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:23.960
 from me. Mary, is Henry still working you live? I don't know whether he's still

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:28.560
 watching or not but he's certainly still in there. I'm practically thrown now.

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:32.820
 Henry, yes, ma'am. When you took that call down to the basement last night's

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:36.960
 thoughts, did you do with it? What do you mean why I do with it? Whatever it was,

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:41.160
 you paid for it. I want to know how the excuse of the elliptic I thought happened

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:46.560
 to be burned out. Holy Jesus, that's not flash one.

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:48.560
 Then you do know something about it.

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:51.560
 Is this the only place where that has of importance can be discussed?

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:55.560
 After all, I am supposed to go downtown sometime this morning

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:58.560
 When I arrive at the office I would at least like to have my hair combed.

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:01.560
 Would you like to have these subjects come under the door, John?

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:05.560
 Yes, please do. I can make my apartment out in the hallway.

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:09.560
 Did he say he did want me to or he didn't want me to?

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:14.560
 You wait young man until you're taught to learn to be unched back to the stand of all night.

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:21.880
 Yeah, hmm, the guy in shoes was really warm and the cream of his coffee has sour. You are the sour cream in my car

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:27.540
 And we all we can come out of that bathroom and run over the car and get your father some cream

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:33.280
 What condition you're in you come out of there? I got to do something about this

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:42.480
 I am oh father you back of course. I'm back. Have you finally finished?

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:45.880
 Just the old homesteader, or that he's grown too interested

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:46.980
 since he went in there.

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:48.480
 - Maria, there he is!

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:51.480
 - Uh, could I have some money, Father?

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:52.780
 What are we going to do, Charge?

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:54.280
 You mean we're going to that bathroom?

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:57.280
 (audience laughs)

00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:01.480
 I've got to have enough money to get a bottle of cream before.

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:04.180
 - Something happened to the ice box last night,

00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:07.080
 but you haven't any idea what the trouble was.

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:08.080
 - Sure.

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:09.480
 - Well, I guess it was my fault, Father,

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:11.580
 and I shouldn't you pay for the cream out of your own money.

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:14.020
 Well, I guess I should.

00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:16.580
 Could you pay me that 75 cents,

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:19.260
 you owe me for carrying out the ashes last winter?

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:20.100
 Mary.

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:21.620
 - I won't be but a minute, Father.

00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:23.420
 - Can you imagine that?

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:24.900
 Now respect it all.

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:29.060
 - Henry, you left your Roman history book in here.

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:30.900
 - Well, don't lose my place.

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:33.900
 (audience laughing)

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:39.540
 And another thing, Henry,

00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:40.940
 I hope that one of these days

00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:44.620
 assume a few responsibilities after all when you take the card of the toaster

00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:47.780
 downstairs we're ready not to bring it back up when you're through with it I

00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:51.860
 thought I did you thought you did I suppose you thought the icebox would run

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:56.740
 with a fuse blown out I suppose you thought that the one more you know what

00:08:56.740 --> 00:09:01.580
 you did last night you put the code of the toaster on the flash I am and then

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:06.220
 let it plugged in all night no wonder the icebox fuse is blown out yes and I get

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:10.860
 the blame for it haven't you started wet Henry I'm just starting now but I

00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:12.860
 I asked the father to take a look out the back window.

00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:15.860
 I wonder whether he realizes he left the lawn mower out all night.

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:17.860
 When did I leave the lawn mower out all night?

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:19.860
 Oh, when did you see?

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:22.860
 I saw you go round to the garage myself and get it out right out the window.

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:24.860
 I've explained if I didn't.

00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:27.860
 Could I keep the change to this dollar phone?

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:28.860
 Henry!

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:29.860
 Now what?

00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:31.860
 Where'd you put this out?

00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:33.860
 I didn't put it anyplace.

00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:34.860
 There wasn't any soap.

00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:37.860
 That's a terrible little dixie.

00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:49.860
 [Music]

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:52.860
 This coming week, try the delicious coffee.

00:09:52.860 --> 00:10:02.860
