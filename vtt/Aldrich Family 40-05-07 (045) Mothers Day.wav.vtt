00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.000
 [Music]

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 And we have milk!

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
 Come on, mother!

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
 [Applause]

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:29.000
 [Music]

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:41.840
 The Old Witch family starring as the stone written by Clifford Goldsmith brought to you

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.600
 by the puddings that are tops in taste.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:45.600
 Yellow pudding.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:01:11.400
 They say the happiest years of your life are the teens.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.400
 But I know one person who has his doubts about that.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.740
 Henry Aldrich.

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.080
 Henry has all the troubles and growing pains

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.000
 that most boys go through under high school days.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.160
 For Henry is a typical American boy.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.000
 Tonight out in Centerville, the Aldrichs

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.080
 are just having dinner and are seen

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.000
 open from the dining room of the Aldrich Hope.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.320
 Have another lamb chop, are they?

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:37.960
 No, thank you.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.320
 You want anything?

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.440
 Sam, I'm so tired of planning meals

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.600
 and cooking meals I don't know what to do.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.400
 - Chop their off, they're good, mother.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.300
 - Yes, Mary.

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.240
 - Say, say, who do you think I was just talking to on the phone?

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.080
 - Who, Henry?

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.080
 - Kathleen.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.580
 - The folks want me to come over for dinner Saturday night.

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:54.580
 - Tomorrow night?

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.440
 - Sure, ain't that a break for you, mother?

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:57.440
 - Why for me?

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.120
 - Well, if I'm not here, you can just have any old things for dinner.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.600
 (dinner whirring)

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:02.880
 - What do you mean, she can?

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.240
 - I've got to go out in the kitchen and whip some cream.

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.960
 - I'll be playing the table, mother.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.600
 - Boy, can you imagine?

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.360
 - We're not here the rest of us invited, Henry.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.700
 He didn't mention any of you.

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.360
 Goodness knows the Anderson's have been here, often enough.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.880
 Mary, is that very kind?

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.760
 Well, Father, get them by and Henry,

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.000
 hardly any way to put off a social debt.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.240
 Henry, would you be disappointed if you didn't go to Kathleen?

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.280
 Not go.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.440
 Have you forgotten what they've done to you?

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.280
 Sunday?

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.440
 Sunday.

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.140
 It's Mother's Day.

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.520
 Oh, but Father, I'm just going for dinner Saturday night.

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.320
 Well, I'd plan to take your mother and you and Mary

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.120
 out to dinner Saturday as a Mother's Day celebration.

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.020
 You had, Father?

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.560
 No, it's up to you as to where you'd rather go.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.120
 Oh, see, I don't want to offend Mother, but I--

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.520
 You'd rather go to Kathleen?

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.720
 Well, I don't know.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.720
 So hard thing to decide.

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.640
 It isn't every day that mothers have a day.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.360
 Hey, you're coming this way when you bring your place?

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.640
 I'm not coming that way, Mary.

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:07.880
 What would you like to do?

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.600
 Well, I'll phone Kathleen.

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.680
 Yeah, sure, I'd love to go with you.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.840
 Well, I guess I ought to get mother something nice, don't you think?

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.160
 Lend it.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.960
 Would you care to contribute anything toward it?

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.200
 [LAUGHTER]

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.480
 I'd like to contribute.

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:23.600
 I'll tell you what.

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.920
 Let it be a present from the entire family.

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.240
 It seems to me, son, you should have saved up for this occasion.

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.160
 I have, Father.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.360
 I have.

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.040
 I've earned nearly $5.

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.760
 Only I hate to see it all go at once.

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.280
 [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.320
 I'm not through with my plate, Mary.

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.080
 I'm not through with that either.

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.580
 You may take my plate, Mary.

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:43.820
 Thank you, Father.

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:45.680
 You're glad somebody in this house cooperates.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.020
 Father, Father, how do you think Mother would like to have me get her a new dress?

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:51.020
 A dress?

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:52.020
 Sure.

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:53.920
 I don't see what would be so difficult about it.

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.240
 All I have to do is get Mother down to the store and just happen to take her by the dress

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:59.240
 department.

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:00.240
 And what?

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.260
 And as we go by, I say, "See, Mother, look."

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.360
 And she'll say, "Oh, isn't that one swell?"

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.200
 And I've got it all picked out.

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.800
 But supposing she picks one of the more expensive dresses.

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.800
 Well, I wouldn't mind this sacrifice.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.000
 I just assumed spend the whole $5.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.800
 [GUNSHOT]

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.600
 I think I ought to do something for Mother.

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.200
 She-- she-- she puts up with a-- with an awful lot from us.

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.200
 Hey, honey.

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.000
 Mother wants to know what you drank in milk this afternoon.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.200
 Just one glass, Mary.

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.200
 Well, what you drank was cream.

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.700
 Cream?

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.200
 Cream?

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.200
 I thought that was awful rich when I drank it.

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.200
 Now, isn't one stock out there to whip?

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:41.720
 She was well what color on Sunday. I'll make up for everything. Give me while I

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:48.160
 pick this. I'm not through with that plate. I've got my chop in my hand.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.680
 I have your bread and butter plate. But you're not to come any closer than that.

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:57.360
 And Henry will you please eat your choppers you should. But Father I waste

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:02.680
 so much when I eat it politely. Mary you wouldn't like to go in on something

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:07.000
 real nice for Mother's Day would you? I'd plan to get Mother something alone Henry.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.200
 What? A blouse. A blouse Mary? A blouse? Mm-hmm. No skirt.

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:20.520
 My goodness I'm gonna pay nearly 395 for it as it is. 395? Just for that and nothing below it?

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:29.480
 You lost the bias skirt? Well how much would one come to? The very cheapest would be 295. What?

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:30.480
 Yes.

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:33.480
 I wonder whether Mother wouldn't like to go to the movies instead.

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.480
 I'm coming Mother.

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:37.480
 Father, there's an awfully good movie this week.

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:39.480
 Oh, what is it?

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:41.480
 The cowboy returns.

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:42.480
 Yes.

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:44.480
 I didn't even be willing to blow the whole family to her.

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:48.480
 Well first don't you think you'd better make sure the cowboy returns is what your mother wants to see?

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:50.480
 Well I would have her choice.

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:55.480
 You know Father, if we didn't go to an expensive place, I could almost take the whole family to dinner too.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.480
 I think the movies will be sufficient.

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:00.480
 Oh no, Father, I know of a place where it's very reasonable.

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:02.480
 I'd be glad to take all of you. How about it?

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.480
 How did you make room for this dessert?

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:06.480
 Mary, Mother can't hear me out there, can't she?

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:08.480
 Mother, is she even speaking to you?

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:11.480
 She isn't, Mary? She will.

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:14.480
 How would you like to go to the movies Mother's Day Eve?

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:15.480
 What's that, Henry?

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:18.480
 Saturday night. I mean it. We're all going to the movies and to dinner.

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:20.480
 - As my guest. - Really?

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:22.480
 - As Father. - Is right, Mary.

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:26.480
 That's wonderful. Because I was going to take Mother down to get that blouse.

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.480
 Now we can meet you right afterwards.

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:31.080
 Boy, there isn't anything Mother likes more than a party.

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:32.680
 Here's your dessert, Santa.

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:34.880
 You want any cream as Henry saw it.

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:38.880
 When Mother that cream I drank was in a picture.

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:40.680
 Look, of course it was in a picture.

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:43.880
 What, do you mind if I change the subject of cream just a second?

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:45.280
 Mm, to what?

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:47.280
 What are you doing Saturday night?

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:49.280
 Dear, I'm probably cooking dinner.

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:50.280
 D'yaar?

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:52.680
 We're all going to meet downtown for something.

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:53.680
 For what?

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.680
 Don't tell her, Mary.

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:57.120
 Where should we meet?

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:01.360
 At the employee and department store at 4.45.

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:03.120
 It's all set, 4.45.

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:06.320
 That's going to make it terribly late for me to get home and cook dinner.

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:08.320
 Don't worry about cooking dinner, mother.

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:09.680
 But what are we going to do?

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:13.520
 She wears you wet. You're going to have one of the smallest times you ever had in your life.

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:31.520
 [Music]

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:33.520
 Oh, pardon me, sir.

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:34.520
 What is it, lady?

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:37.520
 Have you seen anyone waiting here at the entrance to the Emporium?

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:38.520
 No ma'am, not recently.

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:40.520
 Oh, thank you very much.

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:42.960
 Here it is, 12 minutes after five.

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:44.480
 I don't mind waiting so much.

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:46.840
 I just keep wondering if they haven't been in an accident.

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:47.680
 - Yes, ma'am.

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:48.520
 - It's a perfect way it is.

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:49.920
 - My fucking powers, lady.

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:50.760
 - No, thank you.

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:53.160
 - Wouldn't you like to buy some carnations for mother's day?

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:54.640
 - No, thank you.

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:56.400
 Well, you ought to remember your mother

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:58.560
 that telling anyone can do.

00:07:58.560 --> 00:07:59.400
 - Yeah.

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:02.560
 - And we've been waiting for a family

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:04.760
 one time, where she has to go see

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:07.080
 and say a family in action.

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:09.520
 - Boy, boy, can I have a piece of please?

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:10.360
 Here you are.

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:11.880
 One foot street is the family live.

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:13.600
 It's nobody in this town.

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:15.040
 Then I swivel need the paper.

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:15.880
 Excellent.

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:17.160
 Great place for our entrance.

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:18.000
 Alice.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.280
 Alice, why have you been waiting here at this entrance?

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:22.000
 Sam, where on earth do you think I'd wait?

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.760
 Well, I've been standing around the corner.

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:25.520
 That's not the main entrance, Sam.

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:27.920
 Well, Alice, that is certainly the main entrance on that street.

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:30.240
 Well, at least you'll say that's something.

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:32.120
 The thing for us to worry about is my car.

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:33.080
 What's happened to that?

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:36.400
 I left it 30 minutes ago in a 15 minute parking phase.

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:39.040
 But that still isn't as important as Henry and Mary.

00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:41.680
 They're probably at the entrance all the way around on market.

00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:43.480
 Well go around and look.

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:44.240
 Where will you be?

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:45.240
 I'll wait right here.

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:46.720
 I won't move one foot.

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:47.440
 Ready.

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:49.160
 I can buy a box can if I'm other than.

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:49.960
 No thank you.

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:51.760
 The hand dips and carry film.

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:52.760
 No thank you.

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:53.760
 I can pay for my.

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:55.240
 No thank you.

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:56.960
 Thanks Carc Red for his carry.

00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:57.960
 For your mother.

00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:00.560
 He wished you were the will of your bin.

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:02.640
 Right here where I was supposed to be Henry.

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:03.600
 Imagine that.

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:04.440
 Where have you been?

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:05.840
 Just inside the door.

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:07.880
 Why dear did you wait in there?

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:12.120
 But mother, I think the inside of a door would be the only logical place to wait for someone.

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:14.120
 Couldn't you have at least looked outside?

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:15.880
 I finally didn't, Mary, you were.

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:17.800
 Where's Mary?

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:19.080
 I had no idea where.

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:20.360
 Where's her father?

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:23.720
 Your father's gone down to the market, street entrance, to see where you are.

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:24.360
 I?

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:25.640
 Why would he look for me there?

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:27.560
 Well, dear, you take me right here, were you?

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:28.920
 From where I was here.

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:34.680
 Oh, I don't mean to argue with you, but all that's been separating us is that door.

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:35.480
 Yes, Henry.

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:41.080
 Now, supposing you take this nickel and go inside and telephone and see where the Mary has left the house here.

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:41.720
 Yes, Mother.

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:43.960
 Tell her the store closes at five-thirty.

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:44.460
 Yes.

00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:47.800
 Extra space for a young child, this is a fear.

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:49.360
 Boy, boy!

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:50.720
 What am I currently like?

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:52.320
 Where have you been, Mary?

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:54.400
 You're going and dropping this as I was reading.

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:55.800
 I thought he never would die.

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:56.840
 What's he?

00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:58.040
 He'll go in and do our shopping.

00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:00.360
 Well, not until Henry and your father get back.

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:01.280
 Where are they?

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:02.520
 Henry's phoning you.

00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:04.760
 And your father's waiting for you around the market.

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:06.960
 Isn't that ridiculous mother?

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:08.360
 It's completely easy.

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:09.560
 What have we got to do now?

00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:11.260
 Wait for them until I get back.

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.060
 I'm afraid we have, dear.

00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:14.760
 Now at least one of us better.

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:18.360
 You stay right here while I go around and get your father.

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:20.760
 - What's in your father? - Of course I can find him.

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:22.560
 Now don't move until I get back.

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:24.060
 No mother.

00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:26.460
 - Pardon me, sir. - What do you have, lady?

00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:28.460
 On what floor are the blouses?

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:31.460
 Are they going inside of the elevator to get off on the third floor?

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:32.460
 Thank you.

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:36.380
 You suppose it would take me more than three minutes to run any that one?

00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:37.900
 After that I couldn't say.

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:39.820
 Dear, I wonder where...

00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:41.660
 Mary, Mary, where is your mother?

00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:43.580
 Mother, where did you come from?

00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:44.780
 What do you think I came from?

00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:46.860
 Mother, guess I went around after you!

00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:48.140
 Now, what did you do that for?

00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:49.980
 So we wouldn't have to wait so long.

00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:50.700
 Where's Henry?

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:52.300
 She gets our phone in me!

00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:54.300
 What's that?

00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:56.540
 Don't you think I ought to go in and tell him I'm here?

00:10:56.540 --> 00:10:58.140
 You wait where you are, I'll go in.

00:10:58.140 --> 00:10:59.140
 Yes, Father.

00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:00.140
 Flowers.

00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:01.140
 Flowers.

00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:02.140
 Some mother's day.

00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:03.140
 Press, Connie.

00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:04.140
 Um...

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:06.140
 Mother, I'm going to need another nickel.

00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:07.140
 She whizzed, Mary.

00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:08.140
 Where's mother?

00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:10.140
 She's gone after father.

00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:11.140
 Where's father?

00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:13.140
 She thought you were phony.

00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:14.140
 Yeah, but Mary, I couldn't get you.

00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:16.140
 Of course you couldn't.

00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:17.140
 I'll go get father.

00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:18.140
 How long will he be gone?

00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:19.140
 Two minutes.

00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:21.140
 And, oh, can't we?

00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:22.140
 So you're at the house.

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:23.140
 What did she want?

00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:26.140
 Henry, did you tell her you couldn't come to dinner?

00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:27.140
 Sure I did.

00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:28.140
 the message with the maid.

00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:30.140
 So, Kathleen, it's nothing new.

00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:31.140
 Well, she wished she couldn't be.

00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:33.140
 She's Perry Bell Candid for Mother's Day.

00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:36.140
 Listen, Mr. are you going to be here for a few minutes?

00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:37.140
 Uh, yeah.

00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:39.140
 Well, could you deliver a message for me?

00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:45.140
 If you see a lady or a man or my sister looking for a phone, a brown suit like this,

00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:48.140
 could you tell him I just stopped in to phone a second?

00:11:48.140 --> 00:12:05.140
 [Music]

00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:08.140
 Well now friends, while Henry is reflecting on his latest predicament,

00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:11.140
 I'd like to bring you a news item about something that happened the other night

00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:14.140
 in one of Centerville's finest families.

00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:19.140
 The headline reads, "Terminants Local Man Trapped in Raid."

00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:21.140
 And the article goes on to read,

00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:28.140
 "Last night, about 1130, one of Centerville's leading citizens was surprised by his wife,

00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:32.140
 just as he had tiptoeed to the kitchen, raided the refrigerator,

00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:35.140
 and finished eating a dish of pudding.

00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:38.140
 Jello butterscotch pudding that had been left over from dinner.

00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:43.140
 His wife was desolated, as she had been planning to eat the Jello butterscotch pudding today for lunch.

00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:48.420
 lunch but the culprit showed no remorse when questioned he merely kept repeating

00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:53.780
 I'm glad I did it yes and I do it again I simply can't resist yellow butter

00:12:53.780 --> 00:13:01.620
 but it's not putting well friends seriously that is just another way of saying

00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:06.580
 the jello butter scotch pudding is the dish that people won't be denied probably

00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:10.180
 it has something to do with the grand buttery brown sugar flavor of its well

00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:14.260
 dessert and the fact that Jello butterscotch pudding is as smooth as rich

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:19.360
 golden cream undoubtedly plays a big part in its appeal at any rate this

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:23.020
 mellow treat is a mealtime favorite in thousands of homes the country over and

00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:28.780
 I'm sure you'll find it's your favorite too so try some real soon you've honestly

00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:34.540
 never tasted the more luscious desserts than Jello butterscotch pudding

00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:46.540
 [Music]

00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:48.540
 Well now getting back to Henry Open.

00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:54.540
 Henry has just learned that although he's going out with his family, Kathleen is expecting him for dinner.

00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:57.540
 This scene opens in Kathleen Madison's home.

00:13:57.540 --> 00:13:59.540
 [Music]

00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:00.540
 Hello?

00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:02.540
 Hello?

00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:03.940
 Is that you, Kathleen?

00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:04.940
 No, tell me.

00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:08.140
 Did Mary tell you we were having dinner at seven instead of six thirty?

00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:08.640
 Yes.

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:10.040
 Didn't your maid tell you?

00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:12.040
 I'm going out for dinner with my mother.

00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:26.540
 -

00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:26.540
 -

00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:30.040
 -

00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:32.640
 What's the latest I could get there and still eat?

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:34.040
 Well, well...

00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:38.340
 Well, I guess when you stop the thing of a Catholic, maybe that would be trying to do too much.

00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:39.340
 Sadly?

00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:40.540
 Who are you talking?

00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:44.040
 Mother, can we all rely on Mother?

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:46.240
 Henry can't come next Saturday night.

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:47.040
 Oh, well, no.

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:48.540
 He's having dinner with his mother.

00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:50.340
 Why don't you all thought that he'd come?

00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:52.340
 Are you sure next Saturday night will be all right?

00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:53.840
 Oh, yes, of course.

00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:54.940
 Hello, Henry.

00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:55.640
 Yes?

00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:58.240
 Henry, my mother says to bring your mother too.

00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:02.240
 Well, Kathleen, what do I do with my father and marriage?

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:05.740
 What? Well, hold on. I'll take a second, Henry.

00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:09.240
 Mother, yes. Could we ask Mr. O'Riggin Mary, too?

00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:11.240
 Well, as a matter of fact, I think we should have them.

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:12.240
 Hello, Henry.

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:15.240
 Well, Mother, there's a ring of all families.

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:19.240
 Oh, Kathleen, I don't think you should go to all that trouble.

00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:23.240
 No, really, Henry. Mother, be very much offended if you didn't.

00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:27.240
 Well, they're waiting at the department store for me, I think.

00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:30.240
 If you don't hear from me, you'll know we're coming.

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:31.240
 Oh, I...

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:33.240
 You understand about the time, Henry?

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:36.240
 Oh, sure. Seven o'clock. Goodbye, Kathleen.

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:49.240
 [Music]

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:51.240
 Motherhood time in London.

00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:53.240
 Exactly. Twenty minutes past six.

00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:56.240
 You got me and say how long it would be for Henry got back?

00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:57.240
 No, dear.

00:15:57.240 --> 00:15:58.840
 And where'd Father go?

00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:00.840
 Your father went down the street to get the car.

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:02.940
 That was 35 minutes ago.

00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:04.940
 Would you like to have me get down and find him?

00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:05.540
 No, dear.

00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:08.340
 We're not going to break this family up again.

00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:11.940
 Well, I'm also sorry to store clothes

00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:13.540
 before I could get your blouse.

00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:15.340
 That's all right, dear.

00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:17.840
 Just as long as we all finally get back together.

00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:22.040
 That's the beginning of starting to rain.

00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:22.940
 Goodness.

00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:23.240
 Good.

00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:25.640
 The good thing we didn't buy any new clothes.

00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:29.640
 Yes, dear, although please remember, I still have on the best I own.

00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:33.640
 Come on, let's step back and be candid before you're grown.

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:37.640
 Well, we said one consolation. Well, I'm glad you can see one.

00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:42.640
 The restaurant we're going to after the movie says this. Well, please.

00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:46.640
 Look, look, look, there's your father. Let's run out and get in the car.

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:48.640
 Hurry up, Alice.

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:51.640
 Open the door, Sam. Get in, mother.

00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:53.640
 - Now, where's Henry? - We don't know, Sam.

00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:54.900
 Well get in and they are.

00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:56.340
 We can't go up and leave him.

00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:58.140
 How do you get it all wet?

00:16:58.140 --> 00:17:00.140
 They're going to forget something.

00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:01.640
 They can't talk to you about it.

00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:03.240
 Mother, what are you and Father God

00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:04.440
 heading off to here?

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:06.640
 Hello Mary, you get in and I'll say.

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:08.140
 Both of you get in.

00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:10.140
 Father, can't you come up close

00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:12.140
 to the curtain up that's calling your mark?

00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:13.640
 This is a narrow street Mary.

00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:15.640
 The only way that's calling can get around me

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:16.640
 is to go up on the sidewalk.

00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:18.140
 I'll get in. Come on Mary.

00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:19.140
 Hold the door.

00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:20.640
 Yes, Sam.

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:22.140
 Only what do we do now?

00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:23.480
 I got to get out of here.

00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:26.680
 Hey!

00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:27.880
 Get moving there!

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:31.320
 - Doesn't matter what the call is saying.

00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:32.320
 - Oh, not at all.

00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:36.760
 - What is the trouble?

00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:39.320
 - Mary must you just hit 10 enough questions.

00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:41.800
 Mary, so chat with the simple man.

00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:42.300
 - No.

00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:42.800
 - No.

00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:43.300
 - No.

00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:44.320
 I do not want to tell you no.

00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:44.800
 Stop it.

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:45.640
 OK, OK?

00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:47.640
 - You better call your father.

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:51.640
 - Is that our son?

00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:52.640
 It is.

00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:54.040
 No, thanks.

00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:55.240
 Heavens, we're moving.

00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:57.340
 Father, it's so soft.

00:17:57.340 --> 00:17:58.140
 Now what's the matter?

00:17:58.140 --> 00:17:58.840
 This isn't me.

00:17:58.840 --> 00:17:59.340
 Where?

00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:00.640
 Under that newspaper.

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:01.140
 What?

00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:02.140
 Father!

00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:05.640
 Please, Father, it's so soft.

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:07.140
 I can't stop here.

00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:08.640
 Come on, Father!

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:11.140
 Come on, everybody!

00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:13.940
 Oh, here's a place I can pull in.

00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:14.940
 Father!

00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:16.140
 Wait for me!

00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:18.040
 Wait until I tell you the good news.

00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:19.140
 No time for good news.

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:20.140
 Get in the car.

00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:22.220
 Could you move over Mary?

00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:24.980
 Henry, why didn't you leave that wet newspaper outside?

00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:26.500
 Oh, see where?

00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:28.340
 Wait until I tell you the news.

00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:30.860
 Henry, oh, did you simply soak to the skin?

00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:33.940
 Mother, this is gonna be a swell Mother's Day yet.

00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:36.580
 We've all got an invitation to go to Kathleen's for dinner.

00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:37.540
 Really, Mother?

00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:38.380
 Sure.

00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:39.260
 Maybe older to be couldn't have.

00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:41.780
 The Mother, I just got through talking with Kathleen.

00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:44.060
 Henry, is this the water all over me?

00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:47.020
 Well, I can't help where it runs, Mary.

00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:48.660
 The only thing I can do with Fitz, still,

00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:49.900
 and let it go where it wants.

00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:51.400
 (car engine revving)

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:52.400
 How about it, Mo?

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:54.240
 - Anyway, they couldn't have asked us for tonight.

00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:56.080
 - Mother, Kathleen stood there by the phone

00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:58.240
 and begged just to come tonight.

00:18:58.240 --> 00:18:59.160
 - What do you think, Sam?

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:00.800
 - Don't leave it up to him, Mother.

00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:02.320
 This is your party.

00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:04.640
 Up to now, you haven't had a good time at all,

00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:06.960
 but this way you could have a wonderful evening.

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:09.720
 - What are you gonna do with all the money, you save, Henry?

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:11.640
 - I'm not going to save a cent, Mary.

00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:13.560
 I've got it all figured out.

00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:15.480
 I'm getting Mother address with my money.

00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:17.600
 - Well, Sam, pull up someplace in our telephone

00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:18.440
 and make sure.

00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:20.940
 Mother, if you're phone or you'll only be wasting your neck on...

00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:22.840
 Well, are we? Aren't we going?

00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:24.540
 What do you think, Sam?

00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:25.740
 It's up to you, Alice.

00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:28.340
 Mother, they always have awfully good food at the end.

00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:30.740
 Of course they do, dear. I love to go there.

00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:31.940
 And there you are.

00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:33.140
 I'll make up your mind, Alice.

00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:34.640
 Sam, I don't like Mother.

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:37.240
 How many Mother's days are there in a year?

00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:38.140
 One, one, one.

00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:39.540
 Go on, go on there.

00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:42.240
 Yes, Officer, we're just making up our minds.

00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:43.240
 Well, I'd like to tell...

00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:43.940
 How are you?

00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:45.240
 We're going to go on.

00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:46.740
 Yes, sir.

00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:48.240
 I guess, Officer, we are.

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:50.640
 Oh, hey, Father, I got to be angry.

00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:52.720
 And boy, am I hungry here.

00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:54.480
 Not any hungry other than I am.

 Can I help you with the biggest?

00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:19.880
 Oh, no, no, thank you. They're all wiped and put away.

00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:22.480
 Anybody seen the evening papers?

00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:24.280
 It's in the big chair, Carter.

 Ah, I've been looking forward to just sitting around tonight.

00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:31.280
 Robert, do you want Kathleen to go out and get your slippers?

00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:32.880
 Oh, dear, I got them on.

00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:35.480
 Where did I put my necktie?

 Oh, in the land.

 Oh, yes, yes.

 Oh, I always did like this, dear.

00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:44.680
 Now, Kathleen, I want you to go out and do your homework.

 I'll be right there.

00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:08.760
 Robert, would you mind opening the window just linked to?

00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:10.760
 You see, we had fake and onions for dinner,

00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:14.060
 and I'm fed the whole family to be the same.

00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:17.160
 Fake and onion?

00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:18.960
 Do you like some, Henry?

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:21.760
 Oh boy, do I.

00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:24.460
 Mother's very fond of them, too.

00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:25.760
 Alice, I want to show you something.

00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:28.360
 This box, Kathleen gave me for Mother's Day.

00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:29.560
 Isn't that lovely?

00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:30.860
 Why is it, Mrs. Andy's?

00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:32.960
 I have no idea, Mary.

00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:34.480
 Looks like candy to me.

00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:38.960
 Well, if it is, I should never promise Kathleen I wouldn't open it till tomorrow.

00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:40.720
 You did, promising.

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:44.840
 Well, Robert, did you come up there and help me in the air?

00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:46.240
 Alex, would you excuse me?

00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:46.760
 Of course.

00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:53.560
 Well, if you pardon me, I'll go out to the kitchen and see whether we have any ginger ale on the ice bar.

00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:56.520
 Oh, Bob, don't bother. We just had dinner.

00:24:56.520 --> 00:24:58.680
 Bob, I'm angry. Supposing he could hear you.

00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:01.760
 Well, Henry, so we invited you up for dinner.

00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:05.200
 Some places been a very serious mistake.

00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:08.200
 I'll be putting it mildly.

00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:11.000
 And this is the most embarrassing moment I've ever had.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:12.600
 The thing for us to do is to get out of here.

00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:15.000
 Well, I think we should stay long enough to be polite.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.200
 Say, mother is hungry as I am.

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:19.800
 You're not any hungrier than the rest of us, Enray.

00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:21.800
 Oh, I had valence with a cup of cheese.

00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:23.600
 And I didn't have anything.

00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:26.800
 Supposing Alice, we run on before they discover the mistake we've made.

00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:27.800
 Oh, Father.

00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:30.400
 Father, do you mind if I make a suggestion?

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:31.200
 I do.

00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:37.300
 Alice will tell him it's holly, but we're going to run on to the movies, and as soon as we get away, we'll go get some dinner.

00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:41.200
 I have a sort of apology to make you folks, I'm afraid.

00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:42.300
 Oh, I'm a trouble, Bob.

00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:45.700
 Well, it's the ginger ale, but we don't have any ice.

00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:46.700
 [LAUGHTER]

00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:49.200
 No, no, listen, Bob, I give you my word.

00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:51.500
 Not one of us could drink a thing.

00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:53.700
 And besides, we're going to have to run along.

00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:55.700
 No, no, that's your same channel.

00:25:55.700 --> 00:25:57.200
 We're sorry, Dorothy.

00:25:57.200 --> 00:26:00.000
 It's so important that the leaves are not as great as it is, dear.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.160
 - Well, yes, yes, Dr. C.

00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:05.200
 Tomorrow, being Mother's Day, we told Alice

00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:07.360
 we were coming here, but we're really taking her

00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:08.200
 to the movie.

00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:10.200
 - Well, well, isn't that love?

00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:11.360
 - Yes.

00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:13.000
 - Bob, why don't you and I get on, I think.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:14.200
 Go on with him, huh?

00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:15.360
 (audience laughs)

00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:16.200
 - Good idea.

00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:18.000
 - And then they get a new thing together.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.600
 - But, Mrs. Anderson, let me explain something.

00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:21.440
 - Henry?

00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:22.920
 - But, Mother, Henry.

00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:24.560
 - Yes, Mother.

00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:27.680
 Mrs. Anderson, we'd be very glad to have you come along.

00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:43.360
 [Music]

00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:47.600
 Oh, wasn't that the best Pixar episode of "The Only Life?"

00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:52.160
 Yes, Dorothy, and it's been the best Mother's Day party I ever had in my life.

00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:54.080
 Would you like another hamburger, Mother?

00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:55.200
 No, thank you.

00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:57.800
 three is all I could possibly eat.

00:26:57.800 --> 00:26:58.800
 Father.

00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:00.640
 Oh, yes, I'm just too warm.

00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:03.240
 My honey, this is the smartest idea of yours

00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:06.000
 that we drop into this little hamburger stand.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.240
 Thank you, Mr. Anderson.

00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:09.040
 I had been in one of these places in years.

00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:10.080
 I loved them.

00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:12.120
 Sam and I used to drop in all the time.

00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:14.320
 Oh, Mr. May, I have the check, please.

00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:17.160
 Oh, now Henry, I don't pay the check.

00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:18.440
 The movies were on you.

00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:22.360
 But Mr. Anderson, this whole evening has been on me.

00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:24.480
 Yes, Henry, it certainly has.

00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:40.480
 [Music]

00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:43.480
 Henry Aldrich will be back in just a moment.

00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:47.480
 It ends the next time that you want to give a party, there's no need to send out invitations.

00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:52.480
 You just drop the word here and there that you're planning to make some jello pudding whipped.

00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:56.640
 Before you can say come in, you'll have a house full of smiling guests.

00:27:56.640 --> 00:28:00.640
 Yes, this well-used is certainly become a big favorite, and there's every reason why it's

00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:07.000
 huge, because jello pudding whip is wonderfully good and downright easy to make.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:12.160
 You just take one package of jello, any flavor, and one package of jello vanilla pudding, and

00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:14.280
 make them up as you usually do.

00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:18.000
 Then chill the jello and flip it as directed on the box.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:22.480
 Next, you chill the jello vanilla pudding and add it to the fifth jello, beating constantly

00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:24.120
 until it's blended.

00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:25.400
 Then mold.

00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:31.120
 And there you have a grand, inexpensive treat, serving 10 to 12 people and simply ideal for

00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:32.680
 parties and special occasions.

00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:38.160
 So be sure to try this new and intriguing combination of delicious jello and rich, creamy

00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:39.480
 jello vanilla pudding.

00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:53.480
 [Music]

00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:56.480
 Ladies and gentlemen, this week is National Restaurant Week.

00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:59.480

00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:04.480
 and climax that dinner pleasantly by choosing the most popular dessert on the menu?

00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:05.480
 Yellow pudding!

00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:08.240
 (dramatic music)

00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:15.440
 - Father, Father, do you see this dime bank I have?

00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:16.280
 - I do, Henry.

00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:18.240
 - Well, I'm going to start a savings fund.

00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:20.160
 - Well, I'm delighted to hear you say that.

00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:21.080
 - Oh, here.

00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:22.880
 It is your first dime to put in it.

00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:23.880
 - Thank you.

00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:25.440
 You know what I'm gonna save toward?

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:26.280
 - What?

00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:28.120
 - A party on Father's Day.

00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:30.120
 - May I have that dime back, please?

00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:32.880
 (dramatic music)

00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:43.120
 The oldest family starring as the stone is written by Clifford Goldsmith.

00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:46.480
 Original music is composed and conducted by Jack Miller.

00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:50.220
 This is Harry Bonsell speaking and wishing you good night for the puddings that are

00:29:50.220 --> 00:29:51.360
 tops in taste.
