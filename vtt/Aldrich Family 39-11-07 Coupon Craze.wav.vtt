 They say the happiest year is a black with the teeth,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
 but I know one person who has his sons, Henry Always,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 Henry has all the problems and growing pains that most boys

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
 on our ice-cream days for Henry is that Ted McMillan are in the morning.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 To see an open from the Orbridge kitchen, the time is Saturday morning.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.500
 What mother? Why won't you? Because we can't afford it in me.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.500
 We can't afford just eight cents. I'm sorry, but that is the condition the family is in.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.000
 We can't afford eight cents for what, mother?

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 Believe it or not, Mary, we can't afford just eight cents worth of breakfast food.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.360
 You mean father's loss is lost, I think?

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.840
 Your father has not lost his law practice.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.960
 That age this would be only the beginning.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:30.960
 Of what?

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.840
 Well, busy and I are saving breakfast food to Ponsmary

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.000
 to get an off-board motor for a robo.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.200
 And all I'm doing is asking mother to stock up.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.120
 Yes, dear.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.080
 And you might also explain that all you need is 12,000--

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.720
 But we don't, mother.

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.240
 We've already got quite a few.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.960
 All we need now is 11,200 and 14.

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.960
 Well, we are not stocking up with any 11,214 packages, but...

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.960
 I'm not asking anything so ridiculous, Mother.

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.960
 At the most, I'm just asking you to buy 200 packages.

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.960
 Well, at one Henry?

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.960
 Sure, we can use that in a year, easy.

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.960
 Henry, I don't want to hear anything more about it.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:08.960
 No, sorry.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.960
 Has Mr. Sutherland called this morning?

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.960
 Not that I know, well, how could he be filling for me?

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.960
 Noting, Mother. Just something I asked him to call me about.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.960
 If any of you have Sunday school teacher Henry?

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:24.200
 Yes, Mary. Mother, have you tried looking at it from this way?

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.360
 If I were asking you to buy chilling them or candy, it might be different, but breakfast

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.360
 food.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.160
 Think of all the nourishment there'd be in 200 boxes.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.640
 And where would we keep 200 boxes?

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.440
 I'd hear in the kitchen where they'd be handing.

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.000
 And where would I cook?

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.240
 All right. You'll cook here in the kitchen, and I'll give over my room for the breakfast

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.240
 food.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.520
 And then you can send all your time up there eating it.

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:47.660
 All right, Mary.

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.080
 Ridicule me today.

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.360
 We'll wait until you look out on a late Sunday

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.200
 and see me in a rowboat with a two and a half horsepower

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.520
 outboard motor on it.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.600
 Then maybe you won't think I'm so humorous.

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.360
 Won't I?

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.200
 I'll ask her to phone.

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.480
 Mother, as soon as Mary is through with that call,

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.240
 do you mind if I phone Father's office?

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:06.080
 I don't know, dear.

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.280
 Well, I want to remind him to get the folks of his office

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.280
 saving coupons.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.040
 Ten minutes.

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.680
 I don't like to discourage every suggestion you make,

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.800
 but I have to know that your father is extremely busy

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.360
 preparing a case to be tried and put.

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.280
 But mother, this wouldn't take 10 seconds.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.320
 And if I can get everyone at his office eating good breakfast,

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.000
 maybe his whole practice will pick up.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.760
 You are not going to bother him there.

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.480
 And incidentally, your father does not

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.120
 want you to bother Judge Thompson's family anymore either.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.760
 I haven't been bothering the termsons.

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.360
 You've been trying to get Mrs. Thompson to save coupons

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:37.200
 for you.

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.200
 Then your father finds it quite embarrassing

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.560
 when he has to try cases before Judge Thompson.

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.440
 But Judge Thompson ought to be grateful.

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:44.240
 In what way?

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.880
 I'm employing his son.

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:46.720
 - Have they given you?

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.040
 - Sure, didn't I tell you?

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.200
 Freddy works for me.

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.040
 - Doing pot.

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.200
 - Eating breakfast food?

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.120
 - I pay him.

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.360
 - And who pays for the breakfast food?

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:56.800
 - Judge Thompson.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.000
 - But Freddy's thought he'd eat something, hasn't he?

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.320
 - And he might as well eat this

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:01.880
 and have a cow toward something.

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.680
 - Henry, Mr. Sutherland just phoned him.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.000
 That's a message for you.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.840
 - For me?

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.120
 - Yes, Henry.

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.720
 He said that he considered your proposition

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.840
 and he didn't think it would be ethical.

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.200
 - It wouldn't be ethical.

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.200
 It wouldn't be ethical.

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.200
 Can you imagine that?

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.200
 What did you ask him to do?

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.200
 If that isn't the most absurd thing I ever heard of.

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.200
 What did you ask him to do?

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.200
 The most simple thing in the world.

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:32.200
 What I asked him to do was to suggest a Sunday school that the class led me again and eat my kind of breakfast food.

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:33.200
 Henry Oldridge!

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.200
 I don't blame it for feeling that way, Mother.

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.200
 It wouldn't have hurt him to ask him.

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.200
 And I would have been perfectly willing to give him a commission.

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.200
 I will leave this.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.200
 Well, you know what I'm going to do?

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.520
 I'm going to change my church.

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.160
 Oh, no, you're not Henry.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.080
 Oh, yes, I am.

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:51.560
 Oh, if you ask me, I don't think Mr. Sutherland has a Christian like attitude.

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:52.640
 Will one of you see him?

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:54.040
 Is it the front door, please?

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.720
 I'll go, Mary.

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:57.920
 It may be one of the men I have working for me.

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:03.200
 Hello, Henry.

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:04.880
 Oh, how proud he's come on in.

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:06.600
 I got some bad news for you.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.200
 Yeah?

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.640
 The mother says I can't eat so much breakfast food.

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:11.560
 Why not?

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.640
 My father wants to buy a car.

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:16.300
 Once I got to go, whether he needs the money.

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.560
 A campaign to good money, but look at what you're paying.

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.640
 50 cents for every 500 coupons.

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:25.120
 All right, if you keep on saving,

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.320
 I'll give you an interest in the motorboat too.

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.680
 You still don't think my folks can afford it.

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.320
 Why don't you ask them which they'd rather have a car

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.960
 or a motorboat, but my father can't go to the courthouse

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.600
 in a motorboat, can he?

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:40.120
 Freddie, I'm not sure, but I think I just had an idea.

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.120
 Yeah, what else have I got to eat?

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:42.620
 No.

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:45.460
 All you have to do is sit back and count.

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:47.660
 Where's your father buying the car?

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:50.760
 I heard him mention Johnson's automobile agency.

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:51.900
 Let's go down there.

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:52.900
 Bye.

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:56.060
 Oh, if Johnson wants your father's business,

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:59.300
 they ought to be willing to cooperate a little, shouldn't they?

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:01.740
 By saving breakfast food coupons for us.

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:02.900
 Come on, Freddy.

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:04.300

 Okay, Mr. Johnson.

 Hi.

 What can I do for you?

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:24.300
 How do you do?

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:25.300
 We're just looking.

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:28.300
 It has some very nice cars here.

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:30.300
 Are you buying a car?

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:33.300
 Well, we are in exactly, but a friend of ours is?

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:34.300
 He is.

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:41.340
 Yeah, and he asked us to sort of look around for him. What's his name? Well, I'm not sure

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:47.180
 he'd want his name mentioned just now. He just wants your fight. Yes, sir. How much is that car?

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:52.640
 795. That's a kind of considered. How much is that sedan over there?

00:06:52.640 --> 00:07:00.460
 2840. 2840? Yes, sir. Is that FOV or delivered? FOV.

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:03.460
 How many spare tires does that include?

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:04.460
 Two.

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:05.460
 Only two.

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:07.460
 You mind if we try sitting in it?

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:09.460
 Yeah, after sitting in that one?

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:11.460
 Well, we would like to see what it's like.

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:12.460
 No.

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:14.460
 You sit in the back, Jimmy.

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:16.460
 Why should I sit in my back?

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:18.460
 Who's buying this?

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:19.460
 Balls.

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:20.460
 Let me show you something.

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:23.460
 When you push each other against the doors like that, it scratches.

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:24.460
 Huh?

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:27.460
 See, that's the trouble with a black car.

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:29.460
 It shows every button you've bought.

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:32.460
 Oh, geez. I must have hit it.

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:34.460
 Don't touch anything in there.

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:36.460
 No, sir. Not a bad dish, Freddie.

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:38.460
 I don't like it as well as last year's Henry.

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:40.460
 Yeah, well, is that the speedometer?

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:43.460
 That's the clock. That isn't the right time, though.

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:45.460
 It isn't even running.

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:48.460
 What's this here? That's an ash receptacle.

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:50.460
 Would your mind putting it back, please?

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:53.460
 Gee. You broke right off.

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:55.460
 I guess you're not the puppet.

00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:58.460
 I know, but it shouldn't break like that.

00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:01.460
 Well, what do you know about that human?

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:03.460
 I understand that either of your hair.

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:05.460
 $2,800 in your pocket?

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:06.460
 I have.

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:16.460
 Oh, wouldn't you be interested in our making an offer?

00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:17.460
 Well, this job?

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:19.460
 Well, it's a proposition for any car.

00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:20.460
 No.

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:22.460
 Well, you know somebody that's fine.

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:24.460
 Oh, but you're all...

00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:27.460
 Well, do you mind if I ask what you eat for breakfast?

00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:34.660
 What's that got to do with it wouldn't hurt to tell us with it with his mind getting out of this and out of his showroom?

00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:42.000
 Sure, I will get out gladly. I guess he doesn't know who your father is Freddy. How do I care?

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:49.460
 Oh, he is what is it told just a couple of wanderers? I guess I guess you don't want his father to buy his car here, huh?

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:56.660
 Who is this hot judge Thompson? Your judge Thompson's boy? I sure am. Well, it'll certainly glass a no idea, man

00:08:56.660 --> 00:09:03.660
 Thank you. How do you do? I'm the son of Sam Alders. Sam Alders, well you look just like him.

00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:08.660
 Yes, sir. What everybody says is make yourselves a home. Yes, sir.

00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:11.660
 Do you want to see a friend's room? I'll let you teeny scratch.

00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:15.660
 Oh, if there are any questions you'd like to ask boys, just begin to show.

00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:19.660
 Yeah? What kind of breakfast food do you eat? What's that? You made them.

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:23.660
 Yeah, you see, we're saving coupons and we thought maybe it's a time they're a coupon.

00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:26.660
 I've got one right here in my pocket.

00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:27.660
 Here it is.

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:33.660
 We don't eat that bag right now, but I'll certainly speak to my wife about it, you will.

00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:35.660
 How did you try it someday?

00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:38.660
 You couldn't get her to start tomorrow morning, could you?

00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:42.660
 Well, Joe, see this coupon?

00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:45.660
 Getting tomorrow morning, you get your wife to save these.

00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:48.660
 You mean I gotta give up cinnamon guns?

00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:50.660
 Yeah, we're going to help these boys out.

00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:53.660
 Tell the public how to shop there to eat this too.

00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:56.660
 Oh gee, that's pretty nice of you.

00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:58.660
 Here's what you could do for me.

00:09:58.660 --> 00:09:59.660
 It's judged, believe it or not,

00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:02.660
 just thinking of buying one from the yellow arrow people.

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:05.660
 It's a good car, if you don't want to drive a train car.

00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:09.660
 The yellow arrow and your teller about art on it.

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:11.660
 Oh sure.

00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:14.660
 Which model here do you think your dad would like pretty?

00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:16.660
 I like that $2800 job.

00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:19.660
 Yeah, here that job, the boys have paid.

00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:24.020
 So now then, when would you like to have a Senate demonstration car over for you?

00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:24.860
 To ride in?

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:25.860
 Sure!

00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:28.740
 Gee, are you doing anything next week Henry?

00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:31.500
 Not that I planned next week again.

00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:36.740
 Now here boys, before you go I've got something for you.

00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:39.500
 Right here, and this table is two brothers for you.

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:42.180
 Young men and two brothers for you.

00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:44.540
 Well Gee, where's Waller being next?

00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:46.180
 You'll find this new creature right.

00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:47.180
 Mr. Johnson.

00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:48.180
 What?

00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:50.180
 Judge Thompson, of course, the street.

00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:51.180
 Judge Thompson?

00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:52.180
 So it is.

00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:53.180
 You like to have me call him?

00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:55.180
 I don't think y'all are bothering right now.

00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:57.180
 He's probably in a rush someplace.

00:10:57.180 --> 00:10:59.180
 And let's call him Eddie out.

00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:02.180
 Well, he may not like to be pushed into a sale.

00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:03.180
 Well, tell him--

00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:04.180
 Hey, Judge.

00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:06.180
 I'd tell you to come back here for a show in a minute.

00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:08.180
 I would probably talk right now.

00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:10.180
 Acting with everybody.

00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:12.180
 And he wanted me to look at something.

00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:14.180
 Oh, Billie, come on.

00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:17.180
 It's too bad he isn't going to come in.

00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:19.180
 Yeah, it is.

00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:23.180
 Well, I guess we better be dying ourselves.

00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:24.180
 Goodbye.

00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:25.180
 Goodbye.

00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:26.180
 Goodbye.

00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:27.180
 What do you know about it?

00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:28.180
 Come on, Freddie.

00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:29.180
 We've got to hurry.

00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:30.180
 Where are we going now?

00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:31.180
 Where do you think?

00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:33.180
 Why just stop at Mr. Johnson's?

00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:36.180
 Let's get the yellow arrow company eating for us too.

00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:37.180
 Come on.

00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:46.180
 [music]

00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:48.180
 Well, Henry doesn't miss a trick, does he?

00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:52.180
 And while he's trying to persuade the yellow arrow company to do a little eating for him,

00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:54.180
 I'd like to mention something about eating myself.

00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:57.180
 Something I've had all of you ladies will agree with.

00:11:57.180 --> 00:11:59.180
 It's simply this.

00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:03.180
 The real spice and charm the family suffers is in variety.

00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:05.180
 Something new and different all the time.

00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:07.180
 Lots of good desserts at your fingertips.

00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:08.180
 There's the trick.

00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:12.180
 And jello puddings are one mighty swell answer.

00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:15.180
 Or you can have in from the variety easily and inexpensively.

00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:20.900
 For instance, serve jello vanilla pudding, the juicy raisins added, or a covering of lovely

00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:24.100
 coconut or fold in some tempting top dates.

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:29.140
 Jello vanilla pudding has a metal bland flavor that combines perfectly with fruits or coconut

00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:31.980
 and gives you a new treat every time.

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:37.140
 Then dry jello chocolate pudding, rich and dark and luscious, and the jello butter starts

00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:43.300
 pudding as mouth watering as golden taffy candy with a wonderful smooth richness.

00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:46.100
 All three jello puddings are quicker to flash to make.

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:48.300
 Simple directions aren't every package.

00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:51.820
 And when you pride these three brand new desserts,

00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:54.420
 you know why every day more and more people

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:57.620
 are saying to their grocers, give me jello puddings

00:12:57.620 --> 00:13:00.220
 in all three luscious flavors.

00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:02.800
 (lively music)

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:09.300
 From Henry Elders' activity over the day,

00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:13.100
 last few days, his coupons should be arriving in truckloads.

00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:18.100
 You're thinking of now as he is counting with Freddie in Judge Thompson's home.

00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:26.100
 Two thousand four hundred and sixty-five, two thousand four hundred and sixty-six.

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:34.100
 I'm getting tired, Freddie. Don't tell me you want to stop. Maybe, maybe it's because I don't like to do anything that's wrong.

00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:36.100
 Go on and Kenney.

00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:38.100
 Okay.

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:41.100
 Two thousand four hundred and sixty seven

00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:43.100
 to listen to Eddie.

00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:45.100
 Do you think that what we've been doing

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:46.100
 resembles bribery?

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:47.100
 Bribery.

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:49.100
 My father thinks it does.

00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:51.100
 How does he even know about it?

00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:53.100
 In an unguarded moment I told him.

00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:55.100
 Everything or just one or two of the

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:56.100
 highest plus.

00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:58.100
 And he says we ought to go to your

00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:00.100
 father and confess or get it.

00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:02.100
 All we've done is ask somebody to save

00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:06.860
 to save a few breakfast food to find. Sure. That's the way I think I'll look at it.

00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:12.300
 And besides Mr. Johnson hasn't even given all of us yet. That's what I say.

00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:21.700
 Well, 2,468, 2,000. No matter what you say, Freddie, I'm going to tell your father.

00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:25.580
 And me, you'll want to make the mistake of your life, but it was the last Saturday that

00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:31.420
 we did it. I haven't slept since. Well, don't move down to the courthouse, you can confess

00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:33.820
 You mean it would make it legal if I did it down there?

00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:35.320
 He doesn't like to be bothered.

00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:37.420
 He's very straight about saying like that.

00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:38.920
 Hello, Fred.

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:39.920
 Hey.

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:41.420
 Where do you come from?

00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:43.420
 How old is that of the afternoon at home?

00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:44.420
 What the hell?

00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:45.420
 She's out someplace.

00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:46.420
 You sat in there with me.

00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:47.420
 Just Henry.

00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:47.920
 Where?

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:50.420
 At Judge Thompson, can I speak to you with you a minute?

00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:52.420
 Henry, you're only going to have sayings.

00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:55.420
 That's as if I take my boat off and put these factors on.

00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:59.420
 If they're telling me, he's going to look at it from a purely technical point of view.

00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:02.660
 You know, my father's trying to case in front of him.

00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:04.660
 He says, "I've got to get things straightened out

00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:06.920
 "but you don't know what you're walking into.

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:09.000
 "Father can't stand crying.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.060
 "Crying.

00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:11.900
 "Here, help me take these coupons out."

00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:13.660
 - Superins are your shirt.

00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:15.760
 I'll put some in mind what we ought to have

00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:17.000
 to vacuum clean.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.400
 - Well, Henry, okay.

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:21.200
 What is it, the thought nearby?

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:22.240
 - Judge Thompson.

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:26.840
 My father asked me to tell you something.

00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:28.080
 - All right, Henry.

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:28.920
 What was he?

00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:34.760
 Well, I just wanted to say, is it true you're buying in the automobile?

00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:36.560
 I have been thinking of it.

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:37.860
 Oh, right.

00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:39.840
 I think that's a very good idea.

00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:45.160
 That reminds me, there are several packages here that are left in my name at the courthouse.

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:48.200
 I wonder whether you boys would know anything about them.

00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:50.080
 Packages, Dutch Thompson's own right.

00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:53.200
 Father, that's the curious part of it.

00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:57.920
 This first package was left by some representative from the Johnson automobile agency.

00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:00.800
 It contains several breakfast foods to find.

00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:01.960
 Isn't that strange?

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:03.360
 It certainly is.

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:06.040
 Another package is from the Yellow Arrow Agency.

00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:07.720
 And here is one from the center field.

00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:09.040
 You will try and bought it.

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:11.320
 All containing coupons, Father.

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:13.320
 All containing coupons.

00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:15.880
 Do you suppose they're giving breakfast food to Pons

00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:17.480
 with cars this year?

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:20.320
 You boys aren't by any chance saving breakfast

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:21.840
 food to Pons, are you?

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:22.960
 Saving them?

00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:23.960
 I hope they know what it is.

00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:26.520
 Now things that I have reached the age were high savings.

00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:27.780
 I should think that.

00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:29.480
 At first I was afraid you'd go,

00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:31.220
 you might be taking advantage of the fact

00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:33.120
 I was considering a car.

00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:35.020
 But knowing you as I do,

00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:37.620
 I am sure that bribery was either the last thing

00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:39.420
 either of you would stupid.

00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:40.520
 Yes, sir.

00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:42.520
 If there's one thing that's terrible,

00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:43.320
 it's bribery.

00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:44.920
 It certainly is.

00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:47.320
 And it's one thing I never told her it.

00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:48.520
 Yes, sir.

00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:49.920
 I'll tie these up again.

00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:51.820
 You mean they're going to return them?

00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:54.520
 I certainly don't know why I should keep them.

00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:57.520
 But let's get back to what you were going to tell me.

00:16:57.520 --> 00:16:58.920
 Why, uh...

00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:01.120
 Freddie, do you remember what it was?

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:03.020
 It certainly skipped my memory.

00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:06.620
 I had it right on the tip of my tongue, Judge, doesn't it?

00:17:06.620 --> 00:17:08.720
 I couldn't tell you now if I had to.

00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:12.320
 Freddie, what in the world do you have wanted up inside this shirt?

00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:15.520
 Oh, that might be my underwear.

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:18.120
 What do you do? Just tell me it then?

00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:20.320
 I see Henry's does the same thing.

00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:21.120
 He here.

00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:23.720
 Mine keeps slipping down.

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:25.060
 I'll answer the phone call.

00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:26.840
 I'll answer thank you.

00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:28.960
 And take it upstairs to maybe the call.

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:29.960
 I'm sorry.

00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:31.520
 Freddie, Freddie, take a look out the window.

00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:32.020
 Her foot.

00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:33.080
 Coming up the wall.

00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:34.080
 It's Mr. Johnson.

00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:34.640
 That's fine.

00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:35.880
 Time for him to come.

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:37.720
 I'm going to tell you I should have confessed.

00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:39.880
 I certainly didn't stop you.

00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:41.120
 You go to the door, Henry.

00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:42.000
 You go yourself.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.240
 This is your house.

00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:44.240
 Hey, hey.

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:44.800
 You too.

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:46.080
 It isn't the car, please.

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:46.840
 Oh.

00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:50.040
 Is somebody there?

00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:51.120
 Here I am, boys.

00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:52.240
 As good as my word.

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:53.120
 Yes, sir.

00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:56.920
 Mr. Johnson, we don't feel we should be of any more trouble to you.

00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:58.320
 How old you worry about that?

00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:00.040
 The car is right out in front.

00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:02.040
 Either way, here are some old bladders for you.

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:03.960
 - Ready? - Yes, Father.

00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:07.560
 - Who was that to throw up? - A man with um, bladders.

00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:09.680
 Wasn't that your dad with cold?

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:11.640
 - Yes, sir. - Ask him to come along with us.

00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:13.840
 - I don't think he'd have time, Mr. Johnson.

00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:17.640
 - I'm so good to get out for a ride. - I don't think we'd better even bother him.

00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:19.040
 Let me step into next to you.

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:19.840
 - Ready?

00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:21.400
 - Am I going to my door?

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:22.560
 I'll be the crowd up here.

00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:26.560
 See how nervous he is and if we light the car, that's all it counts with him.

00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:31.560
 Well, okay. You wait in the car and we'll be with you just as soon as we get everything you're summer.

00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:33.560
 Okay. Pre-yup, and you get your coat. You gotta get out of here.

00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:35.560
 Right. You take a look out the window. Why?

00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:39.560
 There are two women coming up with walk, and they both got cars out by the curb.

00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:44.560
 They're crazy. There are four cars out there, and two station laggons are just throwing out.

00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:47.560
 Let's go out the back door and leave him there with my father.

00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:49.560
 Well, I don't want them.

00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:54.360
 You suppose we can get a Mr. Johnson's car until all the rest of the follow and what?

00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:56.360
 And give them each a try along the way.

00:18:56.360 --> 00:19:00.560
 Sure, have a demonstration of nine cars all at once, I suppose.

00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:04.560
 How do you do?

00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:06.560
 I was sent up here from the Marvel car.

00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:07.560
 Can I agency?

00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:09.560
 I'm from the Honors Building Company.

00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:12.560
 Yes, sir. We'll be right out as soon as we get a coat.

00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:15.560
 And could you please tell the others to wait in their cars?

00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:22.200
 And that would you mind by asking about how many cars your father is buying just one and just one?

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:26.720
 Yeah, but he's going to be very open-minded about it sure. I can see that

00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:29.680
 I'll say come on

00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:34.500
 Oh, yes, sir. I was in table about the window out the back window

00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:37.860
 Those are about there

00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:42.720
 Brain so and maybe it's a traffic cam. I

00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:45.680
 I wonder who that could be.

00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:47.480
 I didn't see anyone come up the walk.

00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:48.960
 - As opposed to that need over the door.

00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:51.480
 - Oh, I just assumed answer attached, Thompson.

00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:52.480
 - No.

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:53.720
 - Hey, where you bump into a chair?

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:54.560
 - I'll pick it up.

00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:56.640
 - And I will go to the door.

00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:59.320
 - Well, Freddy, here's where everything's box open.

00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:01.440
 - And all because of an idea you had.

00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:03.080
 - I didn't think of all of it.

00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:04.840
 We didn't think of this part.

00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:07.160
 - Well, how cool.

00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:08.000
 - How you doing, darling?

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:08.840
 - Hand me.

00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:10.000
 - Is Mrs. Thompson here?

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:10.840
 - It's your mother.

00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:12.000
 - I'm just passing by.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.640
 I wonder if she might be here.

00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:15.680
 Would you like to have me go home with the mother?

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:16.880
 Wait a minute.

00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:19.240
 You're not going to leave me with all the Jane out there.

00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:21.080
 But my mother may want some help.

00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:21.580
 He may.

00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:22.680
 I don't need any help.

00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:23.240
 I am sorry.

00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:23.880
 Is it Thompson?

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:24.560
 Is it Oh?

00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:26.640
 Perfectly all right, Judge Thompson.

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:28.640
 My goodness, Henry, let me fix your shoes.

00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:29.440
 I can fix your--

00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:30.480
 All right, thank you.

00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:31.360
 What did they do there?

00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:32.000
 Shrink?

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.360
 That's the way they wear them this year.

00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:36.480
 By the way, Henry, this isn't fire drop in.

00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:38.800
 But have you seen your father's humidor around the house

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:39.920
 any place?

00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:41.360
 Is humidor?

00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:43.680
 You mean that big sort of a mahogany block?

00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:44.680
 Yes.

00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:48.000
 I wonder whether that's the same one that's up under my bed.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.000
 I hope, Henry, you're ever taken through, smoking your father's cigar?

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.000
 Oh, no, Judge Thompson.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.400
 I've just been using it to keep my coupons in.

00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:55.400
 Your coupons?

00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:57.400
 Did I say coupons?

00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:58.400
 Yes, Henry.

00:20:58.400 --> 00:20:59.400
 You said coupons.

00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:02.400
 Well, that's why I mean coupons.

00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:04.400
 So coupons, Henry.

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:05.400
 Yeah, so coupons.

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:06.400
 That's so cute.

00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:07.400
 Why, uh...

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:10.400
 I'm wondering if I could be.

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:14.400
 Could I answer that door please?

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:15.400
 There I am, where you are son?

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:19.400
 Yes dear. Never open a door that belongs to somebody else.

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:21.400
 How do you do that?

00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:25.400
 Judge Thompson, about how much longer is it going to be?

00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:27.400
 For what? Right, for the demonstration.

00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:30.400
 You're planning a demonstration? A political demonstration?

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:33.400
 How a demonstration? What the car can do?

00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:46.400
 No, no, no, no, no. Of course, maybe there's a mistake someplace that you don't have two boys here, do you? Two boys. Yeah. I'll tell me I've been eating breakfast food three times a day just for nothing.

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:55.400
 Boy, you want us, Father? Oh, there you are. Pretty good. There's a man here to give us a demonstration, I guess.

00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:56.400
 Hello there.

00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:58.400
 You boys are buying a car?

00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:00.400
 Well, not for ourselves.

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:03.400
 We're just looking into it for somebody.

00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:05.400
 You're so mean, yeah.

00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:07.400
 For my Sunday school teacher, Mr. Sutherland.

00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:08.400
 Are you coming?

00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:10.400
 Goodbye, Father.

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:11.400
 Goodbye.

00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:13.400
 Oh, goodbye, Mother.

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:14.400
 Goodbye.

00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:15.400
 Isn't it funny?

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:17.400
 Your father didn't say more.

00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:21.400
 Now, listen, is your dad buying a car or isn't he?

00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:23.400
 Just what I was going to ask, sure.

00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:24.400
 He's going to buy a car.

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:29.200
 car. I assure, because my family's eaten enough breakfast food in the last week to

00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:33.400
 use up the commission on free cars. There's trouble is, my father's sending all the

00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:38.400
 coupons back to you. Good, that's just fine. And until he buys a car, we kick them.

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:41.400
 [Singing]

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:45.400
 And you can thank yourselves for that noise. Don't you think we better chill off?

00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:49.400
 You want me to go home and we'd know, Freddy, I've got a swell idea. Another one.

00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:53.120
 Let's get Mr. Johnson's car until the rest of follow them.

00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:56.120
 Where it's out to the edge of town, all of them.

00:22:56.120 --> 00:23:02.560
 Sure. And on the way, Mr. Johnson, would you mind driving me by my girl's house over on Walnut Street?

00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:16.040
 [MUSIC]

00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:20.040
 Now listen boys, you've timed all nine of us in first gear.

00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:22.760
 You've timed all nine of us in second gear.

00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:25.800
 You've even timed all nine of us in reverse.

00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:27.800
 There isn't anything more that I can do.

00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:29.720
 There's just one thing more Mr. Johnson.

00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:31.200
 There is, sure.

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:35.840
 This is a peach of a road, and there's hardly any traffic on it.

00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:39.200
 How about an old line of you line up and we'll have a race?

00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:40.160
 A race?

00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:43.520
 Nine cars have a race and a public highway?

00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:44.400
 Or a not?

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:45.520
 Are you crazy?

00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:47.820
 And any other odd nine of us anymore.

00:23:47.820 --> 00:23:49.060
 - A property came of the rest.

00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:50.540
 They'd given up breakfast food

00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:52.700
 and have gone back to their normal life.

00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:54.780
 You leave the sailors between us too?

00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:56.100
 - It is.

00:23:56.100 --> 00:23:59.380
 Well, why can't we see you two, Rakes?

00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:00.220
 - Oh no.

00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:01.060
 - You're afraid to.

00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:02.380
 - What do you mean I'm afraid to?

00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:03.660
 - Certainly looks it.

00:24:03.660 --> 00:24:06.020
 - I wouldn't be a race, I believe in so far behind.

00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:07.300
 - That's who I do.

00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:08.420
 - Well, nine of them.

00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:09.420
 - You will race?

00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:11.820
 - If it's speed you want, we'll give it here.

00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:13.180
 - How fast is Judge Thompson?

00:24:13.180 --> 00:24:14.020
 You'll drive a car.

00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:16.260
 Oh, quite fast as the rule.

00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:19.020
 He does? Well, then, this is the car for him.

00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:21.380
 Oh, here he is.

00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:22.380
 All set?

00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:24.500
 He's already him, we.

00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:25.500
 All start him.

00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:27.300
 Oh, no, no, no, like me, Starcon.

00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:28.860
 It was my idea, Freddy.

00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:29.860
 Okay.

00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:31.860
 Get on your mark.

00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:33.700
 Get set, caught on Mr. Johnson.

00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:35.700
 I ain't got her. Go!

00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:38.700
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:42.300
 Ain't quite a girl.

00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:45.020
 Hand you, hand you, hand just wanna open your mouth, Mr. Johnson.

00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:46.020
 - It's open.

00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:47.660
 - Yeah, but he's way ahead.

00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:50.100
 We have been around two to the corner.

00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:51.660
 - Look at her, heck up.

00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:53.100
 - Where's the happening?

00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:54.020
 - Where's that?

00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:56.140
 - Keep her open, keep her open, Mr. Johnson.

00:24:56.140 --> 00:24:57.300
 - He's just ahead.

00:24:57.300 --> 00:24:59.140
 - I haven't even started to go.

00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:03.900
 - What could that be?

00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:06.060
 - Maybe there's a fire someplace.

00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:07.460
 - It's a policeman.

00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:09.260
 - Yeah, he's right here, too.

00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:11.260
 - I'm in the hole, baby.

00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:13.520
 (cheering)

00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:18.000
 - You mean, we can't finish the race?

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:21.360
 - I'll race, they're every, what is this, anyhow?

00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:23.360
 - Oh, we were just racing officer.

00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:26.240
 That's going to be a big help.

00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:27.840
 - You know what the law permits?

00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:29.080
 - Yes, sir.

00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:30.840
 - All right, I'll be back to town.

00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:33.240
 - We're gonna have an escort.

00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:34.920
 - He certainly are.

00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:37.480
 Well, over to one side, let this college come and go by.

00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:40.680
 - Pretty, look who it is, who is it?

00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:44.680
 Judge, you couldn't have come along at a better time.

00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:46.680
 Oh, it's my father.

00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:48.680
 Something going wrong, boys?

00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:50.680
 You got your new card, Dad.

00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:54.680
 I bought it, but, eh, it was delivered just after you left.

00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:55.680
 It was?

00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:56.680
 The typewriter.

00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:57.680
 Judge.

00:25:57.680 --> 00:25:59.680
 You all should take $10 from both of these men.

00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:02.680
 They were demonstrating that the boys was eight.

00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:03.680
 Lady Weyer?

00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:04.680
 Hey, hey, hey, hey.

00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:06.680
 Well, report at the courthouse to Montemorning Councilman,

00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:09.680
 and I'll give you both a good talking to them.

00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:15.680
 We say we'll turn those over to the police department for upstaking get some new instruments for the band.

00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:18.680
 Where did you buy your car, Judge Tarleton?

00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:23.680
 He didn't you know, Henry? During the week your Sunday school teacher sells cars.

00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:24.680
 Him? Yes.

00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:26.680
 Well, why you know about that?

00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:33.680
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:36.680
 Every all rich will be like whether she knows the most of all.

00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:39.680
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:41.560
 We don't like to think, ladies and gentlemen,

00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:43.320
 the general police could ever create what

00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:46.200
 might be termed a domestic situation.

00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:49.520
 But just listen to our latest letter of the week.

00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:51.680
 The author, Mr. Rodman Paul of San Francisco,

00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:53.920
 is here in our Hollywood studio right now

00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:56.000
 in drawing a visit to the city of stars

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.360
 as a guest of those star desserts, general police.

00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:01.800
 And I'm going to ask him if he'll just read as well he won't.

00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:03.200
 Mr. Paul.

00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:05.440
 My favorite general putting is chocolate.

00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:10.440
 and used to be that when my wife served it, she always made my days a bit harder than the rest.

00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:17.440
 Well, I started trouble right away. First, my daughter gave me a big hug and kiss, and wanted to trade dishes with me.

00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:22.440
 Next week, my son offered me a free copy of the magazine he sells if I had trade with him.

00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:27.440
 So now we always make up two packages for each meal instead of warm.

00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:34.440
 And we all have extra big dishes. My wife doesn't mind because it's as easy to prepare two boxes as one.

00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:37.440
 in this way everybody's happy.

00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:39.440
 So everything's all right, my own is fine.

00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:41.440
 Tell her to say, "I don't know where it is or not."

00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:44.440
 There's some talk about three pages for each meal,

00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:47.440
 and we may end up with four, one for each of us.

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:49.440
 It has when it comes to yellow footage

00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:53.440
 about the only word my family seems to know is "more."

00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:55.440
 Well, that just proves that you folks know a good thing

00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:57.440
 when you taste it, and speaking of more,

00:27:57.440 --> 00:27:59.440
 more and more families every day are discovering

00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:02.440
 the smooth, mellow delight of yellow chocolate pudding,

00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:06.440
 They're explaining over its rich old-fashioned chocolatey flavors.

00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:09.440
 They like Joe Bonilla, one of the first guys putting too.

00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:12.440
 And they're drawing them off because they're easy and economical to serve.

00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:16.440
 So try these three delicious new gel-footings yourself, ladies and gentlemen.

00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:19.440
 You say you never tasted anything so good.

00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:31.440
 [Music]

00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:35.440
 You know, Mary, Mr. Putney says I have a perfect lift for it.

00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:37.440
 The perfect lift for what Henry?

00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:41.440
 For the Cornette Mary. He says I'll have me playing jingle bells by Christmas.

00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:43.440
 And where will the rest of the sea by then?

00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:48.440
 Yeah, but once you get used to the Cornette, it'll develop your musical appreciation.

00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:51.440
 Well, in music appreciation, with fan fairs,

00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:53.440
 thrills, thrills, and many laughs,

00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:55.440
 will be coming here by next week,

00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:57.440
 so be sure to listen at the same time

00:28:57.440 --> 00:28:59.440
 for more adventures of Henry Olens.

00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:01.440
 The Irish family, starring Ezra Stone,

00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:03.440
 is written by Clifford Goldsmith,

00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:06.440
 written with music composed and conducted by Felix Middles,

00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:08.440
 Don Wilson speaking and wishing you good night

00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:10.440
 for those delicious new desserts

00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:12.440
 all America's talking about,

00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:14.440
 Jell-O, hoodie!
