00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 The Aldrich family based on characters originated by Clifford Goldsmith and

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:12.560
 starring Ezra Stone as Henry with Jackie Kalk as Homer. Henry! Henry Aldrich!

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.560
 Coming, brother!

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:29.040
 For the Aldrich family.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:40.540
 [Music]

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:46.540
 Most of us remember our teenage as something that was always bright and shiny and rather wonderful.

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.040
 But to Henry Aldrich who was right in the middle of his teenage,

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.040
 life is not always that attractive.

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.540
 The scene opens in the Aldrich's living room.

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.540
 It is the afternoon of the last day of the year.

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.980
 You are father, you really are?

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.340
 Certainly Mary, may I ask what's so unusual

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.180
 about taking your mother to a masquerade on New Year's Eve?

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.140
 Good Father, did you know that people dance at masquerade?

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:10.380
 Certainly I know.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.580
 Oh.

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:12.980
 What do you mean, oh?

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:13.820
 Nothing.

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:14.660
 Mary!

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:15.860
 I'll be right back, Father.

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:16.700
 All right, Mary.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:17.540
 Take your time.

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:18.380
 Well, you're mother.

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:19.580
 In the dining room.

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.300
 And dear, I was just wondering how you and Kermit

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:23.500
 were going to spend this evening.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:24.700
 Didn't I tell you, Mother?

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.300
 Oh, my goodness, I so frail.

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.060
 Really?

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.760
 I get Kermit just about the most thoughtful person in the whole world.

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.360
 My, where's he taking you?

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:33.860
 No place.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:34.860
 No place.

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.660
 He's just coming over here where we can be all by ourselves with just each other.

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:39.660
 What?

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:40.860
 Isn't that thoughtful of him?

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.160
 Well, yes, dear, of course.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.160
 Goodness when I think of all the poor girls with boyfriends,

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.160
 how think of anything better to do than throw their money around

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.060
 and never get a romantic book near lies.

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.160
 My, doesn't your heart bleed for them?

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.860
 It certainly does, Mary.

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.660
 And I know just how you feel.

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.860
 Your father was always very thoughtful that way too.

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:01.860
 (audience laughing)

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.620
 - Anyways, did you know he's planning

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:05.420
 on actually dancing tonight?

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.260
 - Do your father's been dancing for 25 years.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:09.180
 - That's what I mean,

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:11.260
 won't you think he'd get tired?

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.660
 - My goodness, I never thought of that.

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.140
 - I wonder.

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:16.220
 Excuse me, Mary.

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.660
 Oh, Sam, how did you think I should make something

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:19.500
 for Kermit?

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.220
 - As long as you stick to macarons, Mary.

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:23.660
 - I'm trying to leave.

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.660
 I know, dear, but I just got to thinking about...

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:28.660
 About what?

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.660
 Sam, are you sure you want to go to that masquerade tonight?

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.660
 Course I'm sure. What do you ask?

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:34.660
 Well, it's just...

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.660
 Are you sure you aren't getting tired?

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:38.660
 Tired?

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.660
 After all these years?

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.660
 Tired, Alice. These years with you have been the happiest of my life.

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:44.660
 What?

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.660
 Dear, I'm talking about the masquerade.

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:52.660
 Oh, well, Alice, when you first mentioned the masquerade, I may not have been too enthusiastic, but now I'm really looking forward to it.

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:53.660
 You are, Dean.

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.660
 Not only that, I promise I'd take you and now this.

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.660
 When I give my word, I keep it.

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:58.660
 Oh, Father!

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.660
 Yes, Henry, I'm in the living room trying to read.

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.660
 You go right on with your readings.

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.660
 Sam, it's nice and restful for you.

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:05.660
 What, sir?

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.660
 Father, I've turned the whole house upside down and you're my last hope.

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:09.660
 I am.

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.660
 Gee, was, do you know where my shin pads are?

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:12.660
 Your shin pads? What do you want them for?

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.660
 I'm taking them to the hockey game tonight, Father, and have them autographed.

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.660
 I'm afraid I haven't seen them, son.

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:18.660
 You haven't?

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.660
 Mother, wait, Father. What are you planning on wearing tonight?

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.660
 I don't know yet, Henry. Mr. and Mrs. Brown are looking out for the costumes.

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.660
 You're wearing a costume?

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:27.660
 Certainly.

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.660
 You are, Father. You really are?

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.660
 Yes, I am, and I'm also going to dance.

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:34.660
 You are?

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.660
 I am. You're going to dance at a thing like a hockey game?

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:39.660
 What?

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.660
 Well, yeah. You know the game you promised you to do take me to tonight.

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.660
 When did I promise a thing like that?

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:49.660
 Just before Christmas, Father. When you couldn't take me to that basketball game, you promised.

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:55.360
 When you said the very next time there was a hockey game, no matter if the world came to an end, we'd go.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.660
 Yeah. Well, Henry...

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:03.860
 Henry, I just want you to know that there's nothing I'd rather do than take you to that hockey game.

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:05.960
 Why, isn't it lucky I reminded you?

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:06.960
 Yes.

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:10.760
 Especially since I already turned down three different New Year's Eve parties.

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:11.860
 Oh, you did?

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:12.560
 Sure.

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.960
 And none of the kids would believe me when I told them how my father thought enough of me,

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:20.360
 to turn over the entire end of his old year to me.

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:24.960
 Henry, Henry, would you excuse me a minute?

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.460
 -Surefire. -Alice.

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:27.960
 -Yes, sir. -Alice.

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.460
 -The browns didn't phone, did they? -The browns.

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.460
 -They said they'd get all the costumes,

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.960
 and my goodness, it's the middle of the afternoon now.

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.960
 -Alice, Alice, I just got a wonderful idea.

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.960
 -You did, dear? -Why don't we put on our coats and hats,

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.460
 say, next Saturday night, and go down to the mansion house for dinner?

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.460
 -Why, thank you. -And go dancing afterwards.

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:51.940
 Afterward you know really make a night of it. Then you'd be like that like it by Sam

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:57.580
 I did don't read fine then Alice and dear I think you get more thoughtful every day

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:04.000
 Well my goodness how many husbands realize how tired we were getting our own cooking all the time

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.760
 Alice what I had in mind was that we would do that in place of going to the masquerade tonight

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.880
 But dear I've been looking forward to this masquerade

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.680
 Well, look, Alice, why don't we make a night of it?

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.680
 Not just next Saturday, but every Saturday night in the year.

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:19.680
 What?

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.280
 You know make a regular date of it.

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.280
 My goodness.

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.280
 Instead of going to the masquerade tonight.

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:29.880
 So naturally, Sam, if you're feeling your age, of course I won't drag you out.

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.880
 Alice, I am not feeling my age.

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:32.580
 Well, there...

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.580
 Suddenly you do look awfully haggis.

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:36.880
 Mother, I can't find the coconut!

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.580
 I'll look for it, Mary.

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:39.580
 But, Alice...

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:42.580
 Oh, Henry?

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:43.580
 Yes, Father.

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:49.580
 Henry, you know, Henry, when I wasn't able to take you to that basketball game, well,

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:53.580
 I was a very good example of the way things have been in 1948.

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:54.580
 But not next year.

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:55.580
 No.

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:56.580
 No, sir.

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:58.580
 Next year's son is going to be a big change.

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:00.580
 You and I are going to be closer.

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:01.580
 We are?

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:02.580
 We are.

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:04.580
 D, that's well, Father.

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:09.880
 Boy, what a swell way to start the new year off, going to a hockey game together.

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:12.900
 Well, this is still 1948, Henry.

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:14.680
 Why start a new regime tonight?

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:18.280
 Why not start it, say, any night next week that you name?

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:19.280
 Next.

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:20.280
 Well, sure, but...

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:22.340
 And we'll go out on the town and have the time of our lives.

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:23.340
 We will.

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:24.340
 Absolutely.

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:25.340
 Even if...

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:29.020
 Even if the world comes to an end?

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:30.520
 Uh, yes.

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:34.060
 Well, sure, that's okay, Father.

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:36.060
 Now you're sure, are you, son?

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:37.060
 Sure.

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:39.060
 Sure, that's what you'd rather do.

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:42.060
 I mean, I don't want to appear to be forcing you into anything.

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:44.060
 No, it's okay, father.

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:48.060
 After all, hockey is rather a strenuous form of amusement for a man of my age.

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:49.060
 Well, I mean...

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:50.060
 Sure, father, I understand.

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:52.060
 You really do?

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:55.060
 Well, I'll find somebody younger to go with.

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:55.560
 with.

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:58.400
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:07.740
 But Homer, Homer, are you still there?

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:08.240
 Sure.

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:09.500
 Oh, how about it?

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:10.940
 Nothing doing, Henry.

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:14.300
 But look, Homer, who really wants to go to Willy's party

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:15.380
 on New Year's Eve?

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:16.140
 I do.

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:18.620
 Do you sit around, play stupid games,

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:22.260
 wear your feet out dancing, and watch a lot of dumb girls

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.840
 watching you to see if you're watching them.

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:25.940
 (laughing)

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:28.340
 But boy, you go to a hockey game, see?

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:30.300
 And they're all these swell players

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:32.020
 and there's this little piece of rubber.

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:34.420
 - Sure, and all I do is chase it around.

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:36.460
 - Oh, or they do a lot more than that.

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:38.500
 Boy, they trip up each other with their sticks

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:40.580
 and push each other into the side.

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:42.940
 Sometimes a player even lands in your lap.

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:43.860
 - In my lap.

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:44.700
 - Sure.

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:45.540
 - No kidding.

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:46.380
 - Sure.

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:47.620
 - I'd rather go to the party.

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:48.620
 (laughing)

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:49.620
 - But a homer.

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:51.220
 - Then you can go to the hockey game.

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:52.220
 All by myself?

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:57.220
 Sure, I just think you'd have one seat to sit in and one seat for any player that might land there.

00:07:57.220 --> 00:08:00.220
 See, that wouldn't be any fun.

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:03.220
 Well, I'd like to bum around with you, Han, only...

00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:04.220
 ...she a hockey game.

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:08.220
 Isn't there anything you'd rather do than go to Willy's party?

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:11.220
 Well, what I'd really like is to go to that masquerade.

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:12.220
 The masquerade?

00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:14.220
 Sure that our folks are going to.

00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:16.220
 See, they're giving prizes and everything.

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:18.220
 Well, then why don't we both go?

00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:20.220
 You need money to rent costumes.

00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:25.460
 My father gave me an extra dollar and if I could sell my hockey tickets, I'd have enough money.

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:29.220
 How could you sell them at this late date? Everybody will have plans.

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:33.380
 For the sake of your new year, Homer, the least I can do is try.

00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:44.620
 Hello?

00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:45.420
 Hello, Sam.

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:48.220
 Oh, hello there, Will. Everything all set for the masquerades.

00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:49.120
 You betcha, Sam.

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:49.720
 Fine.

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:53.220
 Just the thought of getting out on the dance floor makes me feel like a boy, I guess.

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:55.420
 Sam, I phone to tell you we have the costumes.

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:56.720
 Good. What are they?

00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:59.220
 We're going as the four seasons of the year.

00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:01.320
 Hey, that's a darn good idea, Will.

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:02.220
 Your winter.

00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:03.220
 What?

00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:05.020
 Your winter, Sam.

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:05.820
 Oh, I am.

00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:09.420
 You wear a long white beard, seeing you even have a cane.

00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:10.120
 A cane, huh?

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:12.620
 Yours, so you won't even have to dance, Sam.

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:15.620
 All you have to do is hobble around all evening.

00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:18.420
 I see. Well, well, that's just great.

00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:20.180
 I'm glad you like the idea, Sam.

00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:22.420
 Oh, I do. I do indeed.

00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:23.920
 What are you, Will?

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:25.120
 I'm Summer.

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:26.620
 Summer, I see.

00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:29.920
 Well, so long we'll get together later and try the costumes on.

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:31.420
 Fine, goodbye, Will.

00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:32.220
 Oh, Alice.

00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:33.720
 Yes, Sam.

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:35.220
 Alice, how old is Will Brown?

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:36.820
 Why, I'm not sure, dear.

00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:38.720
 Is me a couple of years older than I am.

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:40.520
 Yes, I believe he is.

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:42.420
 Why, what's the matter?

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:43.620
 Nothing, Alice.

00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:44.420
 Nothing at all.

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:51.960
 [Music]

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:53.860
 But Homer, listen to reason.

00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:55.260
 Can we stand aside?

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:56.060
 Where are you going?

00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:59.260
 Oh, but Homer, it's the only costume he has left.

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:00.260
 It isn't my fault.

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:03.740
 It isn't my fault either, and I refuse to have anything to do with it.

00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:06.100
 But I've already sold my hockey tickets, Homer,

00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:08.940
 and you promised you'd go to the masquerade with me.

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:10.380
 Not in this costume.

00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:11.980
 Why can't go in and alone?

00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:15.980
 Listen Henry, I'm not being the back end of any horse in that sense.

00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:19.980
 Is that all it's worth? Look, you can be the front end.

00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:23.980
 No, I'm not starting the new year by being any part of a horse.

00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:24.980
 But a home, I...

00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:29.980
 Henry, I said no. Do you think I want to dance with you all evening back to front?

00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:38.980
 Sam, what are you trying to say?

00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:44.280
 Simply this, Alice, that some time ago I gave Henry my word I'd go to a hockey game within this evening.

00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:45.780
 But Sam, what about the brown?

00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:50.380
 That's unfortunate, Alice, but the more I think about it, the more I feel my first duty is to my son.

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:52.480
 But think of how disappointed they'll be.

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:55.980
 I know and I'm sorry, but they'll just have to find themselves another winner.

00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:57.180
 Sam, what do you mean?

00:10:57.180 --> 00:10:58.780
 Right. Nothing.

00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:00.280
 And what about me, dear?

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:03.280
 Alice, I'm sorry about that, but I'll make it up to you next week.

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:06.480
 Did you mean I have to stay home tonight with Mary and Kermit?

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:08.380
 What do you do right here in this house?

00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:09.380
 Yes, Mary.

00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:10.940
 You mean, right in the living world?

00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:12.380
 Excuse me, I'd better phone the bra.

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:13.380
 But mother!

00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:14.380
 That's all right, Mary.

00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:16.100
 I won't bother you and Kermit.

00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:19.220
 I can fix myself up very comfortably in the kitchen.

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:20.220
 In the kitchen?

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:21.220
 I'll be fine, Mary.

00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:23.820
 I'll take an armchair out there and dust nip.

00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:27.420
 My goodness, we wouldn't think of letting you do a thing like that.

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:30.260
 Well, Mary, if you really don't object...

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:33.100
 Come and help bring the radio out in the kitchen for you.

00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:38.100
 Mary, do you need to say you've really banished your own mother to the kitchen on New Year's

00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:40.100
 - Mother! - Yes, Henry!

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:42.100
 - Has anyone phone for me while I was out?

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:43.100
 - No, dear.

00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:46.100
 - No one at all. Not even Homer. No, Henry.

00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:47.100
 - Oh. - Henry!

00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:49.100
 - Yes, Father. - Come in here, please.

00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:50.100
 I've been looking for you.

00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:52.100
 - Mother, you don't understand. Yes, I do, Mary.

00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:54.100
 I understand perfectly.

00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:55.100
 - Henry, I have news for you.

00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:57.100
 - You mean Homer changed his mind about going with me?

00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:59.100
 - Henry, I am going with you.

00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:00.100
 - You are?

00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:04.100
 - Yes, sir. I managed to change my other plans, and, son, you can count me in.

00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:06.100
 - I can. That's definite, Father.

00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:11.100
 - It is. I may have been forced to go back on my word a few times in the past, but not anymore Henry.

00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:14.100
 - Oh boy, then let's try it on. - Try what on?

00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:15.100
 - The costume. - What?

00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:20.100
 - I have it right down the hall, Father. And boy, it's the best darn-looking horse you ever saw.

00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:23.100
 - Horse? Now wait a minute. I thought we were going to a hockey game.

00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:26.100
 - Nothing more, Father. We're going to the masquerade instead, as of course.

00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:28.100
 - Now wait. - You're in the back end.

00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:31.100
 - Now wait. - You just promised, Father.

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:35.100
 - I know, but I thought, Henry, you don't expect me to walk around all over the place.

00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:37.660
 me to walk around all evening, fed over double.

00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:40.300
 But father, I'm not a young man, Henry.

00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:42.620
 Probably you mean you're backing out again?

00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:43.420
 No, but--

00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:46.660
 After you said we were going to be closer this year?

00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:47.860
 Not that close.

00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:51.340
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:12:51.340 --> 00:13:01.340
 [applause]

00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:11.340
 Yes, getting back to the troubles of Henry Oldridge.

00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:15.340
 Mr. and Mrs. Oldridge had made arrangements to attend a New Year's Eve

00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:20.740
 with the Browns when Henry informed his father of a promise to take him to a hockey game tonight.

00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:28.240
 Due to his efforts to keep his word to everyone, Mr. Aldrich has now wound up as the hind end of a horse.

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:33.040
 The scene opens in the Browns living room. It is late the same afternoon.

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:35.840
 Mother, would you phone William Marshall for me?

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:41.240
 What for, hold on. Tell him it looks as though I'm going to recover and I'll be able to go to his party tonight after all.

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:47.980
 Because of the what my pneumonia my pneumonia what pneumonia my mother he thinks I'm staying home with pneumonia

00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:51.740
 Instead of going to his new year's party. You're not going to go these party

00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:56.420
 I told him I wasn't but she was I'll be during if I'll be a whore home

00:13:56.420 --> 00:13:59.260
 But just because you're hoarse is no reason to think you're coming down with pneumonia

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:06.340
 What just going gargled here, but mother a whole but do is your told cat you see I'm busy thinking okay

00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:10.620
 But gargling isn't gonna straighten me out with Willie. Yeah, you just have to have faith

00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:13.620
 Hey, I know, but, whoa.

00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:14.620
 Out of my way.

00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:16.620
 Mother! Mother!

00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:17.620
 Mother, what's in that?

00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:19.620
 Mother, there's a tree out in our hall.

00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:20.620
 A tree.

00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:21.620
 And it spoke to me.

00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:24.620
 Oh, dear, that's no tree. That's your father.

00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:27.620
 Why? I get off my lap.

00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:29.620
 Here I am, Elizabeth. How do I look?

00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:31.620
 Father, is that really you?

00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:32.620
 Sure, I'm summer.

00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:33.620
 You're why?

00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:34.620
 I'm summer. Summer.

00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:36.620
 Oh, boy.

00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:39.620
 We'll stop fooling around with that costume

00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:44.560
 You and help me find a spring and winter who spring and winter did they just back down. What's that?

00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:47.100
 She was all going upstairs and I don't

00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:52.620
 Elizabeth, what do you mean they back down? We'll be ordered. You said you decided they can't come to the masquerade tonight

00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:56.140
 Well, I shall find that now we'll calm down. You're shedding your leaves

00:14:56.140 --> 00:15:02.580
 There's the phone but Elizabeth, what are we going to do? We can't go just this food season

00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:06.980
 Well, I've been trying to think how we could convert our costumes. I'm afraid it's hopeless. Oh

00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:13.020
 Hello, oh Elizabeth. This is Sam Orange. Oh, Sam, you'll never know how disappointed we are

00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:18.980
 Well, that's what I called about it. Even if I can't make it do you think you could still fit Alice in a spring?

00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:23.580
 Well, the only thing is Sam. Wouldn't the three of us look a little awkward without winter?

00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:31.300
 Nonsense, Elizabeth. If there's one season you can dispense with it's certainly winter. Well, maybe we can work out something. Oh, I'd appreciate it, Elizabeth. Goodbye.

00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:37.940
 Elizabeth, was that Sam on the phone? Yes. He wants to know we can fit Alice in his spring. You mean all by herself?

00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:39.740
 But who will we get as winter?

00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:42.140
 I have any idea. Unless...

00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:43.140
 Yeah?

00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:44.740
 Well, I've got this. What?

00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:46.440
 He's not going anywhere tonight.

00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:47.440
 Oh, Homer!

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:48.440
 Yes, you want to go?

00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:50.440
 Come down here and try on this beard!

00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:58.940
 [music]

00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:02.440
 Father, could you hold the horses tail still a minute?

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:04.240
 Henry, what are you doing?

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:06.940
 Well, the trouble is when I put my head in first,

00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:08.940
 My feet won't go in.

00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:10.940
 Why putting your feet in first?

00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:11.940
 Are your feet in, Father?

00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:12.940
 Yes.

00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:14.940
 Maybe I should sort of bend over.

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:16.940
 Father, what happened?

00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:19.940
 The hind legs are sticking straight up in the air.

00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:21.940
 Yes, and I'm on my back.

00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:23.940
 Well, maybe that's the way to do it.

00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:27.940
 We both lie on our back, see and stick all our four feet up in the air.

00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:28.940
 Now, wait a minute.

00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:31.940
 Gee, it's going to be fun, Father.

00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:33.940
 Dad, will you see that to the phone?

00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:34.940
 Well, I'll try.

00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:35.940
 I'll get it, Father.

00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:38.940
 - Henry, stop pulling my leg. - That's my leg, Father.

00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:42.940
 - Hello. That's your leg over there. - It is?

00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:45.940
 - Well, whose arm is this? - Uh, now wait. Now wait.

00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:49.940
 - Isn't anybody going to ask it a call? - Now, Henry, let's take one leg at a time.

00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:53.940
 - Hello. - Hello. Is that you, Mary?

00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:56.940
 - Yes, is that you, Kermit? - Yes. Hello.

00:16:56.940 --> 00:17:01.940
 - Hello. My, it was nice of you to phone. - Mary, I have some news for you.

00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:04.940
 - You have? I am used for you too, Kermit. - You have?

00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:06.300
 You have? What is it?

00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:07.580
 You tell me yours.

00:17:07.580 --> 00:17:09.060
 No, you tell me yours.

00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:10.380
 No, you do.

00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:11.060
 Well...

00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:13.900
 Well, first of all, I made something wonderful for you to eat tonight.

00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:18.820
 You did? That's wonderful because, frankly, Mary, I am getting a little tired of macaroons.

00:17:18.820 --> 00:17:20.820
 Oh. Oh, my goodness.

00:17:20.820 --> 00:17:23.460
 And not that I'm not crazy about your macaroons, Mary.

00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:24.940
 But that's all right, Kermitty, goodbye.

00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:25.540
 You're leaving?

00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:27.940
 Yes, I have to go, and that is... yes.

00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:29.820
 But, Mary, I haven't told you my new.

00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:31.060
 Well, could you tell me quickly?

00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:33.940
 Sure. We're going to a hockey game tonight.

00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:35.140
 For hockey games.

00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:37.040
 Yeah, I'm get to, soldie the ticket.

00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:39.140
 I'm at a hockey game on New Year's Eve.

00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:41.140
 Yeah, isn't that swell?

00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:42.640
 And Mary?

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:44.140
 Mary, are you there?

00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:47.140
 Yes, but my goodness, I was looking forward to...

00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:48.140
 To...

00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:49.140
 To what?

00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:52.140
 Kermit, if you don't know, I'm certain I'm going to tell you and goodbye.

00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:54.140
 Mary, what's all the commotion on here?

00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:56.140
 Either I think you better just hate both.

00:17:56.140 --> 00:17:57.140
 What?

00:17:57.140 --> 00:17:59.140
 You're all the same, every one of you.

00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:01.140
 Mary, what did I do now?

00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:03.140
 Well, then I think I've got that horse lick, Father.

00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:04.800
 Henry, you can forget about that horse.

00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:05.640
 Forget about it.

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:07.140
 I can see your heart isn't in it, son.

00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:08.440
 Now, where are those hockey tickets?

00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:09.340
 I haven't got them.

00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:09.840
 Forget them.

00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:11.740
 When I say I'm going to take you to a hockey game, Henry,

00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:12.740
 then that's what I'm going to do.

00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:13.540
 But, Bobby--

00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:15.840
 I'm not going to palm off a masquerade on you instead.

00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:18.040
 But, Father, I can't get the hockey tickets.

00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:19.640
 I sold them to Kermit.

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:21.240
 What?

00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:22.440
 I see.

00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:23.840
 Excuse me, Henry.

00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:26.940
 Father, you mean you're going to change your mind again?

00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:27.740
 Alice?

00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:29.140
 I'm in the kitchen, Sam.

00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:30.140
 Well, look.

00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:32.440
 Would you like one of Mary's macaroons, dear?

00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:35.180
 No thank you. Alice I've been thinking it over.

00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:36.200
 Thinking what over?

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:39.700
 And while I made a promise to Henry, I also made a promise to you.

00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:40.560
 Yes but...

00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:42.300
 Henry's young. He'll get over it.

00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:44.540
 What as you? What as you?

00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:46.340
 Whereas I fought.

00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:50.580
 Alice would you explain to Henry that you insist I go to the masquerade with you?

00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:52.000
 But dear I can't.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:52.880
 You can't what?

00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:54.480
 I can't insist now.

00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:55.380
 What do you mean?

00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:58.040
 Elizabeth just phoned me and I'm going with someone else.

00:18:58.040 --> 00:19:02.020
 What? Alice do you mean to say you're going out tonight with some other man?

00:19:02.020 --> 00:19:03.420
 Well, who is he?

00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:05.320
 Frankly, dear, I don't know.

00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:07.120
 Elizabeth said it would be a surprise.

00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:08.520
 That's pretty unbelievable.

00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:10.320
 My fan, you're jealous.

00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:11.620
 Tell us, I am not.

00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:14.120
 Now, dear, you haven't a thing to worry about.

00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:16.020
 Alice, you're to call the whole thing off immediately.

00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:17.620
 But, Sam, I've given my word.

00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:18.120
 Alice?

00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:20.520
 And dear, I'm sure that once I've made a promise,

00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:22.020
 you wouldn't want me to break it off.

00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:24.520
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:34.920
 Henry, everything's all settled. You and I are going to that masquerade as a horse.

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:36.820
 But, Father, I thought you didn't want to.

00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:39.320
 Only I'm going as the front end, you understand.

00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:43.820
 But I can keep an eye on what I can watch, what I can see, what's going on.

00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:46.220
 But, Gee, whiz, Father, you're too late.

00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:46.720
 What, sir?

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:50.220
 Look, I just got the hockey ticket back from Kermit.

00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:51.020
 The hockey ticket?

00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:53.420
 Sure. I traded him something for them.

00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:55.520
 Kermit, Hannegan, you certainly have your nerves.

00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:57.720
 But, Mary, you said you wanted us to be secluded.

00:19:57.720 --> 00:19:59.620
 I never think so and so had no my life.

00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:02.020
 But Mary, you can be the front end.

00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:03.120
 Just a minute.

00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:04.620
 (audience laughing)

00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:05.900
 What's going on here?

00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:06.980
 I can tell you, Father.

00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:09.820
 Mr. Aldrich, would you try to explain something to Mary for me?

00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:10.740
 - Herman, I'm not dumb.

00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:12.380
 I don't need anything explained to me.

00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:13.220
 - Mr. Aldrich.

00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:14.220
 - I think I'll just stay out of there.

00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:16.380
 - But Mr. Aldrich, you're better at managing women

00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:17.220
 than I am.

00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:18.700
 - Who I?

00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:19.860
 - Hello, everybody.

00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:21.300
 How do you like my costume?

00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:22.660
 - Come on, I'll be very nice.

00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:24.780
 - I'm giving you one last chance here and now

00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:25.780
 to break your date.

00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:26.980
 - Mother, you have a date?

00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:28.020
 - Yes, dear.

00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:32.060

00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:33.780

00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:35.500

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:39.420
 Homer we're busy you are you mean you can't go with me

00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:44.860
 God heaven did you see what is Homer where did you get that beard

00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:48.980
 oh why you mean you're sure I'm winter

00:20:48.980 --> 00:20:50.980
 Oh, oh, oh, oh.

00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:52.980
 You gotta hold it 'til you laugh.

00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:54.980

00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:56.980
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:20:56.980 --> 00:21:12.980
 Father, Father, how do you feel now?

00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:14.980
 How do I look, Ted?

00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:16.980
 Frankly, terrible.

00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:18.580
 Then you know how I feel.

00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:22.780
 The only thing is there's only about ten minutes left in 1948.

00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:23.780
 Yes.

00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:28.180
 Wouldn't it be a better omen if you saw the new year in with a smile?

00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:29.780
 Perhaps you're right.

00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:30.980
 Father, you want to sit up?

00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:32.580
 No, I'm going to try.

00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:35.380
 Is a darn good hockey game, wasn't it, Father?

00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:36.980
 Yes, son, it was.

00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:38.980
 Until they carried me out.

00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:42.580
 Gee, that player who got thrown into your lap.

00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:44.380
 I think it did him good.

00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:45.580
 Well, I'm glad to hear it.

00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:51.180
 Sure, he just dusted himself off and jumped back on the ice and scored the winning goal.

00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:54.980
 Good for him. Now please hand me that steak again.

00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:58.980
 Sure. And how's your eye coming along, father?

00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:02.980
 She was, there's the phone. You stay right where you are, father, old-timer.

00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:04.580
 Aren't you in me?

00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:05.580
 Hello?

00:22:05.580 --> 00:22:07.380
 Hello, Henry. How was the hockey game?

00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:11.580
 Boy, mother, it was the best one I ever went to. How's the masquerade?

00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:12.980
 Just lovely, dear.

00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:14.580
 Did you win the grand prize?

00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:18.740
 No dear Homer upset the whole apple cart when he discovered his beard was made of

00:22:18.740 --> 00:22:26.020
 spun sugar. What happened? He ate it. And Henry may at least speak to your father.

00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:30.540
 Father, mother wants you on the phone. Mother, who did win the prize? Mary and

00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:35.100
 permit everyone thought they made a wonderful horse. Is that your mother Henry?

00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:40.260
 Sure father. You see who's at the door son. Sure father. Hello Alice. Sam I just

00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:43.380
 wanted to be the first one to say happy new year to you.

00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:45.980
 Well, I thank you, Alice, and the same to you.

00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:47.540
 Are you having a good time?

00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:50.460
 Frankly, they're not as good a time as if you were here.

00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:52.060
 Alice, I'm going to make everything up to you.

00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:54.500
 I haven't forgotten the promise, I made you.

00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:57.780
 Do you really mean we'll go out someplace every Saturday

00:22:57.780 --> 00:22:59.060
 night for the whole year?

00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:00.460
 Absolutely.

00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:04.980
 Well, my goodness, I'm certainly looking forward to 1949.

00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:05.620
 Father!

00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:06.380
 Father!

00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:07.620
 Oh, just a minute, Alice.

00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:09.180
 Father, guess who was at the door?

00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:09.660
 Who?

00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:13.460
 The man from the hockey rink and he wanted to know how your black eye was.

00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:13.960
 Yes.

00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:17.660
 And just to show there's no heart feelings, look what he gave us.

00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:20.360
 A season pass to all the hockey games.

00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:20.960
 What's that?

00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:23.460
 Every Saturday night for the whole year.

 But...

00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:29.460
 Happy New Year, Sam.

00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:31.460
 Happy New Year, Father.

00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:32.460
 Yes.

00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:33.860
 Well...
