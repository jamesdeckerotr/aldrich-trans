 They say that when you grow out of the teenage, it's like being expelled from paradise.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
 You can't ever go back.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 But you can recall that time of your life in the misadventures of Henry Aldrich.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 The scene opens in a neighbor's living room.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 Look out, Henry. Look out. You know how to work it.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 Homer, will you please keep your hands off the storm bank?

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
 -Hinch even with me, Pimpus. -Sure. I'll let you pump it when it's your turn.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 Now just keep your feet out of the way.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 See that, Henry? See that? You don't even know how to start.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 I don't too. Now, look out.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 What's so wonderful about that, Henry?

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 I give little little power into it that you can.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 How'd you win?

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 Homer, did you push something? What'd you do that for?

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 I didn't do anything, Henry.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000

 Now here, let's see whether you have this role of music in, right?

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000

 I've got to have a control home.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 Now listen, Homer, that's a nice thing to do.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 Push me right off somebody's piano store.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 I didn't push. I just wanted to sit down and play it.

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:55.460
 Because, Mother, I think he's the nicest boy I ever met.

00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:57.460
 I must have just lost my head.

00:07:57.460 --> 00:07:59.460
 What, certainly quite a way to lose your head.

00:07:59.460 --> 00:07:59.860
 a head.

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:13.220
 Would you like to look at the evening paper Sam?

00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:14.060
 No thanks Alice.

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:16.100
 I have something else to read here.

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:17.180
 Where?

00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:18.020
 Where's Henry?

00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:19.660
 He went out a little while ago.

00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:22.980
 Well Alice, you mind if I bring up an old question once more?

00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:24.420
 What's the matter Sam?

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:27.340
 Do you really feel that Henry gets very much from his association

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:28.340
 with Homer?

00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:32.740
 Why Sam Aldrich, do you realize how many worthwhile things Homer is really interested in?

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:33.940
 Frankly no.

00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:35.140
 Why he loves music.

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:38.640
 And tonight he's going over to call on some girl to like music just as much as he does.

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:39.140
 Yes?

00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:39.640
 Mother!

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:40.140
 Yes Mary!

00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:43.240
 You know who it was, Henry was talking to on the phone just before he went out?

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:44.140
 No, I don't, Mary.

00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:44.840
 Why do you ask?

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:49.140
 My mother, he was talking very low and making plans to do something I just know he shouldn't be doing.

00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:49.840
 What's that Mary?

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:50.840
 Yes, he was, Father.

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:54.940
 I heard him say he'd be in somebody's house right across the street from someplace looking out the window.

00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:59.940
 And if somebody got into some kind of trouble, he was to go to the window and pull down the shade, and Henry would see it and do something.

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:02.940
 Mary, may I ask what it is you're talking about?

00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:09.940
 No, Sam, the whole thing is perfectly clear. If Henry had gone with Homer instead of where he has gone, you wouldn't be sitting here worrying about what he's going to get into.

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:11.940
 (whistling)

00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:13.940

00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:15.940

00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:17.940

00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:19.940

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:21.940

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:25.940
 (whistling)

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:27.940
 Good evening, Homer. Would you come in?

00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:28.940
 Good evening, Mrs. Marco.

00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:29.940
 We're so glad to see you.

00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:31.940
 I don't know where we look forward to anything so much

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:33.940
 as we have to. You're coming over tonight.

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:34.940
 Have?

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:35.940
 Yes. Now, who's taking things off?

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:36.940
 White.

00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:38.940
 I don't think there's any sense in taking them off.

00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:40.700
 You can't say with your coat and gloves on.

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:41.540
 Yeah, let me have this.

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:43.180
 Well, hello there, young man.

00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:44.540
 Oh, hello, Mr. Ma.

00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:46.060
 Why, they tell me you're something pretty special

00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:47.100
 on the piano, my boy.

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:48.100
 They do?

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:50.340
 Well, gee, I'm not really that good, Mr. Ma.

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:51.900
 Well, come on, let's go in the living room.

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:53.820
 Is Ethel here?

00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:54.780
 Ethel?

00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:55.300
 Ethel?

00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:55.900
 Oh, yes, my goodness.

00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:56.460
 Where is she?

00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:57.460
 Ethel!

00:09:57.460 --> 00:09:58.940
 She had a spitting headache before dinner.

00:09:58.940 --> 00:09:59.860
 Oh, Ethel!

00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:00.980
 Oh, well, look, in that taste.

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:02.580
 Don't you think I might just as well go?

00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:03.060
 I mean--

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:04.380
 What are you here?

00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:07.380
 I mean, how am I having real idea right here?

00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:08.220
 Well, she was Ethel.

00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:09.220
 I was hoping...

00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:10.520
 I have the worst news for you, Homer.

00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:11.520
 You have?

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:12.520
 What do you think happened?

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:16.220
 I just discovered a few minutes ago that every string on my violin is broken.

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:17.220
 It is?

00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:18.220
 I mean they are.

00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:19.220
 Boy!

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:20.220
 But now, that's all they couldn't be all broken.

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:21.220
 Yes, they are, mother.

00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:22.220
 Well, that doesn't make any difference.

00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:24.220
 Right over there in that table drawer, there are a lot of strings.

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:25.220
 Not anymore, Father.

00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:26.220
 They all got thrown out by accident.

00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:27.220
 Well, that's too bad.

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:28.220
 Let's go to a movie.

00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:29.220
 Yeah, young man.

00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:32.220
 We've heard that we'll play the violin, but we've never heard you play the piano.

00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:34.220
 Come on, sit down now and give us a treat.

00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:35.220
 Yes, dear.

00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:36.220
 Well, not go on, Homer.

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:37.220
 Well...

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:39.220
 She was.

00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:41.220
 It's something to matter, Homer.

00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:43.220
 No. No.

00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:45.220
 Homer, that was very good.

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:47.220
 You like that?

00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:53.220
 Would you excuse me a minute while I pull a window shade down?

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:55.220
 This shade?

00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:56.220
 What do you have to do that for?

00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:58.220
 There's a street light outside of shining in my eyes.

00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:00.220
 Oh, I didn't realize.

00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:01.220
 Of course.

00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:03.220
 Do I... do I hear anything?

00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:05.220
 Do you hear anything, Homer? What is it?

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:06.060
 What is it?

00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:07.580
 - Right, it's not strange.

00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:08.980
 I thought I heard the telephone.

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:10.140
 - Really?

00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:11.260
 - Hey, did you hear the phone?

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:12.620
 - No, and I don't believe homework

00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:13.460
 would have heard it either.

00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:14.820
 The phone's down a order, all evening.

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:16.940
 - It's out of order, and you mean?

00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:18.020
 - Oh boy.

00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:19.900
 - Oh, but were you expecting a call?

00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:22.300
 - Wait, no, just in a way I would.

00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:24.420
 - Oh, come on Homer, let's hear the blue daddies.

00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:26.140
 You didn't need coaxing like this this morning.

00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:28.500
 My goodness, you just ripped right into that piano.

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:30.100
 - Oh, I don't need coaxing.

00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:30.940
 It's just--

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:32.620
 - Now young man, all I've heard all day

00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:34.820
 is that's what telling how you know your music.

00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:36.980
 I know but I know.

00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:38.180
 Right now Homer.

00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:40.100
 That window shade is hanging crooked.

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:42.020
 I want to let it up and pull it down again.

00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:46.020
 Oh, did you hit yourself?

00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:46.980
 I'm all right.

00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:48.980
 Steve, get the poor boy out from under that shade.

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:50.820
 I can't get off from under it, Mrs. Moffrey.

00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:52.340
 She whizzed.

00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:54.820
 Homer, what are you waving that hat inside of the window for?

00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:56.500
 Oh, am I waving again?

00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:56.980
 Yes, dear.

00:11:56.980 --> 00:11:58.820
 And if I were you, I'd put it down before you break it.

00:11:58.820 --> 00:11:59.460
 Yes ma'am.

00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:00.740
 She whizzed.

00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:04.740
 Well, I guess you want me to play the piano

00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:05.940
 Don't you think that's right?

00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:07.440
 Well.

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:13.340
 Did I hear something just the piano, dear?

00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:15.640
 There there it is.

00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:16.540
 That's the doorbell.

00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:17.040
 It is.

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:17.940
 It's the doorbell.

00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:20.240
 Whoever it is, don't answer the door until Homer is played.

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:21.740
 Now that's what we can't do a thing like that.

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:22.840
 All right, I'll go to the doorbell.

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:24.240
 But Homer, don't play like it.

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:25.140
 I won't.

00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:27.640
 Hello, what's the matter with your telephone?

00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:28.740
 I mean, where's Homer?

00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:29.240
 Where is he?

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:30.440
 I can't even know the thing room.

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:31.240
 Oh, hello, Henry.

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:32.740
 Boy, isn't this a coincidence.

00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:34.640
 Listen, Homer, I've been trying to get you on the phone.

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:36.140
 You've gotta come out with me right away.

00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:37.640
 I have, okay, where's my coat?

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:39.840
 Now Henry, homie, sit starting to play.

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:41.240
 You can't have him till he's finished.

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:43.240
 But Homer, you should've been out here long ago.

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:44.940
 Is it something pretty serious, Henry?

00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:46.640
 Boy, I'll say. Now get your things on.

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:48.840
 Well, we'll just have to take Ethel's way for it, Homer,

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:50.040
 about how well you can play.

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:52.540
 Or G, Mrs. Moffatt, you don't have to worry about that.

00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:54.340
 Boy, when Homer sits down at the piano--

00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:55.340
 Come on, Henry.

00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:57.440
 Do you know how long he studied music, Mrs. Moffatt?

00:12:57.440 --> 00:12:58.340
 Ten years.

00:12:58.340 --> 00:12:59.040
 Ten years?

00:12:59.040 --> 00:12:59.940
 That's right, Mr. Moffatt.

00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:00.940
 That gives you some idea.

00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:01.940
 Come on, Henry.

00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:04.540
 And, jeez, you are here in turn to Pat Aruski's menu at.

00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:06.140
 - Really? - Henry, will you come on?

00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:07.540
 - Goodbye, Homer. - Goodbye.

00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:09.940
 Nice young man.

00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:11.140
 Yes, Steve.

00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:12.340
 You know what I think?

00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:14.340
 The problem committee has been trying to get somebody

00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:16.140
 for the Women's Club meeting this Friday,

00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:18.340
 and he's a very person for us to have.

00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:20.340
 Well, they've got to be one of your children.

00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:22.340
 We're going to have some readings,

00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:25.140
 and if Mrs. Hardy's going to give a talk on native flowers,

00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:28.340
 and a solo from Homer would be just the thing to top it all off.

00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:47.660

 Right now it's intermission and time for our intermission guests.

00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:54.540
 The one and only Tommy Dorsey.

00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:55.740
 Okay Tommy.

 Now getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldrich and his friend Homer Brown.

00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:35.800
 Just because Homer led his girl into believing he was musically inclined,

00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:38.800
 when he was really operating a neighbor's automatic player piano,

00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:43.800
 he has now received an invitation to play a solo at a meeting of the local women's club.

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:47.800
 The scene opens in Homer's living room. His mother is speaking.

00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:50.800
 Homer, I don't want to hear this subject even mentioned again.

00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:52.800
 Yes, mother. You're going to play it that meeting of the women's club

00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:54.800
 and you're going to do a very nice job of it.

00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:56.800
 Put 'em on the women and look at it this way.

00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:59.800
 Doing a thing like this to me can make me hate music forever.

00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:01.960
 Homer, do you realize what this whole thing means to me?

00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:05.440
 But ten years I've been coaxing you, I've been begging you to keep on with your lessons.

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:08.440
 And now I don't have a clear sky, somebody certainly appreciates you,

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:09.640
 and you ought to say no to them.

00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:12.400
 But don't you realize Ms. Snyder gave me up as hopeless?

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:14.640
 She said she wouldn't even give me lessons anymore.

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:18.840
 And that's why I want you to go in this concert with your chin out and show Ms. Snyder.

00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:19.840
 Oh boy.

00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:21.720
 Now don't take that attitude here.

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:24.280
 When I think of all the money we've poured into Ms. Snyder...

00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:25.720
 Oh boy.

00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:28.000
 And before you do anything, please answer the phone.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.480
 Yes, mother.

00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:30.120
 Hello.

00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:31.480
 Hello, Homer. This is Enrich.

00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:32.480
 He was where are you?

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:33.980
 I'm at Robinson's music store.

00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:35.280
 I think I found something for you.

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:36.080
 What is it?

00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:39.380
 It's called Learn to Play the Professional Way in Less than a Day.

00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:40.180
 What's that?

00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:41.180
 Less than a Day?

00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:41.880
 Sure.

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:43.480
 And you've got a Day in a Half.

00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:44.880
 Boy, you're sitting 30.

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:45.880
 Well, gee.

00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:47.480
 Does it cover the blue Daniel?

00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:48.180
 Oh, wait a minute.

00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:49.880
 Now look in the book and see.

00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:50.680
 No.

00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:51.980
 No, there's no blue Daniel.

00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:52.680
 None at all.

00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:54.180

00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:54.780
 What's that?

00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:56.780
 And in Flocially Sweet Afton.

00:19:56.780 --> 00:19:57.980
 But no blue Daniel.

00:19:57.980 --> 00:20:00.180
 What's the difference, Homer? The sweet atom's a river!

00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:02.980
 But the point is, Henry, I've started to learn the blue Daniel,

00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:06.380
 but I don't want to switch rivers practically in the middle of a concert, do I?

00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:09.380
 - Homer! - In just a minute, Henry. Yes, Mother?

00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:10.680
 Could you mind the door, please?

00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:12.980
 Okay, Henry, I'm gonna go. Goodbye.

00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:15.480
 Oh, my God, I asked her to start your practicing.

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:17.280
 Mother, I was talking on the telephone.

00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:19.780
 I was trying to make a decision about which river.

00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:21.480
 Hello, there, Mrs. Brown. Hello, Homer.

00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:22.880
 Hello, Mrs. Murphy. What'd you come in?

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:23.880
 Hello, Mrs. Murphy.

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:25.880
 My goodness, I've never been so upset in my life.

00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:27.080
 I came right over to tell you.

00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:28.120
 Really? What's the mathematics?

00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:30.320
 I don't know what we're going to do.

00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:32.480
 We've set the announcements out for the program and everything,

00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:35.080
 and now I learn that we can't have any piano where we're meeting.

00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:36.280
 What's that? No piano?

00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:36.880
 Will she...

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:38.480
 No piano at all?

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:40.080
 Well, really, Mrs. Moth, did I?

00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:42.280
 I don't yet think you can just call me a house or thing like that.

00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:44.680
 But home has been planning to do this and getting ready for it,

00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:46.080
 ever since you invited him.

00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:50.280
 Oh, why don't you go down to Robin's music store and ask them to loan you a piano?

00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:51.280
 They'd be glad to do it.

00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:51.880
 They would.

00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:52.880
 Now, wait a minute, Mother.

00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:55.480
 I mean, how would you get the piano over there?

00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:57.480
 Your father can loan you one of his trucks.

00:20:57.480 --> 00:20:59.680
 And you can get Henry as every other boy to help you move.

00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:01.080
 I know, but now Homer.

00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:03.680
 Whether the will is a way, you're going to get that piano

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:04.980
 and you're going to play.

00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:22.480
 - Sam, will you have some bacon? - No, thank you, Alice.

00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:23.980
 Now, the adults sit there and salt

00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:26.420
 Just because I want you to go to that concert this afternoon.

00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:28.080
 Alice, I am not sulky.

00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:30.760
 I simply want to point out that you're asking me to sit through a program

00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:32.080
 in which I'll hear some readings,

00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:34.720
 a talk on native plants and home of brown play the piano.

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:36.080
 But, Margaret, for charity.

00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:38.680
 Yes, and I've supported that charity no blip for seven years,

00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:39.960
 but this is asking too much.

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:40.880
 Hi, Henry.

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:42.180
 She was Homer's at you?

00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:42.920
 Yes, sure.

00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:43.760
 Good morning, Homer.

00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:45.280
 This must be quite a day for you.

00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:46.320
 Boy, I'll say.

00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:48.080
 I didn't sleep a wink last night.

00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:49.960

00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:57.880
 - Will you have some breakfast, Helma?

00:21:57.880 --> 00:21:59.800
 - No thanks, I couldn't eat a thing.

00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:01.400

00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:05.920
 - Number please.

00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:07.120
 - Ellam 212.

00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:08.480
 - Ellam 212?

 - Henry, come back and finish your breakfast.

00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:12.680
 - Yes, mother. Homer, I'll be right back.

00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:13.520
 - Hello?

00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:16.160
 - Hello, is this you, Ethel? This is Homer.

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:17.200
 - Oh, hello, Homer.

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:19.920
 - Look, could you tell your mother it looks as though

00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:21.560
 we can have the piano?

00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:22.800
 - Oh my goodness, why not?

00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:25.400
 Well, we can't use my father's truck, see?

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:27.200
 It's a pretty new one, see?

00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:30.200
 Well, he's afraid the piano would scratch you.

00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:31.600
 Homer, what are we gonna do?

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:35.200
 Well, what I was gonna suggest was, why don't you play the violin?

00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:37.200
 Oh, I... play the violin!

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:39.600
 Sure, at least you wouldn't have to hold it in the truck.

00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:42.000
 And listen, Ethel, would you like to go to the movies tonight?

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:43.000
 To the movie?

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.000
 Sure, but I don't think I've got a call for you.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:46.600
 I'll meet you down at the movie, see?

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:47.600

00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:48.600

00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:50.600
 Homer, did you get old people?

00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:52.200
 I'll say, boy!

00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:54.300
 Homer, are you sure you won't have a little breakfast with us?

00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:58.200
 Wait, as a matter of fact, Mrs. Old, which I think I would enjoy a little.

00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:01.200
 Whether you take this plate out in the kitchen, you'll find some scrambled eggs.

00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:03.000
 And give me some too, Homer. Okay.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.200
 Well, do you know how I suddenly feel? They never felt better in my life.

00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:07.200
 What happened to Homer?

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:10.700
 Sam, I think Homer has a right to feel rather pleased with himself today.

00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:14.200
 Now, Henry, don't you wish you'd gone on with your music as I begged you to do?

00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:14.700
 Well...

00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:18.200
 Down at the bottom of your heart, Henry, don't you wish just a bit you were in Homer's shoes?

00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:21.200
 Well, I... and Sam, it's really your fault as much as it is, Henry.

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:22.020
 My fault.

00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:24.200
 Yes, dear. If you backed me up five years ago,

00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:25.840
 then you'd be hearing Henry instead of Homer

00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:27.560
 when you go to that concert this afternoon.

00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:28.800
 What do you mean when I go to it?

00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:29.640
 I'll answer the phone.

00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:31.400
 As a matter of fact, Henry, I think it's a shame

00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:33.680
 for you not to try to piano once more.

00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:34.520
 Hello?

00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:36.720
 Hello? I want to speak to Homer Brown.

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:37.460
 To who?

00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:38.060
 Palmer?

00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:38.600
 Yes, sir.

00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:39.440
 To Homer.

00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:40.440
 Hey, Homer.

00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:41.120
 What Henry?

00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:41.720
 What is it?

00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:43.360
 You weren't on the telephone.

00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:45.480
 Do you want to just an impulse mother, is it?

00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:46.480
 No, it's some man.

00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:47.840
 We'll hear Homer eggs.

00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:48.560
 Hello?

00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:51.160
 Homer, may I ask just what this is all about?

00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:52.660
 What's that? Who is this?

00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:53.660
 It's your father!

00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:55.860
 Have you been spreading rumors behind my bag?

00:23:55.860 --> 00:23:57.160
 Spreading my father?

00:23:57.160 --> 00:23:59.560
 When did I ever tell you that I was afraid of piano?

00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:00.860
 What scratched my trunk?

00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:02.660
 Oh, did they say that?

00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:04.660
 Mrs. Muffin just phoned me here in the house.

00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:07.860
 And Homer, your mother says you're going to get the boys together

00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:10.360
 and go down to Robinson's music store and get that piano.

00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:11.060
 Understand?

00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:11.860
 Yes, father.

00:24:11.860 --> 00:24:13.860
 And you're going to play in that concert?

00:24:13.860 --> 00:24:14.460
 Goodbye.

00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:15.760
 Goodbye, father.

00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:16.860
 Here's your eggs, Homer.

00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:18.060
 My eggs.

00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:19.460
 What would I do with those?

00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:21.460
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:36.700
 I'm sure that these guys are the reason we do just listen to.

00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:38.940
 In fact, up to now, we've enjoyed our entire program,

00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:40.220
 I'm sure.

00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:41.700
 Before introducing the next number,

00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:42.860
 however, there will have to be-- I'm

00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:46.140
 afraid-- a slight inhibition of a half a minute or so.

00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:48.660
 So if you'll just excuse me, I'll have to step back stage

00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:50.200
 make sure about something.

00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:51.740
 Sam, what are you supposed to trouble is?

00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:54.340
 Alice, how did we have to sit right down here in the front row?

00:24:54.340 --> 00:24:56.700
 Because, dear, I thought it would please Homer's mother.

00:24:56.700 --> 00:24:59.140
 Look, it will brown over there in the next row.

00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:01.220
 Anyone would think Homer was something wonderful.

00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:02.580
 Now, Sam, can you blame him?

00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:05.580
 Perhaps a year from now, you'll feel just as proud as he does.

00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:06.520
 How do you say that?

00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:08.020
 You seem to snider over there.

00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:09.420
 I just had a talk with this amateur.

00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:11.020
 She's promised to come over to the house tomorrow

00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:12.460
 so Henry can start his lessons again.

00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:13.360
 Watch that, Alice.

00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:15.460
 Now, there, ladies and gentlemen.

00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:18.360
 I may as well tell you quite frankly what the trouble was.

00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:20.440
 The summer isn't a piano we're trying to borrow.

00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:22.360
 It was not delivered when it should have been.

00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:25.760
 However, I'm very pleased to announce that I have some good news for you.

00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:27.760
 The boys have arrived with the piano,

00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:29.760
 and if you'll bear with us for another half minutes,

00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:31.760
 they'll roll it on to the stage.

00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:35.960
 - Then there's Henry. - I see him. Don't quite, Alice.

00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:38.360
 After all all he's doing is pushing the piano.

00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:40.560
 I know, dear, but he hasn't any next time.

00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:42.760
 Alice, why doesn't all my help push the piano?

00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:44.760
 Because he's probably saving himself.

00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:46.760
 And now, ladies and gentlemen,

00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:49.760
 I'm sure we're all going to have a great deal of pleasure in listening to one of our

00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:52.960
 sounds of forthcoming musicians shall I say.

00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:56.560
 Pomer Brown, whose selection will be the Blue Danube by Spouse.

00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:59.160
 But perhaps I should say by Jay Spouse.

00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:02.360
 Homer, I'll turn the rest of our program over to you.

 Oh, oh, oh, yeah, remember.
