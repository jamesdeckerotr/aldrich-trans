 And now the Jell-O family presents Henry Henry Olve. Come here, mother.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
 [Applause]

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
 That is the Olve family based on parishes originated by politicalists,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
 I'm sorry, every song of Henry, just Jackie's help as well.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 And yes, it's the Jell-O family.

 And now Henry Olga.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.960
 And Henry has a bounce all his own.

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.040
 The scene opens at the Aldrich breakfast table.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.360
 More coffee, Sam.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.800
 Thank you, Alice.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.440
 What have you spoke of in the henry this morning?

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:26.880
 Got into him in what way?

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:27.760
 Oh, my goodness.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.600
 Didn't you hear him in the bathroom?

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.440
 He was brushing his teeth and whistling

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.120
 at the top of his lungs.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:34.720
 Alice, that can't be done.

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.000
 Well, there he was doing it.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.640
 It sounded like that piece from Rigoletto.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.160
 All four parts?

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.160
 It's too early in the morning for Joe.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.160
 Good morning, Mother. Good morning, Father.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:46.160
 Good morning, Father.

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.160
 Yeah. How do you feel?

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.160
 Oh, I wonder. Pass the cereal, please.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.160
 You're good. Eat cereal voluntarily.

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.160
 Oh, sure, Mother. If there's one thing I feel like this morning,

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.160
 it's great, not.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.160
 See, stick out your tongue. My tongue?

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.160
 No, I'll let it.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.160
 Oh, I'll let it in.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.160
 Henry, it's necessary for you to be in quite such good spirit.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.160
 You're worrying, your mother.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:15.160
 Well, I was gonna save it for a surprise, but what's the best news in the world I could give both of you?

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.160
 You've discovered oil and I can retire.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.160
 Father!

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.160
 Henry, you passed your history exam.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.160
 Ask that mother. I got the highest mark in the class.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.160
 Sam, did you hear that?

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.160
 I think I did, but I'd like to hear it again.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.160
 The highest finish?

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.160
 Sure. Well, that's fine, sir.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.160
 The highest mark imagined my song.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.160
 Well, that's not the good news.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.160
 I'm going to be the regular shortstop on the baseball team.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.160
 What?

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.160
 That's nice. Congratulations, Henry.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.160
 Nice, mother.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.160
 Only try to be careful when the other boys tackle you.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.160
 Mother!

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.160
 Well, Henry, shortstop, eh?

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.160
 Yes, sir.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.160
 First thing, eh?

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.160
 First thing, well, well, well, well.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.160
 When did Coach Nelson tell you, Henry?

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.160
 Tell me what?

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.160
 He kept you with the first thing, shortstop.

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.520
 He didn't exactly tell me in so many words, Father.

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:07.020
 No.

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.760
 I'm not in so many words.

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:09.760
 What did he tell you?

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.560
 Well, Father, I didn't have to be told.

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:12.760
 It's obvious.

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.260
 Sam, let him finish his breakfast.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.200
 He'll be late for school.

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.560
 In a moment, Alice.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.960
 And they would do mind telling me how it is obvious.

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.360
 Father, do you remember Steve Armstrong?

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.560
 Wasn't he the regular shortstop last season?

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:24.840
 Sure, that's just it.

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.120
 He's not around this year.

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.160
 He had a fortunate accident.

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.720
 Accident.

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.960
 Sure, he graduated.

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.760
 When his nomination moved to Abbott City,

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.100
 and that's just like Willie Marshall and me.

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:36.800
 And you're that much better than Willie?

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.640
 No, but he flunked his history exam

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.140
 and so he's ineligible.

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.880
 And don't you think I'm a pushover?

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.440
 No, suppose some boy you don't even know about shows up

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.480
 at practice and take short stuff away from you.

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.520
 Father, you're talking just like a lawyer.

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.080
 I am a lawyer.

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.520
 Santa, hand me to your confidant, he's a pushover.

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.720
 Well, that's, he's just counting his chickens

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:56.560
 before their hats.

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.840
 But, gee, was they even gave me a uniform?

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.560
 That's how sad I am.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.240
 You had a uniform last year?

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.040
 Sure, but this one fits.

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.880
 And he even got another on it.

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:07.780
 He was last year.

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.440
 They wouldn't let anyone know who I was.

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.040
 And the evidence certainly sounds very convincing.

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.360
 Alex, I'm not saying Henry won't be the shortstop.

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.240
 I just think he ought to keep quiet about it

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:18.240
 until he's certain.

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:19.040
 But, Paul--

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.200
 Then Henry, there'll be no chance

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.840
 of you making a fool of yourself.

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.440
 Hey, Henry.

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:24.320
 Oh, she was--

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:25.920
 Is that a homer already?

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.360
 I had the same reaction.

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.880
 I'll be right with you, Homer.

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.280
 Henry, your breakfast.

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:31.200
 Mother, I finished all.

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.200
 But a few great nuts and I'll crunch them on the way to school.

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.200
 Hi, Homer.

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.200
 Henry, hurry up. We're gonna be late.

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:38.200
 What are you eating?

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.200
 Not in my breakfast.

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:40.200
 Yeah?

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:45.200
 If I ever mention I'm crazy about great enough, Homer, I need my strength.

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.200
 Oh, do you mind if I hold my palm under and catch what falls?

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.200
 Okay.

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.200
 What are you gonna do with that glove?

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.200
 This glove? This baseball glove?

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:55.200
 Yeah.

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:56.200
 Nothing, Homer. Nothing.

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.200
 Oh, it's across the street.

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.200
 Henry, are you turning out to the team again?

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.200
 I'm trying out power if you only knew.

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:04.200
 You know what?

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:06.200
 I think I'm a...

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.200
 And quit trying to make me make a fool of myself.

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:09.200
 Can we tell me?

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:10.200
 No.

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:11.200
 Please.

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:12.200
 No!

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:13.200
 It'll be on my mind all day.

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:16.200
 I have enough trouble concentrating on my curriculum.

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:17.200
 Well...

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.200
 ...comer...

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:20.200
 ...can you keep your mouth shut?

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.200
 You know me, Henry.

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:22.200
 That's what I mean.

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.200
 Can you keep your mouth shut?

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.200
 Scout on!

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:27.200
 Well, look.

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.200
 I'll tell you this and no more.

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.200
 Did you know Steve Armstrong is out of school?

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:33.200
 Sure.

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.200
 The lucky dog graduated.

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.200
 Well did you also know Tommy Dixon moved to Abbott City?

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:38.200
 Yeah.

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:39.200
 And did you know Willie Marshall?

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.200
 Plant history and it's ineligible.

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:43.200
 Can we hear the new short stop?

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:45.200
 The Homer stop putting words into my mouth.

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:56.200
 I had a few of those white books.

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:57.200
 Yeah, I was just about to hear it.

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:58.200
 Come on, come on.

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:01.200
 - Henry! Henry, wait for me!

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:03.200
 - Kathleen, what are you doing on the bowl field

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:05.200
 in civilian clothes?

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:09.200
 - Henry, Toby Smith, just tell me you were all set for shortstop.

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:11.200
 - Well, she was. Toby told you that?

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:12.200
 - Yeah.

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:14.200
 - Well, gee, who is?

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:18.200
 - That just shows how people twist innocent little statements around.

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:22.200
 All I said to Toby was that when he takes the official pictures of the team,

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:26.200
 I'd like an enlargement of shortstop to give them to my mother on her birthday.

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:28.800
 Oh, then it is true.

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:34.680
 Well, all I can tell you, Kathleen, is that at the end of the season, I may have a little

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:36.680
 something for your charm bracelet.

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:37.680
 My charm bracelet?

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:40.440
 And it isn't gold, is it?

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:41.440
 Well, I had my thing.

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:42.440
 And love?

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:43.440
 Well, I...

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:46.440
 And you're giving me your gold bar sitting face for...

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:49.440
 And now, Kathleen, I didn't mention anything specifically.

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:52.280
 Okay, well, you wouldn't be able to go over here.

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:53.280
 Oh, boy, that's Coach Nelson.

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:54.280
 I have to go now, Kathleen.

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:56.040
 - I'm gonna get my car, can you?

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:58.540
 - I'm gonna get you, wait for me!

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:01.040
 - All right, were you calling on, coach?

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:02.240
 - Yes, get out there, sure.

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:04.040
 I'm gonna hit some grounders for feeling practice.

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:05.120
 - Sure thing, coach.

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:06.880
 - Now, that's where the old pepper boys come on.

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:07.720
 - I'm coming on, I'm coming on.

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:09.280
 - Let's go, guys, get me old pepper,

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:12.240
 the old pepper, old pepper, old boy, old boy, old boy!

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:14.920
 - Okay, here it comes, all right.

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:16.560
 - I got a little waterfall!

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:18.560
 - Oh, he's coming on!

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:20.200
 - He was where did it go?

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:21.400
 - He's playing your leg.

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:23.600
 - But did, how to get down there?

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:26.840
 Okay, fine again, over. Get down a little lower.

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:28.160
 Here come.

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:29.520
 I got it, Paul!

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:32.020
 No!

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:35.200
 He was, was that the ball that bounced over my head?

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:37.160
 Oh, which I didn't mean that low.

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:40.160
 Coach, are you sure those balls are perfectly round?

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:40.820
 No.

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:42.520
 What's the matter with you?

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:46.800
 Well, I don't want you to think I'm making excuses, Coach, but...

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:48.560
 You see this, Glove.

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:49.720
 What's wrong with it?

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:51.640
 I'm glad you asked.

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:55.640
 She was my father used it to rip barbed wire off the backyard fence.

00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:56.340
 I see.

00:07:56.340 --> 00:08:00.140
 But I'm planning on taking it to the shoemakers right after we're through.

00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:01.540
 And maybe you better do it now.

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:03.140
 You're excused with the rest of practice.

00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:04.840
 Okay everybody, over the sliding fence.

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:07.740
 Thanks, coach, and you'll see a big difference tomorrow.

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:08.740
 Hi!

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:09.940
 She was Agman.

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:11.940
 Why can't I not claw out of you?

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:13.740
 I might claw out of your shed.

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:14.940
 Agnes, quit!

00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:16.440
 That's my throwing hand.

00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:19.440
 Say you won't be getting too gall-based, Bob, will you?

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:20.840
 Well, she was.

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:22.600
 Did Kathleen tell you about that?

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:24.240
 No, Margot Hammersmith.

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:26.720
 Well, how could she? I don't even know her.

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:28.440
 Sure, but she poncied our job,

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:30.360
 and Lubble poncied our Kathleen.

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:32.200
 Boy, where's Kathleen now?

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:34.160
 So we're being pumped by Nancy Adams.

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:36.720
 So we're saving you to get a good old baseball,

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:39.080
 you won't forget your old power, Agnes Lee.

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:41.480
 Well, listen Agnes, I'll thank you not to go counting any chickens.

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:42.520
 But when did I do that?

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:44.400
 You know, darn well, the next thing you know,

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:47.640
 it'll be all over school, and there I'll be making a fool of myself.

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:49.680
 Listen, kid, you don't have to worry about me.

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:51.980
 I can keep a secret as well as the next dog.

00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:53.980
 Sweet John, wait a minute!

00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:57.480
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:06.680
 Good morning, Mr. Bradley.

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:07.120
 Oh, yes.

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:08.040
 Come in, Mr. Nelson.

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:09.280
 You wanted the scene, Ian?

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:10.480
 Yes, I did, Mr. Bradley.

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:12.880
 If it's about new equipment for your baseball team,

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:15.640
 Mr. Nelson, I must warn you that the entire school is

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:17.680
 on a very strict budget this year.

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:18.360
 Budget?

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:22.080
 But Mr. Bradley, the number of broken bats we had last year

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:24.560
 when balanced against the results achieved

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:26.280
 was quite often proportion.

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:27.580
 Quite often proportion.

00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:28.880
 Well, I'm aware of that, Mr. Bradley,

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:30.640
 and that isn't the reason I'm here.

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:32.040
 It's about Willie Marshall.

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:32.700
 Willie?

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:33.280
 Yes.

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:34.920
 We've been practicing for nearly a week now,

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:37.280
 and well, couldn't you ask Ms. Eggleston

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:39.080
 to let him take a makeup exam?

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:41.440
 Well, no, I'm not sure I could do a thing like that,

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:42.120
 Mr. Nelson.

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:43.880
 Mr. Bradley, he's our best shortstop.

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:45.960
 We're not here to play baseball, Mr. Nelson.

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:48.160
 The boy is expected to have scholastic standing.

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:52.160
 I know then that one thing really seems to have very little love.

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:55.160
 Oh, well, hey, but our first game is this coming Friday.

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:58.160
 And if I can't get Willie, I'll have to use Henry Orrich at shortstop.

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:01.160
 Henry? Yes. At shortstop? Yes.

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:05.160
 I'm, uh... He's five-starred enough, but he just isn't up to it.

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:08.160
 So if you could put a little pressure on Miss Eggleston,

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:12.160
 uh, Mr. Nelson, I am afraid. This is a matter for Miss Eggleston to decide for herself.

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:15.160
 Oh, well, I tried. I'd better get back to my chemistry class.

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:18.940
 chemistry class yes you better I hope it's still there when I left Homer Brown was

00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:24.120
 trying to make synthetic rock over hurry mr. Nelson and would you ask

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:28.920
 this shade to step in here please Mr. Bradley would like to see you yes

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:32.740
 it's rather would you say to know to me take a step and say I'd like to see her

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:36.880
 when she's free yes mr. Bradley tell her it's about that series of slides on the

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:40.240
 wall of 1812 she's been asking for but mr. Bradley I thought you decided we

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:44.200
 couldn't afford though I know mr. but it certainly won't hurt to discuss the matter

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:57.080
 Well, good morning, Mr. Albers. Good morning, your head's a...

00:10:57.080 --> 00:11:01.080
 Has that new golf bag I wanted to ride? Why, no, Mr. Albers.

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:03.200
 I told you it probably wouldn't be until the end of the month.

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:06.200
 That's right, you're dead. I'll call you when I arrive.

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:07.200
 Good. Good.

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:12.200
 Say, as long as I'm here, what have you in the way of baseball gloves?

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:13.200
 baseball glove?

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:17.000
 I'm not even a market for one yet, you understand, but it can't hurt the price what you have.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.400
 So the glove you have in mind isn't stock right now.

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:21.200
 The one made especially for short stock.

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:22.200
 Short stock?

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:24.200
 Yes, isn't that position Henry plays on the team?

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:25.200
 Yes.

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:26.200
 That is, no.

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:29.200
 That is, how did you, well, you see when, not at all, sure, yes.

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:30.200
 No?

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:32.200
 Well, I heard from a number of people that he's all set.

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:33.200
 You had?

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:36.200
 Yes, as a matter of fact, I was discussing it just yesterday with Walter Trumbull.

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:38.200
 And he lives at Mrs. Tonkins, you know.

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:39.200
 So what is that to do?

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:43.440
 Tomkins brothers generally down at the school so it's right from the horse's mouth you might say

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:46.240
 Well, is that cool? Yes

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:51.640
 Well, I'll tell you as long as I'm here. I might as well get that blob after all. I'll have to order from Chicago

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:53.920
 You have it in a week a week, but the first game is Friday

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:57.520
 Call Chicago and tell them to rush it out air mail with mr. All Richard will call out

00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:01.240
 Pay the additional charges. We can't have the first drink short stop playing in a ripped glove

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:05.960
 Come in

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:07.880
 I'm going to see me.

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:08.640
 Oh, yes, Henry.

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:09.560
 Come here.

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:10.640
 Thanks, Coach.

00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:12.760
 Did I mention all your worries are over?

00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:13.240
 They are.

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:13.800
 Sure.

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:15.920
 Boy, I'm getting a glove that's so foolproof.

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:17.520
 They practically refund your money

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:19.160
 if you make a narrow with it.

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:19.760
 Fine, Henry.

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:20.800
 Fine.

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:22.920
 Henry, the reason I called you in.

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:24.200
 Yes, Coach?

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:26.080
 The reason I called you in.

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:28.480
 Henry, you know what I admire about you most?

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:29.480
 What, Coach?

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:30.440
 Your spirit.

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:31.040
 Yes, sir.

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:33.000
 Coming out for the team year after year.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.680
 Never getting discouraged.

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:35.760
 You know what that proves to me?

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:36.260
 Why?

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:39.760
 But you realize that isn't only the man in the pictures, mounters, important.

00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:43.260
 Oh, gee, Lee, sure, the shortstop's pretty important, too.

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:46.760
 Of course, but the man behind the scenes is sometimes just as valuable.

00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:47.560
 He is?

00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:50.060
 That's why I feel I can give you a job like this.

00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:54.560
 Because you'll realize that tutoring Willie is as important as being out there on the field yourself.

00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:55.260
 Why?

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:58.560
 Henry, Ms. Eggleston has agreed to give Willie a make-up exam tomorrow.

00:12:58.560 --> 00:12:59.260
 But Coach, I...

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:00.260
 So what do you say, Henry?

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:01.560
 I know you can help him.

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:03.960
 You've got the highest marks in the class on that exam.

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:05.960
 Why

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:16.160
 Could I sort of get something straighten out in my mind first sure Henry well if will he passes he'll play shortstop in the game tomorrow

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:19.680
 Won't he why yes, but you'll be the one who made it possible. Oh

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:22.800
 So Henry, would you do it?

00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:26.440
 Why

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:32.520
 Sure Henry, I'd like to shake your hand sure coach. Hey, shake. Yes, sir

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:34.780
 You've really got the kind of spirit I admire.

00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:36.620
 She was. That's okay, cuz.

00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:40.520
 I'm always glad to do what I can for the team.

00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:48.520
 [music]

00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:49.520
 Oh!

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:52.520
 The Big Red Letter stands for the Yellow Family.

00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:56.520
 Oh! The Big Red Letter stands for the Yellow Family.

00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:57.520
 That's Yellow.

00:13:57.520 --> 00:13:58.520
 Yum, yum, yum.

00:13:58.520 --> 00:13:59.520
 Yellow.

00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:00.520
 What a jump, yum, yum.

00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:11.520
 Yes, there are desserts for everybody's family and the jello family of yum yum desserts,

00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:17.240
 like those swell jello tapioca puddings, a miracle of goodness, a marvel of speed, and

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:20.040
 jello tapioca puddings are ready prepared.

00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:23.280
 All you do is add milk and cook for about five minutes.

00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:28.600
 There's jello vanilla tapioca, luscious light and mellow, jello chocolate tapioca rich and

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:30.000
 candy good.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.880
 orange coconut tapioca tangy orange blended with tropical coconut and you

00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:39.440
 know that name jello is a trademark it's the property of general foods and it

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:44.120
 tells you you're getting a genuine jello product and remember more people by

00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:49.960
 jello puddings than any other prepared puddings in the world

00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:59.400
 And now getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldrich.

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:03.400
 Henry has been so confident he was going to make short stop on the baseball team

00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:06.400
 that he spread the rumor all over school.

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:09.400
 Then Coach Nelson asked him to help Willie Marshall

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:13.400
 ask him to make up his Sam which would enable Willie to play short stop.

00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:17.400
 The scene opens in the Aldrich living room. It is after dinner.

00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:19.400
 Mother his father very upset.

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:23.400
 You know there he just got a walk in the fresh air might do in good.

00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:26.120
 But in the future, Henry, when you have news like that,

00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:28.320
 to tell him why not wait until after dinner.

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:31.040
 Hey, hey, my dear, when it comes,

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:33.200
 I put a bowl of fruit in the living room.

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:34.840
 Hi, Harold, Henry.

00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:36.640
 Here I brought something to cheer you up.

00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:37.440
 What is it?

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:38.000
 Bubble gum.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.360
 I made it in chemistry.

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:41.360
 [LAUGHTER]

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:44.600
 And you're not really going to go through with helping, really, are you?

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:46.040
 Oh, I promised to be cold.

00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:47.560
 You'll be cutting your own throat.

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:51.000
 I know besides Willie's too dumb to teach anything to.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.080
 Well, it's you.

00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:55.080
 You dumb, Homer, have you ever tried to do business with him?

00:15:55.080 --> 00:16:00.080
 I know, Henry. I know. But when it comes to history, he comes apart at the scenes.

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:05.080
 She was the only thing the Sega fans ever been able to make him understand is the Louisiana purchase.

00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:08.080
 That's true. And she's a professional.

00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:09.080
 That's okay.

00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:11.080
 Homer, you're right. If it would...

00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:14.080
 Moza would do Willie any good, I'd be glad to make the sacrifice.

00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:15.080
 Hey, Henry!

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:17.080
 Here he is. And tell him you're not gonna do it.

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:18.080
 Hiya, fellas.

00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:20.080
 Well, here I am, Hannah. Uh, uh, look, Willie.

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:22.680
 Boy, I sure appreciate what you're doing for me, Henry.

00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:24.080
 - Oh, but-- - Willie, I've been thinking

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:26.080
 the whole thing over and I've decided,

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:28.580
 well, it isn't that you're hopeless, you understand?

00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:30.480
 - I'm sorry, please answer the phone.

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:33.080
 - When I'm just about to break the news to Willie.

00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:34.380
 - What's with about what, Henry?

00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:36.380
 - See if please answer it, I'm busy.

00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:38.080
 - Henry, wait here, Willie.

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:39.380
 - What am I hope with about Homer?

00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:41.380
 - You're fine, now, please.

00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:42.380
 - Hello?

00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:44.080
 - I am. This is Toby Smith.

00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:45.080
 - Hi.

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:47.080
 - Do you have a picture of yourself with a school paper?

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:48.080
 - Of me?

00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:51.680
 We're gonna run a story on how you're sacrificing your skill for the good of the school

00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:57.200
 Well Toby about that boy a lot of kids in the school have changed their entire conception of your character

00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:01.520
 They have but so bring a picture to school tomorrow, will you so long, man?

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:04.520
 But Toby oh boy

00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:10.300
 Is it alright to let willy have an apple considering you're throwing him out in a few minutes?

00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:14.100
 Oh, I can throw him out now. I've got to try to help him pass

00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:15.360
 Are you crazy?

00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:18.600
 Or if I don't, I won't be able to show my face around the school again.

00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:20.700
 But if you do, you will play short-stop.

00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:23.400
 I know Homer, that's the spot I'm in.

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:24.900
 Willy!

00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:26.300
 You're calling me Henry?

00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:28.000
 You're gonna tell me why I'm not hopeful?

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000
 Willy, forget about that.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.300
 Where's your book? We've got to start studying.

00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:32.900
 Here it is.

00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:36.300
 Willy, what did you have the most trouble with her in the exam?

00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:37.000
 The date.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.500
 When her number's not in dollars and cents, I just can't keep it in my head.

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:43.000
 The better one will probably ask me all about date.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000
 Well, let's start with the date then.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.000
 When was the Constitution put into force?

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:50.000
 The Constitution?

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.000
 Yeah.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000
 You want the day and the month of just the year?

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000
 The year, Willie, the year.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000
 Oh, let's see now.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000
 Well, then 1776, I know that.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000
 That was the fourth of July.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.000
 (Laughter)

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000
 Willie, are you good?

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.000
 Is that so?

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000
 I can name a president on every piece of money we've got.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.000
 Can you?

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000
 Willie, I've got to get you to remember.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:17.300
 Look, the Constitution was signed in 1789, but don't think of it as 1789.

00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:21.800
 Just think of it as $17.89.

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:25.000
 Yeah? Sure. I like you while buying a jacket, see?

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000
 Oh. What kind of a jacket?

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.500
 We need one fine.

00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:31.500
 For the war caught in the law.

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:33.000
 What difference does that mean?

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.500
 Listen, hold on, I'm not paying $18.99 for a jacket. I don't know anything about it.

00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:39.000
 [audience laughter]

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000
 Oh, Willie.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.000
 Oh, it will work.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:48.000
 Willie, forget about the jacket and see if you can remember this.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:53.000
 The Constitution, it was signed in 1789.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000
 Say that wrong.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.000
 Sure. Now, when was the Constitution signed?

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.000
 The Constitution, it was signed in 1789.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.000
 Hey, give me another and give me another.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:10.000
 (music)

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000
 William, now, show you may come in now.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000
 Well, thank you, Ms. Eglison.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.000
 I don't want to rush you, but did I mention the game starts from half an hour?

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000
 I'm aware that, William.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.000
 Now, let's get right to the exam, shall we?

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.000
 Yes, Ms. Eglison.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.000
 And I want to pray.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.000
 I certainly enjoyed those slides you showed the class today.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.000
 You did?

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.000
 Sure.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000
 Boy, I saw the whole war of 1812 in a different life.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.000
 That's fine.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.000
 Now, let's start.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.560
 We'll take the exam early sort of word of mouth. Yes

00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:41.360
 First question. What were the four phases of the revolution?

00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:44.520
 For patients? Yes

00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:53.200
 I know data your weak point so I decided to make the exam more general

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:05.700
 Jefferson went to Washington in 1801.

00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:08.200
 (audience laughing)

00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:10.880
 From that being one of the places, it could not.

00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:15.360
 One of the, who's our first tariff bill to pass the Senate?

00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:16.560
 Who, not one?

00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:17.600
 You don't know that either.

00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:20.120
 - Ms. Eggleston, it doesn't rhyme with anything.

00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:20.960
 - Take your pardon.

00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:24.960
 Well, I mean, is that the one that $17.99 says?

00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:27.960
 (audience laughing)

00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:36.960
 (music)

00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:40.960
 Well, in the at least if you're a substitute, you can see the games for nothing.

00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:45.960
 He was, what's so special about that? I mean, boy, have you ever sat on that bench, Homer?

00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:49.960
 Hello. The sun's beating down on you all the time, you get sunburned.

00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:52.960
 It's a hundred times more comfortable in the grandstand.

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:59.960
 Yeah, besides your right out in public view where everybody can can listen home.

00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:02.960
 Or if I'd rather be a spectator, why should you worry?

00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:04.960
 Oh, there you are, Henry.

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:05.960
 Hello, Father.

00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:09.960
 Henry, you're a new club. Just arrived there, express. You might as well have it.

00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:12.960
 But, Mr. All, the kid was turning in his uniform.

00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:14.960
 Oh? Oh, I see.

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:16.960
 Oh, would you mind leaving for a moment?

00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:17.960
 Leaving?

00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:19.960
 I'd like to say something to Henry.

00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:21.960
 When you feel it's none of my business?

00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:23.960
 I do.

00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:27.960
 Sure. I'll save the seat for you in the grandstand.

00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:33.960
 Henry, may I ask why you are turning in your uniform?

00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:37.960
 Well, since Willie's going to play short-sidy,

00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:40.960
 so if you can't beat top man, you're going to take your ball and go home.

00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:41.960
 What?

00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:44.960
 Henry, don't you know it's harder to fail than to win.

00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:46.960
 See, I've never had any trouble.

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:48.960
 I've never had any trouble.

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:55.960
 Henry, in later life, willy may have his letter for baseball, but you'll have the respect of the community.

00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:57.960
 And that's much more important.

00:21:57.960 --> 00:21:58.960
 It is?

00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:00.960
 Oh, it's where you've been. Why aren't you beautiful?

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:02.960
 Why, I'm about to put it on.

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:04.960
 Well, hurry, you're starting a short stop.

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:05.960
 But then what?

00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:07.960
 Willy Marshall didn't answer a single question correctly.

00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:10.960
 Everybody couldn't have failed. I told him everything I know.

00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:14.960
 Well, he did. Ms. Eggleston said he kept yelling, "It doesn't rhyme. It doesn't rhyme."

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:16.300
 I can't play.

00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:17.300
 What, Pedro?

00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:20.900
 Do you realize the whole school think I let Willie Flunk on purpose?

00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:22.740
 Henry, you're the only shortstop we've got left.

00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:23.740
 I'm the co-founder.

00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:24.980
 And he's not arguing and get out there and play.

00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:27.580
 When father, I'll lose the respect of the community.

00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:29.380
 Edward, get out there and play.

00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:30.380
 Boy.

00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:33.380
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:44.220
 It's that head with your own, which means you know that a head.

00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:45.500
 Is that nice?

00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:46.500
 Right.

00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:48.620
 This is all that you saw after the Marine Training

00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:50.620
 and we're only meeting by one run.

00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:51.460
 Oh, we've got one out.

00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:52.620
 Oh, my wheel, where's the--

00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:55.100
 Well, Sam, I think it was very nice of the coast

00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:57.180
 of that Henry play right out there in the middle

00:22:57.180 --> 00:22:59.980
 of the whole field.

00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:03.060
 Alice, that's where the short stop usually plays.

00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:06.060
 Oh, well, I think he's doing beautifully so far.

00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:06.580
 Sure.

00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:09.980
 It hasn't been a ball hit to a more old game.

00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:12.700
 I still don't understand why all the young people

00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:14.700
 every time he comes up to back.

00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:16.700
 Alex, it's a little hard to explain.

 Oh, well, oh, well, George Bigeler just walked another ridge hill, man.

00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:23.700
 Now there are two arms.

00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:24.700
 But we're still ahead.

00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:28.700
 But there have these slugs coming up, and if those two run the score, we'll lose.

00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:30.700
 Strike them out, George! Strike them out!

00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:33.700

00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:15.740
 Once and for all, what happened?

00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:17.060
 - How did you saw it yourself?

00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:18.500
 Henry saved the game.

00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:21.020
 - I know he did, but how?

00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:23.620
 - All I remember, Mother, is that the ball

00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:26.260
 started to come light at me, see?

00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:31.100
 And when I went down the field, the lights went out.

00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:32.100
 (audience laughing)

00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:34.460
 - The ball hit you in the head, I know that.

00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:37.100
 It's what happened afterwards, I'm confused about.

00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:38.340
 - How did it simple?

00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:43.340
 When Henry's head the ball bounced straight over to the second base, but he threw at the first for the double play.

00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:45.340
 [audience laughter]

00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:49.340
 Oh my goodness, I should think there'd be an easier way to make a double play.

00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:51.340
 [audience laughter]

00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:53.340
 There he is, Alice.

00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:57.340
 Mother, when can I get out of bed in a few days here?

00:24:57.340 --> 00:25:01.340
 But Dr. Bennington doesn't think you should try to play any more this season.

00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:04.340
 Anyway, not until the buzzing goes away.

00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:07.340
 Oh, but the buzzing doesn't bother me, Mother.

00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:11.220
 No, no, it's not a has a little town to it

00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:19.460
 Is but try to be quiet

00:25:19.460 --> 00:25:26.960
 Can we we told all the kids home a segulls and double costume and they asked me to give you their official Apollo no

00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:34.500
 Kidding they forgive me sure they're even sending you flowers. No kidding. We'll he's over at the end of taking Paula right now

00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:56.500
 [Music]

00:25:56.500 --> 00:26:00.500
 On the afternoon, the kids are central high and here's some flowers.

00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:02.500
 You've got to go to the small guy of the year.

00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:05.500
 Well, Gee, Liz, Willie, Gee, Frank.

00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:07.500
 And Henry, I'd like to make a deal with you.

00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:10.500
 The undertaker says these strawflowers are everlasting.

00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:12.500
 The strawflowers are?

00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:15.500
 Yeah, so could I borrow them back to give to Miss Agleston for Easter?

00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:16.500
 [laughter]

00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:18.500
 What a man, Willie.

00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:20.500
 But here's my special tip for Easter.

00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:24.500
 A surprise dessert for the kids made with jello tapioca pudding.

00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:27.500
 Just prepare one package of luscious, light and creamy,

00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:29.500
 jello vanilla tapioca as usual.

00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:32.500
 When chilled, serve it in your best sherbet glasses,

00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:36.700
 all dressed up with a garnish of bright-colored jelly beans.

00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:39.300
 And then top of the sprinkling of baker's coconut,

00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:43.300
 tinted pink, green, and yellow for a special Easter day flourish.

00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:45.980
 Try all three, jello tapioca puddings,

00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:49.260
 jello chocolate, vanilla, and orange coconut tapioca.

00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:50.660
 They're ready prepared.

00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:53.780
 All you do is add milk and cook for about five minutes.

00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:57.820
 Jello tapioca puddings, three delicious new reasons

00:26:57.820 --> 00:27:02.820
 Why, more people buy jello puddings than any other prepared puddings in the world.

00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:11.820
 I'm hoping you'll be in your living room an hour's next week at the same time. Good night, folks.

00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:20.820
 The Aldrich family starring out at the Stauner's Henry was Jackie Delgis Homer,

00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:24.820
 is written by Norman Tokar and Ed Joris from Music by Jack Miller.

00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:29.260
 Mr. and Mrs. Aldrich, our house, Jamison, and Capron Ross.

00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:31.860
 And this is Dan Seymour in New York saying,

00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:35.860
 "The Aldrich family is brought to you by the Jell-O family."

00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:36.700

 You, as you as a rhino climbing a flagpole,

00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:01.980
 amazingly only one of its kind.

00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:05.980
 That's minute rice, minute rice for magically quick, quick meals.

00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:10.980
 Here's delicious white fluffy rice that you don't have to wash, rinse, drain, or steam.

00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:12.980
 It's even quicker to fix than potatoes.

00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:15.980
 For all you do is drop minute rice in water and bring to a boil.

00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:19.980
 Minute rice can be the mainstay for all sorts of delicious, quick, quick meals.

00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:20.980
 Try it.

00:28:20.980 --> 00:28:23.080
 Try it. Remember the word minute.

00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:25.480
 Minute writes in the red, white and blue box.

00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:38.080
 My goodness, look at Bill Goodwin.

00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:39.580
 He's brown knickers in the beanie.

00:28:39.580 --> 00:28:41.480
 Gracie, you're looking at Henry Olrich.

00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:43.180
 This is the Olrich family, folks.

00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:45.180
 Sure, Gracie. I'm on unit program.

00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:46.380
