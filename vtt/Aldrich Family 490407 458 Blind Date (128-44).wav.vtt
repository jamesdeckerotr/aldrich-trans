00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000
 [Music]

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
 And now the Jell-O family presents...

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
 Henry! Henry Olgrich!

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
 Coming, Mother!

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
 [Applause]

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
 Yes, it's the Olgrich family based on characters

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.800
 originated by Clifford Goldsmith and starring Ezra Stonner's Henry with Jackie Kelk as Homer.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.800
 And yes, it's the Jell-O family.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.800
 Oh, the Big Red Letter stand for the Jell-O family.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.800
 Oh, the Big Red Letter stand for the Jell-O family.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:46.800
 That's Jell-O.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.800
 The Union, the Jell-O pudding.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:49.800
 The Union, the Union, the Jell-O pudding.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.800
 The Union, the Union, the Union, the Union, the Union, the Union, the Union.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:52.800
 The Jell-O tack, the Oka pudding.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.800
 Yes, Harry!

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.400
 And now for the Aldrich family.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.140
 (dramatic music)

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:13.360
 One of the most enjoyable things a man can do

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.360
 is think back to the time when he was a teenage boy

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.200
 like Henry Aldrich, with no cares, no worries,

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.200
 no responsibilities.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.480
 But when you actually are the boy,

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.080
 Things aren't always that pleasant.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.720
 The scene opens in the Aldrich living room.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.360
 It's early evening.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.400
 (sighs)

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:34.240
 Father.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.840
 Father.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.160
 Pardon me, Father.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:41.880
 - What is it, Henry?

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.640
 - Would you like to read something very interesting?

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.680
 - I was.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.280
 - Well, I mean this book, Father.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.920
 Gee, it's wonderful.

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.040
 It's all about two fellows, sing.

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.120
 - That's very interesting.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.840
 - I knew you'd like it, Father.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.320
 You see, Bruce and Rodney are very close friends.

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.800
 You might almost say they're practically inseparable.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.800
 One would do anything for the other.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:02.880
 - Very interesting.

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.280
 - For instance, once Rodney's in trouble, see,

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.760
 he's in a fight with five other fellows.

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.040
 Only I won't tell you how he gets into it

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.160
 'cause I don't wanna spoil the book for you.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.000
 - Thank you.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.120
 - Meanwhile, Bruce doesn't know anything

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.800
 about Rodney's predicament.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.560
 He's home in bed, getting ready to go to sleep, see?

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.200
 But all of a sudden he feels uneasy.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.800
 He tries to shake it off,

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.720
 but he can't get rid of the feeling

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.600
 that all is not well with Rod.

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:31.960
 So he gets stressed.

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:32.920
 - The phone, Henry.

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.240
 - Oh, he thought about that father,

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.360
 but he didn't know where to reach Rodney.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.760
 - Our phone, Henry.

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.960
 - Oh, oh, I'll get it, father.

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:41.800
 Hello?

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:42.720
 - Hi, him.

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.080
 - Look, Homer, could I call you back in a few minutes?

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.400
 I'm right in the middle of a story.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.560
 I'm telling my father.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:48.560
 - All right, Henry, I can go.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.400
 - It's very important, Henry.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.640
 Couldn't it just went, are you in trouble, pal?

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:55.880
 - Sort of.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.760
 - Good, I'll be right over.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.520
 - You don't have to come over and I just want to ask you

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:01.360
 something.

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.320
 - Oh, go right ahead, pal.

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.520
 Anything at all.

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:06.280
 - Thanks, him.

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.760
 - I could come over, Homer.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:08.840
 - It isn't necessary.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.280
 I can ask you over the phone.

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.480
 All you have to do is answer yes or no.

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.120
 - The answer is yes.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.120
 - How do you know?

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.120
 - Listen, pal.

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.920
 When one pal calls another pal,

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.960
 On the first palace in trouble, what else can the second palace say but yes?

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:23.960
 No.

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.960
 Not if they're real pals, Homer.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.560
 Henry, maybe you better wait till you hear what it is.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.800
 Well it doesn't matter, Homer, but go ahead if you want to.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.360
 Well, you know the school dance in a couple of weeks.

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.360
 Sure, you want me to get you a date, is that it?

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.600
 No, I already have a date, Agnes.

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:44.760
 As a matter of fact, it's just the uh... Henry, did you invite anyone yet?

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.160
 No, Kathleen's out of town.

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.840
 I'm just sort of making up my mind.

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:48.840
 That's good.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.640
 I mean, the fact of the matter is, Hen, that Agnes...

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.540
 You see, Agnes has a...

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.140
 Well, when I asked Agnes, she...

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.640
 Oh, boy...

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.840
 Look, Homer, we're friends, aren't we?

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:02.640
 Sure, Hen.

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:03.640
 Good friends.

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:04.140
 Sure.

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.340
 Practically inseparable, you might say.

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:06.840
 Sure.

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.340
 Well, then just ask me, Homer, just ask me.

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:10.140
 That's all.

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:11.840
 Come right out and say it.

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.340
 Okay, Hen.

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.640
 The fact of the matter is that a cousin of Agnes

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.740
 is just coming to visit her the weekend of the dance

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:19.940
 An Agnes asked me to get someone to take her.

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:20.940
 Okay.

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:22.540
 You mean you will?

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:23.540
 Sure.

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:24.540
 Just like that?

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:25.540
 Of course.

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.460
 You need me, pal.

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:28.460
 I'm there.

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.220
 Gee, thanks, ham.

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.180
 You'd do the same for me, wouldn't you?

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.180
 Sure, certainly.

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:36.980
 So there you are.

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:38.980
 Is this L-431?

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:39.980
 What?

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:40.980
 Sure.

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:45.420
 Is this Henry Aldrich?

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:46.420
 Naturally.

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:47.420
 Naturally.

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:51.020
 The Henry older, she was a friend named Homer Brown.

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:52.020
 Of course.

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.020
 Well, I'll be done.

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.980
 By him, I've got a co-agnition teller.

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:59.580
 So long, old pal.

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.740
 Remember, any time at all.

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:03.740
 Where was I, pal?

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:04.740
 I mean, Father.

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.740
 My next spice was getting dressed.

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:08.100
 What homo on?

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:09.100
 Not spice, Father.

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:10.100
 Bruce.

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:13.100
 He wanted me to take Agnes' cousin to the dance.

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:14.100
 Now, let's see.

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:15.100
 Bruce was worried.

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:16.100
 What'd you like?

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:21.380
 father. He, Homa, wanted you to take Agnes' he cousin to the den? She was no,

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:26.700
 she's a she. Bruce is a he. Well, thank heaven. I met Agnes' cousin,

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:30.100
 Henry. What's she like? I don't know. Anyway, there was Bruce. You don't know.

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:33.980
 And now she's from out of town. Oh, I thought you were through with blind date.

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:38.940
 Well, generally speaking, I am father, but this is different. My pal needs me. I

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:39.940
 I see.

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.240
 Mine not to question why.

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.660
 Mine but to do and die.

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:45.660
 Very likely.

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:46.660
 What?

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:47.660
 Nothing, Henry.

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:50.460
 Then why are you shaking your head like that?

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:54.900
 Son, it's been my experience that a man takes quite a chance on a blind date.

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:57.180
 More often than not, he gets stuck.

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:01.460
 But Father Homer's a very close friend of mine, practically inseparable, you might

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:02.460
 say.

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:05.060
 Do you really think I'll get stuck?

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:08.140
 Well, that shouldn't matter, Henry.

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:12.580
 a pal need you sure but what if she's fat

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:18.220
 what if who's fat and bangus's cousin mother do you think she might be fat or

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:23.380
 skinny I suppose there's always that possibility she was why should that have

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:27.460
 said you so much and read just accepted a blind date with a young lady in question

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:33.140
 oh well I'm sure she's very nice you really think so mother do you really

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:37.860
 father says more often than not a man gets stuck on a blind date is that what

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:43.860
 your father says? How interesting considering the fact that he met me on a blind date.

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:44.860
 Now Alice.

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:46.860
 What else did your father say?

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:47.860
 Well, he just...

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:48.860
 Henry.

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:49.860
 Yes, father?

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:53.860
 Alice, when I said what I said to Henry, I had no particular personal situation in mind.

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:55.860
 And besides, all I said was...

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:57.860
 That a man gets stuck on a blind date.

00:06:57.860 --> 00:06:59.860
 I didn't say that, Alice. All I said was...

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:00.700
 - That was fun.

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:03.280
 (upbeat music)

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:11.500
 - Gee whiz Henry, why didn't you think of that

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:13.460
 before I told Agnes should go?

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:14.300
 - Look home.

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:16.160
 - A half hour ago you were such a pal,

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.220
 you didn't even wanna know what I wanted.

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:19.380
 And now look at you.

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:21.740
 - Homer, I didn't come all the way over to your house

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:23.300
 to say I won't go.

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:24.920
 It's still very possible.

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:26.980
 I may take Agnes's cousin to the day.

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:27.820
 - When will you know?

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:29.940
 as soon as I find out a little more about it.

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:32.260
 - Okay, what do you wanna know?

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:33.360
 - Is she pretty?

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:34.280
 - I don't know.

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:36.620
 - Is she fat?

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:37.980
 - I don't know.

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:38.980
 - Is she skinny?

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:40.740
 - I don't know.

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:42.540
 Is there anything else you wanna ask, can we?

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:44.060
 (audience laughing)

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:45.700
 - Well, what do you know about it?

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:47.300
 - Her name is Martha Adams.

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:50.620
 She lives in Hollendale and she's Agnes' cousin.

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:52.660
 - Well, don't you know anything else about her?

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:53.820
 - Physically, I mean.

00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:55.260
 - No.

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.260
 Except that she is Agnes's cousin.

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:01.860
 Well, she was cousins don't always look alike, you know.

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:03.900
 - That's the big trouble with your Homer.

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:06.300
 All you know are the unimportant things.

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:07.700
 Nothing about how she looked.

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:09.820
 - Henry, after all, you're just gonna dance

00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:11.540
 with the girl for a few hours.

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:13.340
 It isn't as though you were marrying her.

00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:14.540
 - You never can tell, Homer.

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:15.540
 You never can tell.

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:17.060
 Look at what happened to my father.

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:17.900
 - What happened?

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:20.180
 - He met my mother on a blind date.

00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:23.620
 - Oh, well, they're happy, aren't they?

00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:24.980
 - Not right at the moment.

00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:26.340
 (audience laughing)

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:28.280
 And besides, let's not change the subject.

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:30.420
 I've got my reputation to think about.

00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:31.260
 - Why?

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:32.860
 - If word gets around that Henry oldridge

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:35.900
 goes out with unattractive girls, from that moment on,

00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:37.940
 I'm finished with the attractive ones.

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:40.500
 - Why didn't you think of that when I first asked you?

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:43.060
 - Because I was trying to be a pal.

00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:45.420
 Didn't Agnes say anything about her cousin?

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:46.500
 - Nope.

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:48.180
 I wonder why.

00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:49.900
 - Because I never asked her.

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:50.940
 - Well, why didn't you?

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:52.300
 - Because, you know, you brought it up,

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:53.460
 it wasn't important.

00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:54.380
 (phone ringing)

00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:55.380
 Hello?

00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:56.380
 Hi, Homer.

00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:57.380
 Oh, pal.

00:08:57.380 --> 00:08:58.380
 Hi, Agnes.

00:08:58.380 --> 00:08:59.380
 I just got into my mother told me you called.

00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:00.380
 What do you want?

00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:02.380
 Homer, one minute Agnes.

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:03.380
 What ever you...

00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:04.380
 Ask her now.

00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:05.380
 Ask her what?

00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:06.380
 About her cousin Martha.

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:07.380
 Is she pretty or fat or what?

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:09.380
 You know, vital statistics.

00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:10.380
 Okay.

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:11.380
 Hello, Agnes.

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:13.380
 What did you want to tell me, Homer?

00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:17.380
 Well, well, how are you, Agnes?

00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:18.380
 I'm fine.

00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:19.380
 How are you?

00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:20.380
 Fine.

00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:21.380
 That's fine.

00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:22.380
 How's your mother?

00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:23.380
 She's fine.

00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:24.380
 That's Mary's.

00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:25.380
 Uh, how's your...

00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:27.380
 He's fine too.

00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:28.380
 That's good.

00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:29.380
 What's good?

00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:31.380
 Gee whiz, Homer, why don't you ask her?

00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:36.380
 Hold on, Agnes, because you've got to lead up to something like that gradually.

00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:37.380
 Um, Agnes.

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:38.380
 Yeah?

00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:39.380
 How's...

00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:41.380
 How's your cousin Martha?

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:42.380
 Who knows?

00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:44.380
 Oh, what's she saying?

00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:45.380
 She said, "Who knows?"

00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:47.380
 You'll have to talk louder, Homer.

00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:48.380
 I can't hear you.

00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:49.380
 I was talking to Henry.

00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:51.380
 Oh, is he there with you?

00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:54.580
 - Yeah, as a matter of fact, we were sort of talking

00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:56.720
 about our plans for the dance.

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:58.480
 And Henry was just wondering,

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:02.060
 what color hair Martha has?

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:03.060
 - Why?

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:07.260
 - So, well, so we know what color tie it aware.

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:08.100
 - Oh.

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:11.060
 - He doesn't want to wear a tie that would clash with her head.

00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:11.900
 - Oh!

00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:12.900
 (audience laughing)

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:14.460
 - What color is her head?

00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:15.940
 - Gee, I don't know.

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:17.660
 - Oh, what'd she say?

00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:18.900
 - She said she doesn't know.

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:19.740
 - How come?

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:20.900
 - How come Agnes?

00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:23.900
 'Cause I haven't seen her since she was nine years old.

00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:25.700
 Oh, what'd she say?

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:27.900
 Oh, no, that's what you said.

00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:29.500
 Oh, thank you.

00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:32.600
 She said she hasn't seen her since she was nine years old.

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:33.600
 What?

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:36.900
 Well, ask her what she was like when she was nine.

00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:39.700
 Agnes, what was she like when she was nine?

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:41.400
 Boy, she was a whiz.

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:43.100
 She was a whiz, Ham.

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:44.100
 She was?

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:45.300
 Ask her in what way?

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:46.600
 In what way, Agnes?

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:47.600
 In school.

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:49.600
 Oh.

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:50.600
 What'd she say?

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:53.600
 She was a whole year ahead of the other kids her age.

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:54.600
 She was?

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:56.600
 What did she say?

00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:59.600
 She's... she's intelligent.

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:01.600
 That's what I was afraid of.

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:03.600
 It's really fine, right?

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:06.600
 Listen, Homer. When you ask somebody about a girl,

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:09.600
 and the first thing they tell you is that she's intelligent,

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:10.600
 you're in trouble.

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:11.600
 Hello? Hello?

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:12.600
 Just a minute, Agnes.

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:14.600
 Just help me out, Homer. Just count me out.

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:15.600
 Hello?

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:17.600
 You can't do that. Hit me. You promised you'd take that.

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:19.600
 That was before I knew she was intelligent.

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:21.060
 intelligent

00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:24.680
 i thought you said you were a pal and i thought when i thought i was in trouble

00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:26.200
 and asked another pal to help me

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:30.280
 what else could that pal do listen homie did you ever try dancing with a girl

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:37.280
 with brains

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:43.840
 what you're actually saying sam is that the girl doesn't count no allies with

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:45.120
 you please i see

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:46.720
 only you men are important

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:49.440
 I suppose it doesn't matter at all if the poor girl gets done.

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:50.480
 Alice, all I say was...

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:52.760
 No wonder boys think they're kings of the earth.

00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:54.160
 They take after their fathers.

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:54.720
 Alice!

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:56.120
 Sam, look at it this way.

00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:58.000
 How would you like it if you were a girl?

00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.600
 Henry, is that you?

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:00.600
 Yes, Father.

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:01.760
 Please come in here.

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:03.680
 Alice, let's not discuss this in front of Henry.

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:06.240
 Sam, you were the one who mixed him up in the first place.

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:08.160
 Now I want you to straighten him out.

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:10.240
 Did you want to speak to our mother?

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:12.720
 No, dear, your father wants to talk to you.

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:13.280
 Alice!

00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:14.880
 Sam, I'm counting on you.

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:16.000
 What is it, Father?

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:22.560
 Henry, you know I never interfere in your affairs, nor do I intend to start now.

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:24.040
 Thank you, Father.

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:25.540
 But...

00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:27.540
 But why?

00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:32.240
 Henry, someday you too will be married and have a family of your own.

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:34.240
 Well, thank you, Father.

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:36.040
 Yes.

00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:38.760
 Henry, your mother is a wonderful woman.

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:40.420
 Thank you, Father.

00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:42.720
 But sometimes...

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:43.720
 You're welcome, Henry.

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:46.280
 [LAUGHTER]

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:49.000
 Son, you remember that book you were telling me about,

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.720
 the one about Rollo and Spice?

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:52.920
 Rodney and Bruce, Father.

00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:53.320
 [LAUGHTER]

00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:54.760
 Yes.

00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:58.160
 Well, sometimes it's that way between Father and Son, too.

00:12:58.160 --> 00:12:59.440
 Oh?

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:04.280
 When one's in trouble, he knows he can count on the other.

00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:07.080
 You know how.

00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:09.280
 Father, are you trying to tell me that now you want

00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:11.080
 me to go on this blind day?

00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:12.680
 It's not that I want you to go, Son.

00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:14.360
 You just prefer it, is that it?

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:16.200
 Well, it's not exactly that I prefer it.

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:18.040
 But you think I ought to go, huh?

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:20.520
 Well, not exactly think you ought to go, but...

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:23.800
 After all, Henry, she may not be as fat as you think.

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:25.160
 No, that's not what I meant.

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:26.160
 I mean...

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:35.640
 Agnes, where is it?

00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:37.600
 I'm looking for it. I'm looking for it.

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:39.040
 It's someone's here in the album.

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:41.680
 Why didn't you say you had a picture of Martha in the first place?

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:43.980
 Because who knew you were gonna be so particular?

00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:45.260
 - Would have made a lot of difference

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:46.740
 to my mother and father.

00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:48.500
 - Don't forget him very often

00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:50.940
 a picture doesn't do a person justice.

00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:53.220
 You should see some of the pictures we have of me.

00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:54.980
 They'd scare the pants off you.

00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:55.800
 (audience laughs)

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:56.640
 - Here, here it is.

00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:57.480
 - Where?

00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:00.420
 - There, there in the lower left hand corner of the page.

00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:02.820
 - Not bad, not bad at all.

00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:04.940
 - See, hen, you were worried for nothing.

00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:07.820
 - Oh boy, not bad at all.

00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:10.820
 A little mature maybe, but I like 'em that way.

00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:12.980
 Mature, let's see.

00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:14.420
 That's her mother.

00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:15.780
 What?

00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:18.660
 Very often, him girls take after their mother.

00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:20.700
 The other one, the girl wither, that's my thing.

00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:21.540
 Let's see.

00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:23.300
 Let me see too.

00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:25.140
 What's the matter?

00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:28.020
 Listen, Agnes, I don't mind doing a person a favor.

00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:31.020
 But if your aunt allows your cousin to go out with boys,

00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:32.940
 she ought to be ashamed of herself.

00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:33.780
 What?

00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:36.580
 Very often, Henry, girls are a lot older than they look.

00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:38.820
 Sure, Homer, but even if this girl is a lot older

00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:41.540
 and she looked, she couldn't be a day over 11.

00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:43.460
 - Well, is that what's worrying you?

00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:44.460
 - Isn't it enough?

00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:47.980
 - This picture was taken five years ago.

00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:48.820
 - Oh!

00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:50.460
 - You see Henry?

00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:51.940
 - Let me see it again, Agnes.

00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:55.820
 'Cause she's still wear braces on her teeth.

00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:56.820
 - I don't know.

00:14:56.820 --> 00:15:00.660
 - Do you think she's still knock me?

00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:02.180
 - Gee, I don't know.

00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:04.460
 - Look at the beautiful hair she has, Henry.

00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:05.300
 - Where?

00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:06.140
 - Right.

00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:07.140
 (audience laughing)

00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:09.140
 - What's her mother again?

00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:10.060
 - Well, Henry.

00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:13.060
 - Well, you see, Agnes, it's very hard to tell anything

00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:14.700
 about Martha from this picture.

00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:16.460
 Is this the latest one you have?

00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:17.420
 - Yes.

00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:20.420
 - Do you have a magnifying glass in the house?

00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:23.500
 - Yeah, I think, just a minute, Henry.

00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:26.020
 Oliver, who do you think you are, cousin of you?

00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:26.860
 - Uh-huh.

00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:27.780
 - Well, you're not, see?

00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:29.780
 And that goes for you too, Homer Brown.

00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:31.260
 - Agnes, I didn't say anything.

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:32.500
 - Never mind the excuses.

00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:34.540
 And I'll tell you one thing, Homer Brown,

00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:37.260
 If any cousin of mine isn't good enough for Henry Aldrich

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:39.060
 than any friend of any Henry Aldrich

00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:40.340
 isn't good enough for me.

00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:42.420
 - Are you referring to me, Agnes?

00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:44.340
 - You don't see any other friends of Henry Aldrich

00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:45.420
 around, do you?

00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:46.700
 Now you can both get out.

00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:47.700
 - What Agnes?

00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:49.540
 - Agnes, what about my father?

00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:50.380
 - Ow!

00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:51.740
 (door slams)

00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:54.500
 - Now look what you did to me, pal.

00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:57.080
 (upbeat music)

00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:06.160
 The Big Red Letter Stand for the Jell-O Family

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:09.660
 Oh, the Big Red Letter Stand for the Jell-O Family

00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:10.660
 That's Jell-O!

00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:11.660
 Yum-yum-yum!

00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:12.660
 Jell-O Putting!

00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:13.660
 Yum-yum-yum!

00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:14.660
 Jell-O Tap!

00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:15.660
 The Oka Putting!

00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:18.660
 Yes, sorry!

00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:21.660
 Yes, that's the Jell-O Family

00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:25.660
 And right now Jell-O is making you the biggest bargain offer you've heard about in years

00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:29.660
 The offer of a full set of six beautiful individual aluminum Jell-O moles

00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:33.700
 Yes, real aluminum, sturdy, good-looking long-lasting.

00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:38.460
 They're handsome fluted moles, the type that have been so hard to get for such a long time.

00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:43.220
 These moles are a guaranteed 60 cent value, but you get the whole set of sakes for just

00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:49.420
 25 cents plus a coupon you'll find on a special banded combination of three packages of jello

00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:50.500
 puddings.

00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:54.500
 So hurry, hurry to the grocers, because this offer is limited.

00:16:54.500 --> 00:17:00.140
 With these six beautiful aluminum molds, a 60 sand value for just a quarter, plus the

00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:02.380
 jello pudding's coupon.

00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:09.540
 Don't miss this big bargain offer.

00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:12.880
 And now getting back to the troubles of Henry Ulrich.

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:17.100
 In order to help Homer, Henry has accepted a blind date.

00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:21.980
 But in trying to discover what she looks like, he has been less than a pal to his father

00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:23.500
 and a homer.

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:25.780
 The scene opens in the Alrich Front Hall.

00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:27.060
 It is the next day.

00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:28.060
 Is this long distance?

00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:29.060
 Long distance speaking.

00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:33.380
 Well, look, can you please tell me how much it would cost to call Hollendale person to

00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:34.380
 person?

00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:36.380
 The charges are $1.25.

00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:38.820
 She was a whole dollar and $0.25.

00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:39.820
 That is correct.

00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:42.500
 Even if the person doesn't know the other person?

00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:45.940
 I'm sorry, sir, but the telephone company is not responsible for that.

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:46.940
 Oh.

00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:50.620
 Well, look, I'd like to place a call to Hollendale person to-

00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:51.620
 Hey, Ray!

00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:54.620
 One minute, mother, the call is to Miss Martha Adams.

00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:55.620
 Henry, hang up that phone.

00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:56.620
 But mother--

00:17:56.620 --> 00:17:57.620
 Henry.

00:17:57.620 --> 00:17:58.620
 Never mind, operator.

00:17:58.620 --> 00:17:59.620
 No.

00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:02.620
 Would you mind telling me why you're calling Hollendale?

00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:06.620
 She was a hen able to find out a single solitary thing about my blind day,

00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:10.620
 just that she wore braces and was not need when she was eleven.

00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:11.620
 So--

00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:14.620
 So I decided to take the bull by the horns, so to speak, and phone her.

00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:15.620
 What for?

00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:17.620
 To ask her for a description of herself.

00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:19.620
 Henry, don't you dare.

00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:22.220
 My goodness, the very idea.

00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:24.460
 Is that what your father told you to do?

00:18:24.460 --> 00:18:25.700
 - Well, not exactly.

00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:26.780
 - Sam!

00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:27.860
 Sam Aldrich!

00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:29.420
 - What's just going on into the garden?

00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:32.740
 - Dear, what did you say to Henry about his blind aid?

00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:34.060
 - Henry, suppose you run along.

00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:35.660
 - Sure, Father, I'd be glad to.

00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:37.620
 - Sam, whatever you said to Henry was enough

00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:38.980
 to make him try to phone the girl

00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:40.700
 and get her to describe herself.

00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:41.540
 - What?

00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:42.740
 - And if I hadn't caught him in time,

00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:44.860
 our whole family would have been disgraced.

00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:46.300
 - Henry was going to phone her.

00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:47.300
 - Yes, Sam.

00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:50.900
 I hope you're satisfied with what you and your blind dates have accomplished.

00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:51.900
 But Alice, all I said was...

00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:53.500
 I don't want to hear another word!

00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:54.500
 Alice, Henry...

00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:56.900
 Henry, we're going to...

00:18:56.900 --> 00:18:59.900
 Number, please.

00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:01.700
 Give me long distance.

00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:04.300
 I want to speak to Hollendale, person to person.

00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:13.100
 Hi, Jack.

00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:14.700
 Oh, hello, Harry. Come on in.

00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:16.460
 -Gee, I'm glad you dropped over, Harry.

00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:17.540
 I was just gonna call you.

00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:19.380
 There's something I've gotta ask you about.

00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:22.100
 -Yeah? That's funny, because I wanted to ask you about something, too.

00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:23.340
 -Oh, yeah? -Yeah.

00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:24.340
 -What did you want to know, Jack?

00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:27.540
 -Well, do you know a girl here in Hollendale named Martha Adams?

00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:29.620
 -What? -You see, my father got a phone call

00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:32.740
 from a man he knows in Centerville, and Mr. Aldrich,

00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:34.700
 he wants to know something about this girl.

00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:36.820
 -No kidding. -Yeah, he wants the information

00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:38.020
 for his son, Henry.

00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:39.540
 -I got a letter from his son, Henry.

00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:40.580
 -Yup.

00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:42.220
 Do you know him? -Nope.

00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:43.540
 -Well, then how come he wrote to you?

00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:44.860
 -Henry knows my cousin, Charlie.

00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:45.860
 He lives in Centerville.

00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:46.360
 Oh.

00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:47.460
 He wants the same information.

00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:49.620
 Oh, well, do you know her, Martha Adams, I mean?

00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:50.500
 No, do you?

00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:50.980
 No.

00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:51.820
 Maybe a red nozer.

00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:52.980
 Yeah, why don't we phone him?

00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:54.380
 That's a good idea.

00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:55.060
 Number, please.

00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:56.580
 Stay 239.

00:19:56.580 --> 00:19:57.580
 Stay 239.

00:19:57.580 --> 00:19:59.020
 Hey, this Martha Adams must be something

00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:01.060
 if they've heard about her all the way over in Centerville.

00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:02.420
 Yeah, I wonder if the father really

00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:04.260
 wants the information for the son.

00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:05.460
 Yeah.

00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:05.980
 Hello?

00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:07.380
 Oh, red, this is Jack.

00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:08.740
 Oh, hiya, Jack.

00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:10.740
 Say I was just about to call you.

00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:11.980
 Yeah, what about?

00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:14.820
 Do you know a girl in town named Martha Adams?

00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:15.820
 What?

00:20:15.820 --> 00:20:18.820
 I got a letter from a kid in the center of asking about her.

00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:19.820
 Signed Homer Brown.

00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:20.820
 No, kidding.

00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:21.820
 Yeah.

00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:22.820
 Well, who's Homer Brown?

00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:23.820
 I don't know.

00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:25.820
 Then how come he wrote to you?

00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:26.820
 Well, he didn't.

00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:28.820
 Well, not exactly anyway.

00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:31.820
 It seems his father once had some business with my father.

00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:36.820
 So he addressed his letter to Sid Benson's son around 17 if he has one.

00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:37.820
 What?

00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:39.820
 Don't you know those four ladders?

00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:40.820
 No, not yet.

00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:50.820
 [MUSIC]

00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:52.320
 What is your letter say, Henry?

00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:54.580
 I'll read it to you.

00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:58.220
 Dear Henry Aldridge, your communication received and

00:20:58.220 --> 00:21:03.780
 contents noted an answer to your request for information regarding a certain

00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:05.420
 party in my town.

00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:07.740
 I wish to state the following.

00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:11.400
 Physically speaking, I find her very satisfactory,

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:12.560
 signed Harry Cooper.

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:14.620
 - She, that's great, Harry.

00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:16.200
 - Oh, wait, a P.S.

00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:19.880
 As regards your request for exact dimensions,

00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:21.580
 I could think of no way to get them

00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:25.640
 without arousing the suspicions of the party in question.

00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:26.560
 - What's the difference?

00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:28.800
 He finds it very satisfactory, doesn't he?

00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:29.980
 - He seems to.

00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:31.580
 Now, what does your letter say?

00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:34.900
 - It says, "Dear Homer Brown,

00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:37.900
 Oh boy, signed Red Stevens.

00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:38.900
 (audience laughing)

00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:40.140
 What do you say, him?

00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:40.980
 - Hello, boys.

00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:41.800
 - Hi, Father.

00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:43.900
 - Hello, Mr. Aldrich, what do you say, him?

00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:46.400
 - Henry, about that blind date of yours.

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:47.240
 - Yes, Father?

00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:51.300
 - I happened to be speaking to a business associate of mine

00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:53.380
 who happens to live in Hollendale,

00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:56.760
 and just in passing, I happened to ask him

00:21:56.760 --> 00:21:58.580
 if he knew a girl named Martha Adams.

00:21:58.580 --> 00:21:59.700
 - Did he, Father?

00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:00.620
 - His son did.

00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:02.580
 - Well, what does son have to say?

00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:09.380
 Well, according to his son, Martha Adams is beautiful, talented, charming, delightful, and breathtaking.

00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:10.940
 No kidding.

00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:11.460
 No kidding.

00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:12.820
 No kidding.

00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:16.980
 Dee, thanks, Father, but you really didn't have to go to all that trouble.

00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:17.900
 I didn't.

00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:19.580
 Of course not, Father.

00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:24.460
 After all, a fella's got to take a chance on a blind date.

00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:25.460
 Yes, Henry.

 - Wait til Agnes hears the good news.

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:37.300
 - Yeah.

00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:38.140
 - Hi Agnes.

00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:38.980

00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:40.660
 - Agnes guess what?

00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:42.460
 Henry's gonna take Martha to the dance.

00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:43.300
 - Yeah?

00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:44.140
 - Yeah.

00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:45.660
 - Yeah, we'll call for you around seven thirds.

00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:47.260
 - But would you rather we came at seven?

00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:48.100
 - Wait a minute.

00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:50.260
 - I just had a great idea, Henry.

00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:51.820
 Why don't we make a whole day of it?

00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:52.820
 - It's alright with me.

00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:53.660
 - Wait a minute.

00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:54.860
 - We'll call for you three.

00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:56.340
 - I get out of school at two.

00:22:56.340 --> 00:22:58.260
 - Val has got a grip on yourself.

00:22:58.260 --> 00:22:59.260
 - It was fun.

00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:01.160
 Agnes, don't pull my tie.

00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:02.820
 Agnes, you're choking me.

00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:03.860
 - Well listen to me.

00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:04.940
 - What's the matter, Agnes?

00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:06.140
 It's just two o'clock too early.

00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:07.700
 - It certainly is.

00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:10.580
 Especially since Martha may not be coming.

00:23:10.580 --> 00:23:11.580
 - What?

00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:12.420
 - Huh?

00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:13.780
 - Why is she may not be coming?

00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:15.380
 That's what I want and a why.

00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:16.780
 - Yeah, why?

00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:18.500
 - Because right out of a clear sky,

00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:21.940
 she became very popular with a boy in Hollendale.

00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:22.780
 - Why?

00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:23.940
 (audience laughing)

00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:24.860
 Why?

00:23:24.860 --> 00:23:26.620
 - She doesn't know, but she is.

00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:31.060
 She can have three separate dates for that weekend with Red Harry and Jack.

00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:34.520
 So she's not making up her mind till she hears from a girl here in Centerville.

00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:35.360
 What girl?

00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:38.760
 The girl she wrote to asking for information about you.

00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:40.600
 About me?

00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:43.100
 She asked for information about me?

00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:43.860
 Yeah.

00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:47.300
 Well, she's got her nerve.

00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:49.780
 All right, she got to ask about me.

00:23:49.780 --> 00:23:51.740
 Is this a blind data, isn't it?

00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:54.940
 Well, I guess she doesn't want it to be too blind.

00:23:54.940 --> 00:23:59.540
 Well, well, you're a fine pal, Homer.

00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:00.040
 Me?

00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:03.340
 Yeah, and after all I was going to do for you a fine pal.

00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:04.340
 What did I do?

00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:05.240
 What did you do?

00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:07.340
 She's your girl's cousin, isn't she?

00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:07.840
 Yes.

00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:10.440
 That's the last favor I'll ever do for anybody.

00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:12.840
 And another thing, Agnes, I know my rights.

00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:15.440
 My father's a lawyer, you know, and a blind date

00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:17.440
 is practically a contract.

 Isn't it nice that we danced so well together, Martha?

 - It's just wonderful, Henry.

00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:38.520
 - Do you wanna know something, Martha?

00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:40.260
 - What, Henry?

00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:42.640
 - My mother and father met on a blind date.

00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:43.800
 - Really?

 - Uh-huh.

 - What happened?

 - They got married.

 Oh, fine.

00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:57.440
 They get along wonderfully, except for a few days last week.

00:24:57.440 --> 00:25:00.480
 Oh, that's nice.

 Before you met me, I mean, were you worried or anything?

00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:24.000
 What?

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:24.840
 What for?

00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:28.320
 Well, I might have been not very attractive to skinny

00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:30.240
 or too fat or something like that.

00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:34.000
 Gee, what is-- no, not you.

 Thank you, Martha.

 But I mean, before you met me, well,

00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:43.960
 didn't you even think about what I might look like?

00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:46.960
 Well, to be perfectly frank about it, Martha,

00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:50.080
 It did cross my mind for a moment.

00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:52.720
 But I'll tell you how I feel about it.

00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:57.240
 When a pal is in trouble, see, and asks a pal to help him out,

00:25:57.240 --> 00:25:58.800

 to write to Martha and fix things up.

00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:20.520
 Would you mind telling me what you said?

00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:23.680
 - Well, I told her you were passively good-looking.

00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:24.520
 - Not handsome.

 - Are you kidding him?

00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:26.960
 Then I told her--

00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:28.560
 - Just passable?

00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:30.120
 - Yeah, I figured after she got here,

00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:33.480
 she wouldn't hold it against you that I exaggerated.

 velvety rich, yellow chocolate pudding as usual.

00:26:57.400 --> 00:27:00.840
 While still warm, add crushed peppermint stick candy

00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:03.040
 or peppermint extract to taste.
