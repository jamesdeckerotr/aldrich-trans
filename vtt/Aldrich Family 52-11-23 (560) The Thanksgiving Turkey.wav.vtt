00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.640
 In just a moment here, the Aldrich family.

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:04.640
 But first, this is Bob McKenzie.

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.540
 You may never have thought about it, but...

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.380
 NBC spells variety in weekday listening too.

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.560
 There's Bob Hope and Dave Garaway,

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.640
 with two of the most entertaining 15 minutes in radio.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:20.320
 Welcome, travelers. Bring you Tommy Bartlett and interviews with visitors to the Windy City,

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:27.320
 while each weekday evening, John Cameron Swayze, gives you a capsule commentary on the "Sightlights" on the news.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:33.320
 Yes, day in and week out, your best bet in radio is this station.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.320
 Now it's the Aldrich family on NBC.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.320
 [music]

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.320
 Henry! Henry Aldrich!

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.320
 Coming, mother!

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.320
 [applause]

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.320
 Yes, it's the Aldrich family, as transcribed, written by Clifford Goldsmith.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:06.320
 [Music]

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.320
 117 Elm Street in Centerville is a house like many other houses,

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:16.320
 and it might be a very Solomon State place if there weren't a boy in it.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.320
 And when that boy is a typical teenager like Henry Aldrich,

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.320
 well, it's a place where unexpected things are always happening.

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.320
 The scene opens and one of Sunnyville's grocery stores.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.320
 The time is afternoon.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.320
 Hello, hello.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.320
 Hello, Mother. This is Henry.

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.320
 Henry, Henry Aldridge, your son.

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.320
 Oh, is everything all right there? Are you all through with the store?

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:43.320
 Practically. I just wanted to tell you, though, they're all out of men's meat, and I've been to two other stores.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.320
 What's that? They don't have any men's meat at all?

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.320
 No. Mr. Preston said people shouldn't let their shop and go till the day before Thanksgiving.

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:51.040
 He said that...

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.320
 Dear, I don't care what he said, it's going to be a blow to your father.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.440
 But I guess he'll have to be satisfied with pumpkin pie.

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.680
 I know, but they don't have any pumpkins either.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.360
 Don't they have any canned pumpkin?

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.360
 Oh, canned pumpkin?

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.280
 And Henry, have you picked up the turkey?

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.520
 No, not yet. I have it over to that side of the store.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:13.360
 Well, there you go over there just as soon as you hang up and tell Mr. McGill you want the turkey I ordered three weeks ago.

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.080
 Yes, mother. Only how about Sage?

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.120
 What about it?

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.760
 Hey, Henry.

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:18.560
 What do you want, Homer?

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.280
 When you get through with that phone, I want us.

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.840
 What's not Henry?

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.560
 Mother, I said, what should I do about Sage?

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:24.600
 They're all out of it.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.000
 Henry, they can't be.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.680
 Mr. Preston said it's a cot of the late shopping.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.640
 Well, dear, you ask Mr. Preston whether he can't fix up Mrs. Aldrich

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.400
 with just a little Sage for her Thanksgiving dinner.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.840
 I'm sure he has some put away some way.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.680
 Listen, Henry, when can I use that phone?

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:40.800
 You whizzed Homer can't you see?

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.040
 I'm talking to my mother.

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.040
 What's not Henry?

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.600
 Nothing, Mother.

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:44.800
 I'm just talking to Homer.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.640
 Henry, you aren't fooling around down there with Homer, are you?

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:48.480
 What's that?

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.640
 It sounds to me like you haven't done any of the shopping I sent you to do.

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.280
 Well, I'm doing the best I can, Mother.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.160
 She was all I got is two pair of hands.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.840
 Listen, Henry, I've got to use that phone.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.760
 Well, please hurry there and don't waste any time with home.

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:01.640
 But, Mother.

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:02.120
 Goodbye.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.240
 Bye-bye.

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.840
 Boy, Henry, it's about time.

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:05.400
 She was home.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.040
 You have to push a guy right out of the booth.

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.680
 Don't speak to me.

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.000
 Don't say a word.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.640
 Trying to remember five different things to tell my mother.

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.560
 I got to get some sage.

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.520
 Number, please.

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.120
 Squash, chestnut, cinnamon.

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.120
 Number, please.

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.840
 I mean, I operated just make it plain,

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.480
 2-3-2 without the cinnamon.

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.080
 May I have your number, please?

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.080
 I told you, 2-3-2, Elm.

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.720
 Elm, 2-3-2.

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.840
 Gee whiz, now I've forgotten our whole Thanksgiving dinner.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.920
 Squash, chestnuts, cinnamon.

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:33.880
 Oh boy.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.760
 Squash, chestnuts, cinnamon.

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:36.560
 Hello.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.920
 Yeah, listen, mother, what came after cinnamon?

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.040
 What's that?

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.320
 Who did you want?

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:42.560
 Isn't this my mother?

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.080
 Well, yes, her mother, it is.

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.680
 And you got everything brought in it.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.880
 Well, the only thing in your list that they've got is bread crumbs and cleaning powder.

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.380
 Well, did you get them?

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:52.580
 Yes, but it isn't much of a Thanksgiving dinner.

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:53.580
 What's that?

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.580
 Oh boy, cranberries!

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:56.080
 What?

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.780
 I just happened to remember cranberries.

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.080
 That's what came after cinnamon.

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.180
 Well, what about them?

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.280
 I can't get any.

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.280
 Oh, now, home, they must have at least a few cranberries.

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:05.080
 No, they haven't.

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:06.880
 Henry Alders got the last half pound.

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:07.880
 What's that?

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.680
 Oh, home, you aren't wasting your afternoon with Henry Alders, are you?

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:11.680
 No.

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.180
 Oh, gee whiz, he bought the last cranberries.

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.180
 Well, dear, I don't see how we can have turkey without cranberries.

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.880
 Well, you don't have to worry, mother. I've got something even better.

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.300
 Oh, that's good. What'd you get?

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:22.300
 Ketchup.

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:23.460
 [laughter]

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.300
 Ketchup? To go with turkey?

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:26.780
 Oh, well, I like it on anything.

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:27.580
 And so does father.

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:28.380
 I know, dear.

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.540
 And it's red. If you're parred on corn kernels, it looks just like cranberries.

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.260
 [laughter]

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.660
 Oh, home, I mean, did you tell Mr. McGill, you want our turkey?

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.780
 Well, that's another thing. There's only one.

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.020
 But one is all we want.

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.140
 No, I mean, one turkey for everybody.

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:45.060
 And Mr. McGill is in shore, but he's pretty sure.

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:46.700
 Mrs. Alderman reserved that.

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:50.340
 Now dear, Mrs. Orange didn't reserve that turkey any more than I did.

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:53.000
 I asked Mr. McGill to put it aside for me weeks ago.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.800
 You did?

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.180
 Yes, now run right over and tell him.

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:56.820
 Hey, Homer, I gotta use that phone again.

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:57.940
 Just a minute, Henry.

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:00.540
 Homer, he's had me all reached there.

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:01.580
 Well, yes, mother.

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.820
 Well, he hasn't got hold of that turkey, has he?

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.020
 Just a minute.

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:06.700
 Henry, what's in that big bag there?

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:07.340
 Squash.

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:08.700
 Now hurry up, Homer.

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:09.620
 Mother, it's all right.

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:10.460
 It's Squash.

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.220
 Oh, Homer, did you get any squash?

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:13.660
 That's what I was going to tell you.

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:15.220
 They don't have the kind you wanted.

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:17.220
 Look, you should like get the kind Henry got?

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:22.220
 He had get any kind, just so long as your father has a good squash when he sits down with his ticket.

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:25.220
 Okay.

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:27.220
 Homer, will you let me have that phone?

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:28.220
 Okay, here.

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:29.220
 Well, thanks. Hello?

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:30.220
 Hello?

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:33.220
 Listen, Homer, why are you handing me your mother? Well, hang her up.

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:34.220
 What?

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:35.220
 I mean...

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:38.220
 Goodbye, mother.

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:41.220
 Boy, will I be glad when Thanksgiving is over.

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:45.380
 Will you please get your oranges and flour and stuff out of this booth? I'm getting them out Henry

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:48.680
 Listen, where did you get that squad? There aren't anymore? There aren't?

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:55.080
 Henry I'm getting sick at you taking the last everything in this place. Oh, you gotta keep your eyes open around here number please

00:05:55.080 --> 00:06:00.680
 Elm 303 Elm 303 just a minute there all rich. What's that? Where you got there in your hand?

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:05.360
 You can't have pumpkin. It was the last one in the counter. I'll say it was I've been looking all over for this

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.760
 That's part of Mrs. Bartlett's order now. Give it to me. Well gee whiz

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:12.200
 Hello mother, what do you think just happened?

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:14.200
 Dear, what is it you want now?

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:17.200
 Well, I was going to ask whether one can of pumpkin would be enough.

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:19.200
 Oh, I guess I could make a pie with one can.

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:21.200
 Mother, they just took it away from me.

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:22.200
 What?

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:25.200
 The man said Mrs. Bartlett saw it first.

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.200
 Dear, do you realize tomorrow is Thanksgiving?

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:30.200
 It sounds to me as though you aren't even trying.

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:32.200
 Mother, you'll be glad to hear I got a lot of parsley.

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:33.200
 Parsley?

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:36.200
 Yeah, it doesn't seem to be much of a demand for that. I took six pounds.

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.200
 [audience gasps]

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:41.200
 Henry, do you have our turkey?

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:42.700
 Oh yeah, gee whiz.

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:43.700
 You say you have it?

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:45.700
 No, I mean I'm glad you reminded me.

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:48.200
 Well you hurry right over to Mr. McGill and ask him for it.

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:49.700
 Yes, mother, I'll go right away.

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:50.700
 Bye bye.

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:53.200
 Hey buddy.

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:55.200
 Yes sir, did you want me?

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:58.200
 When you took that can of pumpkin, did you pick up a can of cinnamon too?

00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:59.200
 Cinnamon?

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:01.700
 No sir, I haven't even seen any cinnamon.

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:04.700
 Well, somebody took the can of cinnamon right out of Mrs. Bartlett's order.

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:05.700
 Hey Homer!

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:06.700
 What, Henry?

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:07.700
 Is Mr. McGill here at the meat counter?

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:09.700
 Yeah, he's in the back room, rapping.

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:11.700
 That is, I mean, he's rapping something up for me.

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:12.700
 Okay, I'll wait for him.

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:14.700
 Oh, he may be in there for quite a while, Henry.

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:16.700
 Why waste time?

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:19.700
 Why don't you go over to the other side of the store and do some more shopping?

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:21.700
 I finally got all mine done, except for one thing.

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:23.700
 You sure?

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:25.700
 I mean, why don't you go over and get some cinnamon?

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:26.700
 They don't have any.

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:28.700
 Well, sure they have, I just got a can.

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:31.700
 All I have to buy is something right here for Mr. McGill.

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:32.700
 Oh, you do?

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:33.700
 Sure.

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:36.700
 Hey, Homer, before I forget, have you got your composition written for English?

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:38.840
 for English? We don't have to have a

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:40.480
 gradie until Monday. Well I know but I'm

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:41.600
 going to do mine tonight. Then I'll have

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:44.280
 a free mine for the whole weekend. She

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:45.880
 was what's keeping Mr. McGill? I'm going

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:47.120
 to go back there and look for it. Now

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:49.360
 wait a minute Henry wait before. Well

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:51.000
 the composition is supposed to be about

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
 what you did on Thanksgiving Day. I know

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.600
 well how are you going to write about

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.440
 what you did on Thanksgiving Day on the

00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:59.520
 day before it? Well I'm going to do

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:01.880
 Homer's eat. I'm going to eat turkey at

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:03.480
 noon and then in the evening I'm going

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:05.640
 to have cold turkey and just before I go

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:07.760
 would have been and would have some more turkey.

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:09.240
 Oh, well, that's nice.

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:11.160
 Sounds like an interesting composition.

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:12.480
 Now then, Homer, here you are.

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:14.160
 A very nice 18 pound--

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.000
 Thank you, Mr. McGill.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:15.880
 Thank you very much.

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:17.040
 It's the last one.

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:17.520
 It's so long.

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:19.280
 Homer, you haven't told me what you're going to do

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:20.200
 on Thanksgiving Day.

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:21.840
 Homer?

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:22.400
 She was.

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:23.520
 Is he in a hurry?

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:25.480
 Now then, young man, what can I do for you?

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:28.480
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:36.280
 [Music]

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:40.240
 Henry, didn't you explain to Mr. McGill that he promised me a turkey?

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:43.080
 Well, sure, Mother, and he said that he could definitely promise you one.

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:43.580
 When?

00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:44.780
 The day after tomorrow.

00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:48.680
 Henry, I need a turkey for Thanksgiving, not the day after.

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:53.280
 When Homer took that turkey, did you tell him he was really taking our Thanksgiving dinner?

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:56.680
 Mother, I didn't have a chance to. He just grabbed it from right under my nose and ran.

00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:59.940
 And Mr. McGill said Homer told him we didn't want the turkey?

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:02.520
 Well, Mr. McGill said Homer didn't actually say it.

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:04.320
 He just implied that we didn't.

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:06.380
 Very well, Henry, here's what I want you to do.

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:10.420
 You're to go over to the Browns and tell Homer's mother exactly what happened.

00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:11.520
 And demand the turkey?

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:13.260
 You don't have to demand it, dear.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:17.560
 If you just explain things, I'm sure Mrs. Brown will be only too glad to give it to you.

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:18.260
 She will?

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:19.760
 Yes, dear. Now start right away.

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:20.260
 Yes, Mother.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:21.560
 And hurry right back with it.

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:22.360
 Yes, Mother.

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:23.360
 Alice?

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:24.560
 Yes, Sam.

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:26.100
 Where did you just send, Henry?

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:28.100
 Over to the Browns, dear, to get that turkey.

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:29.600
 No, wait a minute, Alice.

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:32.300
 Dear, I'm sorry it isn't theirs, it's ours.

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:33.600
 And we have guests coming.

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:36.200
 But Alice, the Browns are old friends of ours.

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:38.500
 You can't do a thing like that to them.

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:40.300
 Not at Thanksgiving.

00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:43.400
 And besides, in all fairness, they have an equal right to that turkey.

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:45.100
 Now, the sensible thing to do is...

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:46.100
 Who are you calling?

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:46.800
 Number, please.

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:47.900
 Elm 391.

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:49.000
 Elm 391.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.400
 Sam, you aren't inviting anyone else for dinner, are you?

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:53.000
 No, Alice, I'm calling the market.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.320
 Do you believe me? They don't have any more turkeys down there.

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:58.160
 Very well. We'll get something else.

00:09:58.160 --> 00:09:59.800
 Oh, he'll mind it. Good afternoon.

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:01.360
 Good afternoon, Mr. Olridge.

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:02.080
 Oh, yes, sir.

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:03.520
 I'd like to play some order with you.

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:04.560
 All right, Mr. Olridge.

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:07.720
 Now then. I'd like a couple of real nice roasters.

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:08.120
 What's that?

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:10.840
 Roasting chickens. Say five or six pounds each.

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:12.880
 But Mr. Olridge, where am I going to get?

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:13.600
 What's that?

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:15.280
 There isn't a chicken left on the plate.

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:19.480
 Oh. Well, then you'd better make it a couple of good-sized ducks.

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:22.000
 Personally, I like duck just as well as turkey.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.600
 How do you know that?

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:24.400
 No, Doc's.

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:25.000
 Now wait a minute.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.160
 You must have something tomorrow's Thanksgiving.

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:28.320
 I know, Mr. O'errich.

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:30.680
 But it seems like everybody waited till the last minute

00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:31.520
 to do their shopping.

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:34.600
 My wife and I are having salmon.

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:36.320
 They're having company for dinner.

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:38.200
 I'll tell you what I can do, Mr. O'errich.

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:42.640
 How would you like me to cut up a nice oxtail for you?

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:44.000
 Oxtail, what for?

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:44.800
 But Thanksgiving.

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:47.360
 It isn't the same as chicken, but it makes it dandy still

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:49.600
 and very nourishing.

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:52.000
 Yeah, well, just skip the whole thing.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.800
 Now, will that be anything else, Mr. Orange?

00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:55.480
 No, thank you. I guess you've got everything.

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:56.480
 Goodbye.

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:57.480
 Come on.

00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:58.480
 Alice.

00:10:58.480 --> 00:10:59.480
 Which did you get, Sam?

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:00.480
 Chickens or ducks?

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:04.120
 I've been thinking it over, Alice, and it seems to me you have a perfect right to demand

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:05.560
 that turkey from the brown.

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:08.320
 And, dear, that's exactly what I told Henry to do.

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:09.320
 Good.

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:12.320
 But when Henry comes back with it, the thing to do is to call the browns and insist that

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:14.600
 they come over here and have Thanksgiving with us.

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:18.920
 But Sam, that turkey isn't large enough for all of their guests and our guests, too.

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:24.520
 Oh, that's too bad. I hate to see the Browns go without the eyelashes.

00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:28.920
 Of course, if we serve plenty of muffins and yams, we might be able to strike it.

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:29.720
 Hello?

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:30.720
 Is this you, Father?

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:31.720
 Yes, Henry, where are you?

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:32.320
 You went downtown.

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:34.920
 Well, hurry on home. Don't dawdle with that turkey.

00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:36.920
 Father, I'm dawdling without the turkey.

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:37.920
 What?

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:39.120
 They wouldn't give it to me.

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:42.320
 Mr. Browns, did they bought and paid for the turkey, and that's all there was to it.

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:43.720
 Oh, he did.

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:45.920
 Father, isn't there any other place to get a turkey?

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:47.920
 I'm not interested in any other turkey.

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:53.080
 We're gonna have that when the Browns have and we're gonna eat it tomorrow alone. They're not invited

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:56.240
 No, I'll take care of it

00:11:56.240 --> 00:12:00.000
 Never mind that Henry you come right home Henry

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:06.880
 Yes, and what's the matter I have tried to be patient I have tried to be considerate now

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:12.600
 I am going to do something what here Alice take this phone. I want you to call the Browns and demand our turkey

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:15.600
 [Laughter]

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:22.600
 [Music]

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:24.100
 Is that what she said Elizabeth?

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:25.100
 Yes Will.

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:29.100
 Well in all the years I've known Alice Aldrich, I've never heard her talk that way to anyone.

00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:33.100
 Alright, alright. If they want to make an issue of the turkey, it's alright with me.

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:35.100
 Mother I'll be back in a little while.

00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:36.100
 Oh my where are you going?

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:38.100
 Just over to Henry's. It isn't so late Mother.

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:40.100
 Oh my let's get this straight.

00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:42.900
 You're not to have anything to do with Henry Aldrich.

00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:43.860
 Not ever?

00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:45.700
 Not until we've eaten that turkey.

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:46.420
 [laughter]

00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:49.060
 And if he wants to speak to you, that's his loss.

00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:50.740
 But look, I've got to write a composition,

00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:52.660
 and I need a little advice about Thanksgiving.

00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:54.180
 Well, you won't get it over there.

00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:57.620
 I don't think the Aldrich is a celebrating Thanksgiving this year.

00:12:57.620 --> 00:12:59.700
 Well, Cag, one of you answered that phone.

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:01.380
 Now, Elizabeth, don't touch it.

00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:05.380
 It's probably Sam Aldrich calling to pick a fight with me about that turkey.

00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:07.940
 Well, now, will the least you can do is talk to him.

00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:10.660
 Even if he loses his temper, you don't have to lose yours.

00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:14.260
 Elizabeth, I'm just going to sit here absolutely calm.

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.740
 Father, would you be willing to help me with my composition?

00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:17.940
 What's your problem?

00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:22.260
 Well, I have to compare what the pilgrims did on their first Thanksgiving with what I did tomorrow.

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:26.100
 Well, for one thing, you can point at what you did tomorrow.

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:26.820
 Yes, sir.

00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:28.580
 What did you do tomorrow?

00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:29.860
 What's that?

00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:32.020
 Homer, what are we talking about?

00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:36.420
 Well, I think you should at least go to the phone and tell Sadner not going to give him that turkey.

00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:38.020
 He'll find out soon enough Elizabeth.

00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:39.220
 He'll find out.

00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:41.980
 He's found out already.

00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:44.380
 Well, what's that?

00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:45.700
 It's the fun door.

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:48.340
 And I'm not going to sit here and just hear bells ringing.

00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:49.300
 I'll go to the door.

00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:50.340
 I'm willing to do that.

00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:51.580
 Let me know who it is.

00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:52.660
 The same here father.

00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:54.980
 Hello there, Will.

00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:58.740
 Well, well, Sam Olrich.

00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:01.220
 Aren't you, that is.

00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:03.420
 Won't you come in?

00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:04.380
 No thanks, Will.

00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:05.620
 And Mr. Broad is Homer here.

00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:09.020
 Now Henry, you stay right here on the steps where you are. Don't bother the brow.

00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:13.820
 Oh, Henry's no bother. Is there something I can do for you, Sam?

00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:21.420
 Well, I don't know what this is all about, but I take it that Alice lost her temper when she phoned your wife a few minutes ago.

00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:25.620
 And just between ourselves, will women have a tendency to exaggerate the importance of things?

00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:31.920
 You're right, Sam. I tried to reason with Elizabeth. I'm afraid she went a little overboard herself.

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:36.920
 When you get right down to it, there isn't any Turkey in the world worth sacrificing our friendship over.

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:39.020
 No, no, of course not.

00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:41.320
 And Alice will be the first to admit the same thing.

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:43.420
 That's just the way Elizabeth feels.

00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:48.320
 So, I just wanted to tell you to enjoy the Turkey and have a fine Thanksgiving.

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:49.820
 Now, wait a second, Sam.

00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:53.220
 The fact is, I was just going to start for your house with that turkey.

00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:54.320
 No, no, no, no.

00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:55.320
 Just forget the whole thing.

00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:56.620
 No, Sam, I mean it.

00:14:56.620 --> 00:14:59.620
 [LAUGHTER]

00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:02.620
 She was fathers Mr. Brown really gonna give us the turkey?

00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:05.620
 And if he brings the turkey out here we're not gonna take it.

00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:06.620
 Why not?

00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:10.620
 Don't you think I have any pride? I never got down on my knees for a turkey before, isn't it?

00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:13.620
 Hey, here you are Sam, it's all wrapped in everything.

00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:15.620
 No, no, we'll know, no, no, no.

00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:16.620
 Where are you going with that turkey?

00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:18.620
 Be quiet, Elizabeth!

00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:23.620
 Oh no, I wouldn't think of it. You keep it and have a nice dinner tomorrow.

00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:26.620
 Now Sam, there's no use in your going down those steps without this.

00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:27.620
 Here Henry, you take it.

00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:28.620
 Shall I, Father?

00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:30.620
 -Oh, no. -Henry, come along.

00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:31.620
 Sam.

00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:32.620
 There's no use following us.

00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:34.620
 Will, get your turkey.

00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:36.620
 No, Sam, it's yours.

00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:40.620
 I'm putting it right here on the front walk.

00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:44.620
 All right, Will, if you want to leave it there, it's all right with me.

00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:46.620
 There it is on the sidewalk, Sam.

00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:48.620
 I'm going back in the house.

00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:50.620
 And Henry and I are going down the street.

00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:51.620
 Father, hey, Father.

00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:52.620
 What's the matter?

00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:53.620
 Look at those three dogs coming.

00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:54.620
 What's that?

00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:55.620
 Hey, get away from there.

00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:56.960
 - Get away from there, step!

00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:58.820
 - She got us looked, and one of them took us.

00:15:58.820 --> 00:15:59.660
 - And what, sir?

00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:00.500
 He took it.

00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:01.420
 (whistling)

00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:02.580
 - They come back here.

00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:03.940
 (whistling)

00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:05.700
 - Well, well, that was certainly

00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:08.060
 a foolish thing for you to do.

00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:10.140
 - What do you mean for me to do?

00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:11.300
 What did you leave it there for?

00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:12.700
 - I left it, I left it.

00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:14.020
 You put it down there yourself.

00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:15.100
 - Well, why didn't you pink it up?

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:16.540
 - Why should I at your turkey, Will?

00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:18.420
 If you wanted to go get it, come on, Henry,

00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:19.620
 we've got other things to do.

00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:20.740
 - What about you, Wizfather?

00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:22.100
 - Well, of all of them.

00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:22.940
 - A boss?

00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:24.780
 - What's the matter, Father?

00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:28.460
 Come on, Homer, we've got to chase a dog.

00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:29.820
 A dog, Father?

00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:31.020
 For Thanksgiving?

00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:34.020
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:44.060
 We'll return to the Alders family in just a moment.

00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:46.260
 Now, I don't know how it's going to turn out,

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:49.060
 but it's one sure bet that tonight's Phil Harris Alice

00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:53.180
 Facio will deliver a full half hours' worth of family comedy.

00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:56.940
 And right after the Harris-Fay show on most of these NBC stations,

00:16:56.940 --> 00:16:59.780
 theater guild on the air will bring you Basil Rathbone,

00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:02.700
 Alan Webb, and Margaret Phillips in the radio version

00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:05.620
 of the Broadway hit "The Winslow Boy."

00:17:05.620 --> 00:17:09.060
 And then there's "Adventure" with a pair of NBC programs

00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:12.140
 as Jack Webb stars in this week's "Dragonette Story"

00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:14.780
 from the files of the Los Angeles Police Force,

00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:17.340
 while William Gargon will be on hand in the title role

00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:20.500
 of Barry Craig, confidential investigator.

00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:22.900
 So stay tuned to this NBC station

00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:25.780
 and listen for the Phil Harris Alice Faye Show,

00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:27.300
 Theatre Guild on the Air,

00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:31.100
 Dragnet, and Barry Craig, confidential investigator.

00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:33.680
 (upbeat music)

00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:43.740
 Now getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldrich.

00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:47.180
 The Browns have somehow got a turkey from the meat market

00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:49.780
 that had been reserved from Mrs. Aldrich.

00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:51.740
 And then while Mr. Aldrich and Mr. Brown

00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:57.220
 each trying to outdo the other with politeness over the bird, a stray dog ran off with it.

00:17:57.220 --> 00:18:02.460
 The scene opens in the basement of the Elm Street Church. The time is that same evening.

00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:07.420
 Step right in, folks. Step right in. The auction's going to begin shortly.

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:08.760
 Hello there, Mr. Johnson.

00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:10.520
 Oh, hello, Mr. Alridge. Hi, Henry.

00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:11.860
 Hello. Has the bidding started yet?

00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:13.460
 No, we'll be starting pretty soon.

00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:14.460
 Pretty nice, Turkey.

00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:17.140
 Uh, nicest bird you ever saw. 25 pounder.

00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:17.840
 Come on, Henry.

00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:20.440
 Step right in, folks. The auction will begin shortly.

00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:25.480
 Father I just happen to remember something you know that darn dog that stole our turkey mr. Brown's turkey

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:26.040
 Yes, sir

00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:31.240
 Well, I think his name is dodo when he belongs to that family that lives down on the corner of Maine and elm where you know

00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:33.240
 We're the fences broken down. Oh, yeah

00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:39.640
 That's the family. Well Brown's always complaining about they get about 15 children. Yeah, and do dogs for every child

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:42.840
 I want to get right up here in front

00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:48.640
 We're auctioning off just one turkey tonight, but it sure is a beauty.

00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:51.440
 They say it's a direct descendant of the first turkey the pilgrims ate.

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:52.960
 [LAUGHTER]

00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:54.200
 Hello there, Mr. Johnson.

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:55.240
 Oh, hello, Will Brown.

00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:55.840
 Hi, Homer.

00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:56.360
 Hi.

00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:57.480
 We are late, are we?

00:18:57.480 --> 00:18:59.160
 You haven't sold a turkey yet, have you?

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:00.880
 No, sir, but we're going to start right away.

00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:02.120
 Come on, Homer.

00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:03.640
 Let's get over here to one side.

00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:04.960
 Oh, you're my tired.

00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:07.080
 Does this tear in my pants show?

00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:08.000
 What tear?

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:09.320
 When that dog tripped me.

00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:11.040
 [LAUGHTER]

00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:12.680
 Well, it doesn't show too much.

00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:14.360
 If you don't bend down.

00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:17.800
 Oh my, why couldn't you have remembered this auction before I tried to climb that fence?

00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:19.440
 [bell ringing]

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:20.680
 All right!

00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:22.400
 All right friends, here she is.

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:24.400
 It's all for charity and worthy co-op.

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:25.840
 Bit freely and generously.

00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:27.880
 You may be sure good use will be made of the money.

00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:30.720
 Now, what am I offered for this beautiful turkey?

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:31.880
 $15.

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:33.040
 $15 I'm bid.

00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:34.760
 That's an insult to this beautiful bird.

00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:37.320
 I wouldn't be surprised to see her get up and walk off in a hut.

00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:38.560
 [laughter]

00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:39.720
 Who made it 18?

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:40.160
 20.

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:41.080
 20 I have.

00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:43.000
 Why, the drumsticks are worth that.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:43.960
 [laughter]

00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:49.120
 Now it's 25. Now it's 25. Now it's 30. Now we're going, I have 30 bit.

00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:51.960
 Father, aren't you going to bid? 30 dollars and 50 cents.

00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:56.560
 I'm sorry Mr. Brown. I'm only taking dollar bids on this. It's all for charity.

00:19:56.560 --> 00:20:00.760
 All right then, make it 31. 31 watt father. 31 watts.

00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:02.280
 There it is. I'm afraid.

00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:06.360
 31, 31 it is. Who made it 32? 33. I mean 32.

00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:09.760
 I heard you the first time lady. 33 you made it and thank you.

00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:13.460
 35. 35 on bid. 35.

00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:15.260
 Well Homer, I guess that lets us out.

00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:17.300
 35 I have from Mr. Oderick.

00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:18.140
 Who make it 40?

00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:19.380
 Homer, did he say Aldrich?

00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:20.200
 Well, she wins.

00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:21.100
 Who make it 40?

00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:21.980
 45.

00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:23.660
 45 I'm bit, 45.

00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:24.860
 That'll show Sam already.

00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:26.060
 55, it's 50.

00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:27.060
 55.

00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:28.380
 She wins, father.

00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:29.460
 Keep quiet, Homer.

00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:31.060
 55 I'm bit, 55.

00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:31.960
 Who make it 60?

00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:32.960
 60.

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:34.700
 Oh, thank you, Mr. Brown.

00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:35.860
 You raised your own bit.

00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:36.700
 Thank you.

00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:37.700
 (audience laughing)

00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:38.780
 I'm bit.

00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:40.140
 65, 65.

00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:40.980
 65.

00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:41.820
 65.

00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:42.660
 70.

00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:44.660
 70 I have.

00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:45.900
 70 for charity.

00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:47.220
 70 once.

00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:48.140
 70 twice.

00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:49.780
 Father, suppose mother years about this.

00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:51.460
 70 twice to a him or?

00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:52.420
 What did he say, Homer?

00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:53.740
 I don't want to make another mistake.

00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:54.580
 You are him or?

00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:55.420
 Father, I'd like to tell you.

00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:57.820
 Now listen, Homer, for the last time, be quiet.

00:20:57.820 --> 00:21:01.100
 Sold for $70 to Samuel Loner.

00:21:01.100 --> 00:21:03.020
 [APPLAUSE]

00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:04.500
 To who?

00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:05.940
 That's a fine thing.

00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:07.500
 And Homer, it's all your fault.

00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:08.340
 Mine.

00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:09.460
 How are you, Will?

00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:10.620
 How are you, Sam?

00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:13.420
 Mr. Allrich, if you'll step up here and pay your $70.

00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:14.940
 All right, I'll be happy to.

00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:16.340
 Bye, Homer. Bye, Henry.

00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:21.500
 Mr. Allrich, I want you to know this turkey is going to be wrapped and sent to one of the most deserving families in town.

00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:22.100
 What's that?

00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:25.540
 And presented, of course, with the compliments of the whole Allrich family.

00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:26.540
 [LAUGHTER]

00:21:26.540 --> 00:21:28.540
 Oh, boy!

00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:38.800
 Here, Dodo.

00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:40.420
 Come here, Dodo.

00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:42.660
 Nice, doggy, Dodo.

00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:44.860
 - Morning, give you the turkey, Papa.

00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:46.780
 Dodo, give Papa the turkey.

00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:49.220
 - Junior, keep away, do you wanna frighten him?

00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:50.660
 Here, Dodo.

00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:52.860
 Give me that turkey.

00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:55.240
 That's a nasty turkey, Dodo.

00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:56.460
 You won't like it.

00:21:56.460 --> 00:21:58.100
 - Papa, where do you suppose you got it?

00:21:58.100 --> 00:22:00.500
 - Natalie, will you stand back and all the rest of you,

00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:01.340
 keep back.

00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:02.940
 - All right, stand back, everybody,

00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:04.380
 and let Papa get the turkey.

00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:08.220
 Now Dodo, for the last time, I want that turkey.

00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:10.820
 We need that turkey cap.

00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:12.720
 I'm gonna take dinner in this house in years.

00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:14.180
 Daddy, go out of the country!

00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:15.020
 Where's the girl?

00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:15.860
 I'm sorry.

00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:16.780
 Look at it, look at it.

00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:19.860
 Where do you suppose Dodo found that turkey poppa?

00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:23.620
 Well, I don't believe in looking a gift dog in the mouth.

00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:26.460
 Besides, Dodo knows a lot of people in this town.

00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:27.940
 (knocking)

00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:28.940
 Is that the front door?

00:22:28.940 --> 00:22:29.940
 Yes, Papa.

00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:31.220
 It is?

00:22:31.220 --> 00:22:33.020
 Now look, Junior, take this turkey

00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:34.740
 and go into the kitchen with him.

00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:37.040
 - All right, it's our turkey now.

00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:39.040
 (knocking)

00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:40.100
 - Good evening, Mr. Foley.

00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:41.540
 I've got a surprise for you.

00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:43.260
 - What's that, Mr. Jassen?

00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:44.500
 - Here you are.

00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:46.060
 It's partly from the Elm Street Church

00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:48.180
 and partly from Sam Olridge.

00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:49.500
 - Oh, what's this, a turkey?

00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:52.060
 - A 25-pounder and all the trimmings to go with it.

00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:53.140
 - Oh, Papa!

00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:54.740
 - She was another church!

00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:55.580
 - Thanks, give it up!

00:22:55.580 --> 00:22:58.580
 - I'm going to die, I'm scared and happy day to do the help!

00:22:58.580 --> 00:23:01.160
 (upbeat music)

00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:03.740
 (bell ringing)

00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:09.480
 - Just a minute, Alice, and I'll turn the light out.

00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:10.680
 - Don't forget to open the window

00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:12.640
 before you get it to bed.

00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:13.480
 - Mother.

00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:15.400
 - Yes, Henry, come in.

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:16.400
 - Mother, I hate to bother you,

00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:18.600
 but could you look over this composition for spelling?

00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:20.120
 - Not tonight, dear, but leave it here.

00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:21.440
 I'll go over it in the morning.

00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:22.560
 - All right, and thanks.

00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:23.400
 - Good night, Henry.

00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:24.700
 - Good night, dear.

00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:27.520
 - And now, Alice, I've been thinking it over.

00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:29.560
 - You've been thinking what, over, Sam?

00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:32.760
 I don't see any reason why we should ask the Browns over for dinner tomorrow.

00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:34.880
 To be quite frank, dear, I agree with you.

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:38.760
 I'll admit we've been good friends, but after the way we'll act today...

00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:41.360
 And I didn't like Elizabeth's attitude.

00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:42.600
 So we might just as well...

00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:45.240
 Dear, how do you spell Pocahontas?

00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:46.160
 What's that?

00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:48.200
 I guess Henry spelled it right.

00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:52.040
 Anyway, I don't see any point in having guests here for the dinner of cranberries and chestnuts.

00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:55.160
 But dear, I told you we're also having corned beef hash.

00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:56.000
 Hash?

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.760
 Of course, I know it isn't turkey, but...

00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:01.260
 Sam, how do you spell Pocahontas?

00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:02.260
 Pocahontas?

00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:04.760
 There's no K in it, is there?

00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:05.760
 [LAUGHTER]

00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:08.760
 There may be in the original Indian spelling.

00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:10.760
 Sam, listen to this.

00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:11.760
 Listen to what?

00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:15.260
 What I did on Thanksgiving by Henry W. Aldrich.

00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:16.760
 Thanksgivings tomorrow.

00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:18.760
 Yes, dear, but stop interrupting.

00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:24.760
 This year, the same as last year, we did the same old stuff that we did every other year.

00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:27.760
 To begin with, our dinner consisted of turkey.

00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:29.760
 Only he scratched that out and wrote chicken.

00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:30.760
 Yeah?

00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:32.760
 Where does he think he's going to eat chicken?

00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:34.760
 Then he scratched that out and just left it blank.

00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:35.760
 Oh.

00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:41.560
 After we finished this hearty meal, we felt very stuffed and all sat around and talked

00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:46.760
 about the price of things and the weather and business and stuff like that.

00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:49.760
 Back in the old days, however, it was much more interesting.

00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:54.760
 Then there wasn't much food for anybody and the pilgrims had to shoot turkeys just like

00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:55.760
 Indians.

00:24:55.760 --> 00:25:01.080
 Pocahontas was one Indian, for example, but she was a good Indian.

00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:07.800
 Mints meat, in those days, they didn't have at that time, nor things like sage, because

00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:10.760
 no more ships came in that year.

00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:15.960
 When you once got some food, you had to hang on to it for dear life, because almost anybody

00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:17.520
 might steal it.

00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:19.560
 Usually a wolf.

00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:23.880
 There were no stores to buy things, so if a wolf took your turkey and stuff, you were

00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:25.040
 out of love.

00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:27.440
 Let me see that out.

00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:34.200
 But it was because of all this that the Pilgrim Fathers, from whom we are all sprung, celebrated

00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:40.720
 their first Thanksgiving and bowed their heads when they sat down over what was in many cases

00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:47.120
 just plain cornmeal mush, which is something that even my mother has never gotten me to

00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:52.400
 like as much as I admire the Pilgrims for the other things they did.

00:25:52.400 --> 00:26:00.640
 Even cornmeal mush is all right, I guess, as long as they had neighbors to share it.

00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:06.560
 Because, as my father says, when it comes to Thanksgiving, it's the spirit and not the

00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:08.800
 stuffing that counts.

00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:15.160
 Your father, Homer's on the phone.

00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:18.080
 His folks say if we could bring over a few eggs, they have some cornmeal to make cornmeal

00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:19.080
 muffins.

00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:20.800
 And won't we come over for dinner tomorrow?

00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:25.800
 "What do you mean won't we come over? You tell them to pack up their cornmeal and come over here!"

00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:26.800
 "I can ask them?"

00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:31.800
 "Yes dear, and tell Mrs. Brown if she has any cinnamon to please bring it. I'm going to make apple sauce."

00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:46.800
 Fight communism by joining the Crusade for Freedom,

00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:52.040
 freedom, the independent movement of the American people which supports Radio Free Europe and

00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:57.700
 Radio Free Asia. These two networks are shattering the isolation which the Kremlin has imposed

00:26:57.700 --> 00:27:03.220
 on its slave states. As a private enterprise they can hit hard and expose the falseness

00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:07.980
 of the communist line. They can spike the hate and lie campaign of the Soviets against

00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:15.220
 the free world. So help build more transmitters for Radio Free Europe and Radio Free Asia.

00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:20.220
 your contribution to "Crucade for Freedom" care of your local postmaster.

00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:41.220
 Mother, at what time are we having dinner?

00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:43.220
 Not for another hour, Sylvia.

00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:46.140
 Look, Mr. Foley's dog, Dodo is out in the front yard.

00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:46.980
 Yes, Henry.

00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:49.020
 And Homer and I are going to take him and do a little hunting.

00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:50.140
 Hunting, do you?

00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:52.860
 Just around the neighborhood and see what we can dig up.

00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:55.360

00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:40.140
 for another sparkling half hour with the Aldridge family.

00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:41.140
 Good night, everybody.
