WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:29.000
 It's the Aldrich family. I beg your pardon. We said it's the Aldrich family. Yes, it's the Aldrich family presented by the Jell-O family. J-E-L-L-O. Oh, Meredith, Meredith, will I? Well, it's my talking people all ready to enjoy the Aldrich family. Oh, hey, hey, what's the matter here? Got to do the dinner dishes.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.360
 You can still listen to Henry in a homer and do the dinner dishes too.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.600
 Hey! Good idea, Bob.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.560
 You bet it's a good idea, Bob.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:38.760
 Did you have a good dinner?

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.280
 You bet!

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.280
 You!

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.160
 Sounds like you had smooth as green jello puddings, maybe.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.000
 Uh...

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.800
 No.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:47.300
 No.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.880
 Well, then maybe the pudding with the personality and the dimple?

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.440
 Jello tapioca pudding?

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:51.940
 Right.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:53.280
 Did you have jello tapioca pudding?

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.840
 Uh...

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:55.340
 No.

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.840
 No.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.240
 Well, then what did you have for dessert?

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.240
 The world will famous shimmery

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.240
 These are...

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:02.240
 That's jello.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.240
 In those six delicious flavors

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:05.240
 Starting with strawberry

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:07.240
 Let's berry

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.240
 Cherry

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.240
 Lemon

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.240
 Lemon

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.240
 Mmmm

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.240
 Mmmm

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.240
 Can't eat

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.240
 out health

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.240
 Oh

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.240
 Would you like it?

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.240
 Oh no, not much

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.240
 I hope I'll speak to you

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.240
 Hey, look at that clock.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.240
 It's time for...

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.240
 The Aldrich family, based on characters originated by Clifford Goldsmith,

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.240
 and starring Ezra Stone as Henry with Jackie Kelke as Homer.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.240
 Henry! Henry Aldrich!

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.240
 A Ming Mother!

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:53.240
 [applause]

00:01:53.240 --> 00:02:01.840
 Life's greatest gift is you.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.460
 And fortunately, it isn't confined to anyone age.

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.760
 Youth can be recaptured at any time by anyone

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:13.120
 who simply shares the experiences of an enthusiastic teenage boy

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.760
 like Henry Aldridge.

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.000
 The scene opens in Henry's bedroom. It is Saturday morning.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.560
 Now listen, Henry, that's no way to hold it.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.960
 It is so y-you have to tip it.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.760
 Then how can you get the knife in?

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.900
 Homer, what go? Gee whiz, whose piggy bank is this anyway?

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.600
 Okay, go ahead if you're so smart.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.160
 Why should I help you scrape up money to throw down the drain?

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.200
 What do you mean down the drain?

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.660
 If I can get enough money out of this bank, I'm gonna ask Kathleen to go to a movie tonight.

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.660
 Henry, you're crazy. You take Kathleen to a movie in what have you got?

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.660
 A lot of memories and a good night kiss. If you're lucky.

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.660
 What's wrong with that? Well, you can do that any old time.

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.660
 But boy, it isn't every day in the week that Springer's hardware has a grab bag sale.

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.660
 That's just it, Homer. You buy a grab bag and where are you?

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.660
 But take Kathleen to the movies and at least you know what you're getting.

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.660
 Sure. So why not buy a grab bag and get pleasantly surprised?

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.160
 Boy, another dime!

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.860
 How much have you got out of your bank now?

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:17.260
 50 cents so far.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:18.460
 50 cents?

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:21.060
 And there's one more coin in here.

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:27.560
 Boy, if I had 50 cents, I'd get my best friend and pull our money and invest it in a grab bag.

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.160
 Now wait a minute Homer, how much money have you actually got?

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.560
 A dime.

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.260
 Okay, so stop wasting your breath on grab bags.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:36.660
 My mind is made up.

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:41.260
 What Henry, did I tell you those grab bags have values up to ten dollars in them?

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
 Hey, look, a quarter!

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:43.760
 Yeah?

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.260
 That gives me exactly enough to cover Kathleen.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.260
 Two balcony seats, two sodas, and a nickel's worth of candy.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.760
 Oi, what you couldn't get at spring or $0.75.

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:54.760
 $0.75?

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.260
 You mean they have grab bags as low as that?

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.760
 Sure, none of them are over a dollar.

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.260
 Homer, you're crazy.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.760
 Are you telling me they have $10 values all for under a dollar?

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.260
 Sure, it's the chance of a lifetime, Henry. You can't lose.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
 But how can you be sure what you're getting?

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.500
 That's the beautiful part. You can. That's where the fun comes in.

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.860
 See, it does sound interesting.

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:20.660
 And you know what you might win, Henry? That bicycle pump you've been lying.

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.860
 Oh, boy. Do you really think so?

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:23.660
 Oh, Henry.

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:24.660
 Yes, Father?

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.660
 You think that's out here in the hall a moment?

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:27.660
 Sure, Father.

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:28.660
 Homer, wait here.

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:29.660
 Okay, but don't be long.

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.660
 I have it just passing your room, Henry. I couldn't help overhearing.

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.660
 You mean about the grab bag sale, Father?

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:36.660
 Then that sounds swell.

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.260
 Frankly, son, it sounds a little risky to me.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:40.260
 to me.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.260
 Risky for other gee wizards the chance of a lifetime.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.460
 When you invest in one of those grab bags you can't lose.

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.700
 Even though you have no idea what it might be inside.

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:50.780
 But that's the beautiful part father.

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.100
 There might be anything inside.

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:54.420
 There might also be nothing.

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:57.180
 But Homer said their value is up to ten dollars.

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.060
 Henry, I want you to make your own decision in this matter.

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.900
 But remember one thing, merchants can very seldom afford to give away anything valuable.

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.100
 But, father, do you know what I might get for seventy-five cents?

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:08.860
 A bicycle pump.

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:10.620
 Henry, you're being very optimistic.

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.220
 I have it on good authority.

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:14.300
 Now, son, I know all about grab bags.

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.220
 I've had my fingers burned. You haven't.

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:19.060
 But, Father, these bags are entirely different.

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:21.060
 Henry, let me explain one more thing.

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:22.460
 We're going to time.

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:33.100
 Hello?

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:34.900
 Hello?

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:35.580
 Hello?

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.100
 Hello, Kathleen.

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:39.700
 Listen, I'm phoning from Springer's hardware, see?

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:40.900
 Oh, hello, Mr. Springer.

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:41.700
 And who?

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:42.260
 What?

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.340
 Kathleen, this is Henry.

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:46.940
 I'm down here at Springer's with Homer and his dime.

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:47.740
 You are?

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:48.580
 Sure.

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:52.540
 And look, how would you like to go to the movies tonight?

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:53.740
 The movies?

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:55.740
 I'd love to, Henry.

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:57.300
 And sit in the balcony?

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:58.300
 Uh-huh.

00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:59.860
 Way in the back?

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:01.180
 Uh-huh.

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:02.380
 What's playing?

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:04.580
 Playing?

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:06.460
 Kathleen, don't you like me anymore?

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:08.220
 (audience laughing)

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:09.920
 - Of course I do.

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:12.740
 - I know, but, well, Gee, you never used to ask

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:13.900
 what was playing.

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:16.100
 - Well, honey, it's a perfectly minor point.

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:17.660
 - Okay, then it's all settled.

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:19.580
 I'll come by for you right after supper.

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:20.700
 - Thanks, Henry.

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:22.020
 Goodbye.

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:23.020
 - Goodbye.

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:26.380
 - Hey, Henry, look at this bag here.

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:27.220
 - Which one?

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:29.080
 - This one with all the bulges in it.

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.780
 Doesn't it drive you crazy wondering what's in it?

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:33.100
 - Not me, Homer.

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:35.340
 I'm just down here to keep you company.

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:39.100
 She, and aren't you the least bit interested in buying anything?

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:41.540
 Not if I have to risk every cent I have in the world.

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:44.340
 Now you take this long skinny bag here.

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:46.300
 Yeah. It's 30 cents, isn't it?

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:48.820
 Sure. Go ahead, and why don't you buy it?

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:53.180
 Why should I spend 30 cents for just a plain ordinary yardstick?

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:55.820
 A yardstick? Is that all that bag is?

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:58.820
 Sure. And she whizzed if I hadn't listened to my father,

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:00.380
 I might have been carried away.

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:01.980
 Hiya fellas. Here comes Willie.

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:03.220
 Hi fellas, what you doing?

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:05.320
 Just looking around, Willie.

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:06.020
 Yeah?

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:08.560
 Hey, Henry, are you gonna buy that wrong thin crab bag?

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:09.820
 He might be, Willie.

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:11.320
 I am not, Homer.

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:12.420
 Well, can I have a fan?

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:13.320
 Sure, here.

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:13.820
 Bank!

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:15.820
 Oh, Mr. Springer, here's my 30 cents!

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:18.320
 Wait, Willie, don't you know what's in that bag?

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:19.420
 Don't tell him, Homer.

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:20.020
 Don't tell him.

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:21.720
 You know how stubborn Willie is.

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:22.520
 Yeah, but...

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:23.920
 Let him get burnt by himself.

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:25.220
 It'll be a good lesson for him.

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:26.920
 Hey, you wanna watch me open my bag?

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:28.120
 Sure, Willie.

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:29.820
 I'll now stand back, fellas.

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:32.320
 Boy, I bet you'll get a surprise, Willie.

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:33.520
 - Yeah, I hope so.

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:36.040
 Hey!

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:36.760
 - What is it, Willie?

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:37.600
 Let's see.

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:38.760
 - Oh boy.

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:40.120
 - Oh boy.

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:41.840
 - A collapsible fishing rod.

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:43.440
 Just what I've always wanted.

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:47.200
 - Gee, those things cost about $7.

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:49.800
 Just think, Henry, you could have had it.

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:52.080
 - Yeah, but I could have sworn it.

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:53.760
 Let's see that fishing rod, Willie.

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:56.080
 Boy, this is slick.

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:57.600
 - Well, I'll say.

00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:59.600
 - Gee, Gee, are you lucky?

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:00.720
 - I sure am.

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:01.920
 Well, sworn, fellas.

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:03.480
 Where are you going, Lily?

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:04.320
 - Fresh 'em?

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:06.640
 - Boy.

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:08.480
 - Boy.

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:12.000
 Henry, maybe your father still has a few things to learn.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:12.960
 - Yeah.

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:15.960
 I guess he didn't live during a period of inflation.

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:17.320
 (audience laughing)

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:18.320
 - I'll say.

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:20.120
 You know, Homer, I've been thinking.

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:20.960
 - Yeah.

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:23.920
 - Kathleen might enjoy a movie tonight, sure.

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:26.240
 Only she'd be even crazier about something

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:28.480
 I might win in a grab bag for her, wouldn't she?

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:30.400
 - Now you're talking sense, Ham.

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:31.800
 - Sure, Homer, come on.

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:33.400
 Help me pick out a grab bag.

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:34.400
 How about this one?

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:38.680
 Boy, well my father hears that merchants really do give valuable things away.

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:39.680
 Hey Henry.

00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:40.680
 Hi Charlie.

00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:41.680
 Don't bother us Charlie.

00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:43.680
 We're busy looking for a grab bag to buy.

00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:44.680
 Yeah, what?

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:45.680
 How should we know Charlie?

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:46.680
 We haven't bought it yet.

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:50.360
 Well if this told me Smith I'm going to see what he got in his grab bag.

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:53.640
 Listen Henry, how would you like to buy this nifty box of clothes pin?

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:54.640
 Clothes pins?

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:56.240
 What could I possibly do with clothes pins?

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:59.560
 Well you could use them to hang girls pictures up on your wall.

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:00.560
 What?

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:05.420
 for starting fires. Charlie you're crazy. Oh now look Henry I paid 25 cents for

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:10.740
 him and I'll let you have him for 20. Oh no. 15. Nothing doing. 10. Well you pay a

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:14.680
 quarter for a thing like that for. I got it in the grab bag and boy am I gonna

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:18.820
 sue Mr. Springer. Well look Charlie naturally merchants can't give away

00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:24.100
 valuable things in every grab bag. Hey Henry get some just bought what for 60 cents.

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:29.900
 A paint sprayer. Why? Toby Smith for only 60 cents. Homer what could you do with a

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:34.700
 thing like that except spray paint. Plenty. I happen to know my father would pay five

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:40.460
 dollars for a new paint spray. Five dollars? Five dollars. You look. Cold cash? Cold cash? I'm the

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:46.300
 line Henry. He's gonna need one to paint our house. Oh boy. Oh boy. Let's start looking home where

00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:50.460
 there might be another sprayer in these grab bags here. There might. She whizzed a bite. Where are

00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:55.420
 you going Charlie? Home and get some more money. One thing about a paint sprayer home where you can

00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:56.820
 and tell it by the feel of it.

00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:59.020
 - Okay, I'll start feeling from this side.

00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:00.460
 - Sure, and I'll start over here.

00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:02.020
 - And we'll feel taught each other.

00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:02.940
 - Oh, why?

00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:04.380
 - Yes, Mr. Springer?

00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:07.180
 - All right, but we can't allow any feeling around.

00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:09.860
 (audience laughing)

00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:11.940
 - Make a chance of it like everybody else.

00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:13.460
 - Sure, Mr. Springer.

00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:16.300
 - Boy, Homer, that's what I call loyalty.

00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:17.140
 - How do you mean?

00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:18.980
 - See, Mr. Springer is practically a member

00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:20.460
 of our own family, isn't he?

00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:21.300
 - He is.

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:23.500
 - Sure, he's engaged to my aunt, Harriet.

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:26.500
 Well frankly I don't blame him for being cranky.

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:28.500
 (audience laughs)

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:32.500
 Homer are you positive you didn't feel anything remotely like a paint spray?

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:34.500
 Positive. You couldn't mistake a thing like that.

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:37.500
 Boy what I couldn't do with five dollars.

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:39.500
 Makes me a week to think about it.

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:40.500
 Let's sit down.

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:42.500
 Hey, Henry.

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:43.500
 Yeah?

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:45.500
 I found one.

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:46.500
 A paint sprayer?

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:49.500
 Yeah, I'm sitting on it.

00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:50.500
 Who were you sure?

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:52.500
 Sure, I'm sure.

00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:58.100
 home where I forgot I left my 75 cents at home. Well that's a fine thing. Look Homer you stay

00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:02.420
 right here and guard this paint sprayer while I run home for my money. But what if somebody

00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:07.220
 else wants to buy it? Just don't let them and Homer if you can keep it for me I'll give you a dollar

00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:10.180
 when I sell. Okay Henry run.

00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:23.100
 It's nice of you to drop in Harry. It's sit down. I'll pour you some coffee.

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:24.740
 Thank you, Alice. How sad.

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:26.100
 He's just fine.

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:27.860
 How's Mr. Springer?

00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:29.780
 Alvin? Just fine.

00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:31.660
 Art men a problem.

00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:32.420
 Oh.

00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:35.340
 Have you and Alvin had a quarrel, Harry?

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:37.420
 Oh no, just a little disagreement.

00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:39.980
 Alvin thinks I should take a painting again.

00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:40.620
 Really?

00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:43.420
 Yes, he believes in women having outside interest.

00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:48.540
 But as I said to him, I said, "Alvin, I said frankly, I don't think I'm very talented, do you?"

00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:53.940
 Well to tell you the absolute truth, Harry, and he said, "Yes, Harry, it's I do."

00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:55.940
 Oh. Oh, he did.

00:11:55.940 --> 00:12:00.940
 Of course, he admits he doesn't know a thing about art, but he knows what he likes.

00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:01.940
 Isn't that nice?

00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:02.940
 Four-thousand.

00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:06.940
 He just can't help seeing me through rose-colored glasses, I guess.

00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:07.940
 Mother!

00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:08.940
 Oh my goodness, that's Henry.

00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:10.940
 Mother, quick, where's my 75 cents glow in, Harry?

00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:11.940
 Hello.

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:16.940
 Henry, you told me to keep it for you and not to give it to you under any circumstances until tonight.

00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:21.360
 Mother don't you understand I've cornered a valuable grab bag and I'm going to make a killing.

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:23.340
 You've forgotten what your father says?

00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:26.160
 No, only he doesn't understand. This sale is different.

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:27.140
 I know!

00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:29.820
 Henry is right. I happen to know personally.

00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:32.780
 There are some very valuable grab bags down there.

00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:35.240
 It's very well I'll go upstairs and get your money.

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:38.380
 You will? That just give me time to make a phone call.

00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:39.660
 Number please!

00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:40.900
 Alm, 1-1-0.

00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:41.980
 Alm, 1-1-0.

00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:43.040
 Yes, operator.

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:45.220
 Harriet, I do wish you let me have.

00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:47.720
 Mother, can you please hurry with my money?

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:48.220
 With my money?

00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:49.720
 Homer's sitting on something.

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:50.720
 Hello.

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:51.720
 Hello, Kathleen.

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:52.720
 Let me ask you something quick.

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:53.720
 What is it?

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:59.220
 Well, suppose, just suppose you were going out dancing to the country club.

00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:00.220
 Oh my goodness, when?

00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:03.220
 Well, suppose it's tonight, see.

00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:05.220
 What color dress would you be wearing?

00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:06.220
 What color?

00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:07.220
 Sure.

00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:09.220
 So I could send you flowers, if.

00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:10.220
 Flowers!

00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:14.220
 If I provide it, I get $5 for a certain something I'm going to win and it doesn't cost too much for a tax.

00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:17.000
 - Oh my goodness, Henry, you mean we're going in a taxi?

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.300
 - We might, so what color, Kathleen?

00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:20.900
 - What, just any color?

00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:23.220
 Although I do like those big black shiny ones.

00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:24.540
 - Black flowers?

00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:25.900
 - Are we talking about taxi?

00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:27.900
 - No, Gee, who is?

00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:30.820
 - Oh my goodness, well, any orchid color flower will do.

00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:32.300
 And I have to hurry and get my hair done.

00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:33.140
 - But, but Kathleen--

00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:34.300
 - Well, I know, Henry, I'll see you tonight.

00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:36.100
 - Sure, only understand, it isn't death on that,

00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:37.220
 don't you, Kathleen?

00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:39.180
 Kathleen!

00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:41.760
 (upbeat music)

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:44.340
 (upbeat music)

00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:50.280
 - Now wait a minute, Charlie, what are you doing?

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:51.520
 - What do you mean what am I doing?

00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:53.040
 I'm trying to pick out a paint sprayer.

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:55.440
 - But you're not allowed to feel a grab bag.

00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:57.000
 You just have to take your chin.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.720
 - Now listen Homer, since when do you own this hardware store?

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:01.840
 - Charlie, get away from this grab bag.

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:03.160
 - But it might be a paint sprayer.

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:05.600
 - And it might not, and besides it's reserved.

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:07.080
 - Then it is a paint sprayer.

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:09.800
 - Now listen, Charlie, not Homer, let go of me.

00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:14.280
 Charlie don't get mad. I didn't mean to push you. Let's just talk this over

00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:18.880
 calmly. Oh yeah listen you little pith squeeze. Charlie you're backing right

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:25.960
 into the garden hole. I'll take this grab bag here. Hey. Hey that's Henry's grab bag

00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:33.160
 old lady. Homer you've got the hose looped over your arms. Lady come back. Homer look out! Hey!

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:52.160
 [Music]

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:58.160
 It's a fact, folks. More people buy jello puddings than any other prepared puddings in the world and no wonder.

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:02.160
 because you never tasted anything better than jello puddings.

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:05.160
 Yes, jello chocolate butter, scotch and vanilla puddings,

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:08.160
 chuck full of old-fashioned homemade goodness.

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:10.160
 Try 'em. Compare them.

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:14.160
 See if you don't say that jello puddings are richer, creamier,

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:18.160
 more all-around delicious, and they cook to perfection in just about five minutes.

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:22.160
 Ask your grocer for jello puddings and say,

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:26.160
 better ask for three packages while you're about it, so you'll be prepared for the weekend.

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:28.160
 That's Jell-O putting.

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:30.160
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:44.160
 And now getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldridge.

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:48.160
 Hoping to make a fortune from a grab bag he wants to buy and then sell for a profit,

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:53.160
 Henry has been planning to entertain Kathleen elaborately this evening.

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:57.160
 But his chances of getting the money are now getting slimmer and slimmer.

00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:01.160
 The scene opens in a back room of Alvin Springer's Sanderville Hardware Store.

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:03.160
 It is the same morning.

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:07.160
 Excuse me, Mr. Have you seen anything of my friend Homer Brown?

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:09.160
 I have no friend of mine Henry already.

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:10.160
 Homer, is that you?

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:12.160
 Sure, just look at it.

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:14.160
 I am, Gee, what has happened to your face?

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:17.160
 Never mind my face. That'll wash off.

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:20.160
 But how can I get all this pain and grease off my clothes?

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:21.160
 What have you been doing?

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:26.560
 Boy, everything. Hoisting paint drums, mixing putty, filling turpentine bottles.

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:27.360
 But why?

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:31.560
 Just because I had a little accident trying to save your darn grab back.

00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:34.360
 You mean it's gone, but I was counting on that five dollars.

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:36.760
 Kathleen thinks I'm taking her out dancing tonight.

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:40.560
 Listen, Henry. How much do you think you could sell an outboard motor for?

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:43.060
 An outboard motor? Homer, you're crazy.

00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:46.960
 Who's crazy? You know the one Mr. Springer's had in his window for two years.

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:51.120
 Sure, but it just happened an hour ago. I saw him lugging into that room over there

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:57.960
 Yeah, and then he came back in here with that box and he said whoever buys it this afternoon is gonna get the surprise of their life

00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:03.360
 Homer do you mean it and it's only 75 so sure it's what they call a sleeper. Oh

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:10.240
 Boy gee I could sell that for ten times as much as the paint sprayer sure so you owe me ten dollars

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:15.200
 Oh, hold on. Second thought I probably can't get more than five times as much.

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:16.200
 Now listen, listen.

00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:19.200
 Look, why don't I go out now and round up a prospective buyer?

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:20.200
 Oh, Homer.

00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:23.200
 Mr. Springer, what time are those grab bags going on sale?

00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:24.200
 It looks like Char, Henry.

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:27.200
 You're sure you won't sell any of them before that?

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:28.200
 Nope.

00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:30.200
 Gee, that's, well, goodbye, Homer. I'll be back.

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:34.200
 Homer, I've been keeping an eye on you this morning. You've certainly done a good job back here.

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:35.200
 I have.

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:40.200
 Yes, sir. And to show my appreciation, I'm going to let you have any grab bag you'd like for that dime of yours.

00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:45.440
 a dime. You mean I can have any bag at all? Yes sir. You mean I could even have the

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:50.880
 outboard motor. What outboard motor? Oh gee I shouldn't have mentioned it. I mean

00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:57.960
 this big grab bag right here. Oh Murr that isn't an outboard motor. It isn't. Oh boy

00:17:57.960 --> 00:18:00.080
 is Henry gonna get a surprise.

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:09.580
 [Music]

00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:10.080
 Hello!

00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:11.080
 Hello, Kathleen!

00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:13.080
 Henry, is it only you?

00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:14.080
 What do you mean, only me?

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:16.080
 Oh my goodness, you dragged me out from under the dryer!

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:17.080
 I did?

00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:19.080
 I'm standing right here positively dripping!

00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:25.080
 Look, Kathleen, I just wanted to tell you that the thing I'm selling now is much more valuable than the thing I was selling before!

00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:26.080
 It is, Henry!

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:27.080
 Yeah!

00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:28.080
 What is?

00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:31.760
 I can't tell you. I'm down at the Acme Machine Works right now.

00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:34.080
 And we are going to the country cup tonight, aren't we?

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:36.760
 Sure, absolutely. And not only that.

00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:37.420
 Yes?

00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:40.400
 Kathleen, how would you feel about a season ticket?

00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:41.800
 A season ticket?

00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:44.640
 Sure, and go every Saturday night in the year.

00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:46.640
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:57.040
 Boy, Mr. Springer, the grand prize.

00:18:57.040 --> 00:18:59.280
 You're certainly the lucky one today, Homer.

00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:02.260
 It's the only thing I ever won in my whole life.

00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:03.920
 Do you mind if I use your phone?

00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:04.680
 Go ahead.

00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:05.380
 Thanks.

00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:06.480
 Now, Brooklyn.

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:08.000
 I owe him 6-1-0.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:09.200
 I owe him 6-1-0.

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:13.840
 She and Mr. Springer, to think Henry's Aunt Harriet painted that all by herself.

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:16.260
 Yes, sir, and she's never had a lesson in her life.

00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:17.280
 Would you believe it?

00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:19.200
 Well, to tell you the truth...

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:20.200
 Neither would I.

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:22.600
 All it needs now is a nice brand.

00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:23.520
 Hello!

00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:24.640
 Hello, mother.

00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:25.840
 Guess who this is?

00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:27.440
 Oh, my don't be silly.

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:30.240
 Listen, Mother, a wonderful thing just happened.

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:31.840
 I just bought a grab bag.

00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:33.640
 I thought you didn't have enough money to buy one.

00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:39.040
 Well, I didn't, but Mr. Springer just had me move a few paint drums and gave it to me for practically nothing.

00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:39.540
 Really?

00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:41.840
 And, Mother, I won the grand prize.

00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:42.540
 You are?

00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:46.840
 Sure, and it's something you've always wanted, and I'd be willing to let it go, cheat.

00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:49.840
 Oh, Rhett, it isn't... it isn't sure.

00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:51.340
 It's a sort of a painting.

00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:52.440
 Oh, my heavens.

00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:54.740
 And for the inside or the outside of the house...

00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:55.340
 Why?

00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:58.620
 Oh, you're a deer and now would you hang up? I'm too excited.

00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:02.140
 Okay, and don't worry, Mother. Mr. Springer's gonna clean me up.

00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:03.580
 That's nice, dear. Goodbye.

00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:04.220
 Goodbye.

00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:07.020
 Oh, Mr. Springer.

00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:08.140
 Yes, Homer.

00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:11.260
 Have you tried looking at this painting upside down?

00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:22.380
 Oh, Alice, I just had a dash right over.

00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:23.880
 And Mrs. will tell me again.

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:25.680
 Homer won the grand prize.

00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:28.980
 We're having our house painted absolutely free.

00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:30.180
 Oh my god.

00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:31.580
 Oh, is it marvelous?

00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:34.380
 And Mr. Spring has already given home with the drums of paint.

00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:38.380
 And Mrs. and I had no idea there was anything worthwhile in those grand days.

00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:40.380
 Oh, Alice, I still can't believe it.

00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:43.580
 You know, Will and I had to choose this year between having a house painted

00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:47.080
 or getting me a new fur coat and we decided on the house.

00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:47.680
 Really?

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:51.580
 Yes, we agreed the house takes more of a beating in the window than I do.

00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:53.180
 (audience laughing)

00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:54.580
 - Mr. Booker's not mean that now?

00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:56.220
 - Why not, Alice, why not?

00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:59.740
 I'll get you head on, let's go look at fur coats right away.

00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:01.100
 Shouldn't you wait until we'll,

00:21:01.100 --> 00:21:02.900
 Alice, I'm only going to look.

00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:05.480
 (upbeat music)

00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:13.580
 - Hello?

00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:15.020
 Are you listening, Kathleen?

00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:16.620
 - Of course, Henry, then what happened?

00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:19.340
 - Well, I found a fella who had a boat, see,

00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:20.620
 but no motor.

00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:22.820
 Yes, and you sold him your motor?

00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:24.180
 And not exactly.

00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:24.680
 No.

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:26.540
 He sold me his boat.

00:21:26.540 --> 00:21:27.540
 My motor!

00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:29.900
 Well, that is, I gave him my IOU.

00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:32.980
 And by next summer, the boat will be mine, I hope.

00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:35.260
 Henry, that's wonderful.

00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:38.460
 My goodness, I'll be the proudest girl at the dance.

00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:39.260
 The dance?

00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:41.060
 Just imagine I'll be the only one

00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:43.620
 there dancing with a boy with an outboard motor.

00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:44.140
 What?

00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:46.340
 [LAUGHTER]

00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:49.900
 Kathleen, look, about the dance.

00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:50.900
 Yes.

00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:54.540
 How would you feel if we were to give up all activities this winter?

00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:55.540
 What?

00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:59.540
 And spend two solid months sailing around in the moonlight next summer.

00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:03.060
 But Henry, what do we do during the long winter evening?

00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:05.980
 Why, we can polish the boat.

00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:06.980
 Polishes?

00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:08.460
 Yeah, and grease the motor.

00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:11.060
 But Henry, I've just had my hair done.

00:22:11.060 --> 00:22:12.060
 Well, I'll tell you.

00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:13.460
 Gee, look at the time.

00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:14.460
 It's 1.30.

00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:15.460
 It is?

00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:17.220
 I've got to get back to Springer's and buy my grab bag.

00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:18.220
 But Henry!

00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:22.720
 outboard motor right over to your house Kathleen so we can admire it together.

00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:39.220
 Sam.

00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:40.920
 I'm reading my paper, Ollie.

00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:42.360
 The adenos ready.

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:44.000
 Yes? Where's Henry?

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.640
 Up in his room he doesn't feel like eating.

00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:48.760
 I should think he wouldn't.

00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:50.520
 Well, he can't say I didn't warn him.

00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:53.240
 I told him not to count on an outboard motor.

00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:56.200
 Here I can't help feeling sorry, Farron.

00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:58.600
 What honor is he going to do with a bear trap?

00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:01.340
 [LAUGHTER]

00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:04.040
 Naturally, Alice, he's going to trap bears.

00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:07.120
 Sam, there isn't a bear within 500 miles of here.

00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:08.600
 Alice, I'm joking.

00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:10.520
 I wouldn't feel so badly, Sam, if I

00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:12.920
 thought he'd really learned a lesson from this whole thing.

00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:13.920
 Alice learned one thing.

00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:16.720
 At least he won't be so optimistic after this.

00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:18.960
 When you answer the phone, dear, while I serve dinner.

00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:19.720
 All right, Alice.

00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:22.320
 Hello.

00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:24.280
 May I speak to Mr. Aldrich, please?

00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:25.800
 Uh, which Mr. Aldrich do you want?

00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:27.680
 Mr. Henry Aldrich.

00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:29.400
 - Yeah, at the moment. - Henry.

00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:30.480
 Yes, Father.

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:31.720
 You want it on the telephone?

00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:33.320
 Perhaps you could take the message.

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:34.960
 This is Mr. Jenkins, the Tanner.

00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:36.560
 - The what? - The Tanner.

00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:40.440
 I have that information regarding the cost of turning a bear skin into a rug.

00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:41.160
 What's that?

00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:43.600
 It all depends on the size bear you're trapped.

00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:46.440
 I am not trapping any bears, and neither is anyone else,

00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:51.440
 in this family goodbye father didn't you say that phone call was for me that was

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:57.600
 the tenor Henry I took care of him you did father but I had my plans all made

00:23:57.600 --> 00:24:03.520
 you can just unmake them come on into dinner if if you don't mind father I

00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:10.240
 rather go back up I'm coming Alice you know the I've been thinking couldn't

00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:13.640
 you give Henry just enough money to take Kathleen to the movies tonight no

00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:16.640
 No, Alice. That's the only way youngster ever learned.

00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:17.640
 I know, but...

00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:20.640
 That's the way you had to learn. That's the way I had to.

00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:22.640
 Good heavens, what's that?

00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:23.640
 What's what, dear?

00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:25.640
 That, on the center of the table.

00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:32.640
 Well, they're candles, dear. You see, shaped like little stars, and they float in the water.

00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:33.640
 Why?

00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:34.640
 Why?

00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:36.640
 I said, why?

00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:40.640
 Well, they're pretty. Sam, I won them today, and I thought I'd better use them.

00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:41.640
 I see.

00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:45.640
 Alice, you weren't anywhere near Springer's part where today were you?

00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:46.640
 What? How did you...

00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:47.640
 But...

00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:48.640
 dear, before you get angry...

00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:50.640
 That's all right, Alice.

00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:54.640
 Do you know anyone who could use a dozen bottles of bubble bath?

00:24:54.640 --> 00:25:00.640
 It's for dogs.

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:03.640
 Oh, Sam, you bummer-grab bag too?

00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:04.640
 I'm afraid so, Alice.

00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:06.640
 But dear, we don't even have a dog.

00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:08.640
 You owe anybody home?

00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:10.640
 We're in the dining room, Homer.

00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:13.640
 - You certainly have to admire his timing.

00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:14.640
 - Oh, everybody.

00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:17.640
 - Oh, gee whiz, is it dinner time?

00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:20.640
 - My strange coincidence, yes.

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:22.640
 - Sit down, Homer, we're one short tonight.

00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:23.640
 - Boy, I'd love to.

00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:25.640
 We aren't eating at our house, Tamarae.

00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:26.640
 - Not at all?

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:27.640
 - No, ma'am.

00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:29.640
 My mother doesn't feel she should fool around in the kitchen

00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:31.640
 in her new fur coat.

00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:33.640
 - Why doesn't she take it off?

00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:34.640
 - She doesn't dare.

00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:36.640
 As soon as my father gets his hands on,

00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:38.640
 he's taking it back to the store.

00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:39.640
 to the store.

00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:41.980
 (audience laughing)

00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:43.400
 What's that under your arm?

00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:46.560
 Oh gee, I almost forgot, it's my grand prize.

00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:48.000
 See?

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:49.760
 - Good heaven.

00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:52.360
 - Only my parents felt that since it was your sister

00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:53.880
 that painted it, Mrs. Aldrich,

00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:56.040
 you should have the privilege of hanging it.

00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:59.040
 - Harry, you painted that?

00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:01.240
 - It looks good upside down too.

00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:02.080
 (audience laughing)

00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:03.040
 - What on earth is it?

00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:05.720
 - Why it's fish there, in a bowl.

00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:08.680
 Sure, I love them up in the fish book.

00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:10.240
 I think they're suckers.

00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:11.680
 (audience laughing)

00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:12.680
 Yes?

00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:15.200
 Oh, ma, you brought it to the right place.

00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:16.520
 Alice, get me a hammer.

00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:17.760
 Sam, what are you gonna do to it?

00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:19.040
 Hang it over the mantelpiece.

00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:20.120
 She will.

00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:21.600
 Where it'll be a lesson to all of us,

00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:23.000
 the rest of our lives.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.580
 (upbeat music)

00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:32.200
 (audience applauding)

00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:38.080
 Boy, Henry, I got good news for us.

00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:38.960
 You have, huh?

00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:39.460
 Sure.

00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:41.400
 How'd you like to go to the movies to marry?

00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:44.840
 Now listen, Homer, you know we haven't got a nickel left to our name.

00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:46.920
 That's the beautiful part of it, him.

00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:50.520
 I've invited someone to go with us, who's agreed to absorb our overhead.

00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:51.680
 Well, G-Wiz.

00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:52.180
 Sure.

00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:52.880
 Who?

00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:54.360
 Agnes Lawson.

00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:57.040
 Well, that solves Henry's overhead problem.

00:26:57.040 --> 00:27:01.320
 And ladies, a good way for you to help solve yours when it comes to family budgets

00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:03.560
 is to serve jello puddings often.

00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:06.040
 They cost little and they taste grand.

00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:08.920
 Yes, yellow chocolate butter scots and vanilla puddings.

00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:10.360
 A trio of treats,

00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:13.560
 chock full of old fashioned homemade goodness.

00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:16.240
 Tomorrow night, try confetti tarts.

00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:19.480
 Just prepare a package of yellow vanilla pudding as usual.

00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:21.880
 When cool, pour your luscious creamy

00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:24.440
 yellow vanilla pudding into crisp individual

00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:26.040
 baked pastry shells.

00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:29.120
 Chill thoroughly, then top with a generous helping

00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:32.040
 of well-drained canned fruit cocktail.

00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:35.720
 Remember all three jello puddings made with milk are nourishing,

00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:39.280
 and they cooked a perfection in just about five minutes.

00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:42.600
 No wonder more people buy jello puddings

00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:45.600
 than any other prepared puddings in the world.

00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:48.180
 (upbeat music)

00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:54.520
 Friends, let's recognize this fact.

00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:58.160
 Our American economic system has brought greater material means

00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:00.080
 for happiness to more people

00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:05.080
 than any other the world has known, and it has preserved the basic freedoms.

00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:09.080
 So let's all of us strive to make that economic system even better,

00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:14.080
 as an employee or employer, as a farmer or as a professional man.

00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:18.080
 Remember, the better we produce, the better we live.

00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:28.080
 The Oldrich family starring Ezra Stone as Henry with Jackie Kalka's Homer

00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:33.200

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:38.720
 are house Jameson and Catherine Ron. And this is Dan Seymour in New York saying,

00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:42.920
 "The Aldrich family is brought to you by the Jello family."

00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:52.360
 "Four desserts that aren't delicious. I believe me you should know. They are made

00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:56.360
 by famous J-E-L-L-P-O.

00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:59.860

00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:08.400
 the Aldrich family.

00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:11.360
 This is NBC, the National Broadcasting Company.

00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:13.940
 (bells ringing)

00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:16.520

00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:19.100
