 In just a moment, enjoy the Aldrich family.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 But first, the Election Day is almost here.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 Studio 8H here is a place of feverish activity.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
 For NBC's combined radio and TV coverage

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 are the biggest political event in 20 years.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
 A staff of 250 men will relay the latest news.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 15 of the top commentators will analyze the results.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
 The network newsmen will have the Monrobot,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
 the electronic brain to compute important trends

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.200
 trends as ballots pour in from 48 states.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.180
 Yes, Tuesday, NBC will be the nation's headquarters

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.160
 for election returns.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.720
 Now it's the Aldrich family on NBC.

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.720
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:48.360
 Henry, Henry, all great.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.360
 Coming, mother.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:57.480
 Yes, it's the Aldrich family of franchise.

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:04.480
 written by typical

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:15.560
 even though everyone knows him because he lives in your house or next door

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.360
 or somewhere in your memories

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.040
 no one has yet been able to define the typical teenage american boy

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.240
 all you can say is that he exists in the person of henry all rich

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.740
 And when you say that, you cross your fingers.

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.340
 The scene is the Aldrich Hallway.

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.380
 The time is just before breakfast.

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:33.680
 Hello, Toby.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:34.880
 Toby, are you listening?

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.540
 Yes, Henry, but I'm thinking.

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.920
 Well, never mind thinking, Toby.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.320
 Didn't you say you'd pay me back?

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.720
 I'm going to, just as soon as I get some money.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.720
 But, Toby, I'm going to a party Saturday night.

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:44.920
 And if you don't pay me the 50 cents,

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.420
 I can't get the trousers I need.

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.080
 Henry, just a minute, Toby.

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.760
 What, Homer?

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.520
 Tell him if he doesn't pay you'll sue.

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.720
 Sure. Listen, Toby.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.160
 Henry, would it help you any if I loaned your pair of trousers?

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.700
 Oh, how would that help?

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.500
 I've ordered a brand new pair of slacks and I need that 50 cents before I can pay for them.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.400
 Well, suppose we made some kind of business arrangement.

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.900
 What business arrangement?

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.700
 Well, would it help you any if I paid you five cents every week on what I owe you?

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:08.500
 No.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.100
 Go on, Henry. Tell him you'll sue.

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.900
 Yeah, Toby, if I don't get that money, you can expect to be sued.

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.500
 Look, Henry. I'll call you back in just a few minutes.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:16.300
 You'd better.

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.700
 Okay, you wait right there by the phone. I'll see what I can do.

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:19.500
 Okay.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.000
 So long, Henry. Thanks for calling.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.100
 So long. What do you say, Henry?

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.500
 What's a nice thing, Homer? That's a nice thing.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.800
 Henry, did you know that when you're in a position like the one you're in, you can get a bill collector?

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.500
 You can? Sure.

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.200
 My father will give you the names of two or three you could get.

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.900
 - Henry! - Yes, Father?

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.400
 I just put a letter for you on the living room table.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.900
 Well, Gee, where's it from?

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:40.800
 I didn't notice.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.100
 Homer, come on into the living room.

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.900
 Why don't you get a collector and scare the daylights out of Toby?

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.100
 I'd certainly like to.

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.100
 Henry, your breakfast is getting cold.

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:49.500
 I'll be right there, Mother.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.900
 You asked for three eggs, you know.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 Yes, mother, I'm practically starved this morning.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
 Is your letter from a girl, Henry?

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 Oh, Gee whiz.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 Oh, who's it from, Henry?

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 Oh, Gee whiz.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000
 What does the letter say?

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000
 Oh, boy.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 Is it bad news, Henry?

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
 Will you please stop breathing on me?

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 But who's the letter from, Henry?

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000
 The public library.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
 Oh, the library.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000
 They want you to join?

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 Well, not exactly.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 I borrowed a book there, see?

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 Now, suddenly it's overdue.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
 But when did you take it out?

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.960
 last December they say. She was home. I think they made a mistake. I could almost

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:29.540
 wear it wasn't until last January. Are you sure? Sure I'm sure. I remember

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.020
 distinctly that in December I didn't feel like reading on a count of Christmas.

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:40.500
 Oh boy. And they charge two cents a day. January, February, March. Oh, we're up to

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.100
 November. It'll be more than five dollars. Five dollars. Just for one copy of

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.820
 Huckleberry Finn that I didn't even read. Well why didn't you return it after two

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:53.260
 weeks I told you I hadn't finished it that's what I get for trying to improve

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:59.500
 my mind five dollars how much do you have well just enough to pay for my slacks

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.340
 provided Toby pays what he owes me then forget about the book the thing for you

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.860
 to do Henry is to crack down on Toby what about the library book all the

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:12.820
 public library will ever do send you letters no one harm can that do you really

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:17.380
 think so home sure they can't afford to get too tough they don't want to lose you

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:22.020
 - Henry? - After all, they hardly ever go as far as they did with George Vigolo.

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:26.380
 - What did they do to George? - They called on his mother and father and went to see the principal.

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:30.980
 - Oh, boy. - Henry, I want you to come in here and eat your breakfast.

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:35.380
 Mother, I don't think I want any breakfast. - What's the matter?

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:39.380
 - I couldn't eat a thing. - [music playing]

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:47.380
 (music)

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.380
 What are you doing Henry?

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:50.380
 I'm just looking for something Mary.

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.380
 Oh my goodness you don't have to tear the bookshelves all apart do you?

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.380
 Don't worry I'll put everything back Mary.

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.380
 Has any phone call come for me this morning?

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:58.380
 Not that I know.

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:00.380
 It was not strange.

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:02.380
 Every time I've called Toby the line was busy.

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:04.380
 I thought you were just talking to him.

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.380
 It wasn't Toby, I was talking to the Senator Bill and Porium.

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:07.380
 What about?

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:10.620
 Well, I cancel the pair of trousers I happen to have ordered.

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.180
 Well, Mother says you should get ready for lunch right away.

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:14.180
 All right.

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.180
 Very, you know Miss Crawford.

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:17.180
 Miss Crawford?

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:18.180
 At the library.

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.780
 Oh, my goodness, Miss Crawford!

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:21.780
 She scares me.

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.180
 Henry, she has the most terrible temper.

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:25.180
 Is that right?

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:27.180
 Henry, you want it on the telephone?

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:29.180
 Well, gee, was it about time.

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:31.180
 Henry, don't let your lunch get cold!

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.180
 I want to tell that Toby a thing or two.

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:34.180
 Hello?

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:35.180
 Now listen, Toby.

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:37.180
 Is this Mr. Henry old, Rich?

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:37.680
 What's that?

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.880
 I'd like to speak to Mr. Henry Aldrich.

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:40.880
 This is I?

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.380
 This is the Centerville Emporium.

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:44.280
 Oh. Oh!

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:47.880
 I'm very sorry, but our manager says it's too late to cancel your trousers.

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:48.880
 What?

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.680
 But, but, Gee, whiz, I don't want them.

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:53.480
 I'm sorry, but those trousers have been altered to your measurements.

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:54.980
 But I can't use them.

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:56.580
 Another use has come up through my money.

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:57.380
 I see.

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:00.180
 And, and in this case, though, I'd warn them you still got them.

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:01.880
 We even got all your cut off the bottom.

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:04.380
 I see. Well, I'll tell our Mr. Sweeney.

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:05.980
 Well, thank you very much.

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:09.220
 and tell them that if I see anybody my size I'd be very glad to send them in.

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:09.980
 Thank you, Miss Drool.

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:11.380
 We're just finally related to it.

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:11.980
 Thank you.

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:12.480
 Good-bye.

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:13.980
 And ready?

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:14.980
 Yes, Mother?

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:18.480
 Henry, did I just hear you canceling your order for those new trousers?

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:19.480
 Yes, Mother.

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:20.780
 But why, dear?

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:24.280
 Well, boy, you know how it is with new trousers.

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:25.780
 I'm afraid I don't.

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:29.380
 Well, she was after a while you get tired of looking at them.

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:31.580
 And I'd wear them to the party Saturday night when it's over.

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:33.580
 What use would I have for them?

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:35.080
 You know what I mean, Mother?

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.580
 No, dear, but I'm sure you're being very sensible.

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:39.480
 Now, please run out and get ready for lunch.

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:41.980
 I have something I made just specially for you.

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:44.080
 Well, I've got to answer the phone first.

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:45.080
 Hello, Toby.

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.080
 Hello.

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:47.580
 Oh, Homer? Listen, Homer.

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:48.580
 This is Mr. Sweeney.

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:49.580
 Who?

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:51.580
 Mr. Sweeney from the Emporium.

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:52.580
 Oh.

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:55.080
 Did your girl tell you I explained everything?

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:56.080
 If she did.

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:58.580
 And we tried to treat our customers fairly.

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:01.580
 But, young man, do you understand what a business transaction is?

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:03.080
 I can't use the trousers.

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:04.080
 Neither can we.

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:05.080
 You can't?

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:08.080
 Well, look, do you know Huckleberry Finn?

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:12.080
 No, but we have a great many customers, and I can't be expected to know all of them.

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:17.080
 Well, see, I've been a very embarrassing position with those trousers.

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:19.080
 You'll be much more embarrassed without them.

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:24.080
 What I mean is they were altered especially for you.

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:26.080
 Will you please call for them?

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:28.080
 Didn't I make it clear? I can't use them.

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:29.080
 Why not?

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:33.080
 Well, I'm not very fond of light blue.

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:35.720
 Would you please ask your father to come to phone?

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:38.860
 My father your father well

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:42.480
 He isn't here right now, then may I speak to your mother?

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:45.700
 Well look come to think of it. I am fond of light blue

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:52.560
 I'll be down to get them and when can we expect to see you but tomorrow be too late? That'll be fine. Thank you, sir

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:55.160
 That's all right. Goodbye. Goodbye. I

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:59.200
 Think it was the Emporium

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:02.020
 Listen, Mary, could you loan me a few dollars?

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:04.080
 Provided I pay it back a little each week.

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:05.640
 What's the matter with your own money?

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:06.940
 It's all tied up.

00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:08.280
 You might sing in debts.

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:09.280
 I'm sorry, Henry.

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:12.880
 I just spent everything I had on a dress for the party, Saturday night.

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:14.920
 It's the most beautiful blue.

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:15.360
 Yeah?

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:17.680
 They call it Huckleberry Blue.

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:19.160
 Huckle?

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:19.820
 Huckle?

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:20.880
 Yes.

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:22.420
 Are you ready for lunch, children?

00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:23.920
 Right away, mother.

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:25.720
 How about you, Henry?

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:29.320
 Well, G-mother, I'm sorry, but I could need a thing.

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:39.320
 (music)

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:41.320
 Hello, is this Dr. Bennington?

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:42.320
 Yes, Mrs. Ulrich.

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:47.320
 I don't like to bother you, Dr. But Mr. Ulrich and I just a bit worried about Henry.

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:48.320
 Something wrong with him?

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:53.320
 Well, he's simply not himself. He hasn't eaten more than a bite in two days.

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:56.320
 That's pretty serious for Henry. Does he have a rash?

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:58.320
 No, I have noticed any.

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:02.320
 He just sits and mopes all day, and he's extremely nervous.

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:05.320
 Well, I'll phone the drugstore and have a tonic put up for him.

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:10.320
 For Dr. We've always had a great deal of trouble getting him to take any tonic. He fights it.

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:12.320
 Well, maybe the exercise will give him an appetite.

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:17.320
 You tell Henry that if he takes this, all of his troubles will be over.

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:19.320
 All right. Thank you for calling Mrs. Always.

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:20.320
 Thank you, Dr..

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:22.320
 Good day.

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:23.320
 Mother!

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:24.320
 Yes, Mary?

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:26.120
 Mary. Have you forgotten Dennis?

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:26.640
 Ready?

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:27.640
 Han coming.

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:28.740
 We went right ahead.

00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:29.400
 Mother.

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:30.240
 Yes, Henry.

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:31.760
 Wasn't told me that just called wasn't.

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:32.400
 And no, dear.

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:33.680
 It was a call I'd put in.

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:35.360
 Did you see Toby today, Henry?

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:35.920
 No, Father.

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:37.840
 I haven't been able to get in touch with him.

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:39.680
 Well, you're not the only one.

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:40.600
 What do you mean, Father?

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:43.000
 After trying to get his father on the phone all day,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.400
 I stopped in there on the way home tonight.

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:47.680
 We discovered that somebody had plugged the phone

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:49.760
 so that it only gave a busy signal.

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:50.760
 Is that right?

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:52.400
 Is that right?

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:57.680
 Henry, you must eat something. If you don't, you certainly aren't going to any party Saturday night.

00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:01.120
 Mother Eleanor Wentworth expects me. She invited me personally.

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:04.080
 Eleanor Wentworth? You're going over to the Wentworth Saturday?

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:05.440
 Yes, sir. That's where the party is.

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:08.080
 Alice, did you hear about Mr. Wentworth? Quite an honor.

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:09.120
 What about him, Sam?

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:12.160
 He was just elected chairman of the board at the public library.

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:14.480
 At the what was he?

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:19.120
 The Mr. Wentworth was?

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:19.440
 Yes.

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:21.580
 Mr. Wentworth.

00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:23.980
 He's chairman of the library.

00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:25.540
 Do you have any objection?

00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:26.540
 Me?

00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:27.740
 Well, gosh, no.

00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:31.380
 I was just surprised to hear that with all his other work.

00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:33.580
 Why would he want to be that?

00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:36.380
 I think he'll find some way to work it out.

00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:39.140
 Henry, turn around and let me look at you.

00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:40.420
 Something the matter with me?

00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:43.860
 Sam, don't you think we ought to have the doctor come over and see Henry?

00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:46.220
 If you think it'll amuse him.

00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:48.220
 Dear, I'm serious.

00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:52.220
 Now, mother, if there's one thing I don't want to see, it's a doctor.

00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:56.220
 Well, I certainly think we ought to drop into his office tomorrow.

00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:59.220
 Tomorrow? But I have a job that I'm beginning tomorrow.

00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:01.220
 With whom? With Mrs. Hoffman.

00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:04.220
 She was just a program alright. I'll eat some dessert for you.

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:06.220
 Mary, how about the dessert?

00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:07.220
 I'll bring it right in, Father.

00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:09.220
 Well, please hurry. I have a guest coming.

00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:10.220
 And Mary?

00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:11.220
 Yes, Mother.

00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:13.220
 I want you to give Henry an extra large portion.

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:15.220
 Sure. What do we have in?

00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:17.220
 -Huckleberries. -Huckleberries.

00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:20.220
 I... good ol' huckleberries.

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:22.220
 -Huckle? -Huckle?

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:26.220
 That reminds me, Henry, if you ever read "Huckleberry Finn"?

00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:29.220
 -Whoa! -If you haven't, you ought to get it out of the library sometime.

00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:31.220
 -Yes, sir. -Dear, weren't you reading it last winter?

00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:34.220
 -Well, I was, Mother, but I... -Well, you're very, Henry.

00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:37.220
 -Thank you, Mary. -Who's coming over tonight, Father?

00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:39.220
 -Mr. Wentworth. -Mr. Wentworth?

00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:41.220
 -[coughing]

00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:44.220
 -And my, what's the matter with you? -He's choking on his huckleberry!

00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:46.220
 Mary, come on the back.

00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:54.220
 I'm glad you dropped in, Mr. Wentworth.

00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:56.220
 Sorry I can't stay any longer.

00:11:56.220 --> 00:12:00.220
 You can count on Mrs. Aldrich and me to do everything we can for the library.

00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:02.220
 It's very good of you, Mr. Aldrich.

00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:07.220
 Incidentally, if you want to raise more funds, why not get some of the young people interested?

00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:08.220
 You think they'd help?

00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:11.220
 Well, of course. Let's get Henry down here. He's usually pretty good at all.

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:14.760
 well of course let's get henry down here is usually pretty good at organizing

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:17.320
 things

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:21.320
 or and we

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:22.640
 was here right after dinner

00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:25.740
 well as i'm dropping my office on the i'd like to have a talk with them i'd

00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:27.200
 have to do that

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:28.440
 where you dropped in

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:31.560
 incidentally i don't know if you think it's a great deal of henry well you know

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:33.680
 how henry feels about elana

00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:36.960
 he's looking forward to coming over to her party saturday night

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:38.960
 good night mister wednesday

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:42.200
 Sam, did Henry say anything to you about going out?

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:43.200
 Not to me.

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:44.960
 Well, dear, I'm really worried.

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:46.960
 Oh, no, Alice.

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:49.200
 Henry's a reasonably normal, healthy boy.

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:50.960
 There's nothing to worry about.

00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:51.960
 Father--

00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:52.960
 Henry, is that you?

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:54.840
 What are you doing?

00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:56.240
 I'm talking to your mother.

00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:59.280
 You're talking to anybody else besides, mother?

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:00.240
 No.

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:01.960
 You just missed Mr. Wentworth.

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:02.960
 Oh.

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:04.800
 Well, I'm certainly sorry to hear that.

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:06.680
 Henry, where have you been?

00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:11.680
 Well, just out in the garage, I just thought I'd go out and see whether the car needed washing.

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:13.680
 At this time of night?

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:16.680
 Gosh, if everybody knows the best time to wash your cars when the sun's down,

00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:20.680
 uh, m- Mr. Wentworth isn't coming back, is he?

00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:21.680
 No, dear.

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:26.680
 No, that reminds me, Mr. Wentworth said if you have time tomorrow, he'd like you to drop into his office.

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:27.680
 He wants to have a talk with you.

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:28.680
 With I?

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:29.680
 What for?

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:31.680
 It's regarding a matter pertaining to the library.

00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:32.680
 It is?

00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:35.680
 Some money they're trying to collect.

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:39.680
 You know father, you think I'll be going to bed.

00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:42.680
 Henry, it's nowhere near your bedtime.

00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:45.680
 I know, but I think mother's right.

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:47.680
 Maybe I am coming down with something.

00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:58.680
 Yeah? Someone at the door?

00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:01.680
 It's Henry orders Mrs. Hoffman. I'm reporting for work.

00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:02.680
 Oh.

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:04.160
 Oh, I'm sorry.

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:07.560
 Dear, I'm afraid it's too wet for you to rake the leaves this morning.

00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:08.720
 She was Mrs. Hoffman.

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:10.320
 I need her and some money.

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:14.040
 Well, I have several errands you might run for me.

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:15.480
 Come in while I answer the phone.

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:16.000
 Yes, ma'am.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.560
 I'd be glad to do anything.

00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:19.560
 [KNOCKING]

00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:21.280
 Hello?

00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:22.000
 Oh, not at all.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
 I'll be very glad to call you.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:25.440
 Henry?

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:26.280
 Yes, Mrs. Hoffman?

00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:27.480
 No, Mother wants to speak to you.

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:28.880
 She says it's quite important.

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:29.880
 Oh.

00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:30.800
 Hello, Mother.

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:33.900
 Henry, can you be through with Mrs. Hoffman's by three o'clock?

00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:34.500
 Why?

00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:37.200
 I made an appointment for you to see Dr. Bennington.

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:39.100
 Dr. Bennington, mother Dr. Bennington?

00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:39.700
 Yes, dear.

00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:41.700
 He's to give you a thorough going over.

00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:44.000
 But mother, I might be busy here all day.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.600
 I haven't got time to be gone over.

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:47.100
 You'll be through by noon, Henry.

00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:48.100
 You what, Mrs. Hoffman?

00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:49.800
 And remember near three o'clock.

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:50.500
 Do you hear me?

00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:51.200
 Yes, mother.

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:52.900
 Good-bye.

00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:54.900
 Now, here's what I want you to do first, Henry.

00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:55.600
 Yes, ma'am.

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:57.200
 This book goes back to the library.

00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:59.300
 Yes, Mrs.

00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:00.300
 For the library?

00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:04.860
 Goodness, look at this. My, my, my. It's two days overdue.

00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:07.800
 Well, I don't know what Miss Spawfrigle think of me.

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:08.600
 Two days?

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:11.100
 Well, you just have to apologize for me.

00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:14.700
 I understand that since Mr. Wetmirth has been made chairman of the board,

00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:17.500
 there's sort of a campaign about overdrawn books.

00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:18.300
 They are?

00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:22.500
 After all, you can't blame them. Some people keep a book out for as much as a month.

00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:25.500
 Look, Mrs. Hoffman, my son's coming out.

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:29.300
 Couldn't I do something else for you instead of going down to the library?

00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:31.300
 I'd much rather you write down to the library.

00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:36.300
 And please tell Miss Spoppard that if she has a copy of a book called "Climb and Punishment"

00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:38.300
 I'd love to read it.

00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:41.300
 "Climb and Punishment"?

00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:42.300
 Yes, and hurry, won't you?

00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:43.300
 Yes ma'am.

00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:47.300
 But are you sure you don't want me to do something constructive instead?

00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:58.300
 We'll return to the Aldrich family in just a moment.

00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:05.300
 But right now I'd like to give you some inside information on the NBC shows to be heard over most of these same stations later this evening.

00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:14.400
 First off, we're all going to go over to the Harris-Fayhouse Hall to visit with that suave sophisticated Phil Harris and his long-suffering wife Alice.

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:23.000
 And then we go from the laughable to the supernatural for a theater guild on the air, which brings you John Patrick's comedy, "Low and Behold."

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.800
 Your stars this week will be Anne Blithe, Basil Rathbone, and Jeffrey Lin.

00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:34.800
 With the elections coming up, NBC's coverage makes it the nation's headquarters for election news.

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:39.800
 As a regular Sunday feature, you can listen in on America's only public press conference.

00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:42.800
 When Martha Roundtree and Lawrence Bivax meet the press,

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:47.800
 offers you a chance to hear the answers given by one of the personalities in the news,

00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:52.800
 to questions posed by a panel of newsmen and prominent public citizens.

00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:56.800
 There is a whole world of radio entertainment that's yours for the dialing

00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:59.880
 tuned to this NBC station later tonight.

00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:01.880
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:10.320
 Now getting back to the troubles of Henry Olga.

00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:12.440
 Henry has just been notified that he's

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:15.280
 neglected to return a library book which he drew out

00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:19.080
 last December, which he is now unable to find.

00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:21.320
 Hoping to earn enough to pay part of the find,

00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:24.640
 he takes a job with Mrs. Hoffman, whose first request

00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:28.440
 is that Henry return a book of her own to the library.

00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:30.720
 The scene opens into Haven's drugstore.

00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:32.800
 The time is a half hour later.

00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:34.600
 Homer, won't you please help me out?

00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:36.520
 Won't you please do it for me?

00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:38.160
 But Henry, I'm busy.

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:40.680
 I've got some pretty important things to take care of.

00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:41.240
 Like what?

00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:42.360
 Like what?

00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:44.040
 Well, I've got a date with Willie Marshall

00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:47.280
 to watch that new building they're putting up a third main.

00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:50.520
 Boy, Homer, and you call yourself a friend.

00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:52.560
 Have you ever in your whole life asked me to do anything

00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:53.960
 and I turned you down?

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:55.460
 Sure, last week.

00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:57.460
 You wouldn't lend me your binoculars.

00:17:57.460 --> 00:17:57.960
 Well, she would.

00:17:57.960 --> 00:18:00.360
 You don't have to remember every little thing.

00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:01.800
 I thought we were friends.

00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:03.760
 We are friends, Henry.

00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:04.960
 Well, if you can't do a simple little thing,

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:06.560
 like going to the library and returning a book

00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:07.560
 and maybe getting another.

00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:09.240
 All right, I'll do it.

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:10.960
 Homer, you'll never regret it.

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:11.760
 Where will I meet you?

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:12.660
 Right here in the drugstore.

00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:14.060
 Buy this telephone booth.

00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:16.160
 I'll be calling Eleanor while I'm waiting for you.

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:17.860
 Why are you calling Eleanor?

00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:19.860
 I'm taking you to the movies tonight.

00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:21.160
 I think it'd be better if I met her someplace

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:22.560
 besides your house.

00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:28.060
 Oh, here Homer, all you have to do is give this book to Miss Crawford and apologize for Mrs. Hoffman's keeping it over two days.

00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:31.160
 Should I tell you'll bring in Huckleberry Fenn as soon as you find it?

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:37.760
 No, Homer! Don't worry about that. Just give it this and ask her for... for what?

00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:41.560
 Well, I think the name of it is... "Crying Doesn't Pay."

00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:54.940
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:57.400
 Did you like the movie, Henry?

00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:59.400
 Well, I didn't care for it so much, Eleanor.

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:00.720
 Oh, I did.

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:02.960
 I thought it was beautiful.

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:06.320
 The way as long as he lived his conscience bothered him.

00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:07.240
 Did you like that part?

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:09.840
 And all he'd stole when he was a boy was an ordinary bottle

00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:11.120
 of milk.

00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:13.080
 Why, but didn't he suffer though?

00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:16.280
 Well, I guess the suffering was pretty evenly divided.

00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:19.080
 Now, would you mind walking up this street toward Homer's house?

00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:20.000
 What for?

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.360
 Well, I waited at the Haven's drugstore for nearly three hours a day,

00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:23.600
 and he never did show up.

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:27.240
 Now, I bet you wouldn't do a thing like that to a person.

00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:27.960
 Who me?

00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:30.800
 That's the first impression a person gets of you.

00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:34.120
 But you're dependable, and reliable.

00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:36.200
 Oh, gee, I don't--

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:38.560
 Well, you take a person that--

00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:39.360
 Whoa.

00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:40.640
 What, Henry?

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:46.280
 What I was going to say is you take sometimes, don't I guess a person can't help it?

00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:47.840
 Hell what?

00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:48.840
 Anything.

00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:51.920
 You're awfully understanding of others, Henry.

00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:54.040
 Well, I do study people a lot.

00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:55.440
 They kind of read their character.

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:57.520
 And that's what I like about you, Henry.

00:19:57.520 --> 00:19:59.080
 You're so intelligent.

00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:01.240
 I'll bet you do a lot of reading.

00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:03.160
 Well, I like some books.

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:05.920
 I'll bet you, probably go up and collect books.

00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:07.160
 I'll get over it.

00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:08.160
 I mean...

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:09.160
 [audience laughter]

00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:12.040
 Oh boy, who's that coming down the street?

00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:12.860
 Where?

00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:14.360
 Right under the street lamp.

00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:16.120
 Oh, it's Mrs. Foster.

00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:17.120
 Miss Crawford from the library.

00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:18.120
 Is Crawford?

00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:19.120
 Do you know her?

00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:20.120
 Only what you might call professionally.

00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:22.120
 Look, Eleanor, I'm still going to Homer's.

00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:23.120
 Why don't we go down this way?

00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:24.120
 By Johnson's Candy Kitchen.

00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:25.120
 Did you want to stop him?

00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:26.680
 Well, I think it might be a good idea.

00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:28.240
 Let's walk real fast.

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:29.240
 Oh my goodness.

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:31.600
 Look who's right ahead of them.

00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:32.600
 Who is this?

00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:33.600
 Isn't that Mrs. Hoffman?

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:34.600
 Mrs. Hoffman.

00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:35.600
 Oh boy.

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:39.120
 Look, Eleanor, why don't we go across the street to Tillman's hamburger?

00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:40.120
 It's a lot better.

00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:41.120
 All right.

00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:42.120
 Oh, let's hurry.

00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:43.120
 Why?

00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:44.120
 Father's right over there.

00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:45.120
 We can walk with him.

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:46.120
 He is.

00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:47.120
 Henry.

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:48.120
 Henry?

00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:49.120
 Why, Henry?

00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:50.120
 Why, Henry?

00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:51.120
 Why, Henry?

00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:53.120
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:20:53.120 --> 00:21:07.120
 What did he say, Alice?

00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:09.680
 the doctors doesn't seem to know what the trouble is.

00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:10.180
 No.

00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:12.220
 There wasn't anything wrong with his eyes

00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:14.920
 and the dentist x-rayed every tooth in his head.

00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:16.720
 Well, that should put your mind at ease.

00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:18.460
 No, dear, it doesn't.

00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:21.660
 Dr. Bennington says sometimes something very mysterious

00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:23.260
 can happen to a boy.

00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:26.660
 And no matter how hard they try, they can't find what's wrong.

00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:29.540
 He simply goes into a complete decline.

00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:30.900
 And when a thing like that happens,

00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:33.900
 Sammy says there's only one safe thing to do.

00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:34.540
 What's that?

00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:36.940
 Take a trip to Arizona.

00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:38.940
 All right, I'll take it.

00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:39.940
 No!

00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:40.940
 Hey, Brie!

00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:49.940
 Henry, what's in the bar?

00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:52.940
 Just a pair of trousers, Mary. See?

00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:53.940
 Oh, they look all thing nice.

00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:56.940
 We implore you, Maithem. It's still to order, you might say.

00:21:56.940 --> 00:21:58.940
 You better hurry if you're going to the party.

00:21:58.940 --> 00:21:59.940
 I'm not going.

00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:00.940
 Why not?

00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:01.940
 Because I'm not.

00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:04.940
 Do you think I'd be wearing my new trousers if I were going?

00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:06.940
 Well Henry, you don't have to jump at me.

00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:08.940
 Jump at you? When did I jump at you?

00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:10.940
 That's what mother and father were talking about.

00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:12.940
 They said you've turned so cross, they don't know you.

00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:16.940
 Listen, Mary, I'm in one of the most terrible predicaments I've ever been in in my life.

00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:19.940
 You know where I can lay my hands at a copy of Huckleberry Finn?

00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:21.940
 Sure. You do? That's wonderful. Where?

00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:23.940
 At the public library.

00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:25.940
 She and Wiz, Mary.

00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:26.940
 Henry!

00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:27.940
 Yes, Mother?

00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:29.940
 Have you taken your atomic since dinner?

00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:32.940
 Well, she was. I've taken it five times today.

00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:36.540
 That doesn't make any difference. You're supposed to take it as to dinner too.

00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:41.020
 All right. Listen, Mary. I had a letter from the library today, see?

00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:42.020
 Another.

00:22:42.020 --> 00:22:43.740
 Don't you know I had any?

00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:45.740
 I keep my eyes open.

00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:51.380
 Well, Mary, all Miss Crawford says in this letter is that if I pay the library the price of a new copy of Huckleberry Finn,

00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:52.900
 they'll forget the rest that's due.

00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:56.140
 Well, I'm sorry. I can't lend you anything, Henry.

00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:56.740
 Henry?

00:22:56.740 --> 00:22:57.580
 Yes, mother.

00:22:57.580 --> 00:22:58.740
 Homer's down here.

00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:00.100
 He is? Homer's here?

00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:00.860
 Sure.

00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:03.740
 - Well, Gee whiz, Homer, where you been for the last two days?

00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:05.300
 - I was delayed, Henry.

00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:06.700
 (audience laughs)

00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:07.940
 Delayed by what?

00:23:07.940 --> 00:23:09.380
 - Well, first it was the bulldozers,

00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:11.100
 then it was the steam shovel.

00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:13.060
 But don't worry, I got Mrs. Hoffman's book

00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:15.220
 to the library the first thing this morning.

00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:16.780
 - Boy, it's about time.

00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:17.820
 - Well, hurry up.

00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:18.820
 Aren't you going to the party?

00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:20.020
 - No, I'm not.

00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:20.860
 - Why not?

00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:22.420
 - Because of Mr. Wentworth.

00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:24.580
 - Well, Mr. Wentworth isn't gonna be there.

00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:25.420
 - He isn't?

00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:28.020
 - I think somebody said he's gonna be out of town.

00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:30.100
 - But you're not sure he's going to be.

00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:31.600
 I'm partly sure.

00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:34.000
 Well, come on Homer, come on.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:35.960
 Aren't you gonna put on your new pants?

00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:37.840
 Well, I'll bring the box along with me.

00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:38.680
 What?

00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:40.000
 Homer, there's no sense of putting them on

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:40.920
 and giving them wear and tear

00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:43.680
 unless I'm absolutely sure I'm going to the party.

00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:46.100
 (jazz music)

00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:57.280
 - Henry, what are you doing out here on the floor?

00:23:57.280 --> 00:23:58.160
 - Hello Eleanor.

00:23:58.160 --> 00:23:59.000
 - Hello Homer.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:23:59.840
 - Hi.

00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:02.840
 Oh no, we won't be disturbing your father, will we?

00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:04.840
 Oh no, he isn't even in town.

00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:05.840
 He isn't?

00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:06.840
 What are you doing? That's too bad.

00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:08.840
 Did I tell you Henry? Let's go in.

00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:09.840
 Come on Henry!

00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:10.840
 Okay.

00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:12.840
 There isn't anyone here but I'll tell you.

00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:14.840
 And a few others and this is Crawford.

00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:15.840
 Miss Crawford?

00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:16.840
 Yes, you know her, don't you?

00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:17.840
 Oh yes, yes.

00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:19.840
 Sure, Miss Crawford from the library.

00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:21.840
 Oh no, I just happened to remember.

00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:22.840
 What?

00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:23.840
 Well, my mother's home, all alone.

00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:24.840
 She is Henry.

00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:26.840
 Oh, why don't you ask her to come over?

00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:28.840
 No, I think I better go home.

00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:31.840
 Oh, Henry, you can certainly come in for just a while.

00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:34.840
 Would you like to go on, but when my mother's alone, she likes to have me with her.

00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:36.840
 Oh, just a day for one game.

00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:38.840
 In just a minute, we're going to play a literary game.

00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:39.840
 A literary game?

00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:40.840
 A literary game?

00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:41.840
 Yes!

00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:44.840
 I just happen to think my mother's alone, too.

00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:46.840
 Oh, but it may be a thing in the world.

00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:49.840
 Miss Bofford asks the questions, and you answer.

00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:50.840
 And they're a prize?

00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:52.840
 Well, I just couldn't enjoy winning a prize.

00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:54.840
 And now is my mother home alone.

00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:55.840
 Please, Henry.

00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:56.840
 No!

00:24:56.840 --> 00:24:57.840
 Henry!

00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:00.540
 Henry, I'm not gonna let you go.

00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:02.340
 You're coming in if I have to pull you in.

00:25:02.340 --> 00:25:03.340
 Please, Elle Dore.

00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:04.540
 Hey, Henry, let go of me.

00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:06.540
 If I'm going in, you are too.

00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:20.540
 Quiet, everybody, please.

00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:22.240
 Shh, quiet!

00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:25.340
 Miss Boffin is almost ready for the final part of the game.

00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:26.840
 Shh.

00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:32.380
 The last three remaining in the literary contest are let me see who our name is father

00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:40.040
 Dad go be Smith. Oh, be Smith. Oh my bra. Oh my bra. Now. Let me see who was the third who's not Henry. Oh, yes

00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:41.760
 Henry Orridge

00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:43.280
 now

00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:50.900
 Three of you boys will stand in the middle of the room facing me. Yes ma'am. Yes ma'am. Yes ma'am in each of these packages is a prize

00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:53.840
 Yes ma'am. Yes ma'am. Yes, ma'am. This bar for anyone take my place

00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:58.000
 I'm very sorry Henry, but you will have to take your own turn in answering.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:25:59.360
 No, then Toby.

00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:03.280
 In order to win, Watson, this box I hold, you will have to answer a question.

00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:04.280
 Yes, ma'am.

00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:09.640
 Now tell me, what character in literature said to be or not to be?

00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:11.080
 To be or not to be?

00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:12.080
 Yes.

00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:14.080
 Is that the end of a sentence?

00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:16.080
 That's the end of the question.

00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:18.080
 Who said it?

00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:19.080
 Shakespeare?

00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:21.080
 Well, that's close enough.

00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:25.080
 Here's a box of... why, I believe it's six linen hankage.

00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:26.680
 Well, thank you very much.

00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:28.680
 They're exactly what I've always wanted.

00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:30.080
 [audience laughing]

00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:31.580
 Now then, Homer.

00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:37.080
 Homer, can you tell me who was the leading female character in Ivanhoe?

00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:39.580
 - In Ivanhoe? - Yes.

00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:44.080
 - She has to be female? - I'm afraid not.

00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:46.580
 [audience laughing]

00:26:46.580 --> 00:26:48.580
 In Ivanhoe.

00:26:48.580 --> 00:26:50.580
 Rebecca? - That's right.

00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:55.580
 What? And here is a lovely color box for you.

00:26:55.580 --> 00:26:58.580
 Look so cute. Now then Henry.

00:26:58.580 --> 00:26:59.580
 Oh, Gee whiz.

00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:04.580
 I want you to tell me the name of the author of the book in this last package.

00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:08.580
 Yes, Miss Boffrey. It is Huckleberry Finn.

00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:10.580
 Huckleberry.

00:27:10.580 --> 00:27:12.580
 Henry!

00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:13.580
 She was Miss Boffrey.

00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:14.580
 She's very big.

00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:15.580
 Great somebody. Get something cold.

00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:17.580
 You rub some ice cream on her.

00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:18.580
 Oh, I've been faffing here.

00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:22.580
 He went to the book. Just as he went down his last words were marked away.

00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:27.580
 Mrs. Barford, why don't you just keep the book? I've got a feeling you're going to get it back anyway.

00:27:27.580 --> 00:27:40.580
 All Americans have always stood behind our fighting forces through all the years of our country's history.

00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:45.580
 Today the need is for blood donations for members of our armed forces in Korea.

00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:52.580
 Today, with the reserve of blood plasma virtually exhausted by GI requirements, an emergency exists.

00:27:52.580 --> 00:27:57.280
 The Department of Defense is therefore calling for an immediate stepping up of blood collections.

00:27:57.280 --> 00:28:01.780
 This is your opportunity to help save the lives of our fighting men in Korea.

00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:06.380
 Call your Red Cross chapter, a local blood donor center, for an appointment.

00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:19.820
 [Music]

00:28:19.820 --> 00:28:23.780

 Listen again next week, same time, same station, for another sparkling half hour with the Aldrich family.

00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:51.980
 Good night, everybody.

00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:55.140
