00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
 Thank you.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 Help me, always.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 Come here, Evan.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:26.000
 That is the headless family.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
 That's the headless family.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 That's the headless family.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
 That's the headless family.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
 That's the headless family.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 And now, for the older family.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:00:38.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 [Music]

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 The trouble of the semelordic consider is this doesn't think one fellow is still girls with sort of a club.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 If you guys come down to my little house and you know what this is, how could you get another fellow to your little house?

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 Well, how about this?

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
 Oh, you mentioned that guy, he's your best friend.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 Oh, Homer.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 That's it, what's he like?

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 Oh, uh, these are 12 kids.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.000
 You good, little kid?

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
 I'm 12 kids.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
 They're all trouble with these people over to have a city with his family to visit his uncle Oscar.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 Oh, that's extraordinary.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
 Well, what about your mother's born?

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 That's good, your mother's born.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 Excuse me, a second, mother's. I think she's in the kitchen problem.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 Thank you.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 Father's, I'll tell you what. You were hanging out with the lucky phone around with some of the guys right now.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 Oh, yes.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 I thought these were down town.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 I'm about to, but first, do you have enough clothes for me, again?

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 What?

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 You?

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 Oh, yes.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:23.000
 Now are you doing it? Gotcha. How's he? Oh, cool. What are you? Money. Have you got the mention of money and clothes? Tell me what's gotten in here. I don't think I'm going to come to town. I've been happy with the best client I've got. I just want to be honest. I'm going to have any. I should be screaming here for me. Why would I be there? I open myself up. That's why I don't have any. I don't want you to hold me down there.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 I thought you were going to visit your uncle after.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
 That's why I was talking.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
 You like to save my life.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
 I better talk to my mother together.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
 No, I get to have to tell.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000
 There you go.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
 Me bring an operator somebody in this town that's being offered.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
 Hey, where are you with?

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
 Is that a moment?

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 That's a moment.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 I thought you were going to visit your uncle after.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
 That's why I was talking.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 You like to save my life.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
 So, can you tell her who's got something very urgent to do today?

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 You mean you don't want to go to your uncle or uncle?

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 Well, certainly my uncle. It's my cousin, Hipsabaw.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
 Every time I go over there, she makes a million wrestling.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
 I send half my time on the floor.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
 You're doing it, old pal.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
 Well, I'm hoping you're all wild. I'd be tickled to.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
 And as a matter of fact, we have got something very urgent to do.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
 We have a lot.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 Well, how would you like to go on a well-daked protection now?

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:35.000
 I guess I didn't have a chance to tell you about this. Well, girl, I met the other night. The name is Bubbles. Bubbles? What kind of a name is Rob? What's Roblin? Nothing. Your package is self-placed.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:44.000
 Well, it happens to bigger personality, exactly. Anyway, I've got to date with her for the second now. And I'm a little isolated.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 Well, she has a sister thing.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
 Now wait a minute.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 You hold on.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000
 I'm going to just let her out with anybody's sister and that's all.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
 I'll tell her everybody is somebody's sister.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 I'm not.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
 Wait a minute.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
 You like to see a picture of her?

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.000
 Okay.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
 It was taken up a camp hocal as Johnny.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
 It's their whole camp.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000
 Now look here.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
 Oh, you're so old.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
 Oh my, you're looking at the lifeguard.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.260
 (laughing)

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.200
 Look, look, look, look, will you hear

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.340
 right under the "oh" when Poco was shot?

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:22.680
 Uh huh.

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:23.520
 Good.

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.420
 Sometimes call it a sense of humor.

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:26.260
 What do you mean?

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.120
 Let's see right around and get him under the "ee" too.

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.360
 (laughing)

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.120
 No, no, that's your sister.

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.960
 No, it's the same girl.

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.200
 Oh, can I mention that?

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:36.520
 I'm answering her all.

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.840
 Well, hold you there, sister, or a twin.

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.160
 Oh.

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:41.240
 She's five lines.

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:42.080
 Yeah.

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.920
 What do you say?

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:44.680
 So let me ask you how to touch your gun.

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.840
 This is mine right here.

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.200
 It's cool.

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:49.880
 Have you got a night and a time ago?

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:50.720
 Oh boy.

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.640
 Come on, I called a chicken or coke.

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:54.800
 Too many times to take chances.

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.280
 (audience laughs)

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:57.120
 Yes, Bobbie.

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.600
 You'll love your little one, please.

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.640
 I'm home, but you just keep looking at that picture.

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:01.680
 Okay, but you'll say,

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.400
 "That's cool, make it a little bit of a film."

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:04.840
 Let's see him there.

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:06.160
 Yes, Bobbie.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.880
 Better do you have your little arm.

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.680
 Sure, Bobbie, do you need some clag?

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.160
 (audience laughs)

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:16.160
 I just want to be sure that you have no reason for trying to get in touch with me.

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.160
 What are your plans?

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:22.160
 Well, if I can get a moment, a listen to reason, we've got a date to go walking down town with a couple of girls.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:28.160
 On a nice day like this, well, how are you? I'd have the girls, I'd be like, "Oh, they're not into the country."

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:33.160
 Well, definitely. And she holds a dollar for a couple of years, so that's expensive.

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.160
 Well, team, team, thanks, Father.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.160
 This is a kind of reason in how my understand.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.160
 Oh, and guess what I've got?

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:44.160
 Well, now I think you'll think things differently.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.160
 You're trying to make me try and go?

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:49.160
 That would very nice of you.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:50.160
 Uh-huh.

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.160
 Oh, well, I'd like to see the boy.

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.160
 You cannot be the owner.

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:56.160
 You know what I mean?

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:57.160
 Oh, of course.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.160
 And if you buy the plug,

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:00.160
 then you can't bother me.

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.160
 I'll breathe in your pool.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:07.160
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:12.960
 Is this your bye time friend here?

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:14.560
 Well, I'll tell you a little bit.

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:17.640
 Why don't I go up by myself, Bertie?

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:19.280
 Sort of place the ground.

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:20.440
 What do you mean?

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:22.560
 Well, don't you think it's better if we

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:25.320
 stem the sister adjusted to the IBM?

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:27.880
 The IBM law of you?

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:30.080
 Oh, just wait a minute.

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:33.080
 I think I should film my girls now, I think.

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:38.080
 You think you're high, well you're gonna put yourself together.

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:41.080
 Well, be with my dog!

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:42.080
 There he is.

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:43.080
 What's wrong?

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:45.080
 That one is trying to shoot.

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:48.080
 I mean, the first impression is that you don't mean a thing.

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:49.080
 You know what I'm asking for?

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:51.080
 We need about the most generous person I know.

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:55.080
 And, Angela, you said your sister was pretty desperate to make some noise.

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:57.080
 You're not so desperate.

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:01.080
 Well, you made out here while I was a little careful, Bubbles.

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:05.080
 You were not Bubbles? No, I'm too.

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:09.080
 But it's just me, the Bubbles, wait. I mean, I'm too. You got the help.

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:11.080
 Oh, boy.

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:14.080
 Hey, what's going on in your?

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:16.080
 You're in.

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:17.080
 You're in.

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:18.080
 You're in.

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:19.080
 What did you tell about me?

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:21.080
 Why, um, nothing.

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:22.080
 You are?

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:24.080
 I was actually sorry, huh?

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:27.080
 [inaudible]

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:29.080
 Oh, my God, I'm going to do that.

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:32.080
 Oh, my God, I'm going to do that.

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:34.080
 Oh, my God, I'm going to do that.

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:36.080
 Oh, my God, I'm going to do that.

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:38.080
 Oh, my God, I'm going to do that.

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:40.080
 Oh, my God, I'm going to do that.

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:42.080
 Oh, my God, I'm going to do that.

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:44.080
 Oh, my God, I'm going to do that.

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:46.080
 Oh, my God, I'm going to do that.

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:48.080
 Oh, my God, I'm going to do that.

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:50.080
 Oh, my God, I'm going to do that.

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:52.080
 Oh, my God, I'm going to do that.

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:53.080
 Not yet.

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:55.080
 What do you think of them, Bobo?

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:57.080
 I'm always going to do this at that time.

00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:59.080
 So you're going to do anything I want.

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:00.080
 Get straight to it.

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:02.080
 How about us getting your bites out now, Bobo?

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:04.080
 Okay, then you can add.

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:06.080
 So do what you want.

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:08.080
 What I'm going to do is you're going to go,

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:10.080
 I think I'll go and get over to you.

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:11.080
 You can do it too.

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:12.080
 You can do it too.

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:13.080
 Yes, in many ways.

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:15.080
 You look like my dumbest friend.

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:16.080
 In what way?

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:17.080
 What?

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:19.080
 You're going to have to do it at an imagination.

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:21.080
 Now just to say, if mommy is a little age,

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:26.080
 You know, you have no way to look at your ears.

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:29.080
 I thought you were going to throw the things out then

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:32.080
 so you have to make one little talk about your ears.

 Oh, yes, it's a bomb.

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:40.240
 Okay.

00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:42.240
 Follow me.

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:43.240
 What's the trouble?

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:45.240
 What a little bit of a zombie.

00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:47.240
 She's very nice.

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:48.240
 Very nice.

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:52.240
 Well, of course, when it comes to look,

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:54.240
 there isn't much to do between them.

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:58.240
 But those are those little bitches of technology?

00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:01.240
 Oh, no, I think she has a nice one.

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:05.240
 Although there is no way she could improve it.

00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:07.240
 I'm sure you're not going to be able to do that.

 You don't have to follow me, Homer.

 He was a devil.

00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:39.240
 He wouldn't know he better than to touch you, Mr. Deere.

00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:42.240
 Oh boy, but don't you remember the whole thing was not out here.

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:43.240
 Oh, it's not!

00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:45.240
 Sure you see, I just want to give Homer a break.

00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:47.240
 You mean a break to me, is that it?

00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:49.240
 No, from Francine.

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:50.240
 I'm Francine.

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:54.240
 Don't you think you'll get to the party, Bobo?

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:56.240
 You mean you can't tell yourself the party?

00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:59.240
 No, I mean...

00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:01.240
 But no, you couldn't be because...

00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:08.240
 Well don't you remember you were sitting here asking me all about your... I mean... Oh, oh.

 [audience laughter]

00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:12.740
 If you remember, it's a long work I asked to do.

00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:15.240
 So if you've had any idea that you weren't friends,

00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:18.240
 then we all get to try and tell them to tell them to double it.

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:19.240
 And you know, let me talk about that.

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:21.240
 Your family is not telling a cow!

 Well, anyway, I'm glad you're cold.

00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:45.240
 I'm over five, bang.

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:49.240
 No, just sitting here going over the steam catalog.

00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:51.240
 Oh, he's not good enough, bang.

00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:54.240
 Although, so, while there's really nothing going,

00:18:54.240 --> 00:19:02.240
 Yeah. Oh, 105. And of course I don't need to say it. You didn't get a bit of milk or that lot.

 Oh, no. Oh, no.

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:07.240
 Hi, did you see what's up to go on? Oh, no, no.

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:10.240
 You just said to read a good sentence, Lord.

00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:12.240
 No, I mean, someone wants to go on.

00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:14.240
 Don't do a whole thing, Lord.

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:15.240
 Yeah.

 You can't be not a little person, but I'm sure it is.

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:20.240
