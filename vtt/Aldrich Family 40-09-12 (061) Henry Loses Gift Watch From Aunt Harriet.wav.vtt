00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.160
 The Aldrich family based on characters originated by Clifford Goldsmith and starring Ezra Stone

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.760
 as Henry with Jackie Kalk as Homer.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.360
 Henry! Henry Aldrich!

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.360
 Coming, mother!

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:44.360
 [Music]

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:50.880
 Each election year we hear a lot of talk about favorite sons, but Senator Bill USA claims

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.600
 one who has nothing to do with politics.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.320
 Mr. and Mrs. Aldrich's boy Henry.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:01.240
 And because he is just a real American boy, well that makes Henry Aldrich everybody's

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:02.920
 favorite son.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:09.240
 Our scene tonight opens in the Aldrich living room where we find Henry and his sister Mary.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.080
 Mary, Mary, what is it Henry?

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.280
 Have you seen my new wrist watch any place your wrist watch? Where'd you leave it?

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.480
 I didn't leave it anyplace. I just can't find it. Mary you hadn't finished what you were doing in the kitchen

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.580
 Oh, I'll go right out mother and Henry I want you to go upstairs and get washed

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:32.860
 Yes, mother just as soon as I finished looking for something wash especially well there and Harriet's gonna be here for dinner

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.620
 She is and you know how she is about everything like that

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:40.340
 May I ask what you're upsetting all the cushions on the sofa floor? Oh nothing

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.580
 I just happened to be looking for something.

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.340
 I certainly hope you wrote your Aunt Harriet and thank her for the lovely wristwatch, she

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.340
 sent you.

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:49.340
 Yes, Mother.

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.980
 I wrote her the minute I heard she was coming.

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:56.460
 Oh, you didn't find anything out of the ordinary when you swept under the sofa, did you?

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.220
 What would you call out of the ordinary?

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:59.220
 Nothing.

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.020
 Just dust or something.

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.860
 Mother, what time shall I put the potatoes on?

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.460
 Oh, Henry, what time is it?

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:12.060
 It's exactly about, I should say it's a time of 26 minutes after six.

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.260
 Oh Father, am I glad to see you.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.160
 Put the potatoes on right away Mary.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.960
 Henry, I hope you're going to wash before Aunt Harriet gets here.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:24.160
 Yes Father, have you seen anything lying around that's sort of round and shiny?

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.460
 Such as what?

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.460
 Well, if you saw it you couldn't help but notice it.

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:32.960
 Father, mother wants to know whether you remember to bring that picture Aunt Harriet gave us down from the attic.

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:33.660
 Which one?

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.260
 The Colosseum in ruins.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.300
 I'll go up and get it.

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.260
 Oh, and Henry, Mother says to the dinner,

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:39.940
 "Yorta, sit down and Harry, it's right."

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:40.980
 On her right?

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.700
 Where she can see my left wrist?

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.260
 Henry, always, do you mean to say

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.340
 you lost that beautiful watch she sent you?

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.380
 No, Mary, I'm sure I can find it.

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.300
 Oh, my goodness, if you can't.

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:51.260
 You know how to press down,

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.100
 Harry, it gets over a thing like that.

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.580
 That isn't the half of her.

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.380
 She said if I'd take good care of it,

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.140
 maybe she'd give me a new bicycle.

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.980
 Henry, haven't you washed yet?

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.260
 Yes, Mother.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.620
 Mary, if anyone asks where I am, tell them I'll be right back.

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:05.460
 Where are you going?

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:06.620
 I just happened to remember.

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.180
 I left my watch across the street at Nancy Adams's.

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:10.620
 I'll be right back, Mary.

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.200
 (upbeat music)

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:23.740
 Can't you help me look for my watch, Herbert?

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:25.340
 Are you sure you left it here?

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:26.180
 I must.

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.180
 I've just been over at Nancy Adams's

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:29.620
 and it isn't there any place.

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.020
 Well, Henry, I don't see how you could

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:33.100
 lose a watch on my front lawn.

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.680
 This is where I remember wearing it last.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.440
 Herbert, let me see the watch you have on.

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.880
 Now listen, Henry, this isn't yours.

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.320
 It's exactly like mine, Herbert.

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:43.320
 It's the same, right.

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.360
 But is your strap worn as much as this?

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:46.360
 No.

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.760
 Was the second hand gone?

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.360
 No, but could I borrow that watch just for this evening?

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.360
 No, Henry.

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.320
 You don't know how to take care of a watch.

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:57.360
 I've never ruined the strap or busted my second hand, have I?

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.840
 No, but you've lost the whole watch, haven't you?

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:06.220
 If my Aunt Harry at finds I've misplaced it, she'll get depressed and refused to give me a bicycle.

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:10.580
 Henry, you're the last person in the world, my folks who want me to loan my watch to.

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:12.500
 What makes them feel that way about me?

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.740
 They don't even think you're a very good influence for me.

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:17.020
 Alright.

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:18.140
 Listen.

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:23.900
 Would you let me wear your watch if I give you all my allowance for the week of October 15th?

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:25.900
 Why would I have to wipe that wall?

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.460
 I owe everything until then.

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:28.940
 I wouldn't be interested.

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:33.380
 You wouldn't be interested. Well, would you consider two weeks allowance beginning October 15?

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:33.880
 No.

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.480
 But I wouldn't be asking you to help me if it didn't mean a lot.

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.600
 Henry, my folks will raise the dues.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:45.080
 I'm not asking you to give me your watch tomorrow. I'll bring it back as safe as though I'd never taken it.

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.360
 But supposing my folks ask me what time it is.

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.360
 All right, give me a call and I'll be glad to tell you what time it is.

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.000
 Would you give me three weeks allowance?

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:55.840
 Three?

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:56.960
 Sure.

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.140
 Come on over by this, please, so my mother doesn't see it.

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:05.440
 Herbert, if there's ever anything I can do for you of any nature whatsoever, just name it.

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.540
 Here, Henry's the watch. Thanks, Herbert.

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:10.240
 Boy, if I got a run, it's a good thing we're eating late tonight.

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.040
 - They'll be careful. - Herbert?

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:13.840
 Uh, what is it, mother?

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.640
 You have the correct time.

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:19.640
 - Why, uh... - It's exactly 12 minutes to heaven, Mrs. Thompson.

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:22.240
 Herbert, could you come here a minute, please?

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.440
 Don't you think I got to put the lawnmower away first?

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:26.940
 Will you please come here?

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:29.940
 Sure. Has something going wrong, Mother?

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:31.940
 May I see your watch, please?

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:33.440
 My watch?

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:35.940
 You didn't buy any chance. Give it to Henry, did you?

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:36.940
 To Henry?

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:38.940
 It was that you gave him.

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:41.940
 I didn't give him anything. I loaned him my watch.

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:47.440
 But, Mother, he's going to give me his allowance for the last two weeks in October and the first week in November.

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.940
 Herbert, you realize how much of Father paid for that watch?

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:53.940
 Put the money Henry's paying me as it was doing the investment.

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:57.440
 I want you to march over to Henry's house and get that watch this minute.

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:58.240
 Right now.

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:59.240
 At once.

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.740
 But mother, I don't think I should.

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:02.240
 Have it.

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:03.740
 Do you want me to tell your father?

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:05.240
 Okay, I'll go.

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.640
 And if you dare to come home without your watch,

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:10.540
 you will go without your allowance for one entire month.

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:23.540
 [Music]

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:24.940
 Sam, ask Harriet.

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:26.540
 But then she won't have another piece of steak.

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:28.040
 More steak, Harriet?

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:29.540
 No, thank you.

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:32.040
 How many nights a week can you people afford steak?

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:34.040
 Well, we're really having this for you.

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:35.540
 You needn't afford it for me.

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:36.540
 Where's Henry?

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:38.540
 He ought to be done any minute, Anne Harriet.

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:40.040
 I heard him run upstairs a little while ago.

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:42.600
 Father never let us be late when we were children.

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:46.440
 Henry! Henry, all rich!

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:47.840
 Yes, Father!

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:50.840
 Do you realize we're practically through with dinner?

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:52.040
 I'll be right there!

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:55.440
 Sam, as long as you have so much state, give me that piece next to the bone.

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:56.840
 All right, sir.

00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:02.240
 What on earth is that? Henry!

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:05.040
 I'm awfully sorry, I'm late. Hello, Aunt Harry.

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:06.040
 How do you do?

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:08.040
 Henry, didn't you know what time it was?

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:10.760
 Oh, oh yes, father. It's ten minutes after seven.

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:12.300
 And me, where did you get that watch?

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:13.540
 Why, Mary, why?

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:16.180
 Oh, nothing. Oh, when you have some bread and Harry.

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:20.920
 No, thank you. And Harry, I want to tell you how very much I appreciate the watch.

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:22.220
 Why didn't you write me about it?

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:24.420
 I did, and Harry. Didn't you get the letter?

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:26.820
 I did not. Let me see the watch. Here it is.

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:28.980
 Who could that be at the door?

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:29.820
 I see who it is.

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:30.860
 Don't you want me to, mother?

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:33.020
 No, thank you, Mary. I'm already on the way.

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:34.620
 So you like to watch?

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:37.020
 And Harry and I wouldn't work with it for anything.

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:39.020
 Hello there Herbert.

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:42.020
 How do you do Mrs. Orridge? Could I speak to Henry a minute?

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:43.020
 I'm sorry but Henry's at dinner.

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:44.020
 But I have to see him.

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:45.020
 We're having guests, Herbert.

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:47.020
 Well could I go into the dining room and speak to him?

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:50.020
 No, you better go back home and see him tomorrow morning.

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:52.020
 Oh no, I'll wait here until he's through.

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:54.020
 But Henry will be busy all evening.

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:57.020
 But Mrs. Orridge, Herbert, I'm quite sure anything you have to say can wait until morning.

00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:58.020
 Good idea.

00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:00.020
 Okay Mrs. Orridge, the only thing...

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:04.020
 My goodness Herbert Thompson never comes over to this house except when we're eating.

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:05.020
 Oh that's him?

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:06.020
 Herbert.

00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:07.820
 Oh, Herbert, Herbert Thompson?

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:08.380
 Yes.

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:10.120
 What's the matter with him?

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:11.620
 Nothing.

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:12.940
 Henry, are you all through?

00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:14.500
 Yes, Father, I've caught up with you.

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:15.860
 Well, I'll clear the table then.

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:17.020
 Mary, you helped with dinner.

00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:19.140
 I'm sure Henry would be glad to clear the table.

00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:19.940
 Oh, yes, Mother.

00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:20.980
 Sure.

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:22.900
 Should we keep our forks for the pie?

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:23.420
 No, dear.

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:24.740
 We're going to have clean ones.

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:25.700
 Oh, OK.

00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:27.700
 Henry, don't break anything going through that door.

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:28.200
 I won't.

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:30.580
 Now, put everything on the big kitchen table.

00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:32.260
 Yes, Mother.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:33.260
 Here for, buddy.

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:34.260
 Here you go.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:35.260
 Here you go.

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.260
 Hey Henry, she was, who's that?

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:38.260
 It's me.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:39.260
 Herbert, where are you?

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.260
 You're here behind the refrigerator.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.260
 Oh, Henry, I've got to have my wife.

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:44.260
 You're gonna listen, Herbert, aren't I?

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.260
 Paying you for the use of it?

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:49.260
 But if I don't get it, I'll lose a month's of a while.

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.260
 Herbert, you can't back out on a bargain.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.260
 But you shouldn't have taught me anything.

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:55.260
 Listen, Herbert, have sense, can't you see?

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:56.260
 I'm... I'm...

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:57.260
 Do I or don't I get my watch?

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.260
 Let me have it just until the end of the meal.

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:00.260
 No.

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:01.260
 Henry?

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:02.260
 Yes, Mother!

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.260
 When are you coming back to the rest of these dishes?

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:05.260
 Right away mother!

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:06.260
 Henry, wait!

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:07.260
 Get out Herbert, I gotta go back.

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:10.460
 Well I'm gonna wait right here Henry until I get that one.

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:11.460
 No Herbert.

00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:12.460
 Henry!

00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:16.260
 I'm just putting the dishes down carefully mother.

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:17.260
 Here I come.

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.500
 Was there something you wanted?

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:21.260
 I'll take the rest of the dishes out.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:22.260
 Oh wait, mother I'll take it off.

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.260
 I'll take everything in one load.

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:25.260
 Henry, look out.

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:26.760
 I haven't spold a thing.

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:28.860
 Please sit down while I take these things out.

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:30.660
 But mother, why not at least let Mary?

00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:32.260
 She's good at a thing like that.

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.460
 Mary's done more than her share.

00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:36.260
 And I think I'll go up and lie down.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:37.660
 What's the matter with you?

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:38.460
 I have a fever.

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:40.960
 You're not to go to bed until the dishes are done.

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:43.260
 I'll be right back to the pie, Harriet.

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:47.060
 Henry, must you drink an entire glass of water in one gulp?

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:49.860
 No, no, don't you think?

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:51.860
 Henry, what are you doing?

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:53.460
 I'm dying.

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:55.660
 Here, you're looking to slap you on the back.

00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:59.560
 I'm all right, Anne, Harriet.

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:01.260
 Do you think I found in the kitchen?

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:02.860
 Listen mother, let me explain.

00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:06.060
 Explain, I let the burner on under a brand new pan.

00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:07.460
 You let the burner on under a pan?

00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:08.460
 I did.

00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:10.060
 Here Harriet, the piece of pie for you.

00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:12.860
 I could need a piece that big unless there's some cheese to go with it.

00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:14.260
 I have the cheese right here.

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:15.660
 Where are you going now, mother?

00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:17.060
 Back to get the rest of the pie.

00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:17.860
 I don't want any.

00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:19.660
 But Henry, the rest of us might.

00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:21.660
 Oh, oh sure, of course.

00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:23.660
 Henry, you still need a new bicycle?

00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:25.260
 Well, I could certainly use one.

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:26.260
 Mary, it is mother.

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.460
 How many pieces of pie did you cut?

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:29.060
 Pie?

00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:33.700
 Well, I brought in two, and when I just went back out, there were only two left.

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:34.700
 There's one missing?

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:36.340
 There is.

00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:38.140
 Well, I guess Mary only cut four.

00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:40.140
 But I'm sure I cut five.

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:41.260
 Well, don't go back, mother.

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:42.300
 I can't eat a thing.

00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:43.660
 The best pie I ever ate.

00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:46.500
 [SIREN WAILING]

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:48.660
 Well, what could that be?

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:52.300
 That whistle?

00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:53.700
 Yes.

00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:56.500
 Oh, I imagine it's just one of the fellows outside or something.

00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:58.580
 Sounded as though it would be right here in this house.

00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:00.380
 I think it was in the cellar.

00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:01.820
 From the cellar, Mary?

00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:03.540
 That's ridiculous.

00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:07.820
 She was, what is there in the cellar that would whisper?

00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:09.380
 We have some sold in, Harriet?

00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:10.180
 On my pie?

00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:12.060
 Well, some people I get in.

00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:14.620
 Henry, the doctor says that Harriet must never touch sold.

00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:15.260
 Well, I'm not kidding.

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:16.540
 She certainly doesn't want any.

00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:21.500
 Isn't that strange?

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:23.620
 Santa, is the hot water heater down the basement all right?

00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:25.300
 Perhaps I'd better go down and see.

00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:27.220
 You sit still, father, and finish your pie.

00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:28.380
 I don't care for any more.

00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:30.380
 I'm halfway out to the kitchen already.

00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:32.380
 Just turn the path off.

00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:33.380
 Yes, Father.

00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:37.380
 Hey, Herbert, you here in the kitchen?

00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:43.380
 Herbert, you down here in the basement?

00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:45.380
 Yes, and I want my watch.

00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:47.380
 Oh my gosh, it's so dark down here.

00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:48.380
 Where are you?

00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:51.380
 In the cold, but listen, Herbert, do you want to get me into serious trouble?

00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:53.380
 You want me to go up until you're in, Harriet?

00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:55.380
 That's my watch you have, please.

00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:56.380
 I beg of you.

00:11:56.380 --> 00:12:00.460
 decent inside of you Herbert please don't go up. Well I'm going up right now.

00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:03.980
 All right Herbert here's your watch G-Wiz. You better give it to me.

00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:07.500
 Here take the darn thing. She was the jadropa? You dropped it.

00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:11.180
 Where is it? Don't you have any light in this part of the cellar. What do you

00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:15.420
 want with a light in the coal bin for? Are you sure you aren't stepping on it?

00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:20.220
 How would I know? If I am Henry you'll be responsible. It's a funny thing. I fell

00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:23.820
 all around on the floor. There isn't any sign up. Let me feel.

00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:24.660
 Do you have it?

00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:25.480
 Whoa.

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:26.540
 Herbert, here's a broom.

00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:30.340
 Stand up in the coal while I try to find it by sweeping.

00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:30.840
 OK.

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:36.220
 Henry!

00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:37.580
 Yes, Father?

00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:40.580
 What are you doing down there?

00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:43.780
 I'm sweeping the cellar.

00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:45.340
 What for?

00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:48.700
 It's something I should have done weeks ago.

00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:49.460
 Herbert, Herbert, look.

00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:49.960
 I found it.

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:50.540
 It's OK.

00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:51.900
 Yes.

00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:53.900
 Look out, Henry!

00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:59.460
 Herbert.

00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:01.740
 Herbert, are you buried?

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:03.500
 Tell me to watch Henry.

00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:05.340
 Quick Herbert, quick, my father's coming, I think.

00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:06.420
 Let me up the stairs.

00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:07.540
 You can't go upstairs.

00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:08.340
 You gotta go in here.

00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:10.540
 In this little room where my father has his work bench.

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:11.540
 Okay.

00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:14.060
 Don't bother to come down, Father!

00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:15.740
 What's the trouble down there?

00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:16.740
 Nothing!

00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:17.660
 Are you in there, Herbert?

00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:18.180
 Yeah.

00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:19.340
 We'll close the door tight.

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:21.260
 I can't. There's no latch on the inside.

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:22.180
 here I'll close it.

00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:24.540
 Give me my word.

00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:26.380
 Hey, I asked why you're sweeping this

00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:28.580
 fellow while your Aunt Harry is taking dinner with us.

00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:30.940
 I guess I just didn't stop the thank-bothering.

00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:32.900
 Who closed the door to my workroom?

00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:34.100
 But I have.

00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:36.700
 I certainly hope you didn't snap that lock, son.

00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:37.900
 Well, it snapped by itself.

00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:39.460
 Well, that's a nice state of affairs.

00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:42.540
 I've told everyone in this house I've lost both keys to that lock

00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:43.820
 and it must not be closed.

00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:45.700
 You mean it can't be open?

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:46.860
 Of course it can't.

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:49.420
 Not until I get a locksmith tomorrow afternoon.

00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:59.420
 [Music]

00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:02.420
 Now getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldrich.

00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:05.420
 Henry having lost the new watches and Harriet gave him,

00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:08.420
 as borrowed one exactly like it from his friend Herbert.

00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:12.420
 Herbert, in trying to get the watch back, got locked in Mr. Aldrich's work room.

00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:15.420
 The scene opens now in the Aldrich kitchen.

00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:16.420
 Henry!

00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:18.420
 Yes, Father?

00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:19.420
 Where are you?

00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:23.420
 I'm in the kitchen asking Mary if there's anything I can do to help her.

00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:28.420
 Your aunt Harry has been waiting here in the living room for you to come and play Rummy with her.

00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:31.420
 Ask father, I'll be right there.

00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:33.420
 Listen Mary, did you put in that phone call?

00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:34.420
 Yes, Henry.

00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:36.420
 Well, what did the locksmiths say?

00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:38.420
 His wife said she sent him over the minute he got home.

00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:42.420
 Did you tell her Herbert's been locked in the cellar for more than an hour and a half?

00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:43.420
 Yes.

00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:44.420
 Henry!

00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:45.420
 I'm coming right away, father!

00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:48.820
 And don't forget him, it was your promise to give me for putting in that call.

00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:52.820
 No, Mary, you get my allowance for the second and third weeks in November.

00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:55.820
 - Henry! - Coming, Father!

00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:59.020
 - Henry! - Is Anne Harry ready to play?

00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:01.020
 Well, I'm almost ready to go home.

00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:02.420
 Sit down here and deal the part.

00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:05.420
 Yes, Anne Harry, I see you give each seven cards.

00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:07.620
 - Henry, do you know anything about Herbert Thompson?

00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:09.420
 - Herbert? - Mrs. Thompson just phoned.

00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:11.420
 Herbert hasn't been home all evening.

00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:12.620
 Is that right?

 The way this younger generation stays out nowadays.

00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:17.520
 Play your first card.

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:18.520
 Oh, let me go.

 Boy, it is time flying a crisis.

00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:26.220
 In a crisis?

00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:27.120
 I'll go to the door.

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:28.820
 You stay right here and play with me.

00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:29.920
 Yeah, but that might be for me.

00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:30.920
 I'll see who it is.

00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:32.120
 I'm on my way now.

00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:35.320
 How do you do?

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:36.020
 How do you do?

00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:37.320
 Sorry to have kept you waiting.

00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:38.620
 Kept me waiting.

00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:39.420
 Yes, man.

00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:40.820
 Didn't you phone for locksmith?

00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:41.920
 Who is it, mother?

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:44.920
 Henry, ask your father if he's phone for a locksmith.

00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:46.520
 Oh, is there one out there?

00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:47.220
 Yes, sir.

00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:51.120
 Well, I didn't phone for you, but I do have a job downstairs you might attend to.

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:52.120
 Father, who is there?

00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:53.420
 Henry, play your car.

00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:55.420
 You got somebody locked up downstairs?

00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:56.620
 Locked up?

00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:57.720
 No, sir.

00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:00.820
 Well, this place I was called to has an emergency of some kind.

00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:03.220
 Say, I better go back to the shop and shake up with my wife.

00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:04.720
 I'm sorry, this wasn't the house.

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:06.720
 Well, that's okay, lady. All of these were...

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:08.720
 Father, has the man gone?

00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:09.620
 Yes, dear.

00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:10.720
 Is Mary in the kitchen?

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:11.220
 Yes.

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:12.980
 I think I'll get in Harry at a glass of water.

00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:14.260
 I don't want any water.

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:15.780
 Oh yes you do Anne Harry.

00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:17.780
 She was I'd be very glad to get it.

00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:18.780
 Mary.

00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:19.980
 What is it Henry?

00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:22.500
 Mary, Mary listen you gotta phone the locksmith again.

00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:23.300
 Where's Nick home?

00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:24.780
 He's come and gone.

00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:25.860
 They sent him away.

00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:28.060
 Henry I done all I'm going to.

00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:32.700
 Mary don't you realize my best friend is down in the basement locked in that room.

00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:34.100
 Maybe without air.

00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:39.660
 Henry if you think I'm going to make myself ridiculous by falling out locksmith every 10 minutes you're crazy.

00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:43.980
 Look, Mary, would you be interested in my allowance for the first week in December?

00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:45.820
 Well...

00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:48.340
 That practically cleans me out up to Christmas.

00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:50.540
 Henry, where's that water?

00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:52.460
 I'm letting it run in, Harriet!

00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:54.780
 All right, for you, Mary.

00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:58.460
 I'm putting the full responsibility for Herbert's condition on your shoulders.

00:16:58.460 --> 00:17:02.380
 When we get to the door to Father's workroom open and Herbert comes to,

00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:04.060
 he'll want to know who did this to him.

00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:05.780
 But, Henry, I haven't even seen him.

00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:06.380
 Henry!

00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:07.540
 Yes, see, and Harriet.

00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:10.460
 Here's your glass of ice cold water.

00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:12.780
 Now I can sit down and play.

00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:13.620
 Here you are.

00:17:13.620 --> 00:17:14.660
 Thank you.

00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:15.500
 What did you do?

00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:16.980
 Let the hot water run?

00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:17.660
 Was it warm?

00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:21.100
 I'll put it down and let it cool.

00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:23.220
 How could that have happened?

00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:25.460
 See, I played that car, didn't I?

00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:28.700
 I discarded it.

00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:29.740
 Oh, then it's my turn.

00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:37.380
 - Is that someone sawing wood?

00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:42.380
 - Is what someone sawing wood?

00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:43.380
 - Oh, oh, wow.

00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:45.380
 - I thought I heard a saw.

00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:47.380
 - You still haven't discarded.

00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:48.380
 - Oh, no.

00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:52.380
 - Oh, oh, wow.

00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:53.380
 What do you mean?

00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:55.380
 - What do you mean well, well, well?

00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:56.380
 You haven't put your car down.

00:17:56.380 --> 00:17:58.380
 - I thought I heard that sawing again.

00:17:58.380 --> 00:17:59.380
 - Yes.

00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:01.380
 And sounded as though I were in the basement.

00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:02.380
 - Maybe it's the hot water heater.

00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:04.380
 - I didn't even hear a noise.

00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:05.980
 You listen, you hear it.

00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:08.220
 (humming)

00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:09.900
 Henry, will you please stop singing?

00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:11.620
 I'd like to hear what that song is.

00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:12.720
 - Oh, excuse me.

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:15.420
 - Very unharried is my card.

00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:18.560
 - And Harriet, did you know I've been taking

00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:19.660
 music lessons?

00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:20.900
 I'll play a tune for you.

00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:21.740
 - Not now.

00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:23.540
 - Look, here's what I learned so far.

00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:25.300
 (piano music)

00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:26.140
 - Henry.

00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:26.980
 - Yes, mother.

00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:28.340
 - I want you to go back to that card table,

00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:30.380
 and if I hear one word out of you for the next five minutes,

00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:31.900
 I'm gonna have to ask you to go up to bed.

00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:33.140
 - Yes, mother.

00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:34.140
 Now then let's listen.

00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:38.140
 Well, you wait.

00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:42.740
 I hope that that be.

00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:44.540
 Probably that locksmith again.

00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:45.840
 Is it?

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:48.540
 I don't know, dear, and I won't know until I open this door.

00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:51.240
 Hello, Mrs. Orr, a chibbit.

00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:53.040
 Mother, is that Harvard?

00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:54.240
 Henry, come back here.

00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:55.940
 Henry, I want to talk to you.

00:18:55.940 --> 00:18:58.040
 Henry's playing Rummy with his aunt, Herbert.

00:18:58.040 --> 00:19:00.740
 And if you don't mind, I'll go into the living room.

00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:02.440
 Who's coming in here?

00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:06.240
 I am. I always wanted to play Rummy and now I'm going to.

00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:21.440
 Harriet, what's the score?

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:24.440
 I'm two thousand ahead. It was I'm three thousand and going.

00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:27.940
 Herbert, how would you like another glass of ginger ale?

00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:28.440
 Sure.

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:31.940
 Young man, do you realize this is the fourth bottle you've had?

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:35.200
 It is. You drink anymore. You're going to go right up in the air.

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:37.360
 - Herbert! - Yes, Mary.

00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:39.120
 Your mother wants to speak to you on the phone.

00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:39.960
 Okay.

00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:43.480
 You mean to say that young man is actually going to leave this room?

00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:46.800
 Well, I had a nice nap.

00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:49.320
 Father, you've been asleep for two hours.

00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:52.000
 Oh, I'm glad to see Herbert's gone.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.800
 What makes you think he's gone?

00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:56.480
 - Where is he? - He's phoning for his pajamas.

00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:59.680
 But, Mother, it's just a question of time.

00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:02.280
 As soon as he's in, Harry, it goes like got it.

00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:03.280
 He's got what?

00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:05.480
 There are several things I'd like to know.

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:07.880
 One is that locksmith coming back the second time.

00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:10.180
 Yes, that some man was locked up here.

00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:13.680
 Well, I'll certainly be interested in reading what was in the morning papers.

00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:14.680
 Henry, I'm quitting.

00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:15.480
 You are?

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:16.680
 Oh, uh, this only?

00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:17.680
 I'm not going yet.

00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:19.080
 Just not going to play anymore.

00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:20.080
 Yes, Anne, Harry.

00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:22.280
 Henry, I want to see your watch.

00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:24.480
 It's exactly eight minutes after eleven.

00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:25.480
 Let me look at it.

00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:27.880
 Oh, there's just one little thing I'd like to explain.

00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:28.680
 Give it to me?

00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:29.680
 Yes, ma'am.

00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:33.980
 How would you like to have me take this down to the jewelers and have your monogram put on it?

00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:35.580
 Who's monogram, Henry?

00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:36.880
 Who's do you think?

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:39.280
 You mean my initials naturally?

00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:40.780
 Oh, I don't think he'd like that.

00:20:40.780 --> 00:20:42.280
 How do you know he wouldn't?

00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:44.380
 Oh, no, Aunt Harriet, she was.

00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:47.380
 Suppose, and Henry wanted to change his name sometime.

00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:51.080
 - To what, for instance? - Early thing.

00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:51.680
 Yeah.

00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:54.180
 Only girls use their monograms.

00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:58.580
 Henry, you let me take this and sometime during the next week or so, I'll have it in braid.

00:20:58.580 --> 00:21:00.040
 I'll put in my pocketbook.

00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:03.800
 Wouldn't you fight to have me carry your things out to the car for you?

00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:04.800
 What things?

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:07.080
 Well, your pocketbook or anything?

00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:09.240
 No, thank you.

00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:12.160
 Henry, supposing you helped your aunt Harry go with her coat?

00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:13.680
 Well, I hold her pocketbook.

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:15.880
 Put my pocketbook.

00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:17.800
 I'll put it right down here.

00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:18.640
 Thank you.

00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:22.680
 Anne, Harriet, don't you want to leave it there and go upstairs and see my new wallpaper?

00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:25.480
 You mean to say you got new wallpaper, but not asking me what to get?

00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:26.640
 Well, you told me to get it.

00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:28.940
 Well, I'll go up and see it, but I know I won't like it.

00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:30.240
 Oh, but I think you will.

00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:32.640
 Hand me my pocketbook.

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:34.340
 Do you want to carry it all the way upstairs?

00:21:34.340 --> 00:21:35.040
 Give it to me.

00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:36.040
 Give it to me.

00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:38.440
 Henry, don't you think it'd be nice if we helped

00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:40.140
 your aunt Harry up the stairs?

00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:40.840
 Yes, Herbert.

00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:41.640
 Let's do that.

00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:43.440
 Not so fast, boys.

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:44.640
 So fast, but Henry?

00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:45.640
 Yes, Aunt Harry.

00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:48.340
 It isn't necessary to push me.

00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:49.140
 Alice.

00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:49.940
 Yes, darling.

00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:52.540
 Would you please tell me what's gotten into those two boys?

00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:54.340
 Trying to be nice to Harry it.

00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:56.240
 It isn't like them to be that nice.

00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:58.320
 Herbert's fond of us, and he fits.

00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:00.320
 [SINGING]

00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:02.320
 [SINGING]

00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:03.720
 Well, Herbert.

00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:05.000
 Yes, Mr. Walrich?

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:06.520
 Did you like the wallpaper?

00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:08.000
 Oh, very much.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.160
 Well, Henry, I guess I'll be going.

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:12.360
 About what time is that, Herbert, my friend?

00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:16.000
 Well, my friend, it is exactly 21 minutes after 11.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.120
 Thank you very much.

00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:18.600
 Alice, what do you think I've lost?

00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:19.100
 What?

00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:19.760
 Well, sir.

00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:20.760
 So long, Henry.

00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:21.880
 You wait, young man.

00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:23.040
 I want to say good night to you.

00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:23.800
 What did you do?

00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:26.240
 I locked my car out in front of the keys inside it.

00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:26.740
 What?

00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:28.080
 Sam go out and get them.

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:29.200
 And how would I do that?

00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:32.080
 Oh, here they are in my pocket.

00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:33.080
 The only thing is--

00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:33.580
 Now what?

00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:35.520
 Henry's watch is gone.

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:37.240
 You mean it isn't there, Anne Harry?

00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:38.520
 Henry, I gotta go home.

00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:40.040
 Yeah, so long, Herbert.

00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:43.080
 Now who's dead at the door?

00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:43.680
 Hello?

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:44.600
 No, Mr. Oldie.

00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:45.720
 Go ahead and then see Adams.

00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:46.760
 What are you doing here?

00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:48.880
 If Henry here, I just found his watch.

00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:49.440
 What?

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:50.160
 His watch?

00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:51.200
 Where did you find it?

00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:53.360
 He left it over at my house this morning.

00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:55.960
 Well, how would you account for a thing like that?

00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:58.520
 Henry also let this letter you forgot to mail.

00:22:58.520 --> 00:22:59.440
 A letter?

00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:02.400
 Oh, yeah, here, Aunt Harry, it's for you.

00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:03.960
 Thanking you for my watch.

00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:06.960
