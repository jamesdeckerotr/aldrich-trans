00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.120
 - And nobody's to light the fire until I get there.

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.960
 - Okay.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:49.800
 - Okay.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:50.640
 - Why?

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:51.460
 - Why, why?

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:52.840
 - Why do we have to wait till you get there?

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.440
 Because Charlie, because I'm organizing the whole thing.

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.940
 Oh.

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:57.840
 Sure.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:58.640
 Why?

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:59.540
 Why?

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:00.340
 Why?

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.540
 She was so nothing will go wrong.

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.540
 Henry, did you say $2 worth or $3 worth?

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:07.340
 $3, Mr. Prichard?

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.840
 OK.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.740
 Extra fresh.

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.040
 Now listen, Charlie.

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.040
 Charlie, Charlie, where'd you go to?

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.640
 She was.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:22.100
 Mr. Prichard, are you taking those weiners out

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.100
 of the showcase?

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.100
 Sure.

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.860
 But didn't you order special ones just for me?

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:27.860
 Why?

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:28.860
 Sure, Henry.

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:34.860
 I've just been saving them just for you right here in the corner of the showcase.

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.100
 Oh, oh well that's good.

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.620
 Boy have I got a headache.

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:40.620
 Oh that's too bad.

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.820
 I don't know why I let myself get talked into managing these things.

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:45.820
 Excuse me.

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.660
 Do you mind if I just watch you weigh those weiners?

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:49.660
 Hey, I'll look Henry.

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:50.660
 Just keep away from these scales.

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.280
 I'd be glad to only I have to look after all the little details such as

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.680
 Well such as such is what well mr.. Pritchard

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.500
 I don't suppose your thumbs actually resting on the scales

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:09.940
 Just looks like it. Look I'll throw into extra winners if you'll get down off my counter sure

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.220
 See, thanks very much. You want me to leave the winners in this here box?

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:18.320
 Yes, please and would you put some heavy brown paper on it and lots of string all right?

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.320
 I don't want anything to go wrong

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.480
 You got everything straight Homer

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:29.400
 If that's what you mean did they check it from top to bottom they put air in the tires

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:35.020
 What else can you do with a bike? It's gonna be in perfect running order Homer. I told you that I've got a big

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:39.740
 Responsibility listen Henry who asked you to be responsible anyway

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:44.520
 What do you mean by that just because the kids gave you the money for the winners?

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:48.520
 That doesn't mean you had to talk everybody into pedaling way out into the country.

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:49.520
 What's wrong with that?

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.520
 She whiz its work.

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.520
 But think of the appetite it'll give you.

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.520
 Henry, I don't need anything to give me an appetite.

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:01.520
 Why can't we have the leaner roast in your backyard the way you said in the first place?

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:07.520
 Homer, when I invited the kids to my backyard, how was I to know my father had just planted grass seed

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.520
 and was going to be unreasonable about it?

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.520
 What's the matter with your friend, Lord?

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:13.520
 Homer, listen.

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:19.520
 Why sit on an uncomfortable lawn when you can sit in solid comfort on McCorkle's rocks?

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:22.520
 Here Henry, here's your weeners, that'll be $3.

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.520
 Sure, I've got it right here.

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:25.520
 Right?

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.520
 Henry, what's the matter?

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:28.520
 Oh boy.

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.520
 Why are you turning all your pockets inside out?

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.520
 Oh boy, Homer, Homer, have you got any money?

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.520
 What do you mean if I got any money? Where's our $3?

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.520
 I had it, I had it, I had it in this pocket here.

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.520
 That one with the hole in it?

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:46.160
 all folded up. Oh boy. Mr. Prichard, what are you doing?

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.600
 Why are you blind Henry? He's unwrapping the wieners.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.560
 No, wait a minute, Mr. Prichard. Wait a minute. Homer, I want you to go all the way back to

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:59.040
 my house on your hands and knees. Now listen Henry. Hey, hey, wait a minute.

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:05.520
 Why are you taking your shoe off? Look. Here's the three dollars in my sock.

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.680
 Why? And it's still all folded up. Well, I'll be done.

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.960
 Mr. Prichard, would you mind wrapping those weiners up again?

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.320
 Alright.

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.240
 Boy, Homer isn't this my lucky day.

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:18.160
 I'll say.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.880
 Let's get going. Where'd you put my bike?

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.480
 Uh, right out there at the curb. Behind that truck.

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:23.240
 You mean the one that's...

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.080
 Whom are the trucks backing up?

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:25.920
 Hey!

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:27.040
 Well, Gee, where's my bike?

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:28.920
 Hey, Mr. Look out!

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:33.280
 Hey, cut it out!

00:05:33.280 --> 00:06:02.680
 *Singing* Hello? Hello? Is that you, Charlie? Sure, who's this? It's Henry! Hi, you Charlie, old kid, how's a kid? One kid. Look, Charlie, you know what I've been doing? I've been thinking. You have, Henry again? What do you mean by a statement like that?

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:06.280
 Why you did some thinking yesterday, Henry and all I did was get confused.

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:08.920
 What's confusing about it, Charlie?

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:13.080
 Instead of sitting around and being bored in my backyard, we're having a

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:16.600
 swell wiener roast in the open air at Macorkle's Rocks.

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:19.180
 What's so confusing about that?

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:20.360
 Nothing, I guess.

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:22.600
 Except you keep changing your mind all the time.

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:23.680
 No, I don't.

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:27.800
 Okay. We're all going out to Macorkle's Rocks on our bikes. That's fine.

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:31.680
 Well, look, Charlie, and that's what I've been thinking about.

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:36.240
 We're just letting ourselves in for a lot of trouble going on bikes.

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:37.680
 We are, why?

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:42.000
 Well, for one thing, they're tearing up a piece of the road out there.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.520
 And boy, there are ruts all over the place.

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:45.520
 Yeah.

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:47.280
 Sure, and detours.

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:52.040
 And, um, and, uh, it's a regular booby trap, Charlie.

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:53.040
 She wish.

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:57.960
 So look, why don't we get all the kids to get their father's cars and drive out there

00:06:57.960 --> 00:06:58.960
 in solid comfort.

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:00.960
 You all those ruts?

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:04.720
 Charlie look you go through a run on a bike and you're up a tree

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:08.300
 But you go through a rut in the car and where are you?

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:10.300
 Where she was in a rut?

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:17.000
 That's a beautiful part Charlie you stay there. That's true. So do you think you can swing it from bikes to cars?

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:25.440
 Okay, you do that

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:27.920
 It's practically in the bag so long

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:30.920
 Father

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:33.920
 Father, are you upstairs?

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:35.420
 I'm in my room, Henry.

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:36.420
 You are?

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:37.420
 Can I help you with anything?

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:39.920
 As a matter of fact, I'm fighting for something.

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:41.520
 Oh, I'll help you hunt, Father.

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:42.920
 I'll start on this door here.

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:44.420
 What are we looking for?

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:45.420
 Never mind, Henry.

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:46.420
 What is it you want?

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:53.220
 Well, now that you mention it, Father, we've always been pretty good pals, haven't we?

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:54.220
 I think so, son.

00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:55.220
 Sure.

00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:57.020
 That's what I'm always telling the kids.

00:07:57.020 --> 00:08:00.920
 Boy, I say, is my father a reasonable sort of guy.

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:03.220
 He has his full chore, but don't we all?

00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:05.920
 The main thing is, he's generous.

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:06.420
 Who is?

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:07.620
 You are, Father.

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:10.520
 And boy, I think of a person as generous

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:12.320
 than the rest can just go out the window.

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:13.820
 Would you like a wiener, Father?

00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:15.220
 You throwing them out the window?

00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:19.320
 No, no, Gee, was I'm just not letting them out of my sight.

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:21.920
 Father, I'll get right to the point.

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:22.920
 I'm glad to hear it.

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:26.920
 I'll ask you straight from the shoulder.

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:28.540
 You know your car?

00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:31.720
 Pretty well. I've been on intimate terms with it for 10 years.

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:34.040
 Well sure, that's my point.

00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:34.940
 What is?

00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:41.520
 Father, you remember the other night you said you didn't feel you should get a new car until this one was worn out?

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:43.320
 Yes, I believe I said that.

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:47.480
 Well, don't you agree that the only way to wear it out is to use it?

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:48.640
 I do use it.

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:50.920
 Sure, Father, but I don't.

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:53.920
 Henry, I don't want it worn out that quickly.

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:58.800
 Father father if you just lend it to me tonight, I give you my word. You'll never know it had been in a rush

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:04.320
 What's that I mean? Well, it's a matter of life and death father and all the other kids are getting cars

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:09.680
 I think and if you want to borrow my car this evening, why don't you come right out and ask for it?

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:12.240
 You mean I can have it?

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:18.380
 If you can show me a good reason why you need it. Oh, I can father. I can dig up as many reasons as you want

00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:21.160
 Yes, mother

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:25.500
 Oh boy, that'll be Charlie. I'll be right back father with my reasons.

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:27.960
 Head rest slow down.

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:30.380
 My goodness Sam, what's the matter with head mate?

00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:35.540
 Well that's pretty involved subject Alice. Right now I'm trying to find my maroon tie.

00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:40.780
 What maroon tie Sam? My favorite Alice, the one I wear all the time. I've been hunting high and low for it all week.

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:44.260
 Now there you don't want that tie. It was one practic but a shred.

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:45.480
 Alice, why do you say that?

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:48.520
 And dear let's talk about it some other time. I have to go down and start dinner.

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:51.520
 Alice, what happened to my maroon tire?

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:53.520
 Very well, Sam.

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:56.520
 To be perfectly frank, Henry borrowed it.

00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:57.520
 What?

00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:00.520
 Now, there before you lose your temper, try to think of all the nice things he does.

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:01.520
 Henry!

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:04.520
 Sam, there's no use asking him for it.

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:05.520
 Why not?

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:09.520
 Well, as I said, it was pretty well worn, and...

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:12.520
 Well, you see, Henry was patting this horse.

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:13.520
 What?

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:15.520
 And you know those little white squares on the tire?

00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:18.320
 you have to admit they do look like lumps of sugar.

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:24.020
 Alice, do you mean some strange horse ate my tie?

00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:25.920
 Oh no, Sam.

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:26.920
 No.

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:28.120
 It was Gus's horse, Sheila.

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:29.120
 You know Sheila.

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:34.120
 Alice, that's the third thing Henry has borrowed and not returned this week.

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:36.120
 Henry isn't the only one there.

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:40.320
 There's that book you borrowed over a year ago called History of the Roman Empire.

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:41.320
 Alice, that's different.

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:43.720
 I don't remember who I borrowed it from.

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:45.720
 Have you made much of an effort to find out?

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:48.720
 Alice, I never heard of anyone called Aunt Tilly.

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:50.720
 And that's the only name in the book.

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:52.720
 Henry, where are you?

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:54.720
 And how do you try not to get angry?

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:56.720
 I'm just going to teach Henry a lesson.

00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:59.720
 You have Charlie, you have your father old soda, well so am I.

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:01.720
 Henry, please put down that receiver.

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:03.720
 Sure, Father. So long, Charlie.

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:05.720
 And keep working on the rest of the kids.

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:06.720
 Henry, about my car.

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:08.720
 Sure, Father. Here are my reasons.

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:10.720
 You can forget the whole thing.

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:11.720
 Forget it.

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:14.880
 Father, you mean? You mean I can't have?

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:15.720
 I do.

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:17.360
 But you haven't heard my reason.

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:20.420
 Just sit down, son. I'll tell you a few of my reasons.

00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:32.600
 [Music]

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:33.340
 Hello.

00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:35.480
 Hi, all-time-er. Our trip.

00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:36.440
 Is that you, him?

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:36.940
 Sure.

00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:38.240
 I was just gonna phone you.

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:40.940
 My father finally fought over his car.

00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:41.940
 We're all set.

00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:42.940
 We are?

00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:47.940
 Well, look, I've been thinking, and did I come up with a swell idea?

00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:48.940
 Yeah.

00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:50.940
 Sure, it's so good I don't know why I didn't think of it before.

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:55.940
 Look, why don't we all chip in and take a couple of taxis out to McCorkle's rocks?

00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:56.940
 A taxi?

00:11:56.940 --> 00:11:59.940
 You are in right out in solid comfort.

00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:03.940
 Well, Henry, you take a taxi and I'll go in my father's car.

00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:08.940
 But wouldn't it be more fun if we all went together and, and besides, if we all chip in, it'll be cheaper?

00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:12.940
 What do you mean cheaper? It wouldn't cost me a cent to go in my car.

00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:13.940
 I think of the repairs.

00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:14.940
 What repair?

00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:18.940
 Over there, road is full of ruts. By some of them are this deep.

00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:20.940
 They are? As deep as that?

00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:21.940
 Sure.

00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:28.940
 You'd stand a very good chance of wrecking your car out there, but a taxi's different. They're made to be wrecked.

00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:30.940
 How much would a taxi call?

00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:33.940
 I got it all figured out, only two dollars each.

00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:36.940
 Henry, that's two dollars more than I've got.

00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:41.200
 All you gotta do is work on your father. You've got a golden tongue Homer.

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:44.200
 A what? A golden tongue, a golden tongue.

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:47.640
 I have. And I'll phone the other kids and get the wheels rolling.

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:59.880
 But father Henry Alders can get two dollars.

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:00.940
 Now wait Charlie.

00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:03.780
 Mother says it's alright with her and it's alright with Mr. Alders.

00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:05.380
 So why isn't it alright with you?

00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:09.480
 What do you want the two dollars for? I told you you could have my car, didn't I?

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:13.240
 Yeah, but suddenly we've all decided to go out to Macquarkle's Rocks by Taxi.

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:15.280
 By Taxi? Why?

00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:19.720
 Because of the ruts and it's bad enough with a bicycle and with a car, gee!

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:23.360
 Only a taxi doesn't cost as much the fix like a car is when it's wrecked.

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:24.460
 What's that?

00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:26.460
 I think that's my reason. I'm all confused.

00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:29.460
 Now just a minute, who's running this weeder rose?

00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:30.220
 Henry Aldrich.

00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:32.400
 Very well, before my headache gets any worse.

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:35.140
 I'm going to phone the Aldrich's and find out what's going on.

00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:37.660
 I still don't think you'll understand it any more than I do.

00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:38.660
 Hammer, please.

00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:40.220
 Airm, 303.

00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:41.460
 No, 303.

00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:42.340
 Charlie, run along.

00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:44.660
 Can I listen, Father? I'd like to find out what's happening.

00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:46.740
 I'll tell you what's happening. Now, run along.

00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:47.380
 Yes, Father.

00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:48.020
 Hello.

00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:50.340
 Uh, hello, Mr. Aldrich. This is Mr. Carr.

00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:51.540
 Oh, hi, your water.

00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:55.220
 Sam, I'd just like to know if you're loaning Henry your car this evening,

00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:57.140
 or if you're giving him money or what?

00:13:57.140 --> 00:14:00.900
 Well, I'm certainly not lending you my car. I'm being very firm about that.

00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:03.860
 Boy, his age isn't capable of taking care of other people's belongings.

00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:04.740
 I see.

00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:10.140
 Recently, Henry developed a bad habit of borrowing things and not returning them, so I decided to clamp down.

00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:11.620
 Good for you, Sam.

00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:14.460
 Borrowing things as one of the worst thoughts a boy can have.

00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:14.980
 Exactly.

00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:17.540
 Some people never get over it, even when they grow up.

00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:19.260
 I agree with you 100%.

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:24.900
 For example, Sam, somebody, I can't remember who it was, borrowed a favorite book of mine over a year ago.

00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:26.860
 History of the Roman Empire, it was.

00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:28.100
 Oh.

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:29.100
 Oh.

00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:29.900
 Yes, sir.

00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:31.460
 And I've never seen the book again.

00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:34.460
 Mr. Clark, that's, that's rather a coincidence.

00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:37.260
 If you ask me, Sam, it's a perfect example of bad upbringing.

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.860
 I'm sure you'll book what you are one of these days with the car,

00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:42.760
 and now excuse me, I think I hear my wife calling you goodbye.

00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:43.760
 Goodbye, Sam.

00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:44.960
 Hello, sir.

00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:48.060
 Did I hear you talking about that history of the Roman Empire?

00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:48.860
 You did?

00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:51.260
 Well, I certainly wish you'd hurry and find it.

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:54.160
 And till he keeps saying you borrowed it from her and never attended...

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:56.360
 Now, Marion, it will show up one of these days.

00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:57.560
 Where is Charlie?

00:14:57.560 --> 00:14:59.460
 Here I am, Father. Can I have the two dollars?

00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:00.460
 You may not.

00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:01.860
 You mean I have to go in your car?

00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:03.160
 And you can't have the car either.

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:06.280
 Boy your age isn't capable of taking care of other people's belongings.

00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:08.320
 But I don't want any argument, Charlie.

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:10.320
 From now on I'm clamping down around here.

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:12.520
 But how am I gonna get to the winner, Rose tonight?

00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:14.920
 That's for Henry Aldrich to figure out.

00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:35.920
 [Music]

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:39.920
 And now getting back to the troubles of Henry Albers.

00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:43.920
 Henry has undertaken the management of a wiener roast at McCorkle's Rocks.

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:48.920
 And when a truck ran over his bicycle, he swung the boys around to going in cars.

00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:51.920
 Now Henry can't get a car.

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:55.920
 And his attempts to raise money for taxis seem to have backfired.

00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:58.920
 The scene opens in the Aldrich living room.

00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:01.920
 It is six o'clock the same night.

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:03.920
 Homer, what do you mean by that?

00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:05.920
 Lock the doors, Henry, lock the doors.

00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:06.920
 Why, Gee, what?

00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:10.920
 The kids are all on their way over here to your house, and boy, are they men.

00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:11.920
 What are they coming over here for?

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:16.920
 They're all going to punch you in the nose and take their wingers over to Willie's backyard

00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:17.920
 and eat them.

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:20.480
 I thought everybody was getting money for taxis.

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:21.880
 Well they were.

00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:26.440
 Only everybody got confused and our father started phoning each other and now they've

00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:28.160
 all decided to clamp down.

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:29.160
 But why?

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:34.800
 Well as near as I can figure out, it's because your father says boys our age shouldn't borrow

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:35.800
 anything.

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:36.800
 Oh boy.

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:40.040
 Well, frankly, Homer, I'm kind of tired.

00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:42.840
 I don't mind a bit having a whole thing over at Willy's.

00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:44.200
 Trouble is him.

00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:45.040
 What?

00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:46.320
 You're not invited.

00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:47.240
 What?

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:49.240
 I'm not invited!

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:51.040
 After all I've done?

00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:52.640
 That's why you're not invited.

00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:54.120
 [LAUGHTER]

00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:56.080
 Look for me.

00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:58.200
 See, that's the thanks you get.

00:16:58.200 --> 00:16:59.720
 Well, wait a minute.

00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:01.600
 Homer, listen, I just got an idea.

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:03.760
 Can we take my advice and forget it?

00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:06.800
 Look, when the kids get here, you stall them, see.

00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:08.720
 Don't let them get near the weiners.

00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:13.420
 And in exactly half an hour they're going to get the biggest surprise of their life!

00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:23.720
 [Music]

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:26.220
 Gus, is there any way we could hurry with this?

00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:29.720
 No, you can't hurry, a sensitive horse like Sheila Henry.

00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:31.720
 Not when it comes to hitching her to a hay wagon.

00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:36.220
 I know Gus, but at 6'15" go on Sheila back out!

00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:38.900
 Henry, it won't get you anyplace pushing her.

00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:40.180
 You have to talk to her.

00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:41.180
 Yeah?

00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:43.340
 Sheila, listen, I'm talking to you.

00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:47.140
 It's 6'15, and the kids won't wait much longer.

00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:50.060
 Beck, we go, Sheila, baby.

00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:51.700
 Beck, up to the nice wagon.

00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:54.220
 I sure appreciate you're doing this for me, Gus.

00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:57.340
 Boy, wait till the kids here that are having a hayride out

00:17:57.340 --> 00:17:59.020
 to McCorkle's rocks.

00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:01.700
 But I'm not the one doing your favor, Henry.

00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:02.540
 Sheila.

00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:03.540
 It is?

00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:04.380
 Yeah.

00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:05.940
 You don't know what this is costing her.

00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:07.940
 She's allergic to hay, you know.

00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:08.940
 Is that right?

00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:09.940
 Yeah.

00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:11.940
 Well, baby, she's got hay fever.

00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:12.940
 [LAUGHTER]

00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:13.940
 There it is, Sheila.

00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:15.940
 Now let's put your honeycomb.

00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:17.940
 Well, could I be taking care of this?

00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:18.940
 Yeah.

00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:19.940
 That's the bit, Henry.

00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:21.940
 It goes in her mouth.

00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:23.940
 Oh, yeah, sure.

00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:24.940
 Here, Sheila.

00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:26.940
 Open your mouth.

00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:28.940
 You'll have to drive a real carpool in me.

00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:31.940
 She's a regular bundling her overnight.

00:18:31.940 --> 00:18:32.940
 She is?

00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:34.940
 Well, if she seems unhappy,

00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:38.700
 She brought something along to give her something she loves.

00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:39.700
 What is it?

00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:41.940
 The other half of my father's maroon tie.

00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:49.940
 [Music]

00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:55.740
 Sam, I wish you wouldn't bolt your supper like that.

00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:57.700
 I'm not bolting, I'm just in a hurry.

00:18:57.700 --> 00:18:58.700
 Did you wrap up the book?

00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:01.100
 Yes, dear, and I patted it with brown paper.

00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:02.940
 It's on the hall table.

00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:07.260
 I still wish you'd face Mr. Clark like a man instead of sneaking over there.

00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:10.260
 Not as long as he gets his book back. He doesn't care how it gets there.

00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:14.700
 I still don't approve of you just tossing the Roman Empire up on his front porch.

00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:16.380
 What's that?

00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:18.700
 Don't worry folks, it's only me.

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:20.940
 Homer, what are you doing at that window?

00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:24.100
 I'm not coming in, Mr. All. Which I'm just scouting.

00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:26.700
 Where's Henley? Have you heard from him?

00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:29.940
 No, Homer, but he said he'd be back here by 630.

00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:32.100
 Homer, all the boys still on the front porch?

00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:36.740
 Yes sir. Why don't you have them wait inside? In a hole with Henry spots of

00:19:36.740 --> 00:20:01.940
 lieners right there on the table. Hey, Homer, where are you? No. What do you mean? Sam isn't it grand? What is? The way Henry has managed this entire affair with all the boys leaning on him. Why with his capabilities he might, he might even. Yeah. Sam, I wouldn't say this.

00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:03.740
 for anybody else but

00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:05.500
 just think

00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:08.340
 president all

00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:10.620
 that's going just a little far

00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:14.220
 i don't know if you got the proper guidance and help

00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:17.500
 for instance and i do think you should have let him have your car tonight

00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:20.820
 nonsense at least if i'd let Henry my car he wouldn't have had the satisfaction

00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:23.780
 of working this thing out for himself i know when you have to hear he said he

00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:26.820
 had a solution to the whole transportation problem that's true when he

00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:29.660
 works it out the boys will respect him for it and so will i

00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:30.700
 Why suppose so?

00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:33.380
 That's just that I understand boys better than you do.

00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:35.500
 Now where's that history of the Roman Empire?

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:36.700
 I'd better get over to the Clark's.

00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:39.500
 What's all that racket?

00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:41.500
 Let's open the door and see.

00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:45.380
 We want to know.

00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:48.540
 Now listen, you can at least take your hats off.

00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:50.820
 Who cares about Henry?

00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:51.820
 Where's Henry?

00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:53.700
 Wait, am I good to speak to him?

00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:55.220
 You speak to him, Alice.

00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:55.980
 Where's my book?

00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:56.580
 Oh, there.

00:20:56.580 --> 00:20:57.740
 Send us not your book.

00:20:57.740 --> 00:20:59.340
 That's Henry's box of weiners.

00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:01.340
 Oh, then this is the book.

00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:03.340
 This woman goes like a wiener.

00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:05.340
 Hey, now look boys, let's pour this.

00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:07.340
 Let's pour this back.

00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:09.340
 Don't tell them they'll link to them.

00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:11.340
 Then come back here, you understand boys?

00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:13.340
 Hey, here.

00:21:13.340 --> 00:21:16.340
 Boys, boys, listen to me.

00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:28.840
 Hello?

00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:30.140
 Is that you mother?

00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:32.040
 Henry, what all of this happened to you?

00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:34.040
 Oh, the boy, everything.

00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:37.140
 Oh, the boys are right here in the living room waiting for you.

00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:37.940
 They are?

00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:38.940
 Oh, gee whiz.

00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:43.540
 I explained to them that you were working out a way to get them all out to Macaulco's rocks.

00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:46.740
 And dear, they were so excited they forgave you for everything.

00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:48.340
 Mother, that's the whole trouble.

00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:50.340
 They were going to have a hayride.

00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:52.340
 Only now they're not.

00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:53.140
 Why not?

00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:55.540
 Well, I was driving Sheila down Walnut Street

00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:58.020
 And she was as peaceful as can be when...

00:21:58.020 --> 00:21:59.020
 Bang!

00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:00.020
 Well, what happened?

00:22:00.020 --> 00:22:04.880
 All of a sudden a fellow with his coat collar turned up and is hacked down over his eyes

00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:07.580
 dashed right in front of Sheila and threw something.

00:22:07.580 --> 00:22:08.580
 Yeah?

00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:11.700
 And the first thing I knew there was hay all over the place.

00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:14.660
 I was in the gutter and Sheila was headed for home.

00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:15.660
 Oh my goodness.

00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:21.660
 And look, mother, would you mind packing a suitcase and sending it over to Anne Harriet's?

00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:22.660
 Goodnight!

00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:23.660
 Why all those issues?

00:22:23.660 --> 00:22:27.900
 I'm just going to stay here a couple of weeks till the air clears.

00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:29.800
 No, there you can't do that.

00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:30.760
 Ah!

00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:33.360
 Henry, your father just came in. I'll talk to him and call you back.

00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:34.860
 Okay.

00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:38.160
 Sam, what on earth is that all over your coat?

00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:39.460
 Hey.

00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:40.560
 Hey.

00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:41.460
 Hey, Alice.

00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:47.460
 I just thrown the book up on the Clark's front porch when out of a clear sky I was nearly killed by a horse.

00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:49.460
 You mean it was you?

00:22:49.460 --> 00:22:50.560
 What?

00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:53.560
 Sam, old rich, do you realize what you've done?

00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:58.740
 What I've done when you ran in front of that hay wagon you upset Henry's whole apple card

00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:01.380
 Alice would you please explain what you were talking about?

00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:08.320
 Just this time if you don't do something to help Henry. We'll never be able to face his friends again

00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:24.060
 Alice, I'm exhausted.

00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:26.960
 Here you are, dear. I brought your slippers down for you.

00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:28.240
 Thank you.

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:31.000
 But I'm too tired to lean over and put some on.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.840
 Now, Sam, it wasn't really as bad as that.

00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:37.440
 Alice, that's a long drive out the Macworkel's rocks.

00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:42.140
 Well, I do think you could have taken the boys out there without making two trips.

00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:47.420
 There is a law, Alice, that says you can't take 14 boys in one car.

00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:49.480
 They aren't very big boys.

00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:50.580
 Now, Alice.

00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:56.580
 Well, the main thing is that Henry and his weiners and his friends are all out at Macaukel's rocks.

00:23:56.580 --> 00:24:00.080
 I'm sorry you're tired there, but I'm glad that Henry's happy.

00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:05.580
 Seems to me that it should have been a simple thing for Henry to arrange a wiener roast without running into all that trouble.

00:24:05.580 --> 00:24:09.580
 He did his best, Sam. He may have made a few little mistakes.

00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:11.580
 That's just it. He should learn not to make mistakes.

00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:15.580
 By one little mistake, and all to the whole course of the world.

00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:19.080
 Yes, dear. Oh, did I tell you, Mrs. Clark, phone while you were out?

00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:22.080
 Mrs. Clark, she didn't see me today.

00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:25.080
 Oh no, they wanted us to come over and play bridge this evening.

00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:27.580
 What's that? After all I've been through?

00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:30.580
 I knew you'd be tired, dear, so I said no.

00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:31.580
 Good.

00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:33.580
 I invited him over here instead.

00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:37.580
 Over here? Alice, why did you do that?

00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:41.580
 The last thing in the world I feel like doing is playing bridge with the Clark.

00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:44.580
 Oh, you'd better answer the phone, Sam. I'll have to start on the refrain.

00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:48.580
 But Alice, that's a fine thing.

00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:50.580
 Hello?

00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:52.580
 Hello there, Miss Dornridge. This is one o'clock.

00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:53.580
 Well...

00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:56.580
 Hello Walter, I hear we're playing bridge tonight.

00:24:56.580 --> 00:24:57.580
 Yes!

00:24:57.580 --> 00:24:58.580
 Well, I'm delighted.

00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:01.580
 Well, look Sam, would you mind if we brought along the refresh?

00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:03.580
 Oh, now that won't be necessary.

00:25:03.580 --> 00:25:05.580
 We'd really like to. You see earlier this evening, some stranger

00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:07.580
 tossed a package up on our front verandex.

00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:08.580
 What's that?

00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:11.580
 And when we opened it, it turned out to be a box of winners.

00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:14.580
 Winners? You mean...

00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:16.580
 Oh no!

00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:35.580
