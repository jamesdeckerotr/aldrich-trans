 The Aldrich Family, written by Clifford Goldsmith and starring Ezra Stone.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 Entertainment for All the Family brought to you by Postam,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 attempting wholesome drink for All the Family. Postam.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 Friends, before we join the Aldrich family,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 I wonder if I could put something squarely up to each one of you

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.640
 who has trouble getting to sleep at night.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.120
 Would you be willing to make a simple test that should show whether coffee keeps you

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.120
 awake?

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.160
 Mind you, it may not be coffee, for there's no question that many folks can drink it without

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.200
 losing a minute sleep.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.600
 But if you suspect it is coffee that keeps you awake, the way to check on it is to drink

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.440
 postum instead.

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.560
 You see, postum contains no stimulants, nothing that could possibly rob you of sleep.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.680
 So it stands to reason if coffee is the cause of your sleeplessness, switching to postum

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.440
 will settle the point. Now why not try it? Drink fragrant flavor for post-em

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.520
 instead of coffee. Give it a fair trial, say for two short weeks, and see if you

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.760
 don't honestly enjoy good sound sleep again, and along with that, see what a

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:47.360
 perfectly swell mealtime drink delicious tempting post-em really is.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:02:09.520
 There's an old saying that claims you're young only once, but you can prolong that

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.920
 youth, and the best way to do that is to share the experiences of Henry Aldrich.

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.960
 He'll take you right back to your own teenage days

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.780
 Tonight Henry is visiting Nancy Adams one of his favorite classmates

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:30.800
 Nancy tell me honestly. What is it you like about Bill Turner? I don't know Henry. I just like him. Don't you sure?

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.000
 I guess Bill's all right. That's a loud Henry. I hear you

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.440
 How would he hear me he's out in the front hole and I like him only hey Nancy

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.360
 Oh, she was I ever tell you about the time I dove off the top of the boat house

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.360
 I didn't even know anybody could climb up that high.

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.360
 Oh, it's easy.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.360
 You know that flagpole down at the end of the lake?

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.360
 Yes.

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:50.360
 Oh, I dove off that one.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.360
 Nancy, how's your mother?

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.360
 She's better, Henry.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.360
 She just strained her back a little.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.360
 Boy, that was some luck I had in the game Saturday.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.360
 Boy, remember when those three guys tackled me

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.360
 and I carried them right across the goal line for a touchdown?

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.360
 That was just wonderful, Bill.

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:05.360
 I don't see how you stood up.

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.360
 Nancy, what make radio is this?

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.360
 I don't know my father bought it.

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.640
 father bought it. You know Nancy when I pull those three fellas across. Yeah. I heard a

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:23.080
 good radio program the other day. It was about a milkman. Boy was it funny. Yeah go on.

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:31.080
 Well it was just awful funny. Boy I darn near left my head off. Yeah. Henry could you

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.920
 Sure, well I'm not.

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.440
 Wait a minute Henry, I'll open it.

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.040
 Well that's alright Bill, I've got it practically.

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.240
 Practically.

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:41.800
 Huh, is it stuck a little Henry?

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.840
 No it isn't stuck, I just...

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.440
 Could you stand back please Bill?

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:46.520
 How am I in the way?

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.520
 I want to get my elbows out.

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.520
 I'll add a little further.

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.240
 Here let me show you how to open it.

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:55.440
 Now look out Bill, all I have to do is...

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.760
 Nancy would you mind if I push this sofa away?

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:58.560
 No Henry.

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.880
 Don't get up, I'll push you along.

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:01.880
 A lot.

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.680
 She was who opened that window.

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:04.980
 I did.

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.420
 You know I thought I had it started.

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.040
 I just should have kept at it.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.520
 Anything else you want done Nancy?

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.720

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.880
 You stay right where you are Bill.

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.160
 Sure you don't need any help lifting the bottles.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.160
 Now Bill.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.400
 You'll find everything out there on a tray Henry.

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.200
 All you have to do is put some ice in the glasses.

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.760
 I'll be right back.

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.400
 Listen Nancy, what do we have to have him around for?

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.400
 But I like Henry.

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.800
 What do you suppose that is?

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.000
 Well, I don't know. Nancy, isn't there any way of getting rid of him?

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.000
 This evening?

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.200
 What does he ever say?

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:37.400
 Bill.

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.600
 My goodness, Henry Aldrich is one of the nicest people I've...

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:45.200
 Excuse me, Nancy, but is there any special way of getting your ice trays loose?

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:49.200
 Well, my mother never has any trouble. All she does is pull and they come right out.

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.600
 Oh, isn't that strange? I'll be right back.

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.600
 Nice guy. I'd like to see him come out for football practice some afternoon.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.200
 Bill, you just don't understand, Henry.

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.660
 No. Say about the dance Friday night.

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:01.460
 What about it?

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:02.840
 What time shall I...

 Yes, Mother?

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.200
 I don't believe Ray's football down there.

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.400
 No, Mother. Henry's getting some ice.

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.800
 I'll pick everything up, Nancy.

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.600
 Does your mother have a good big screwdriver?

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:27.100
 Henry, what is that all over your coast?

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:28.000
 Why, you're...

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.800
 I'm pretty sure it's tomatoes juice.

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:30.960
 Get out of the way.

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.860
 Come on, Nancy. I'll get the ice out.

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:35.040
 I think you'll want something to get it loose with, Bill.

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:36.460
 What's the matter with my hands?

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:38.200
 Well, be careful where you walk.

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:39.500
 Henry, oh, do I--

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:42.240
 Well, I didn't know that wire basket would come all the way out.

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.040
 What did you want to take it out for?

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:45.880
 So I could spread my elbows.

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:47.280
 Yeah.

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:50.040
 Here, Nancy. Well, one tray of ice be enough for you.

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:51.920
 Gee, had I loosened it that much?

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:55.160
 Nancy, you know what we were just saying about Henry in the living room?

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:55.800
 What?

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:56.920
 Well, don't you remember?

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:00.920
 Now Bill, you know Nancy I think I better be going.

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:01.920
 Is there a way Henry?

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:06.920
 Well I've got a lot of homework to do and I think I better.

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:07.920
 Oh.

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:08.920
 So long Henry.

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:20.920
 Sure for the dance.

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:22.920
 Henry I didn't promise to go with you did I?

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:23.920
 Why sure?

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:24.920
 Why sure?

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:25.920
 You didn't?

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:28.920
 I don't see how I could have. I'm going with Bill.

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:30.920
 Oh. With Bill?

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:32.920
 Well, I'm terribly sorry, Henry.

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:35.920
 I guess you just must have misunderstood me.

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:37.920
 I'll go to the door with you.

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:40.920
 No. You go back and have your ginger ale.

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:42.920
 I can find my way all right.

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:44.920
 Well, I hope you understand, Henry.

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:47.920

 There you are.

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:06.920
 Why didn't he go?

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:08.920
 Well dear, that's what I don't know.

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:11.920
 You remember the other evening when Henry came home from Nancy Adams?

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:12.920
 When?

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:13.920
 Last week, dear.

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:14.920
 A couple of nights before the dance.

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:19.680
 He walked into the house and went right straight up to his room and it didn't come down again all evening

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:23.380
 And Sam Henry hasn't been himself since then. Did you have a talk with him?

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:26.640
 Yes, and all he'd say was he felt dancing was a waste of time

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:29.640
 Mary come in here and eat your breakfast

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:32.280
 Henry's doing upstairs

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:36.280
 What is he doing? He's putting on his best suit again, and that's the fourth day in a row

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:42.000
 He's wanted to school. Well dear Henry explained all about why he had to wear his best suit. Is this male for me?

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.000
 Yes, dear.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.500
 Why does he have to wear it?

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:47.700
 Well, he says the class may have their picture taken any day this month,

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:50.000
 and they just aren't sure which day it's going to be.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
 And so he wants to be prepared.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
 Well, my goodness, what's this letter all about?

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.000
 What letter?

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
 Certainly the most absurd thing I've ever seen.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
 It must be for father.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.000
 May I see it, please?

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
 Who is it, from, Sam?

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:08.000
 From the National Institute of Muscular Development, Incorporated.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000
 Dear Mr. Ulrich, are you a man or a mouse?

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
 I knew all the time, it wasn't for me, Father.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:22.000
 Yes. Are you a man or a mouse? We assume it is the former, otherwise we would not have received your recent inquiry.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:33.000
 No man can make his mark in the world, no man can inspire the love of a good woman, unless he is willing to develop his inner potential strength and enroll in our 26-week course.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
 Sam, what in the world are you reading?

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
 I don't know, Alice, but I'm fascinated.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
 In case you do not care to sign for the full 26 weeks,

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
 we can offer a shorter course for the busy executive

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
 who is interested in only partial development.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
 Remember, decide now.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
 Sam, when did you write for that?

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
 May I see the envelope in which this arrives?

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
 It's right here, Father.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
 Oh, my goodness, it's addressed to Mr. Harold, Aldrich.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.000
 Who's he?

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.000
 I have no idea.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
 But he's a man or a mouse.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000
 Well, put the letter in the envelope, please. It's probably for Henry.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
 Mother, why would he want to develop?

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000
 I don't know, dear. And besides, it's none of our business. Please put it back in the envelope.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000
 Well, well, I think I walked to the office this morning.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
 Well, Sam, you haven't walked to the office in six years.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000
 Of course I have. I walked a couple of times just this last summer. It made me feel great.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
 I'll go get your coat for you, Father.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
 A coat? A coat? Why would I want a coat?

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
 Well, I can leap get your hat for you.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.000
 Goodbye, Alice.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
 - Are you leaving? - Goodbye, child.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
 Goodbye. Mother, do you have any ideas to where my best tie is?

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
 Your best tie? No, dear. Sit down and eat your breakfast.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
 But, Mother, I've got to find it.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
 There'll be plenty of time to find it after you've eaten.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
 Now, please sit down. I want to ask you something.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.000
 What about?

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.000
 What in the world is the trouble?

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
 The trouble? The trouble? Do you think I don't know of any trouble?

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000
 But you want yourself, dear. When anyone speaks to you, you're way up in the air.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
 I'm not up in the air, Mother. I may be a little upset this morning

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.960
 this morning because I can't find my blue and white tie, but otherwise I feel fine.

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:02.360
 Then why not eat your breakfast?

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:03.360
 I'm going to eat.

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:04.360
 I'm going to eat.

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:07.160
 How's Nancy Adams these days?

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:08.800
 Nancy Adams' mother.

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:11.280
 Well, I asked, is how is she?

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:12.440
 You see this book here, mother?

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:13.440
 You see this book?

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:14.440
 Yeah.

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:17.040
 Well, that gives you an idea of how little interested I am in her.

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:18.120
 What about it?

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:20.280
 I borrowed it from her two weeks ago.

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:21.280
 Well.

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:22.280
 And now I'm returning it.

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:23.280
 That's fine.

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:24.280
 I'm returning it.

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:25.280
 I'm returning it.

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:26.280
 But that's all.

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:27.280
 I go.

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:28.880
 Would you like some butter on your toes?

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:29.880
 No, thank you.

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:31.280
 I'll have you know this mother.

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:33.880
 She asks me whether I'd like to keep it and finish it.

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:35.880
 I'll tell her I'm not even slightly interested.

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:37.080
 That's fine, dear.

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:37.880
 Now drink your milk.

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:38.880
 And do you know what else?

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:39.380
 What?

00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:39.980
 That's all right.

00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:40.680
 Never mind.

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:43.080
 But if her folks can't afford a better ice box

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:46.480
 than the one they have, do you like Bill Turner?

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:47.780
 Bill Turner.

00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:48.780
 I hardly know him.

00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:50.180
 Gee, he's got a lot to learn.

00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:51.180
 He just goes around.

00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:52.280
 Do you know what he says?

00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:53.780
 Henry.

00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:55.280
 What's your ambition in life?

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:56.800
 My ambition, Mary, what do you mean?

00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:57.300
 That's all.

00:10:57.300 --> 00:10:59.580
 I just wondered whether you wanted to be a man or a mom.

00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:02.240
 Now listen, Mary, I haven't any time for a small talk.

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:04.160
 Have you seen my blue and white tie?

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:06.480
 No, but I'd love to see your chest expansion.

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:08.320
 Now, Mary, that's what I say, Mother.

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:10.160
 But, Mother, all I was going to ask him was,

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:13.040
 is he going to take the short course of the 26-week course?

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:13.540
 Of what?

00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:15.440
 Mary, will you please give Henry that letter?

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:16.120
 What letter?

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:17.960
 I don't think it's for you, though, Henry.

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:20.120
 You certainly didn't write to the National Institute

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:22.480
 of Muscular Development Incorporated, did you?

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:23.080
 Yes.

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:23.600
 No.

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:24.640
 Yes.

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:26.440
 Listen, Mary, where did you get that letter?

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:27.680
 You just said it wasn't yours.

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:29.920
 Now listen, Mary, that's United States, Mary.

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:32.280
 Mary, mother, it says right here on the envelope.

00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:33.960
 Maybe open for inspection.

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:35.640
 Mary, give me that letter.

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:37.240
 Are you Mr. Harold Aldrich?

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:39.320
 No, yes, no.

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:41.280
 Now listen, Mary, you come back with that.

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:42.920
 Children, stay out of the living room.

00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:44.200
 We won't break anything.

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:46.000
 I'm just helping Henry develop.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.080
 Now listen, Mary, you're only going to make me late for school.

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:51.280
 Do you want to take a video to show to Nancy Adda?

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:53.840
 Mary, if you breathe one word about that to her, I'll--

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:56.840
 Mary! Mary, come back down here with that!

00:11:56.840 --> 00:12:10.560
 Is there a class in this room next period, Homer?

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:11.560
 Sure.

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:14.840
 Why are all those questions you're filling out, Henry?

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:17.120
 Nothing, Homer. Nothing important.

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:20.240
 It's just some information I've got to send away.

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:23.600
 Could you measure my calf once more, please?

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:25.600
 It's pretty hard with this ruler.

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:31.600
 Well, just go around me real slow.

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:33.600
 It's...

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:35.600
 14 exactly.

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:37.600
 14 for my calf?

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:41.600
 Gee, was my ankle was 14 too?

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:42.600
 It was?

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:44.600
 Yes, Homer, and I don't want to mislead anyone.

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:46.600
 I don't want them to send me...

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:49.600
 Listen, Henry, what is it you're sending for?

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:50.600
 Nothing, Homer.

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:52.600
 Gee, why would I...

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:55.200
 whether Nancy Adams has a class here next period.

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:56.800
 - I thought you were ignoring her.

00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:57.640
 - I am.

00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:59.700
 That's why I'm waiting to return this book.

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:02.680
 When I give her this back, it's going to end everything.

00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:04.940
 - Well, let me see that letter just for a second.

00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:05.780
 Will you please?

00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:06.620
 - No, Homer.

00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:08.400
 - What is this question at the bottom mean?

00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:09.320
 - What question?

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:11.440
 - Do you have flat feet?

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:12.840
 And you wrote in yes.

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:13.800
 - Now listen, Homer.

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:14.800
 - Well, what did it say then?

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:16.080
 - Keep quiet, Homer.

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:17.600
 Miss Watson just came into the room.

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:18.440
 - Miss Watson.

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:20.480
 - Well, boy, you certainly look busy.

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:21.880
 - We are Miss Watson.

00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:23.480
 You working on your biology?

00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:25.800
 Well, in a way we are.

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:27.400
 Well, isn't that fine?

00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:29.840
 You know, we're going to start working on mice next week.

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:31.480
 We are?

00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:32.200
 On mice?

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:32.760
 Yes.

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:36.120
 We're going to compare their development with that of man.

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:37.360
 What's that?

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:38.080
 Come on, Henry.

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:40.320
 That's the end of the period, and there's a class coming in.

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:41.040
 Hello, Henry.

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:42.400
 What are you doing in here?

00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:44.640
 Well, I'll tell you, Nancy.

00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:46.240
 I've been waiting.

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:47.480
 I've been filling out--

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:50.080
 Henry, you're getting ink all over yourself.

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:50.920
 I am?

00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:54.720
 Well Nancy, I just wanted to tell you how much I enjoyed this book.

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:58.320
 Well I'm awfully glad you returned to Henry Cudd. Bill Turner's anxious to read it.

00:13:58.320 --> 00:13:58.920
 He is?

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:00.620
 Are you sure you threw it with it?

00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:02.220
 Oh yes.

00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:07.420
 After all, even if I weren't through with him, well naturally, if Bill wants to read it...

00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:09.320
 Where have you been for the last week?

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:11.820
 Just around. Just around.

00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:13.720
 Hey Henry, come on!

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:16.720
 You go on ahead Homer, I may be held up here a second.

00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:17.520
 Quietly!

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:18.920
 You better go Henry.

00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:22.000
 I just wanted to tell you though how much I enjoyed your book.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.320
 Henry Aldrich, don't you and Homer Brown have a class this period?

00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:27.640
 Yes, Ms. Watson, I'm on my way right this minute.

00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:28.640
 Bye, Henry.

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:29.960
 Goodbye.

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:32.200
 Henry, let me have a look at that letter, will ya?

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:32.800
 What letter?

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:34.160
 About your flat feet.

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:36.520
 Now, Homer.

00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:37.920
 Listen, Homer, where is that letter?

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:39.080
 I haven't got it.

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:40.880
 But, Homer, I put it in this English book.

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:42.800
 I put it in this English.

00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:44.800
 You suppose I put it in Nancy's book?

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:45.800
 Why would you do that?

00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:46.720
 I didn't know I did.

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:48.680
 I was talking to her and I just stuck it in there.

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:50.440
 Well, come on, you can't go back now.

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:51.640
 Oh my, I gotta get that letter.

00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:52.140
 Why?

00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:52.800
 My name's on it.

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:53.880
 Do you think I want a thing like that

00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:55.520
 to be read publicly by Nancy?

00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:57.600
 Well, you certainly can't get it now, Henry.

00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:58.920
 Maybe they haven't started yet.

00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:00.480
 Well, I'm not going in with you.

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:02.200
 I don't want that whole class to look at me.

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:03.920
 Keep quiet, Homer.

00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:06.440
 Will you all get it out your pencils, please?

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:07.920
 [GRUNTS]

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:10.680
 Miss Watson, I'm sorry to interrupt your lesson like this,

00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:13.320
 but I just returned Nancy to a book.

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:16.920
 I mean, Nancy's desk has something in it I'd like.

00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:17.420
 I want.

00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:18.360
 I mean, need.

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:21.520
 Is it anything you can't do without the rest of the period?

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:23.520
 Yes ma'am, I have to have it.

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:26.520
 Well, if it won't take more than a second, you may go to a desk and get it.

00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:27.580
 Thank you, Ms. Watson.

00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:31.000
 In the meantime, will all of you be copying what is on the board here?

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:31.800
 Nancy.

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:33.720
 Henry, what on earth is it you want?

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:35.760
 I'd like to borrow that book again.

00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:38.960
 Henry didn't have to come all the way back into the class and embarrass me.

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:41.200
 But I just happened to remember.

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:42.200
 I haven't finished it.

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:43.680
 I thought you had finished it.

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:45.880
 So did I, and so I got out.

00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:46.960
 Yes, Ms. Watson.

00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:47.760
 Here, Henry.

00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:48.760
 Thanks.

00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:50.760
 Henry, may I ask good books?

00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:51.760
 That is.

00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:52.760
 This book?

00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:53.760
 I just got from Nancy.

00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:54.760
 Yes.

00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:56.760
 Well, it's just a book.

00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:59.760
 What is the title?

00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:01.760
 Murder on the third floor.

00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:05.760
 That is the book you were in so much of a hurry to get.

00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:07.360
 Well, I'll tell you.

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:08.760
 It isn't the murder I'm so angry.

00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:10.760
 May I have the book, please?

00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:11.760
 The whole book?

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:12.760
 The whole book.

00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:13.760
 Well, couldn't I just...

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:14.760
 Please do not open it.

00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:15.760
 No?

00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:16.760
 May I have it, please?

00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:19.760
 And I should like to see Nancy Adams immediately after class.

00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:20.760
 But Miss Watson...

00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:22.760
 Please leave the classroom.

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:24.760
 Yes, Miss Watson. I'll go.

00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:50.260
 Well, Henry may be a man, but it's easy to see how he'd feel like a mouse if that letter gets around.

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:56.460
 So let's hope that it doesn't, and if you will, turn to something that should get around, something that all of you should know about.

00:16:56.460 --> 00:17:03.960
 You really owe it to yourself and to your family to find out what a swell treat it is to enjoy a good hot cup of postum with your meals.

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:09.160
 For I can promise you if you haven't tried postum, you have a very pleasant surprise in store.

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:12.080
 because postum really hits the spot, sugar and cream with

00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:14.720
 who suit your taste, and you have a cup of pleasure

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:16.480
 overflowing with goodness.

00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:18.440
 The goodness of postums inviting a aroma

00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:20.480
 and irresistible flavor.

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:23.280
 Just don't expect postum to taste like coffee anymore

00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:25.960
 than you'd expect coffee to taste like tea.

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:28.000
 For naturally, postum is different,

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.960
 and it's that very distinctiveness of flavor

00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:33.120
 that gives postum its special delightful appeal.

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:35.920
 Yes, folks, is a good hot meal time drink for all the family,

00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:37.720
 for even the youngsters at the table.

00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:41.160
 You'll agree that no drink is quite so good as Postam.

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:44.400
 So fill everyone's cup with it and see if I'm not right in saying,

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:47.440
 it's flavor that puts the "Mm" in Postam.

00:17:47.440 --> 00:18:02.400
 Now getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldrich, Henry has decided that he needs a course in physical development.

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:06.080
 After filling out the rather intimate questions on the application blank,

00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:10.160
 He discovers that he has left the blank in a book belonging to Nancy Adams.

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:13.240
 The scene opens in Henry's school at the close of the period.

00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:17.200
 Listen, Henry, this will make two classes I've missed just because of you.

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:21.560
 Homer, all you have to do is just walk into Miss Watson's classroom, pick up Nancy's book,

00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:22.720
 and walk out with it.

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:24.680
 Are you sure Miss Watson isn't in there?

00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:25.600
 No one's in there.

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:27.400
 There isn't a soul in there.

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:29.240
 Why don't you go in and get it?

00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:33.520
 Well, gee whiz, Homer, I was going to stand here in the doorway and keep watch for you.

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:37.680
 Well, if anyone does come along, Henry, don't speak. Just clear your throat.

00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:39.040
 Sure, I'll just sort of cough.

00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:41.920
 Okay. Nobody's coming, Homer.

00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:46.760
 That's it. Just walk right along as though you own the place.

00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:48.960
 Which book is it on to take?

00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:50.560
 The one your hand is on.

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:51.960
 This isn't it?

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:53.600
 Well, it must be there, Homer.

00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:55.360
 Well, come here and show it to me.

00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:58.480
 All right. Wait a second. I'll close the door, partway.

00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:00.960
 If it was here, it would be here.

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:04.440
 Homer, I'm almost positive Miss Watson didn't take it with her.

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:05.760
 All right, show it to me.

00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:07.840
 Well, gee, was it a book with a blue cover?

00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:09.240
 A blue cover? Blue?

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:10.500
 Yes, I will.

00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:12.000
 Henry, someone's out in the hall.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:12.600
 Well, I'm glad you were.

00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:14.000
 Quick, Homer, we're all we done.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.360
 Get down here beside her desk.

00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:17.760
 Did they come in, Henry?

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:19.640
 No, they just closed the door.

00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:22.640
 She was a locked it.

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:23.880
 They locked it.

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:27.200
 You mean we're locked in and I can't get to solid geometry?

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:29.640
 Well, at least they didn't see us, Homer.

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:32.640
 But Henry, I'm weak and geometric as it is.

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:35.940
 Well, all we have to do is climb out that window, Homer.

00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:39.140
 Well, what good will that do? We're way up on the third floor!

00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:53.140
 Nancy, could you take these keys down to the main office, please?

00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:54.140
 Yes, Miss Watson.

00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:59.140
 And Nancy, if you are quite sure you won't let this book interfere with your studies anymore, you may have it.

00:19:59.140 --> 00:20:00.140
 Yes, Miss Watson.

00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:05.940
 After all, Henry Aldrich has much more important things to attend to in school than reading mystery stories.

00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:06.840
 Yes, Miss Watson.

00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:08.640
 He's a very nice boy, Nancy.

00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:10.840
 At least he has his good points.

00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:16.540
 But I do wish you'd become more interested in someone who takes things just a bit more seriously.

00:20:16.540 --> 00:20:24.340
 Be careful, Homer.

00:20:24.340 --> 00:20:26.440
 Do you want to knock me off this fire, Skyn?

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:29.040
 She was Henry, we've got to get off of here somehow.

00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:31.640
 Sure, and I suppose you want to go down to the bottom and jump.

00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:35.640
 Don't you realize this fire escape goes right past first and second floor classroom?

00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:36.940
 He's quiet, Henry.

00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:39.540
 Suppose somebody should come back in the Miss Watson's room.

00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:41.140
 Let's close the window we came through.

00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:42.940
 Then if anyone does, they won't hear us.

00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:44.940
 Easy now, Henry.

00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:46.940
 I'm being quiet.

00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:49.440
 That's it, make all the noise you can.

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:53.440
 Homer, all we have to do now is go up the fire escape to the roof.

00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:54.240
 And then what?

00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:56.740
 Well, it's bound to lead to something, Homer.

00:20:56.740 --> 00:20:58.200
 Come on, have you got Nancy's book?

00:20:58.200 --> 00:20:59.240
 Sure, here take it.

00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:00.240
 Is my letter in it?

00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:01.540
 I don't know.

00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:03.000
 Hey, Homer, what'd you take this for?

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:04.000
 Why?

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.240
 This isn't Nancy's book.

00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:08.720
 Gee whiz, it's Miss Watson's report book.

00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:09.760
 Her report book?

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:12.080
 What made you think my letter would be inside that?

00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:14.000
 He said blue, so I grabbed blue.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.080
 Well, you should have looked, Homer.

00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:17.200
 If we get caught with that, we could even be expelled.

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:18.400
 Just for having a report book?

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:19.520
 Sure.

00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:22.440
 Well, you can be the one that takes it back, Henry.

00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:23.480
 I'll take it back, Homer.

00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:25.480
 All I have to do is open the window again.

00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:26.980
 Be sure no one's in there, Henry.

00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:28.480
 No one's in there.

00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:29.480
 She whiz.

00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:31.480
 All you have to do is lift, Henry.

00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:33.480
 I am lifting.

00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:35.480
 Get away so I can spread my elbows.

00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:36.480
 Does it open?

00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:39.480
 Let me try once more.

00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:41.480
 Well, what's the matter, Henry? You weak.

00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:43.480
 She whiz, maybe I do, Nick.

00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:48.480
 Wouldn't you think I could at least open a window when it's an emergency?

00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:50.480
 You're certainly in the nice fix.

00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:54.480
 Nice fix. You've got Miss Watson's reports and Nancy's got your measurements.

00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:58.980
 Sure, and probably by this time Nancy's read the whole thing. Come on, pull Homer.

00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:01.980
 Boys! Boys, what are you doing up there?

00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:03.480
 Who is it, Henry?

00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:04.980
 What are you doing up there?

00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:07.480
 Mr. Bradley, he's down in the courtyard.

00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:08.480
 Boys!

00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:12.480
 Why? Why, we're just trying to open a window.

00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:15.480
 Don't you know the rules about going out on the fire escape?

00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:18.480
 Are there any special rules, Mr. Bradley?

00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:19.480
 What are your names?

00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:22.860
 Why I'm Henry Aldridge. Oh, Homer Brown

00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:28.860
 Henry and Homer all rich and brown yes, sir

00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:34.080
 Will you please report in my office at once yes, sir?

00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:36.520
 How would you like to have us get there?

00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:43.500
 Any way you can't well the only trouble is mr. Bradley that nothing will get down

00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:50.500
 (music)

00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:52.500
 Hey Nancy, wait Nancy!

00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:53.500
 I've got to go to class Bill.

00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:54.500
 What's that book you've got?

00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:55.500
 Murder on the third floor.

00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:56.500
 Let me read it, will you?

00:22:56.500 --> 00:22:58.500
 Henry Olderch hasn't finished it yet Bill.

00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:01.500
 But I've got a study period and I've got to have something to read.

00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:02.500
 Bill, turn it you give me that book!

00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:03.500
 I won't hurt it!

00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:05.500
 Bill, let me have it! Please Bill!

00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:07.500
 Bill, bring it here!

00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:17.500
 [Music]

00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:22.500
 And now then, class, the first question is, what is the comparative?

00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:23.500
 The comparative?

00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:25.500
 You get the window open, Henry?

00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:26.500
 Sure.

00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:28.500
 May I ask what this means?

00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:30.500
 Oh, excuse me, Mr. Van Wie.

00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:33.500
 Do you realize you literally are breaking into a Latin class?

00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:36.500
 But this is the only one on the fire escape we could get open.

00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:39.500
 And Mr. Bradley wants us right away, we think.

00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:41.500
 Well, get out of the room quickly to can, please.

00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:45.500
 Yes, sir. Now then, plaz, what is the comparative of bonus?

00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:47.500
 - Oh, me? - No!

00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:59.500
 About how long have you been a student in this school, young man?

00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:01.500
 About three years, Mr. Bradley.

00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:03.500
 And these are the young men?

00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:05.500
 About three and a half, Mr. Bradley.

00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:08.500
 Well, that wasn't an account of the mums right on top of the measles.

00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:10.500
 I see.

00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:14.500
 Then you both know those fire escapes were placed on this building for emergency use only.

00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:16.500
 Well, the fact is, Mr. Bradley.

00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:19.500
 Mr. Bradley, I have some papers here that were just picked up in the third floor hall.

00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:20.500
 What are they?

00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:23.500
 Well, they seem to be some sort of a physical education report.

00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:25.500
 Uh, just post them on the bulletin board, please.

00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:27.500
 Well, Ms. Shea, could I...

00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:28.500
 Could you...

00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:30.500
 Is that by any chance my paper?

00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:31.500
 Yours.

00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:32.500
 Yes, ma'am, it might be mine.

00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:33.500
 How much do you weigh?

00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:36.500
 132 pound. Well, this is not yours.

00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:40.500
 Well, have any others been picked up lately? I mean, around 132.

00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:42.500
 They have not.

00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:44.500
 Homer, must you lean on my desk?

00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:48.500
 Oh, no, sir. Excuse me. I thought you were through with us.

00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:50.500
 I don't know what gave you that impression.

00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:53.500
 Excuse me, but could I interrupt you, Mr. Bradley?

00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:54.500
 You're a built-turner, aren't you?

00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:57.500
 Yes, sir. I'm the one that carried three men over our gold Saturday.

00:24:57.500 --> 00:24:59.500
 What were you sending here for?

00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:04.500
 Well, I don't suppose I should have been reading this book during study hour, Mr. Bradley.

00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:05.500
 What's the title?

00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:06.500
 Murder on the third floor.

00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:07.500
 Murder?

00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:08.500
 Well, G.

00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:09.500
 Well...

00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:10.500
 Henry?

00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:12.500
 Yes, Mr. Bradley.

00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:17.500
 What do you think of a boy who would spend his time reading a book like that?

00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:20.500
 Well, I guess it's pretty bad, Mr. Bradley.

00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:21.500
 That's what I say.

00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:24.500
 Do you know what I think all three of you boys need?

00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:25.500
 No, sir.

00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:26.500
 Suppose you wait here, all of you?

00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:27.500
 Wait here, all of you.

00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:29.500
 Well, I step out and get your records.

00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:30.900
 Yes, Mr. Bradley.

00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:34.380
 Well, Henry, you aren't worried about anything, are you?

00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:36.260
 Listen, Bill, could I borrow that book a second?

00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:37.100
 Nancy's book?

00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:39.060
 All I want to do is take it for one second.

00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:40.100
 What for?

00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:41.060
 I just want to--

00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:42.660
 Bill, can't you even let me look at it?

00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:43.820
 Keep your hands off it.

00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:44.940
 Look what fell out of it.

00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:46.500
 There's your letter right on the floor.

00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:47.500
 Oh, Gee whiz.

00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:49.620
 Hey, Bill Turner, you take your foot off that.

00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:50.340
 You make me.

00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:50.900
 Do you hear me?

00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:52.460
 Take your foot off that letter.

00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:53.500
 Henry, somebody's coming.

00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:54.220
 I don't care.

00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:55.160
 Mr. Bradley, Mr.

00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:57.800
 - She whizzed Henry. - Hello Nancy.

00:25:57.800 --> 00:25:58.740
 - Close the door.

00:25:58.740 --> 00:25:59.660
 - Let go of my leg.

00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:01.260
 - You lift your leg, do you hear me?

00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:02.100
 Lift it.

00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:02.940
 - Boy stop it.

00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:04.160
 - Lift his leg Henry.

00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:05.440
 - She whizzed.

00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:07.740
 - Hey Bill, quit your twisting my head off.

00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:08.580
 - Yeah.

00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:09.660
 - Bill Turner, you stop that.

00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:10.840
 - Don't you, Bill.

00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:14.140
 There.

00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:15.140
 - Henry.

00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:16.140
 - She, Henry.

00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:17.980
 Did you knock him out?

00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:18.820
 - Oh boy.

00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:22.140
 - She, you lifted him right off the floor.

00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:24.220
 - Hey, what hit me?

00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:26.680
 He's all right, Henry. Pick him up before Mr. Bradley comes in.

00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:28.680
 Come on, Homer. Let's lift him onto the couch.

00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:30.960
 Listen, Aldrich. What did you hit me with?

00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:33.640
 I just used my bare hands, didn't I, Nancy?

00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:36.100
 Well, then, young man. Turn up.

00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:38.600
 Does anyone invite you to lie down on that couch?

00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:42.920
 No, Mr. Bradley.

00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:44.620
 I'll help him up, Mr. Bradley.

00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:46.520
 Don't you think he can get up himself?

00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:48.160
 - Well... - I'm up.

00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:49.060
 Well, young lady.

00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:51.100
 Let's watch an athlete to bring her keys down here.

00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:53.800
 Thank you. Turn up. Here's what I want you to do.

00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:57.360
 I want you to spend a part of each lunch hour for the next ten days,

00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:59.480
 picking up the papers in the halls of this building.

00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:00.840
 On all three floors?

00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:02.800
 On all three floors.

00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:03.940
 And as...

00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:06.240
 How did Miss Watson's report book get here on my desk?

00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:07.640
 On your desk, Mr. Bradley?

00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:08.960
 Nancy, will you see that she gets it?

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:09.480
 Yes, sir.

00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:10.600
 Orich and Brown.

00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:11.480
 Yes, Mr. Bradley.

00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:12.560
 Yes, Mr. Bradley.

00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:13.560
 Orich!

00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:15.040
 What is that you're tearing up?

00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:19.960
 Why, it's just a sort of a letter that I've decided I won't need to send away.

00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:22.960
 It so happens that the gym instructor needs a couple of huskies,

00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:27.440
 such as you two to go down each afternoon and help him move the steel lockers move

 Henry Aldrich will be back in just a moment.

00:27:57.280 --> 00:28:01.280
 In the meantime, remember there are two big reasons why you like Postam.

00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:08.280
 You like it if coffee keeps you awake, and you'll love it as a good hot meal time drink that all the family can and will enjoy.

00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:10.680
 I want to ask your grocer for a post-dom.

00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:13.440
 (dramatic music)

00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:19.620
 - Henry, you suppose you could open the window, please?

00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:20.460
 - Sure.

00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:21.720
 - Here, I'll pull on one end with you.

00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:23.260
 - She was, I don't need any help, Nancy.

00:28:23.260 --> 00:28:24.660
 Do you think I'm a weakling?

00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:27.340
 - Oh boy.

00:28:27.340 --> 00:28:30.080

 The Aldrich family starring as Rustone is written by Clifford Goldsmith.

00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:51.780
 Original music is composed and conducted by Jack Miller.

00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:56.480
 This is Harry Vanzel saying, "You will enjoy fragrant, flavorful postum.

00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:59.060
 And remember, postum contains no stimulants.

00:28:59.060 --> 00:29:00.820
 It cannot keep you awake."

00:29:00.820 --> 00:29:01.220
 Good night.
