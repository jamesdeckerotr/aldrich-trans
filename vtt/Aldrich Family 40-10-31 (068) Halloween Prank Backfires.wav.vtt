 The Albright family, written by Clifford Goldsmith and starring Ezra Stone.

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.760
 Henry! Henry Albright!

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:17.960
 Coming, mother!

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.960
 [Applause]

 [Music]

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:45.960
 You know ladies and gentlemen scarcely a day passes that doesn't bring us a letter from some housewife praising Jell-O better scotch pudding.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.960
 Many of these letters read somewhat as follows.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.960
 I've tried just about every ready prepared pudding on the market.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.960
 And jello butterscotch pudding is the one for me.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.960
 Other letters, of course, speak of how easy jello butterscotch pudding is to make,

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.960
 because you simply add milk, cook for a few minutes, and cool.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.960
 And still other letters tell us how grateful housewives are

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.960
 for the many ways you can serve jello butterscotch pudding.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.960
 But the big point is its flavor, the warm buttery brown sugar flavor

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.840
 sugar flavor of creamy, golden butterscotch.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.840
 Just the way you like it, full of rich homemade goodness.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.960
 Yes, friends, you like yellow butterscotch pudding a lot, so just try it.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.220
 And let your own taste tell you why yellow butterscotch pudding is the pudding that thousands

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:28.880
 call the best of all.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:45.880
 [Music]

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.880
 If your doorbell rings tonight, when you answer it and find no one there,

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.880
 you remember that this is Halloween and that you too were a chance for yourself.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:01.880
 And you might suspect Henry Aldrich of having something to do with the prank, because he's a real boy from your own neighborhood.

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.880
 Tonight we find Henry in the Aldrich living room with his friend Toby.

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.880
 Gee whiz am I bored?

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:10.880
 Same here, Henry.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.880
 How could a thing like this happen, Toby? A Halloween in the two of us are dead broke.

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.880
 Gee, I thought I'd never lived to see a thing like this happen.

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.880
 Wouldn't you think, Toby, that there'd be at least one thing a person could do on Halloween without its costing money?

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.200
 money. That's what you'd think. How about going over and getting even with Mr.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.880
 Tarbell for what he did a year ago? How? Well we could think of something. I'll tell

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.320
 you what. If we could get his front steps loose from the porch we could hide them.

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.640
 No, tell me. But Henry, then when he comes out and starts to go down the steps you

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.480
 wonder where they are. Who will wonder where what is? Oh is that you father?

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.560
 You're not going to touch anyone's front steps. How do you know about that? I'm

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:51.960
 I'm psychic.

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:55.360
 Halloween or no Halloween, you boys are not to touch any private property.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.760
 Henry, are you in the living room?

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:57.960
 Yes, mother.

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:58.960
 She was father.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.360
 Toby and I don't want to just sit around and look at each other all evening.

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.060
 How would you like to have me make some candy?

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.960
 Mother candy.

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:10.060
 Everybody else is out doing things and we sit home and make candy.

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.860
 Well, if you'd planned ahead, you'd have enough money to go to a den.

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.060
 I did plan ahead.

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.060
 I told you several weeks ago that my allowance is an adequate.

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.060
 Yes.

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:23.060
 Henry, what do you say we'd get our hats and go out for a little stroll?

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.060
 All right.

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.560
 You aren't going to play any practical jokes on anyone, are you?

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.060
 Oh, oh no, Mr. Olvich.

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.060
 We're just going out for the fresh air and maybe ring one or two doorbells.

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.060
 Henry, you're not going to ring any doorbells.

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.060
 But, Mother, what harm can come from innocently ringing just one doorbell?

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.060
 That's wrong 50 million times in the year anyway.

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.060
 Because most people don't like it.

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.060
 Henry, the minute you begin to trespass, you're liable to run into trouble.

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.460
 They're named one thing that could happen from sticking a pin into a doorbell

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:55.120
 Aside from the fact that it's going to ring for a while. I'm not going to argue

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:02.600
 Probably I don't think I'll go out. No wall here ever since way back. I've been looking forward to tonight

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:06.160
 And now it's here and I can't even stick a pin in a doorbell

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.740
 Sam if Henry didn't actually stick a pin in it couldn't he ring just one bell?

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:16.480
 It's entirely up to you, Alice. All we do is ring it and run father. Don't look at me, son

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:21.400
 I'm only your father. I don't see what fun that could be in at least my whole year wouldn't be ruined

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.820
 Well, could you ring a bell when no one is home?

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.520
 mother

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:33.700
 Right if it'll make you any happier go out and ring one bell we can father we can't just told me come on

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:37.140
 Okay, I don't see what fun you'll get brother at least we can say we've done it

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:44.000
 Henry I've got an idea what my folks didn't say I couldn't ring more than one. I'll tell you

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.300
 I'll do the ringing and you do the running.

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.800
 Okay, let's ring Mr. Edwards's bell first.

00:04:48.800 --> 00:05:02.800
 [MUSIC]

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.140
 John.

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:06.800
 John Edwards, are you out there on the porch without any hat on?

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.200
 I am.

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.100
 I was just out to look at the car.

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:11.900
 Someone has taken the battery out of it.

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:13.900
 You suppose you could have done a thing like that?

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:15.900
 Oh, some Halloween hootlem.

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.900
 I tell you, Phoebe, this town has reached a nice state of affairs.

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.900
 Well, come in and close the door before you catch pneumonia.

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.900
 You know what I think I'll do.

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:26.900
 I'll just wait inside the door and see whether anyone comes back.

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:28.900
 I'll get my cane too.

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.900
 The next boy that comes up on this porch is going to get the tanning of his life.

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:32.900
 Yes, dear.

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.900
 Toby.

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:36.900
 Toby.

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:37.900
 What?

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:39.900
 He's going in.

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:40.900
 Come on up on the porch.

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:46.800
 What were they talking about Henry search me? Let's write a note and pin it to the door. Okay. Got a pencil?

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.800
 No, here's my fountain pen

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:54.240
 Listen Toby. Let's just ring the bell and run. Let me ring it. No Toby. This is the only one I can ring

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:59.560
 You can ring the next one. No besides mr. Edwards was my idea. Here we go Toby. I'm gonna ring it

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:04.380
 Do you hear anyone coming?

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:06.840
 No, I'd better ring it again

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:11.600
 Run Toby run I am

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:17.100
 Quick Toby talk around the stock the house. I'm with you. I'm with you. Hey stop

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:21.100
 Oh boy, oh boy, what's that?

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:27.220
 I'm all right. Just knocked over an ash can come on. I care for this great lover

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:30.440
 There goes mr. Edwards over

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:31.940
 Toby

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:33.940
 Help

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:39.180
 I'm went out through these trees Toby if he catches you Henry don't give you a right name whose name should I give

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:43.740
 Take one off. What was that? That was Mrs. Edwards.

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:47.420
 Look, Toby, here's a hole or something we can hide in.

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:49.180
 Yeah, where? Right here in the ground.

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:51.180
 Oh, she was way too big. What's the matter?

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:52.540
 It's an old wall. It's an old well.

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:55.180
 Well, this is a nice time to tell me.

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:55.980
 What's the matter?

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:57.580
 I dropped my fountain pen in it.

00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:00.460
 Toby, he's coming.

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:01.020
 Poured us.

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:04.620
 He went right on.

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:06.060
 Boy, that was close.

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:07.660
 Let's be determined and get out of here.

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:09.660
 What, Henry, I dropped my fountain pen.

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:10.660
 That's so important.

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:12.360
 My mother just bought it for me.

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:15.160
 She whizzed, I can't go home without my fountain pen, Henry.

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:16.460
 How are we gonna get it?

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:18.660
 It's way down at the bottom of the wheel.

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:20.160
 Well, there's an old chain here.

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:22.660
 It's hanging right straight down.

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:24.160
 Is it fastened here at the top?

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.160
 Sure. Right to this piece of iron.

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:28.160
 Wait a second, I'll roll up my trousers.

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:30.660
 You better take the morph toby, then you won't get them wet.

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:32.660
 Sure, and hold my coat, too.

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:33.660
 John!

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:34.660
 John!

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:35.660
 Hey, what is it?

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:36.660
 Did you find it?

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:37.660
 Go on, kid.

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:39.160
 Toby.

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:41.160
 Did you look in the kid out beyond the well?

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:42.160
 I'm just coming from there.

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:44.160
 Well, come back in the house, man.

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:47.160
 Oh, I can say, here's they must have disappeared right into the ground.

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:49.160
 It's okay, Toby. You can go down now.

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:52.160
 Look out while I go over the edge.

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:53.660
 Are you sure you can get up again?

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:57.660
 Why not? All I have to do is hang on to this chain and climb right up the side.

00:07:57.660 --> 00:07:59.660
 So long, Henry.

00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:01.160
 Hang on.

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:03.660
 Hang on, tight old boy.

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:05.160
 Gee, where's...

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:06.160
 What's the matter?

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:07.760
 So what's the matter?

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:10.560
 There's something tied part way down on the chain.

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:11.360
 What is it?

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:13.260
 It's an automobile battery.

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:14.560
 A battery?

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:16.260
 What's it doing down there?

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:17.360
 How should I know?

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:19.160
 And the chain ends right here.

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:20.260
 We're done?

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.060
 Can you jump the rest of the way?

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:23.460
 What do you mean jump?

00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:27.560
 It's so dark down here I wouldn't know when I got to the bottom.

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:28.660
 Oh, here's the trouble.

00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:29.860
 It's up here.

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:32.460
 Some of the slack is hooked onto a bolt.

00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:34.060
 I'll see whether I can lose to it.

00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:35.860
 Let it out easy, Henry.

00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:39.360
 Don't worry, Toby. You don't think I'd let you fall, do you?

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:44.860
 Toby.

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:46.360
 Oh, Toby.

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:48.360
 Toby, where are you?

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:50.860
 I thought you were my friend.

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:53.460
 I couldn't help it.

00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:55.160
 Toby, can you float?

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:58.060
 How can you float in four inches of water?

00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:00.960
 Well, did you get your pen and come on up?

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:03.860
 You're crazy. There's nothing to take a hold of.

00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:05.740
 - Fan on the battery and reach.

00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:07.060
 - I can.

00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:09.340
 - Well, G-Tobe, I'll have to get you out somehow.

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:11.300
 Wonder whether I can find a ladder anyplace.

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:13.940
 - Ask Mr. Edwards whether he has one.

00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:16.100
 - Sure, do you think I'm crazy, Toby?

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:18.740
 - Well hurry up and get a ladder someplace.

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:20.860
 - Look, there's the lid to the well up here.

00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:21.860
 - Well, what about it?

00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:24.660
 - You want me to put it over the top so you won't get cold?

00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:26.940
 - No, just get me a ladder.

00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:28.980
 - Do you want your pants and coats?

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:30.660
 - Just throw down my coat.

00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:31.980
 - Okay, here it comes.

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:34.380
 I'll get the latter that's in our garage, Toby.

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:37.540
 And if anybody speaks to you, don't answer.

00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:40.120
 (upbeat music)

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:51.820
 - Santa, has Henry come in yet?

00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:52.660
 - Not yet.

00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:53.820
 - It seems as though it's taking him

00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:55.820
 an awfully long time during one doorbell.

00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:57.940
 - Do you realize, Alice, this is the first Halloween

00:09:57.940 --> 00:09:59.460
 no one has bothered us?

00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:00.980
 - Certainly do.

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:02.380
 You put all the H cans in.

00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:03.380
 I put them in the basement.

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:05.580
 What was that?

00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:07.080
 Something out in the back.

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:10.980
 Sam, Sam, it sounds like one of the garage doors.

00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:12.480
 You suppose anyone's getting in there?

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:13.980
 Listen, dear.

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:14.980
 Come with me.

00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:15.680
 Where?

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:17.780
 Let's go out to the kitchen and look through the window.

00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:19.380
 Is the kitchen light on?

00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:20.480
 No.

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:21.780
 I want you to see it.

00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:23.280
 Sam, someone is in the garage.

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:24.480
 Stand back from the window.

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:25.480
 Can you see them?

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:26.880
 That is.

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:29.780
 Someone is coming out of the garage with our big ladder.

00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:30.480
 Sam, who did you?

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:31.520
 I think that's the limit.

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:34.160
 I'm going down the cello stairs here and slip out to the basement door.

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:35.440
 Who might not go out the back door?

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:36.960
 This way I can hit him off in the driveway.

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:37.880
 Shall I turn the light on?

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:39.120
 No, no, don't turn the light on.

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:40.200
 I can see quite all right.

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:41.200
 Hey!

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:42.200
 Hey!

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:43.840
 Sam, what have you done?

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:45.880
 I forgot I put the ash hands down here.

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:48.600
 Well, my goodness, dear, the ash is all over my cello floor.

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:51.040
 Yes, so am I.

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:51.880
 Turn on the light.

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:54.000
 Sam, you better come back up here and get your hat and coat.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.720
 You want whoever it is to get away?

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:57.600
 Is that later more important than your health?

00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:59.000
 Now, come back up here.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:04.280
 All right, if you've already gone out toward the street in a town this size and you can certainly track down someone with a ladder

00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:21.400
 You say the battery was taken right out of your car mr. Edward yes officer, but you didn't see any

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:26.240
 Not until a few minutes later two boys come up on the porch and rang the bell and I chased them right around here through the

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:27.240
 a great barber.

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:28.540
 And were they carrying the battery?

00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:29.840
 Well, I couldn't say.

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:33.640
 Well, whoever stole it is going to be apprehended and punished.

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:36.080
 The young fellows here have got to respect private property.

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:37.880
 Oh, they don't stop at anything.

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:40.760
 I even found a pair of somebody's trousers back here.

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:42.360
 You better take them down to headquarters.

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:43.760
 Why?

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:44.520
 One minute.

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:45.280
 What's up?

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:47.920
 Stand back there under the street.

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:50.720
 You see out there toward the street.

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:51.520
 Somebody coming?

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:53.840
 Somebody with a ladder is coming right this way.

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:57.120
 I know, keep quiet, keep quiet, and when he passes I nap.

00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:02.920
 - Just a minute, dear young man. - Oh, jeez, who said that?

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:05.280
 - One minute, I said. - Yes, sir.

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:08.200
 - Is there something you wanted? - Where did you get that ladder?

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:10.800
 - At home. - I asked you, where did you get it?

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:13.480
 - I brought it from home, sure I did. I give you my word, I did.

00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:16.760
 - Oh, so we're gonna have trouble with you. Where's the battery?

00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:20.120
 - The battery? What battery? - The battery that disappeared from my car.

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:22.800
 - I haven't even seen any battery. - What's your name?

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:25.940
 Why, uh, what is it? It's a...

00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:28.400
 - A hurry. - Harry, what?

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:30.100
 Harry Ambrose.

00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:32.040
 Where are you taking that ladder?

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:32.800
 Well...

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:35.520
 Not any place in particular.

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:37.240
 I just...

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:38.920
 Just happen to be carrying it with me.

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:40.960
 Just giving this a nailing.

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:42.560
 Aye, taking it out for a walk.

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:43.300
 Yes, sir.

00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:46.420
 Well, Mr. Edward, what do you think we ought to do with him?

00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:47.860
 It's, uh...

00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:50.060
 90 days for a large knee in an office.

00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:52.940
 90 days in jail for taking my own father's ladder?

00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:54.100
 That's what it is.

00:12:54.100 --> 00:13:12.940
 Well, but I've got a friend, S

00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:14.740
 Well, suppose you leave that ladder here.

00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:16.540
 But I'll get the duchess, if I don't take it back home.

00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:19.440
 You'll get 90 days, Harry Ambrose, if you don't put it down.

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:20.240
 Yes, sir.

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:21.340
 Now get home with you.

00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:22.640
 It should have been an embedd an hour ago.

00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:25.440
 Yes, only I don't know what my friend will do without me.

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:47.160
 And ladies and gentlemen, this being Halloween, I'd like to tell you a ghost story.

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:52.000
 The story of Edgar the gloomy ghost.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.360
 Edgar, it seems, was very fond of nice desserts at dinner.

00:13:56.360 --> 00:14:02.160
 But his wife, Phyllis the Phantom, kept serving him just ordinary desserts.

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:07.760
 As a result, Edgar went around moaning and groaning like this.

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:23.500
 Then one day Edgar's wife bought some jello vanilla pudding at the ghost to restore.

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:26.640
 And now Edgar is just as cheerful as can be.

00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:29.520
 No longer does he go around moaning.

00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:34.520
 Now he has a warm, likable laugh like this.

00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:38.520
 [Laughter]

00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:41.520
 So, you see, just in case that germite drop in, ladies and gentlemen,

00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:44.520
 always keep jello vanilla pudding on hand.

00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:47.520
 It's rimful of pimping flavor as smooth as rich cream

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:51.520
 and extra good when garnished with nuts, marshmallows, or fruit.

00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:54.520
 My own favorite is jello vanilla pudding with sliced bananas,

00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:56.520
 but served anyway at all, it's bram.

00:14:56.520 --> 00:15:03.520
 Order this delightful ready prepared dessert and start right away to enjoy the luscious flavor of jello vanilla pudding.

00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:18.520
 Now getting back to the troubles of Henry Albridge, if being Halloween Henry and his friend Toby set out to ring just one doorbell and come home.

00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:24.520
 However, one thing leads to another until Toby was left stranded at the bottom of a well.

00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:26.520
 And Henry is attempting to rescue it.

00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:31.520
 Good evening. Oh, is that you out there Henry Alders?

00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:35.520
 Good evening, Mrs. Lockbridge. Could I borrow a real strong rope from you?

00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:39.520
 A real strong what, dear? A rope. I need about 15 feet of very strong rope.

00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:42.520
 Oh, would the be the clothesline help him?

00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:44.520
 No ma'am, I have a friend that's in a well.

00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:46.520
 Oh, look at that, quite a Halloween joke, isn't it?

00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:48.520
 No ma'am, I'm trying to get my friend out.

00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:51.460
 friend out. Well, how did he get in it? He was looking for his

00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:54.420
 fountain pen. Well, why don't you try one of the other houses in

00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:57.180
 the neighborhood? I have, I have, but every doorbell I've rung so

00:15:57.180 --> 00:16:00.140
 far the people chased me. Don't say so. Yes, ma'am, that's how I

00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:02.620
 got a little wet like this. Goodness gracious, how did you get

00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:05.100
 that when? They poured a bucket of water on me from the second floor

00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:08.660
 window. Well, it's common to think of it, Henry. We have a good

00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:11.780
 long toed-up out in the car. You have? Yes, sir. You'll find the

00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:14.340
 car right out there in front. Right down the curb away. That's

00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:17.100
 right. Okay. If I remember, the roast a little bit

00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:20.100
 That's all right. It can certainly hold Hobi.

00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:23.100
 Well, I find it in the front or the rear of the car.

00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:25.100
 You have to look there.

00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:27.100
 Yes, this is the car.

00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:29.100
 Oh, my gosh.

00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:32.100
 That's funny.

00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:35.100
 All right, young fella. What are you trying to get away with?

00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:36.100
 What's that?

00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:37.100
 Did you think I didn't see you?

00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:38.100
 It was like, oh, my car.

00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:39.100
 What were you doing in my car?

00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:41.100
 I've got a friend that's in a well.

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:42.100
 Yeah?

00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:44.100
 But you see, Mrs. Lockbridge gave me permission to open this car.

00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:45.100
 This is Lockbridge did.

00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:46.340
 This is Lockbridge did.

00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:47.000
 It's her husband.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.800
 Well, it just happened to be my car and I live right here in this house.

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:50.400
 You do?

00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:52.500
 You mean this other car here is Lockbridge?

00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:53.980
 And I suppose you're going to tell me,

00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:57.400
 Mrs. Lockbridge gave you permission to let all the air out of my tires.

00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:58.200
 Are they flat?

00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:00.300
 What do you think I was watching out the window for?

00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:02.200
 Well, you certainly have my sympathy.

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:04.200
 [SOUND]

00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:05.000
 Here you are.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:05.600
 What's that?

00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:06.700
 It's a pump.

00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:07.400
 Get to work.

00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:11.800
 But she was, I'd give you my word while I was looking for it with a piece of rope so I could pull my friend out.

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:14.800
 Maybe you'd like to have me turn you over to the police, my boy.

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:15.800
 Oh, no.

00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:17.600
 Are you going to hook that pump onto the valve?

00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:18.400
 Yes, sir.

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:19.300
 What's your name?

00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:23.300
 Well, it's, um, it's, uh, which tire do you want me to pump up first?

00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:24.800
 I asked her your name.

00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:26.500
 It's Harry Ambrose.

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:27.600
 Harry Ambrose, eh?

00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:28.400
 Yes, sir.

00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:30.000
 Well, your family ought to be ashamed of you.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:30.400
 Yes, sir.

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:31.600
 They certainly ought to be.

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:33.800
 I'm going in and keep an eye on you from the house.

00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:37.800
 And don't forget, there's a street lamp right here and I can see every move you make.

00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:38.600
 Yes, sir.

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:41.300
 If I hadn't been a boy once myself, I'd come to open the law.

00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:42.300
 Yes, sir.

00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:44.300
 I'll be with you.

00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:49.300
 I'll be with you.

00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:51.300
 Henry?

00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:54.300
 Henry, is that you popping up those tires?

00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:56.300
 Father, where did you come from?

00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:58.300
 I'm looking for our ladder.

00:17:58.300 --> 00:18:01.300
 And may I first ask you to come back to the house?

00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:04.300
 I'm not going to be here.

00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:06.300
 Henry?

00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:08.300
 Henry, is that you popping up those tires?

00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:10.300

 - You're waiting till I get even with you, Homer.

00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:19.520
 - You got away from him, didn't you, Henry?

00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:21.560

00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:28.480
 - Where did you get it?

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:29.720
 - Isn't it a beauty, Henry?

00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:31.580
 I found it over here on Walnut Street.

00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:33.520
 - What I mean, Homer is who's was it?

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:34.440
 - Nobody.

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:37.700
 We're just roping off a new sidewalk that had been laid this afternoon.

00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:39.780
 Listen Homer, I'm not going to use it.

00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:42.380
 We aren't going to keep it, Henry. It's just to get Toby out.

00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:43.860
 But Homer, I don't think we should use it.

00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:45.420
 All right then. All right.

00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:46.780
 Not so loud, Homer.

00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:47.780
 Do you see somebody?

00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:49.620
 We're right here by Mr. Edwards' house.

00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:52.580
 Oh, come on now, Homer. I'm following back to the well.

00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:54.780
 Why don't you want to disturb Mr. Edwards, Henry?

00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:58.580
 Well, if he's going to sleep, there's no sense in waking him up as then.

00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:00.220
 Come on back through this great barber.

00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:02.620
 I'm coming. Where is the well?

00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:03.620
 It's right ahead here.

00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:05.520
 Someplace.

00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:07.120
 Can't you find it?

00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:09.020
 It's strange.

00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:11.520
 She was done falling window.

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:12.920
 Oh, here it is.

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:14.720
 And Toby.

00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:16.820
 Toby, are you all right?

00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:17.920
 Help me.

00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:19.420
 Who is that?

00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:21.420
 It's Henry and Homer.

00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:24.420
 Well, you're the only one that haven't been here before.

00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:25.620
 Who else has been here?

00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:26.620
 Everybody.

00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:28.920
 And they all threw something down.

00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:33.220
 The last time it was a bushel of apple.

00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:35.620
 Are you all right, Toby?

00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:36.780
 How could I be?

00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:38.120
 Get me out of here.

00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:40.520
 We're letting a rope down now, Toby.

00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:41.820
 Here, Henry, I'll help you.

00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:43.420
 Is it down yet, Toby?

00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:44.120
 No.

00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:44.920
 It's coming.

00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:46.420
 Homer, have you got the end?

00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:47.420
 What end, Henry?

00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:48.120
 Of the rope.

00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:50.120
 The end down here.

00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:53.020
 Witch end.

00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:53.820
 Both ends.

00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:57.120
 Well, she whiz, Homer, if you are in a hell.

00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:58.820
 Toby, throw one end up here.

00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:00.320
 Oh, my God, I do that.

00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:02.320
 Just throw it right straight up.

00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:04.320
 Here it comes.

00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:06.320
 Where is it?

00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:08.320
 Around my neck.

00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:10.320
 Henry, I've got an idea. Look out.

00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:11.320
 What are you going to do?

00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:14.320
 How about dropping this rock down and letting him tie the rope to it?

00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:15.320
 And then throw it up?

00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:19.320
 Now listen. Don't throw anything more down here.

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:21.320
 There isn't any more room.

00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:24.320
 Henry, do you think you could hold my hand while I go down part way?

00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:25.320
 How would you get the rope?

00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:27.320
 Well Toby could tie it to my foot.

00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:28.320
 Sure, and then I'll pull you back up.

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:31.800

 You got it?

00:21:58.160 --> 00:21:59.960
 - Come on, I'll sure I think you're off this way.

00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:00.800
 - I ain't coming.

00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:01.720
 - Oh, she was.

00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:02.560
 - What's that?

00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:03.400
 - Keep quiet.

 Oh boy.

00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:05.060
 Oh boy.

00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:07.640
 (upbeat music)

00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:17.960
 - Gee, if they had come two feet closer,

00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:19.520
 they would have fallen right in with us.

00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:21.080
 - That would have been good.

00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:22.480
 Well, we got you out, Toby,

00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:25.000
 even if we did have a hard time finding my father's ladder.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:29.360
 Toby we got you away from Mr. Edward's house, but I still haven't got any pants Henry

00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:32.920
 Oh, just walk along as though you are coming home from a party

00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:42.380
 Boy is this heavy is what heavy listen Toby. What are you carrying this battery? Well Jean Whiz Toby? What do you bring that for?

00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:44.380
 I didn't even know I had it

00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:47.940
 Well, we've got to take that right back to Mr. Edward all the way sure

00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:52.760
 What do you think we hold it out for we get caught with it? We'll get six months in jail here Homer

00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:54.040
 How would you like to carry it?

00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:54.680
 I don't want it.

00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:55.640
 Let Henry carry it.

00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:57.880
 Toby, don't try to shirk responsibility.

00:22:57.880 --> 00:22:59.640
 Well, you fellas are going to go back with me.

00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:00.720
 I'm not going alone.

00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:01.720
 Come on.

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:03.040
 It was-- who's that come?

00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:03.680
 Where?

00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:04.880
 Down here on the corner.

00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:06.560
 He's coming right toward us.

00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:07.520
 Isn't that a policeman?

00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:08.680
 I think it is, Henry.

00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:10.320
 Let's turn around and go the other way.

00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:11.280
 That's what I say.

00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:11.640
 No.

00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:13.680
 We'll walk right along as though we were heading for a--

00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:14.240
 Rod.

00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:14.760
 Sure.

00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:15.520
 Oh, sure.

00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:18.160
 Our battery ran down and we're going to get it recharged.

00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:20.600
 But I still haven't got any pants.

00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:21.480
 Let's see, fellas.

00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:22.240
 Look ahead there.

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:25.360
 Where? There's another policeman and he's walking right toward us.

00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:26.240
 So long, Toby.

00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:29.040
 Now wait, Henry, you can't leave me flat like this.

00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:30.560
 I've got to get rid of this battery.

00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:31.920
 So put it down someplace.

00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:33.600
 Sure, I'm supposing he saves me.

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:36.080
 I've got an idea. You see that car parked there by the curb?

00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:36.480
 Yeah.

00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:38.880
 We'll put it inside. Just dump it through the window.

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:40.480
 Henry, you've got a head on you.

00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:42.640
 Come on, how will I be? I've been between these two houses.

00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:44.560
 Boy, if they see it.

00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:45.040
 Okay.

00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:45.920
 Wait for me.

00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:47.120
 Well, hurry up.

00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:47.600
 Quiet.

00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:50.480
 Police are going by.

00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:53.480
 Do you think they saw us?

00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:54.480
 No.

00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:55.480
 They're not even looking this way.

00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:56.480
 Say fellas.

00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:58.480
 You know what I just happened to think?

00:23:58.480 --> 00:23:59.480
 What?

00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:01.480
 I left my fountain pen down in the well.

00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:04.480
 - Say, Gee whiz. - What's the matter?

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:06.480
 That car we put the battery in.

00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:07.480
 What about it?

00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:09.480
 Somebody just drove off in this.

00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:19.480
 [Music]

00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:22.480
 [Music]

00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:23.480
 Is that you Henry?

00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:24.480
 Yes mother.

00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:26.480
 Will you please tell me where you've been all evening?

00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:28.480
 Just that with Toby.

00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:29.480
 Fooling around.

00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:30.480
 Well come into the living room.

00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:32.480
 I've got to make a phone call first mother.

00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:33.480
 Hello operator.

00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:34.480
 Then I'll be right there.

00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:36.480
 Operator could you get me?

00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:38.480
 It's right here in the book.

00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:40.560
 It's um, it's Elm 36.

00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:41.360
 Henry!

00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:42.960
 Mother father isn't in yet anything.

00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:43.840
 No, he isn't.

00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:45.200
 Oh, hello.

00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:46.880
 Hello, is this Mr. Edwards?

00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:51.360
 Well, Mr. Edwards, this is to inform you that if you will notify the police

00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:59.760
 to look for a car number T765, I think, or maybe it was T5 something,

00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:02.880
 anyhow, in it you'll find your battery.

00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:04.320
 What's that?

00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:08.320
 This is just a friend, Mr. Edwards, who happened to be passing by your house a

00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:09.580
 little while ago.

00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:10.580
 Henry!

00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:11.580
 Goodbye.

00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:12.580
 Henry!

00:25:12.580 --> 00:25:13.580
 I'm coming, mother.

00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:14.580
 Where's your coat there?

00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:15.580
 I just hung it up in the closet.

00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:17.980
 Well, did you ring your doorbell?

00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:18.980
 Yes, mother.

00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:19.980
 I rang it.

00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:22.580
 Did you find it worthwhile?

00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:30.140
 Well, to be honest, I think I'm getting a little too old to be doing things like that.

00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:31.140
 Where's my Latin?

00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:33.140
 Well, it's Henry in...

00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:34.140
 Yes, Sam.

00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:35.140
 He's sitting here studying.

00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:36.300
 Where have you been?

00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:38.500
 I found the ladder, but not the boy.

00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:40.940
 Then what on earth do you have all of your shoes?

00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:42.540
 That is cement.

00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:43.980
 They laid a new sidewalk over town

00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:45.340
 and didn't even bother to rope it off.

00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:47.500
 Well, don't get it all over the carpet.

00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:49.340
 What do you think I found a few minutes ago?

00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:50.180
 What?

00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:51.820
 A battery in the backseat of my car.

00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:53.300
 (audience laughing)

00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:54.140
 A battery phone?

00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:55.900
 Tomorrow morning, Henry, you call up the police

00:25:55.900 --> 00:25:57.140
 and find out who lost it.

00:25:57.140 --> 00:25:57.980
 I, Father.

00:25:57.980 --> 00:25:58.900
 And then after you've done that,

00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:01.060
 you can go over to Mr. Edwards and get our ladder.

00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:02.620
 Yes, Father.

00:26:02.620 --> 00:26:06.260
 I wonder why people think Halloween is a time for fun.

00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:23.260
 [Music]

00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:26.260
 Henry Aldrich will be back in just a moment.

00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:28.260
 And when you make out the grocery list for tomorrow,

00:26:28.260 --> 00:26:32.260
 be sure to include several packages of jello pudding.

00:26:32.260 --> 00:26:35.260
 They're easy to make, inexpensive, and really delicious.

00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:40.420
 Ask a grocer for all three flavors, yellow chocolate pudding, yellow vanilla pudding, and

00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:42.420
 yellow butterscotch pudding.

00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:46.260
 Yellow puddings are made by the makers of jello, so you know they're good.

00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:47.260
 [Music]

00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:57.260
 The night helps me singing the next week to help.

00:26:57.260 --> 00:26:58.260
 [Applause]

00:26:58.260 --> 00:27:04.100
 Listen in again next Thursday evening to the Aldrich family and to the Maxwell House Coffee

00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:07.800
 time program which immediately preceded on most of these stations

00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:11.480
 a solid hour of sparkling radio entertainment every Thursday night

00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:14.960
 the old rich family starring as the stone is written by Clifford Goldsmith

00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:18.120
 original music is composed and conducted by Jack Miller

00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:23.120
 and this is Harry Vansell bidding you all good night

00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:35.120
 [Music]

00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:40.120
 It's your grocer folks, calling out to let you know about our special this week on Birds

00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:47.120
 Eye Quick Frozen Haddock Phillip. Say what really good Haddock it is too, chalk full of that

00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:52.920
 fresh taste in deep sea flavor, and don't bother to look for any bones, because birds

00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:58.360
 The harak is all clean and bone for you ready for the pain.

00:27:58.360 --> 00:28:01.960
 By birds I harak fillets tomorrow.

00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:05.240
 They're specially low priced all this week.
