00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.160
 Henry! Henry Eldridge!

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.600
 Coming, mother!

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.200

 The Old Rich Family, starring as Rustone,

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.200
 written by Clifford Goldsmith,

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.200
 brought to you by the makers of those delicious new desserts

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.200
 all America's talking about,

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.200
 Yellow pudding.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:01:00.200
 [Music]

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:07.200
 In the town of Centerville, most of the residents are ready for march to come in like a lion and go out like a land.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.200
 But in the Aldrich family home on Elm Street, these traditional animals have been relegated to the background.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:20.200
 For Henry Aldrich has real rabbits hopping around the basement and live pigeons flapping about the attic.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.200
 Our scene tonight opens in Henry's room with Mrs. Aldrich speaking to herself.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.200
 Do you want this broken fountain, Tandya?

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.200
 Yes, Mother.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.200
 You want this piece of lead pipe?

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.200
 Yes, Mother.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.200
 Will you tell me what on earth, Paul?

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.200
 Mother, please, I want everything in my desk.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.200
 That Henry your desk is a sight.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.700
 Let me explain something.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.500
 Right this minute, I'm very busy.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.000
 But the first time I'm not busy, I'll clean it out.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.700
 You've been saying that for six months.

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.900
 But she whizzed when you get through, I won't know where anything is.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.300
 What are you saving this ticket to the World Fair for?

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.600
 I might use it.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.600
 But it's to the Chicago World Fair.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.600
 It was over several years ago.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.000
 Yeah, I know it's to the Chicago World Fair.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 Even if I don't use it, I'd like to have it for a souvenir.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
 What about these three pieces of rock?

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.800
 Mother, I brought all those back from Vermont last summer.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.300
 I carried them back purposely.

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:11.300
 Where did you put them?

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:12.600
 In this lower drawer.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.300
 Well, there's a very good example of what I'm trying to tell you.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.500
 Supposing I should suddenly need those rocks and I'll hurry.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.400
 I'd have to go through everything I own.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.800
 Henry, you're exactly like your grandmother.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.400
 Alice, are you a Henry Drew?

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.200
 Yes, Sam.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.000
 Did you want me, Father?

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.400
 Oh, no, Henry.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.000
 Alice, I realize you wanted the maid for some time

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.900
 and that we now finally have one.

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.500
 But I do wish you'd ask her not to go in that spare room I used to work in.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:38.700
 What happened now?

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.340
 She's just gone through the place like a tornado.

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.180
 She's taken half the things off my desk.

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.300
 Fact is, dear, I cleaned out your desk.

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:47.180
 You cleaned it off?

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.980
 Of course.

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.260
 But what did you do with my pen?

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.780
 I put it in the pen holder.

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:51.820
 Why did you put it there for?

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:55.820
 My goodness, Sam, don't you want Martha to have any respect for us?

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:57.020
 Respect for us.

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:00.060
 After all, are we hiring her or is she hiring us?

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.040
 But dear, she's the only maid I've ever had, and this is her first day here, and your

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.860
 room looked almost as bad as the room Henry keeps his rabbits in down in the cellar.

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.340
 Mother, do we have to tell her about my rabbits?

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.280
 Whether we do or not, Henry, I think you'd better be prepared for the day when she finds

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.280
 them.

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.720
 Well, couldn't you put it up to her?

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:22.380
 Just tell her that if the rabbits will stay in their room, and father will stay in his.

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.140
 Wouldn't she be happy?

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.100
 Incidentally, who changed the blotter on my desk?

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.100
 I did.

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.700
 I didn't want to see it thrown out. I liked that old blutter.

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.900
 All right, dear. Go it down and get it out of the trash barrel.

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.460
 If you want to, you may sleep with it under your pillow,

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:40.940
 but I certainly hope you won't let Martha see it.

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.740
 Unfortunately, it had all my telephone numbers written on it.

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:46.220
 What do you want done with this Canadian penny, Henry?

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:47.900
 I might go to Canada sometimes.

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.940
 Miss Armin?

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.220
 Yes, Martha.

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.140
 Miss Armin, yeah.

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:55.180
 I'm right here, Mother.

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.380
 Miss. All you somebody want you downstairs at the front door.

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:00.380
 Oh gentlemen.

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:01.820
 You saw the resentment.

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:03.760
 Well did you ask him to step inside?

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:04.960
 Yes.

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:08.320
 Miss. Always could I pick up some of your time for something?

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:09.860
 What is it Martha?

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:15.900
 I don't like to complain but frankly when I come to you this morning you said there was only food in the family.

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.400
 Oh no. So there are.

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.600
 But how about all those rabbits down in the cellar?

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.100
 The rabbits Martha?

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.540
 Yes I didn't anybody know they was down there.

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:31.400
 Of course we knew they were down there, but I know that don't you like rabbits my brother kept rabbits once and frankly

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:36.600
 I got awful tired of them, but they don't ever come upstairs and get near way do they not yet

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.200
 But two of them working their way toward the cell of stands Martha

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:45.240
 We're not keeping those rabbits always Henry's simply going to raise them and then sell them very soon

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.880
 You they say here nice. Oh, yes, they like it here very much

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.680
 Yes, sir

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.880
 Right away

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.760
 I ain't gonna stay here with you, Rabbit.

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.680
 Martha. Martha, why don't you look at it this way?

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.840
 You know how lucky a rabbit's foot is.

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.480
 You read it from my brother's head.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.520
 It was always just a lot of weight.

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.680
 How long did you live with your brother?

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.440
 Frankly, just a little while.

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.800
 I tried, but I couldn't get myself adjusted to him.

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.800
 But very few people get to like a rabbit right away, Martha.

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.560
 But once you get to know those I have, you'll say,

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:21.200
 gee whiz thanks Henry for letting me get to know them.

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:24.600
 Well, I finished off the day, but I can't stay any longer than that.

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:28.400
 Look, Martha, is there anything I could give you to make it worth your while?

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:29.080
 Like what?

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:32.400
 Well, I could give you a part of my allowance each week.

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:33.760
 How much would that be?

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.320
 Well, I could give you a 20 cents of it.

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:37.320
 20 cents?

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:40.280
 And I'll do all the work that's in connection with the rabbits.

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:42.280
 Gee whiz, Martha, isn't that a bargain?

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.480
 Frankly, I wouldn't be interested.

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:49.480
 Would you be interested in 20 cents a week in your choice of anything in my desk here?

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:50.280
 What did I?

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:52.280
 Well gee, I got a million things.

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:54.680
 How about a Canadian penny?

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.240
 How many is that?

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.960
 Well, just one.

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:59.440
 But don't let that mislead you.

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.400
 It's only a penny in Canada.

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:02.640
 But here Martha.

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:04.360
 How much is it here?

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:06.280
 Well, I wouldn't want to say.

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:08.360
 (audience laughing)

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:11.600
 In this country, a thing like that is very rare.

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:12.440
 Yeah.

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:13.800
 In fact, that's only the fourth one

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:15.120
 I've ever seen in my life.

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.120
 And you know how long I've been kicking around.

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:18.520
 Whatever you got.

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:19.820
 What else about, well,

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:23.740
 Would you like a piece of genuine Vermont granite, Martha?

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:25.820
 Yeah, just a piece of stone, ain't it?

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:27.220
 Not in Vermont, it isn't.

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:30.020
 In Vermont, that's granite.

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:33.420
 And you can't get better granite unless you want imported.

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:35.660
 You certainly wouldn't want to go to all that trouble.

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:37.220
 You got anything else?

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:39.940
 Well, there's a compass here.

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:41.540
 Only I wouldn't want to give you that.

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:44.340
 It's broken.

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:47.740
 See, Wiz, if you got lost with that, where would you be?

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:49.220
 I don't want to do that.

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:52.300
 Oh, here's something for you, Gee Whiz.

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:52.960
 What is it?

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:55.460
 How would you like a ticket to the World's Fair?

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:57.100
 To the WOOD FAFT!

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:58.260
 Sure.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:06:59.540
 You gon' give me this?

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:01.860
 Of course, if you'll only stay with the rabbits.

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:03.700
 Martha, may I stick with you?

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:05.340
 Definitely miss Aldrich.

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:07.620
 Martha, that visitor downstairs did not

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:08.900
 want to see Mr. Aldrich.

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:10.500
 He wanted to see Henry.

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:11.140
 Henry?

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:12.620
 Somebody is here to see me, mother.

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:14.060
 Come right on up, Tony.

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:14.900
 Henry up here?

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:16.380
 I'm up my room, Tom.

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:17.980
 Martha, is it all safe?

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:20.240
 Well, I say it to the fell!

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:21.800
 Henry, take a look at this.

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:23.520
 What is it? It's the morning paper.

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:24.780
 Not so loud, Tom.

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:26.220
 But it's got the end we put in.

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:27.060
 Yeah, let's see it.

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:28.580
 I'm telling you, Henry, we're gonna make money

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:29.420
 hand over fifth.

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:30.940
 Has anyone phoned your house yet?

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:31.860
 Oh, it's too early.

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:33.580
 But I'm asking you, Henry, who else in town

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:35.580
 would have thought of using carrier pigeons this way?

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:37.340
 Not so loud, I tell you.

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:38.180
 What's the matter?

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:39.500
 I mean, what's the matter?

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:41.660
 We've got a new maid, and she ought to get used

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:43.340
 to one thing at a time.

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:45.660
 (audience laughing)

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:47.340
 Doesn't she like pigeons?

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:49.340
 We don't know yet.

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:51.140
 She doesn't know you've got some up in the attic?

00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:52.640
 She'll find it out, Tommy.

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:54.340
 She'll find it out.

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:56.140
 They're in the room right next to hers.

00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:58.640
 [LAUGHTER]

00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:00.540
 Oh, Henry, is your mother in there?

00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:01.840
 No, she isn't, Father.

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:04.740
 Tommy, fold the paper up quick and stick it on my desk.

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:05.740
 Where'd she go?

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:06.540
 Oh, mother?

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:07.640
 What is it, Dad?

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:11.140
 I dug my old blood around of the trash barrel.

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:14.040
 I also found one of my good shot flies in there.

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:15.940
 I almost hooked myself on that thing.

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:17.580
 every time I go into your desk drawer.

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:19.020
 - You don't know right to go in there, dear.

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:21.460
 That's my drawer and everything in there is mine.

00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:22.460
 - It's all right.

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:23.380
 - Yes, mother?

00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:25.940
 - A part I want to speak to you on the telephone.

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:27.580
 - I'll be right there.

00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:29.500
 - Henry, isn't that the morning paper sticking out

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:30.340
 of your desk?

00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:31.420
 - Oh, that is an R's mother.

00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:32.260
 That's Tommy.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:33.340
 - I'll take it, Mrs. Alders.

00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:35.020
 There's no use bothering you with that.

00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:36.260
 - May I see it, please?

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:37.820
 - Oh, Mother.

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:40.540
 You ever noticed how this piece of granite sparkles?

00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:42.220
 - Henry, I'm looking at the advertisement

00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:43.380
 before I do my shopping.

00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:45.540
 - Well, wouldn't you like to have me look at them for you?

00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:46.800
 I certainly would not.

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:49.380
 Have you noticed the ads on this other page, Mrs. Alden?

00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:50.100
 Over here?

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:51.300
 Yeah.

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:53.340
 Why should I buy a piano?

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:54.340
 I don't know.

00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:56.260
 They say they're good pianos.

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:59.300
 Alice, would you please tell Martha not to call me every time

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:00.060
 the phone rings?

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:01.260
 Who was that call for?

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.340
 Tommy Walsh's mother wants to talk with him.

00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:05.060
 She wants to talk to me, Mr. Orgwick?

00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:05.860
 She wants me?

00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:06.580
 Yes, Tommy.

00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:07.860
 Henry, the first one's come.

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:08.940
 The first one's come.

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:09.940
 What is come?

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:12.340
 I'm message you was expecting.

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:14.580
 Sam, did you see this advertisement?

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:17.580
 I think it might interest Henry too.

00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:20.580
 What's it for, mother?

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:23.580
 A clearance of men's and young men's shoes.

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:25.580
 Shoes?

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:28.580
 Let me say it.

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:30.580
 Here.

00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:32.580
 Henry, are you too warm?

00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:34.580
 Warm, mother? What's the matter with you?

00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:37.580
 I just thought I'd get down and see Tommy.

00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:39.580
 Father, could I have the paper, please?

00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:40.580
 One moment here.

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:42.580
 Alice, did you see this?

00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:45.180
 - What? - Just notice, it says,

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:47.500
 "Carry a pigeon service.

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:51.240
 "Messages delivered to any point in Centerville.

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:55.540
 "Low rates, our birds can make 60 miles per hour

 "under favorable conditions.

 (audience laughing)

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:05.620
 - Sam read that again.

00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:07.140
 - I'd rather not.

00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:10.120
 - Henry, do you still have those pigeons up in the attic?

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:13.120
 Well, less than a dozen, Mother.

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:16.120
 What do you suppose Martha's going to do when she finds them?

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:18.120
 Mother Tommy and I can make some money.

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:23.120
 Henry, you don't imagine anyone is actually going to use any such messenger service, do you?

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:27.120
 Why not? We only charge $0.10 a message and the whole thing's clear profit.

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:30.120
 Do you mean to say, dear, your pigeons can go anyplace you send them?

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:34.120
 Well, I couldn't go so far as to say that, Mother, but they're trained almost that well.

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:38.120
 When Martha leaves, can your pigeons be trained to do the housework?

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:41.580
 Could I keep the pigeons in my room, Mother?

00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:42.580
 No, dear.

00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:43.580
 Henry, may I come in?

00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:44.580
 Yes, Tommy.

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:47.780
 Listen, Henry, Mrs. Persons wants us to deliver a very important message for her.

00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:48.980
 It's all off, Tommy.

00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:51.580
 Tommy, what is the message Mrs. Persons wants to deliver?

00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:53.900
 Well, she didn't say she just said we should come over right away.

00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:57.420
 And may I ask how a pigeon could possibly deliver a message for us?

00:10:57.420 --> 00:10:58.820
 Or it'd be simple, Mother.

00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:01.820
 We've got dizzy Stevens working for us on a commission, see?

00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:06.140
 He takes one of our pigeons over to Mrs. Persons and fastens the message on our foot, see?

00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:07.380
 On to Mrs. Persons?

00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:08.980
 No, under the pigeons.

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:10.340
 How does it know where to go?

00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:11.580
 It comes here.

00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:13.060
 Whether the message is for us or not.

00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:14.740
 Well, this is a relay junction.

00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:16.940
 One of us then detaches the bird from the message,

00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:18.740
 jumps on a bicycle and delivers it.

00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:22.540
 (audience laughing)

00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:25.180
 Sure, sure, that's all there is to it, Mr. Aldrich.

00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:26.080
 You don't say so.

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:27.460
 Could anything be more simple?

00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:29.700
 And where is Mrs. Priscan's all this time?

00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:31.460
 That's the beautiful part of it.

00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:33.900
 Once the message leaves her hands,

00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:35.540
 she can forget the whole thing.

00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:37.300
 (audience laughing)

00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:40.300
 Supposing there's an answer.

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:43.300
 What's that?

00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:45.300
 Supposing there's an answer.

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:48.300
 Well, Mr. Rawd, don't you think that would be an exceptional case?

00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:52.300
 I mean, after all, most people just send a message, and that's all there is to it.

00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:54.300
 Sure, that's what I should think.

00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:57.300
 You know, Martha will never stand for our keeping those pigeons.

00:11:57.300 --> 00:12:01.300
 Alice, what does Martha have to do with it, the boys have an idea here?

00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:03.300
 Don't you want me to keep a name?

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:04.300
 Well, I don't think she should be spoiled.

00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:05.300
 That's what I think.

00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:06.300
 That's what I think.

00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:09.460
 Now, that you explained to Martha what Henry wants to do.

00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:12.020
 Well, if I can't understand it, certainly Martha can.

00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:13.300
 Mother, look at it this way.

00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:14.820
 Henry, there's no use arguing.

00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:16.820
 Martha is not going to like Henry.

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:19.380
 But Mother, Henry, let me talk to your mother.

00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:23.180
 Alice, I don't think what Henry wants to do is going to laugh.

00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:25.460
 But I do think he should be allowed to try it.

00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:27.580
 And I don't see why Martha should be afraid of pigeons.

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:29.540
 Would you like it if a pigeon should get in your room

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:30.300
 in the middle of the night?

00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:31.460
 What harm could it do?

00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:33.380
 Well, I'm sure I wouldn't like it.

00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:34.980
 Where does the trouble seem to be, Henry?

00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:36.380
 No place, Tommy.

00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:38.380
 We just have a temperamental maid.

00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:40.580
 Henry, if you must go through with this,

00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:42.880
 supposing you wait while I have a talk with Martha.

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:45.580
 If you want my advice, don't mention the pigeons to her,

00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:47.980
 and she won't even notice they're there.

00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:50.080
 [SCREAMING]

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:51.180
 What on earth is that?

00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:52.180
 It's coming from the attic.

00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:53.180
 I think it's Martha.

00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:54.480
 She's found the pigeons.

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:57.480
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:13.160
 A week or so ago, ladies and gentlemen, one of our listeners gave a party.

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:16.760
 And a few days afterward she received a note of thanks from one of the guests.

00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:20.880
 Now you've all heard people refer to such a note as a bread and butter letter, but this

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:24.000
 one was a pudding letter because here's the way it read.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:29.000
 Dear Helen, just a line or two to tell you how much Bob and I enjoyed the party.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.000
 It certainly was a big success and we all had our grand time.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000
 Incidentally, the real hit of the evening was that wonderful pudding you served for dessert.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
 Bob keeps asking me to find out how you made it.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
 So why don't you be a good girl and send me the recipe?

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.000
 Love Julia.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
 Well, the next day Helen answered her friend's letter,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
 and if you could have peeked over her shoulder, you'd have read this.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
 Dear Julia, the pudding was called jello orange vanilla whip.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:58.040
 vanilla whip, and I heard about it on the radio, on the program called the Aldrich family.

00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:00.520
 Here's the way Harry von Zehl said to make it.

00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:05.000
 Well first you take one package each of orange jello and jello vanilla pudding,

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:10.280
 and make them up as you usually do. Then chill the orange jello and whip it as directed on the box.

00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:16.680
 Next you chill the jello vanilla pudding and add it to the whipped jello, beating constantly until

00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:22.920
 blended, then mold, and there you have a truly swell dessert, a glorious combination of golden

00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:29.400
 orange jello and smooth, creamy jello vanilla pudding, easy to make and downright inexpensive.

00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:35.320
 P.S., now why not try some yourself friends, and see how soon it becomes one of your special

00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:41.400
 favorites, for rich tangy flavor, for rare distinctive goodness, jello orange vanilla

00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:43.400
 The width is absolutely tops.

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:56.400
 [Music]

00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:59.400
 Now getting back to the problems of Henry,

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:03.400
 the Aldrichs have a new maid who apparently does not like pigeons.

00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:07.400
 The scene opens on the second floor of the Aldrich home.

00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:10.400
 Sam, I've about decided you were right.

00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:15.400
 Well, I don't think we should make Henry get rid of those pigeons, just because Martha doesn't like them.

00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:17.400
 You certainly aren't going to let her go, are you?

00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:18.400
 Well, I thought you said I should.

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:21.400
 Well, that was before she made that beef stew we had for lunch.

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:24.400
 That was the best beef stew Alice. I ever ate in my life.

00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:27.400
 But if we let her have her way on the pigeon, she'll water away on everything.

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:32.400
 It might interest you to know Alice that Martha no longer objects to the pigeons.

00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:33.400
 How do you know?

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:35.400
 I had a little talk with her.

00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:36.400
 What did you tell her?

00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:40.400
 Well, I told her we'd give her a dollar a week more.

00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:43.400
 Sam Olrich, you should never have told her that.

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:44.400
 But I like her stew.

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:50.400
 I still don't believe she's going to stay in her house with something she's scared the death of for only one dollar a week extra.

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:53.400
 Well, if you must know, I gave her something else.

00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:54.400
 What?

00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:56.400
 My chocolatine.

00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:58.400
 She wanted it for a hat ornament.

00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:02.400
 Well, at least I won't be hooked on it anymore.

00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:04.400
 I also gave her a timetable.

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:05.400
 Well, I thought she was saying.

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:08.680
 No, she is until the Chicago world's fairy opened.

00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:11.480
 What year will that be?

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:14.200
 I have no idea, but she's staying until then.

00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:15.120
 Mother!

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:16.240
 Where are you, Henry?

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:18.400
 I'm coming down the attic stairs.

00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:21.960
 Have any pigeons flown in any windows down here yet?

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:23.080
 None that I've seen.

00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:24.200
 That's strange.

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:26.120
 How's your messenger say this wicked?

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:26.920
 Fine.

00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:30.720
 I wonder how you can account for a thing like that.

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:32.520
 You've got to give our bird time, Henry.

00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:34.720
 But babies, the fastest bird we have.

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:36.480
 Nothing seems to have gone wrong, Henry.

00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:37.720
 Oh, nothing, Father.

00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:38.920
 Nothing.

00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:40.760
 Just seems to be a minor delay.

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:44.240
 The only thing that's wrong is we don't know where our pigeon went.

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:46.000
 Of course, maybe Dizzy Stevens hasn't even

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.400
 got her over to Mrs. Persons yet.

00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:48.360
 That's what happened.

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:50.680
 Sure, Dizzy probably took the nickel we paid him

00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:52.000
 and is out blowing it in.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.840
 Come on up back up into the attic.

00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:55.800
 Boys, you haven't forgotten your promise

00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:57.960
 to stay out of Martha's room while you're up there.

00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:00.800
 Oh, we haven't been near her door, Father.

00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:03.440
 Henry, what do you suppose has become a baby?

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:06.600
 She was probably a strong headwind holding her back.

00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:09.360
 But Mrs. Person's only goes a mile from here.

00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:13.680
 Maybe she arrived when we weren't looking and couldn't see that this attic window here was open.

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:15.200
 She can find this house.

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:17.480
 She certainly ought to be able to tell whether a window was open.

00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:20.240
 Tommy, Tommy, take a look outside.

00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:20.720
 And what?

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:22.520
 Look, she's coming 90 miles an hour.

00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:24.480
 That isn't a direction Mrs. Person's lives in.

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:25.440
 What difference does it make?

00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:26.560
 She's coming, isn't she?

00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:29.680
 She probably went around so she could come in on the wind.

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:32.720
 Where is she now?

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:33.980
 She's straight up there.

00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:35.940
 Henry, Henry, I think I can see the message.

00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:38.580
 Father, mother, come up for the landing.

00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:40.700
 Stand back from the wind of Tommy so we don't frighten her.

00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:41.540
 Where is she?

00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:42.380
 She's overhead.

00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:44.540
 She was.

00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:46.140
 She went right by.

00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:49.380
 To where?

00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:51.020
 I don't know.

00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:52.540
 She didn't stop.

00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:53.740
 Just when we need her.

00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:55.980
 As a matter of fact, that might have been some other bird.

00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:58.220
 You know what we need is a parabonocular view.

00:17:58.220 --> 00:17:59.300
 As you landed, Henry.

00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:03.300
 Not yet, Father, it was just an aeroplane or something.

00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:04.900
 A musset's on her way up there.

00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:06.700
 Oh, well, come right up, Martha.

00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:07.900
 Oh, no!

00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:10.100
 A musset wants you to come down and meet her.

00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:12.500
 Sure, I'll escort you up, Martha.

00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:14.700
 Ain't no no pig and loose up there, is it?

00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:16.100
 Gee whiz, no, Martha.

00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:18.800
 Every bird up here is in her own cage.

00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:20.500
 And look, Martha, they won't hurt you.

00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:22.100
 I put my fingers right through the bores

00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:23.900
 and they don't even touch me.

00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:26.500
 Just let me in my room here.

00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:27.900
 There you are, Martha.

00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:29.100
 Close that door.

00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:30.100
 Sure.

00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:32.100
 Henry, take a look out the window.

00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:33.100
 Where?

00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:35.100
 She's right over there on the roof of the next house.

00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:36.100
 Tommy.

00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:37.100
 Tommy, there she is.

00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:38.100
 Hiya, baby.

00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:39.100
 Mother!

00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:40.100
 Mother!

00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:41.100
 Hey, everybody, look outside.

00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:42.100
 Come on, baby.

00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:43.100
 Come on.

00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:44.100
 Martha!

00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:45.100
 Martha!

00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:46.100
 What's the matter?

00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:50.100
 Leave your window open in case baby wants to come in that way.

00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:53.100
 I'm going back to clothing right now.

00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:54.100
 Tommy is baby coming?

00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:55.100
 Here, baby.

00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:56.100
 Here, baby.

00:18:56.100 --> 00:18:58.100
 She just sits on the roof of Mrs. Kilmer's house.

00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:00.100
 Maybe she wants a rest for a minute.

00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:04.100
 After flying just one mile, can you see the message?

00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:05.100
 Sure.

00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:06.100
 What can we? She's coming. She's coming.

00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:08.100
 Yeah, only to the end of the roof though.

00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:11.100
 Well, that's an art direction, isn't it? Her instincts are right.

00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:13.100
 Why? Do you have your bird yet?

00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:14.100
 Where are you, father?

00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:16.100
 I'm here on the back wall.

00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:19.100
 She just flew onto the window sill. Maybe she likes that house.

00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:21.100
 Maybe she thinks we live there.

00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:24.100
 Mr. Aldrich, could you get a stick and poker?

00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:27.100
 There's no stick down here, that log.

00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:31.100
 If everybody would keep quiet a second, maybe she'd come over here naturally.

00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:33.300
 Henry, is she coming?

00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:34.700
 She walked this way.

00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:38.300
 That means she's getting ready.

00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:40.100
 See that?

00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:41.300
 What'd she do?

00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:42.500
 She sat down.

00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:48.500
 Mr. Roar, would you ring the bell next door and ask the people to push her off the window sill?

00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:51.700
 I happen to know the kilmers are out.

00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:55.300
 At a time like this, Father, could you go inside and push her off?

00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:56.600
 I could not.

00:19:56.700 --> 00:20:01.500
 Well, she was the opposed she's going to nest on that window, so maybe she's going to lay an egg.

00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:06.700
 Father, do you see that ladder right there by the side of our house?

00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:09.700
 I do, but I'm not going to climb up it.

00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:12.820
 But she may be gone by the time we get down there.

00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:15.860
 Sam, put that ladder against the house and help the boys.

00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:17.100
 Where are you, mother?

00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:18.580
 I'm down here with your father.

00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:21.260
 I'm not going to climb up the side of Kilmer's house.

00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:24.100
 What was it your idea that the boys would go ahead with this?

00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:27.620
 But I certainly didn't know it was going to lead the breaking in the houses.

00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:30.380
 - Sad. - All right, I'll help them.

00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:33.540
 Well, Henry, send him off his room and tell her it's time to start dinner.

00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:34.500
 Yes, mother.

00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:37.060
 Martha.

00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:38.540
 Martha.

00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:39.700
 What do you know?

00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:42.860
 My mother says it's time to start dinner.

00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:45.020
 You got that fine devil called yet?

00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:49.700
 Martha, if you come out, we'll give you protection to look under the stairs.

00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:51.900
 Martha!

00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:55.180
 Isn't she timid though?

00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:59.460
 Father if you can get baby down I think we can get Martha out

00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:06.760
 You don't say so don't talk to him Henry you want him to fall off that ladder must you mention my calling?

00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:09.460
 Just talk to her father and she'll come

00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:14.880
 What shall I say to her just say here baby come baby here baby?

00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:17.580
 I'm not gonna say anything of the kind

00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:23.060
 Mr. Orgens, if you'll stand on the top wrong and reach, I think it can get her.

00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:24.740
 Stand to fault!

00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:27.460
 Grab her quickly, but carefully, Father.

00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:30.500
 Yes. Is there anyone else who would like to give me a flight?

00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:32.900
 Oh, Gee, look who's opening that window.

00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:35.140
 Was there something you wanted, Sam Orgens?

00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:37.300
 Uh, how do you do, Mrs. Kelsey?

00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:39.940
 Uh, where did the pigeon go?

00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:40.660
 What pigeon?

00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:42.740
 She didn't fly in your window, did she?

00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:43.940
 What are you talking about?

00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:46.100
 My father, he's trying to get a message.

00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:46.820
 To me?

00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:48.420
 No, from a pigeon.

00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:53.320
 Henry, you're not helping that, is it, eh?

00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:56.020
 Mr. Roar, but she's down there on the whim of that tree.

00:21:56.020 --> 00:21:59.520
 Father, all you have to do is move your ladder.

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:03.920
 I'm not going to climb anything more.

00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:06.720
 Sam, if we don't get that baby, we won't have any dinner.

00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:07.920
 I can't help it.

00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:09.340
 What are you having for dinner, Miss.

00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:10.820
 Aldrich, pigeon pie?

00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:15.720
 Alice, if I don't stop now, I'll end by climbing everything in town.

00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:18.000
 Mother, could you climb up the tree?

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:18.900
 No, dear.

00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:20.260
 Could you throw a stick?

00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:21.700
 They're all gonna stick.

00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:24.060
 Could you just toss a stone in her direction?

00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:25.300
 All right, dear.

00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:27.060
 And that's toward me, Alice.

00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:29.260
 Be sure not to hit Baby, either.

00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:30.260
 Here he goes.

00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:31.900
 You're too high, Mother!

00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:34.340
 Who do that?

00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:38.440
 She and Waze Mother duck around the corner.

00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:40.040
 It went through Martha's window.

00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:42.840
 Did not care if you couldn't trust him, that kid, just...

00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:45.080
 And now Baby's flown away.

00:22:45.080 --> 00:23:01.080
 [Music]

00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:03.480
 If you ask me Alice, no maid on earth is worth it.

00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:06.680
 Well, she's just gone up to the attic and she's perfectly happy.

00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:10.920
 Well, she had better be. It cost me three dollars to get Henry to go out of business.

00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:13.640
 Mother? Mother, are you down in the living room?

00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:15.140
 Yes, dear, where are you?

00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:18.760
 Could you come up to the second floor in just a minute?

00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:20.200
 Now, what is it?

00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:22.400
 Martha doesn't want to go up to her room.

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:25.560
 Tell Martha there isn't a pigeon left in the house.

00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:26.240
 No?

00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:28.760
 No, my father made me give them all away, Martha.

00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:29.480
 Yes, Martha.

00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:32.520
 Henry even gave his rabbits away just so you'd stay.

00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:33.720
 I appreciate that.

00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:36.440
 Only I never been up there before in the dark.

00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:37.840
 Who does it like in your room?

00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:40.640
 Not till I get to it.

00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:41.760
 Martha, what if it is dark?

00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:45.160
 As soon as you get to your door, you snap the switch on and there's light.

00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:48.060
 Yeah, Henry isn't afraid, certainly you shouldn't be.

00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:50.060
 Henry, will you go up there with me?

00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:51.160
 Who I?

00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:53.960
 Of course he will. In fact, Martha, if it will make you any happier,

00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:57.960
 Henry will even sit in the chair just outside your door until you get this seat.

00:23:57.960 --> 00:23:58.960
 In the dark, Mother?

00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:00.160
 Of course.

00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:01.860
 I thought you weren't afraid.

00:24:01.860 --> 00:24:03.060
 I'm not.

00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:03.960
 I'm not.

00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:06.760
 I'll open the door to the stairs for you.

00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:08.160
 There you are.

00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:09.760
 Henry, you go in first.

00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:12.360
 Oh, uh, you can go first Martha.

00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:15.560
 Then if anything happens, you know I'm right in back of you.

00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:17.560
 Henry?

00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:18.560
 Henry?

00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:23.760
 Mother, I'll lead the way.

00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:25.160
 Are you coming Martha?

00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:26.160
 Yes.

00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:27.160
 Goodnight.

00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:32.560
 Gee, I didn't realize it was so dark up here.

00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:34.760
 What's that?

00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:37.760
 It's the chair outside your door.

00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:38.760
 There's the light Martha.

00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:40.760
 You gonna sit out here?

00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:41.760
 Sure.

00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:43.760
 I don't mind the dark.

00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:45.760
 Good night.

00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:46.760
 Good night.

00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:49.760
 Mom, are you afraid of this?

00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:51.760
 Martha.

00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:54.760
 What? What you want?

00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:57.760
 Do I have to sit out here like this and very long?

00:24:57.760 --> 00:25:00.760
 You get used to it after a couple of nights.

00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:04.760
 Where did I put my night down?

00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:07.760
 Come over here you little rascal to say good night.

00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:10.760
 Mother, you choose all of us.

00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:15.760
 I like to talk to myself.

00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:21.760
 Now I'm off to turn out the lights.

00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:28.760
 I'm good about this crowd in this room.

00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:32.760
 Henry, Mr. Henry.

00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:37.760
 Well, I'll let you know when I'm asleep.

00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:40.760
 (audience laughing)

00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:45.760
 I guess this place ain't so bad after all.

00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:48.760
 Who there?

00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:50.760
 Who there?

00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:53.760
 There ain't nothing else, Ma.

00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:55.760
 Just like I was still.

00:25:55.760 --> 00:26:00.760
 If Miss Orange is giving her one of our squatter's words in here.

00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:09.760
 They're you buddy in here. Are you all right Martha? They're the eagles in here. Get away from me.

00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:15.760
 Henry where are you? I put my phone downstairs for something Martha. But come back.

00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:20.760
 Turn on the lights. The pigeons they all come back. What in the world is going on up there?

00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:25.760
 Look only one came back. Was enough. And it's baby. It's baby.

00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:27.760
 Sitting right over there on Martha's dresser.

00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:29.760
 She's right on my ticket to the woods, Sam!

00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:34.760
 Mother, mother, you hold Martha while I save baby.

00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:36.760
 What's the trouble here?

00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:38.760
 Martha, what is that rabbit doing beside your bed?

00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:41.760
 I hope you don't mind my keeping just one, Miss Alder.

00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:43.760
 Frankly, I just took the lack of ill fellas.

00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:46.760
 I kind of took the one that keep one all of them.

00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:47.760
 Mother.

00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:49.760
 I just got the message, Father.

00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:53.760
 Mrs. Persons wants a man to hurry over and fix her oil burner this afternoon.

00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:55.760
 You don't say so.

00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:57.760
 Martha, what are you getting your suitcase out for?

00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:01.760
 If you don't mind this all just frankly, I think I'll go.

00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:04.760
 Well, frankly, Martha, we don't mind.

00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:15.760
