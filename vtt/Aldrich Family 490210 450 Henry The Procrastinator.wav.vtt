 [Music]

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
 And now the Jell-O family presents...

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.500
 Henry... Henry O'GRAE!

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.000
 Coming, Mother!

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
 [Applause]

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
 Yes, it's the O'GRAE family based on characters

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.820
 originated by Clifford Goldsmith and starring Ezra Stone as Henry with Jackie

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.960
 Pelka's home. And yes it's the Jell-O family with its three famous desserts.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.400
 Jell-O in those six delicious flavors regular Jell-O puddings with that old

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:48.100
 fashioned homemade flavor and Jell-O tapioca puddings. A miracle of goodness, a

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.100
 A Marvel of Speed

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.100
 Everyone's a Jello Goodfellow

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.100
 A very good Jello Goodfellow

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.100
 So rich, so tempting and mellow

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.100
 J-E-L-L-O

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.100
 And now for the Aldridge Family

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:20.820
 [Music]

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:27.060
 117 Elm Street Centerville is your own house or the house on the next block

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.500
 or that house right around the corner in your memories.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:36.980
 And the important person in and out of it is always a typical teenage boy like Henry Aldrich.

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.820
 The scene opens at the Aldrich breakfast table.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.340
 It is Saturday morning.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.300
 - How long has we have to? - Now, Sam.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:44.980
 - Started out to be such a nice day.

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.820
 The air is brisk, the sun is shining.

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.340
 Why ruin it by discussing Henry's report card.

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:52.940
 - But do you have you seen it?

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:54.020
 - I signed it.

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.500
 - But have you seen it?

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.300
 - You don't think I signed Henry's report card

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:58.660
 with my eyes closed, do you?

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:59.740
 - Yes.

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:00.580
 - How old?

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:01.420
 - If you looked at it,

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.340
 you'd certainly be more upset.

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.580
 And I'm sure we ought to have his basal metabolism taken.

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:07.420
 - That's why.

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:08.940
 - His basal metabolism, Sam,

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.300
 it's at the bottom of a lot of things these days.

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:12.260
 (audience laughs)

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.420
 - Not report cards.

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:14.820
 Alice, there's nothing wrong with Henry

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.500
 that some hard work won't cure.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.500
 You just got to learn to stop procrastinating

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:19.340
 and buckle down.

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:20.340
 - That's right, dear,

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.260
 and I think you should speak to him about it.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.980
 - Yes, Alice, I will.

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:24.900
 Tomorrow.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.220
 - Why can't you do it today?

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.740
 - Alice, the sun is shining, the air is brisk,

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.740
 and it's Saturday, Henry's day of rest.

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.780
 - Sam Aldrich, if you ask me you could do

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.540
 with a little buckling down yourself.

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:42.340
 Henry yes mother come in here please and dear if he has any homework I think you should do it right now

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:48.740
 You were calling on my mother yes dear father has something to say to you he has oh boy

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:56.580
 I'll answer the phone yes father Henry Henry what I want to say is yes

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:02.180
 what I want to say father if it's going out of your head I don't mind dropping the whole thing

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.180
 until it comes back.

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.180
 I haven't forgotten Henry. Sit down.

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.180
 Sit down? But father, yes, father. I'm sad.

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.180
 I mean, sit. They're the seated.

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.180
 Henry, your mother and I have just been discussing your report card.

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.180
 You have? On a nice day like this?

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.180
 I had the same reaction.

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.180
 Henry, don't you think it's about time you buckle down and started to worry about your schoolwork?

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.180
 Gee, I do worry about it, Father.

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.180
 You do? I give you my word. There's nothing I worry about more.

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:30.180
 I'm glad to hear that.

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.180
 But I'd be glad to do a little extra worrying if it would ease your mind.

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:39.020
 That's very cooperative of you, Henry, but there's one method we ought to try first.

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:40.580
 There is what?

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:41.580
 Work.

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:42.580
 Work?

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:43.580
 Yes.

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:47.540
 Father, when you say work, how do you mean that?

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:48.740
 Just the way it sounds.

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:50.420
 Good, hard, industrious effort.

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:53.700
 I want you to buckle down and really put your mind to your study.

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:54.700
 Yes, sir.

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.140
 Now, what homework do you have this weekend?

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:58.140
 This weekend?

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:01.900
 Well, gee, that's a wonderful part, Father. I practically don't have any at all.

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.100
 Not at all?

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.500
 Well, just a few simple geometry problems.

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.900
 And gee whiz, I cannot close off in five minutes.

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.980
 Good! Suppose you take five minutes right now and start knocking.

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:13.780
 Yeah, what?

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.580
 But Father, when I said five minutes, I was thinking of five minutes Monday morning

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:20.420
 when my brain will have a whole weekend's rest.

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:24.220
 Henry, your mother and I have taken all the procrastinating we're going to.

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.660
 You're not to leave the house until your geometry is done.

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:27.980
 But Father, is that clear?

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:28.820
 Yes, sir.

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:31.460
 Sam, could I speak to you out here in the hall?

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:32.700
 Yes, Alice.

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:33.580
 I'll get to work, Henry.

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:34.860
 Yes, Father.

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:38.100
 But I'm really much better at homework on Monday morning.

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.460
 Sam, you didn't tell him to do his homework now, did you?

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:42.420
 Yes, why?

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:43.700
 That was Homer on the phone,

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.860
 and I'm afraid we'd made a terrible mistake.

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:46.700
 In what way?

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.100
 He's on his way over here.

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:52.380
 Alice, I'm afraid that's a mistake we can no longer avoid.

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:53.820
 Here you don't understand.

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:55.900
 We didn't realize that the boys have a date

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.580
 to go ice skating with Kathleen and Agnes.

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:59.860
 So wouldn't it be just as well

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:01.740
 if he did his homework Sunday evening?

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.380
 - Alice, after I ordered him to do it now.

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.380
 - But Sam, this is Saturday, his day of rest.

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.740
 - Suppose I do this, Alice.

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:10.980
 Suppose I help him.

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:11.980
 - You will?

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:13.660
 Well, that might help.

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:14.780
 But nevertheless, dear,

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:17.180
 I'm certainly going to write a note to Mr. Bradley.

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:18.580
 - Henry's principal, why?

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.260
 - Sam, they have no right to ruin

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.580
 a boy's entire weekend this way,

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:25.620
 especially on the last good ice skating day of the year.

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:26.620
 Oh, Alice.

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:27.820
 So will you answer that, dear?

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:29.020
 I'm on the stove.

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:31.920
 Hello.

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:32.660
 Hello, Sam.

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:33.520
 This is Will Brown.

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:34.120
 Yes, Will.

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:36.580
 Sam, I just looked outdoors, and it's a wonderful day.

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:37.500
 Yes, isn't it?

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:38.620
 The sun is shining.

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:40.420
 There's a don't snap in the air.

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:42.820
 And I thought, why stay cooped up in the house?

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:45.920
 Why not call good old Sam and spend the afternoon bowling?

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:46.620
 Bowling?

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:47.320
 Why not?

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:49.060
 You mean, why be cooped up in the house

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:51.320
 when you can be cooped up in the bowling alley?

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:53.220
 But Sam, I have to get out of the house.

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:55.220
 Elizabeth's trying to get me to shellac the dining room

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:59.980
 Shall I get sure that's her favorite indoor sport trying to get me to shellac

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:05.780
 So what do you say aren't you in the mood to bowl Sam? Oh, I'm in the mood all right good

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:11.540
 Then suppose you pick me up right away. Well, I'll tell you there's a little matter. I have to clean up first

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:19.360
 You mean Alice has stuck you with some job. No, no, no, it's just just well. It's nothing. I can't finish in five minutes

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.700
 Okay, I'll be waiting for you so long Sam. Goodbye, Will

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:23.100
 - Hey, Ray.

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:26.500
 - I'm in the dining room, Father, buckling down on my homework.

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:27.340
 - Good.

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:29.780
 - Gee, Father, mother told me about your helping me,

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:31.940
 and boy, I certainly appreciate it.

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:32.780
 - That's quite all right.

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:33.620
 Now let's get started.

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:34.620
 - Hey, Henry.

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:36.020
 (audience laughing)

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:37.260
 - Gee.

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.100
 - Sounds like Homer.

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:40.660
 - Doesn't sound like anyone else.

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:45.340
 - Hi, him, hi, Mr. Old, which boy, what a day, what a day.

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:48.140
 (audience laughing)

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:48.980
 - Homer.

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:50.660
 - Is that an apple in that food bowl?

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:52.100
 - Homer, don't bite it.

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:53.100
 It's wax.

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:54.300
 It is.

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:55.780
 Boy, what a day.

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:57.380
 Come on, Henry, let's go.

00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:58.220
 Let's go?

00:06:58.220 --> 00:06:59.900
 Sure, are we meeting the girls at 12?

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:02.820
 Well, first, Homer, there's a little matter, my father,

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:04.460
 and I have to get out of the way.

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:05.460
 What a little matter.

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:07.100
 My geometry homework.

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:08.460
 You're gonna do that now?

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:10.820
 What'll you do Monday during lunch?

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:12.180
 (audience laughing)

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:13.820
 Homer, the fewer interruptions we have,

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:14.780
 the quicker we'll finish.

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:16.740
 So would you please sit quietly in the corner?

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:17.700
 Yes, sir.

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:18.540
 Now, Henry.

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:20.260
 Henry, did I tell you about that trick,

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:21.660
 Agnes and I worked out?

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:22.500
 Homer, if--

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:24.620
 We're skating along gracefully, see?

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:26.980
 And then all of a sudden, she grabs me by the wrist

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:29.140
 and throws me over a shoulder.

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:29.980
 Homer, I--

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:32.980
 And when I come down there, she is to grab me again.

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:33.820
 Homer?

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:35.340
 Yes, Mr. Olridge.

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:37.460
 I'll shut up.

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:38.380
 Good.

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:38.880
 Now--

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:40.820
 Is that banana wax, too?

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:42.100
 It is.

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:44.740
 Oh, the pear, too?

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:47.460
 Homer, I'm sure Mrs. Olridge must have something edible

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:48.300
 in the kitchen.

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:48.900
 Yes, sir.

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:50.460
 You don't mind my leaving?

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:51.420
 Not a bit.

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:53.180
 You won't be long, will you, hand?

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:56.740
 No, Gee, if we buckle down, we'll be through in no time.

00:07:56.740 --> 00:07:58.700
 Henry, how many problems have you done so far?

00:07:58.700 --> 00:07:59.940
 How many?

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:03.940
 Well, there's one in particular I'm sort of stuck on.

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:04.440
 Which one?

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:06.260
 The first.

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:07.780
 I see.

00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:09.140
 Well, let's get to work on it.

00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:09.860
 Yes, sir.

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:12.460
 Just as soon as I get this lampshade fixed.

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:13.380
 What's wrong with it?

00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:15.780
 Well, Gee, was-- did you ever notice how it tilts?

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:17.740
 Boy, you can hardly concentrate.

00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:18.580
 Excuse me.

00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:19.340
 Where are you going?

00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:21.980
 get a pair of pliers so we can work with a free mind.

00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:22.980
 - And reset down.

00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:23.820
 - Yes.

00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:25.700
 - You'll never get anywhere if you keep on procrastinated.

00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:26.540
 - Yes.

00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:29.300
 - Now, what's the problem you're stuck on?

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:33.860
 - A farmer gray has a field that is 900 feet on one side,

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:36.340
 800 feet on the parallel side,

00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:38.820
 and the remaining sides are 100 feet each.

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:42.700
 If the field is in the shape of a trapezoid,

00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:44.100
 what is the area?

00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:46.940
 - Henry, that can't be right.

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:50.800
 But I copied it right off the blackboard, Phon.

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:52.620
 The field is in the shape of a what?

00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:53.780
 Trapezoid.

00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:54.700
 Oh.

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:56.700
 Oh, trapezoid.

00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:58.180
 Well, that shouldn't be hard.

00:08:58.180 --> 00:08:59.420
 Do you have your pencil, Henry?

00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:00.260
 Yes, sir.

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:01.180
 And your ruler and your paper?

00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:02.020
 Yes, sir.

00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:05.620
 All right, can Henry now first tell me what is a trapezoid?

00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:09.740
 What is it?

00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:11.500
 Well, Henry, you can't expect to find the area

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:13.540
 unless you know what it is.

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:15.780
 But, Father, that's the whole thing.

00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:19.380
 I don't even remember Ms. Bennett ever even mentioning trapezoids.

00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:22.780
 I can't. Do we have a nutcracker on you?

00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:24.980
 A nutcracker?

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:28.480
 All your mother had to eat that wasn't in a can with these walnuts.

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:31.080
 Homer, you'll find my hammer in the basement.

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:32.080
 Yes, sir.

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:35.080
 Henry, do you think you'll be through by the time I'm all cracked?

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:39.180
 Homer, just run along.

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:41.380
 Yes, Mr. All, which I'll leave you alone.

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:43.680
 Let's hurry, Henry. Suppose you look up trapezoids.

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:44.480
 Where's your math book?

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:46.340
 Why, in my lunchbox.

00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:47.460
 - You're having it for lunch?

00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:49.660
 - No, sorry, I put it in there so I'd be sure not

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:51.580
 to forget to bring the book home from school.

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:52.420
 - Well, please get it.

00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:54.720
 - Well, that's just it, I forgot my lunchbox.

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:55.720
 (audience laughs)

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:57.260
 - You don't have a book at all?

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:58.100
 - No, sir.

00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:01.300
 So couldn't you just tell me what a trapezoid is?

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:02.900
 - A trapezoid, of course.

00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:07.100
 Now, as I remember it, a trapezoid is a sort of...

00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:11.540
 - Yes, Father?

00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:14.300
 - Henry, you'll never learn by my telling you.

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:16.940
 The thing for you to do is look it up.

00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:18.180
 But we're fathers.

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:19.580
 Doesn't Homer have a geometry book?

00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:21.180
 Sure, but it's probably in his house.

00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:22.180
 Well, ask him to get it.

00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:22.700
 But fine.

00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:23.700
 And please hurry, Henry.

00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:26.340
 A certain gentleman is waiting for me on a very urgent matter.

00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:37.060
 Hello.

00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:38.380
 Elizabeth, this is Alice.

00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:39.660
 Oh, hello, Alice.

00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:42.100
 Elizabeth, I'm writing a letter to Mr. Bradley.

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:44.820
 And I wondered if you'd be interested in signing it too.

00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:46.500
 What sort of a letter, Alice?

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:49.180
 About the amount of homework they give the boys.

00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:52.780
 I say, "Dear Mr. Bradley, as one of your mothers,

00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:56.100
 I am deeply concerned about my son's weekend."

00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:58.540
 Henry has homework over the weekend?

00:10:58.540 --> 00:10:59.280
 Yes.

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:00.780
 Well, isn't Homer lucky?

00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:02.500
 He never has any.

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:04.860
 But are he and Henry in the same class?

00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:05.540
 That's true.

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:06.420
 They are.

00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:07.940
 He must have homework.

00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:09.060
 I should think so.

00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:11.780
 You know what Homer's trouble is he takes after will.

00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:13.380
 Always putting things off.

00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:14.220
 - He does?

00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:16.500
 - Alice, I'd hate to tell you how long I've been after Will

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:18.620
 to shellac my dining room floor.

00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:19.820
 I asked him this morning and he said

00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:21.580
 he's going bowling with Sam.

00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:22.580
 - Sam?

00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:23.980
 Sam's going bowling?

00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:25.100
 - Isn't he?

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:28.540
 - Well, right now he's working on a trapezoid with Henry.

00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:30.900
 - You don't say?

00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:31.740
 Well...

00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:32.580
 - Elizabeth.

00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:33.400
 - Oh my goodness, it's Will.

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:34.980
 I better hang up before he gets away.

00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:36.220
 - All right, goodbye Elizabeth.

00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:37.060
 - Goodbye.

00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:38.460
 Will, I'd like to speak to you.

00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:40.340
 - Elizabeth, I've never seen my bowling shoes.

00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:43.060
 You're bowling shoes, they're in my broom closet.

00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:44.260
 What are they doing there?

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:47.220
 They're so comfortable to do housework in.

00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:48.140
 Elizabeth.

00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:51.020
 And anyway, Will Brown, you won't need them.

00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:51.700
 Why not?

00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:54.580
 If Sam Aldrich can fix Alice's trapezoid,

00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:57.220
 you can survive your life.

00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:58.420
 Thanks, her wife.

00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:01.020
 Oh, don't stand around asking questions.

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:01.980
 Suppose you stop.

00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:04.620
 But Elizabeth, it's too humid to show up.

00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:07.380
 You used the same excuse in July.

00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:08.660
 But Elizabeth--

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:09.740
 Will Brown.

00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:12.640
 How would you like to have sweet breads for dinner?

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:14.440
 Every day from now on.

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:15.940
 Sweet breads.

00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:16.780
 Elizabeth.

00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:19.460
 Glad you're going to get them if that floor isn't done today.

00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:21.300
 But Sam will be here any minute.

00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:21.820
 Hi, man.

00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:22.820
 Elizabeth.

00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:25.140
 Father, have you seen my geometry book anywhere?

00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:26.020
 Where did you put it?

00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:27.500
 I don't remember.

00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:29.700
 I always put things like that right out of my mind

00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:31.620
 as soon as I get home on Friday.

00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:33.060
 Well, I haven't seen it.

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:33.580
 And Homer--

00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:34.980
 Well, there it is on the hall table.

00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:35.420
 Excuse me.

00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:36.860
 Oh, wait a minute, Homer.

00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:39.380
 Didn't you promise to help me shellac the dining room floor?

00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:42.100
 Sure. When the time came, then she couldn't get out of it.

00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:43.380
 Well, the time has come.

00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:45.060
 Look at the brushes and let's start.

00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:45.560
 What fun?

00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:47.540
 Homer starts shellacking and shut up.

00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:58.420
 Henry, go back and look through that encyclopedia again.

00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:03.780
 Gee, was father. I did four times, and I give him my word trapezoids, nowhere in there.

00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:06.260
 Henry, it must be everything's in the encyclopedia.

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:09.860
 But it isn't. It goes from Tripani to trap shooting.

00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:14.060
 Oh, I know. Remember when little cousin Bertram visited us last summer?

00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:14.960
 What about him?

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:19.060
 Boy, if there was one thing he liked to do, it was cut pictures out of books.

00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:21.760
 You suppose he took trapezoids with him?

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:23.960
 That's a fine thing. Let me at that full.

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:25.160
 Father, who are you calling?

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:26.860
 Mr. Cleary, my accountant.

00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:29.260
 And find out once and for all what a trapezoid is.

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:30.260
 Number two.

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:32.460
 Elma, 494.

00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:34.260
 Do you think Mr. Cleary can help us?

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:38.500
 He can't know one can. I've never seen anyone who could do the things with figures that he can.

00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:39.220
 Hello?

00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:41.140
 Oh, hello, Mr. Cleary. This is our all-rich.

00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:43.600
 Why, hello, Mr. All-rich. I've been trying to get you all week.

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:45.760
 Every time I call your office, you're in conference.

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:48.740
 Oh, yes. We don't have too much time left to get your books in order.

00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:51.800
 Yes, I know, and I'm very anxious to have them out of the way, naturally.

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:53.580
 You are good, I'll have you right over.

00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:54.100
 What?

00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:56.540
 All I have to do is get your books together and sharpen my pants.

00:13:56.540 --> 00:13:57.340
 But, Mr. Cleary...

00:13:57.340 --> 00:14:01.340
 I don't usually work on Saturdays, but if we buckle down, we should be through in two or three hours.

00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:02.260
 Two or three?

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:02.920
 Goodbye.

00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:09.920
 Mr. Cleary, come back. Mr. Cleary, I don't have time to. Mr. Cleary, I'm in conference.

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:26.720
 And now it's time to listen to someone who actually is in conference. Meredith Wilson and his talking people.

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:30.580
 on-track on-track

00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:32.260

00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:41.180
 on time no it is but what has all your glamorous french got to do with henry

00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:43.380
 all rich and his trapezoid

00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:46.420
 we're the intervention on the all rich family program

00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:47.720

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:49.780
 sponsored by the jello family

00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:52.820
 world's most glamorous desserts

00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:53.820

00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:58.140
 there's glamour in the shimmer of jello six delicious flavors starting with

 Strawberry Eewee, cherry Eewee, orange! Love it to you!

00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:09.140
 Ah, those shimmering flavors are rich with locked-in flavor!

00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:11.140
 J-E-L-L-O-O!

00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:15.140
 And Jell-O's locked-in flavor can't get out until your first tempting spoonful.

00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:17.140
 Now that's why it tastes so good.

00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:20.140
 It makes you think of the real ripe fruit itself.

00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:23.140
 And don't forget those big red letters that spell Jell-O,

00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:26.140
 also stand for the entire Jell-O family of desserts!

00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:43.140
 [Music]

00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:45.140
 And now back to the Aldrich family.

00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:53.140
 [Music]

00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:56.900
 Yes, getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldrich.

00:15:56.900 --> 00:16:00.840
 After Mr. Aldrich had made a date to go bowling with Will Brown,

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:05.640
 Mrs. Aldrich and vaguely meant to helping Henry with his geometry homework.

00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:11.140
 This inspired Mrs. Brown to insist that her husband get to work shellacking the floor.

00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:13.640
 The scene opens in the Brown's dining room.

00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:15.540
 It is later the same day.

00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:18.340
 Homer, that's the oldest mistake in the world.

00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:22.540
 But Father, I thought you were leaving him down at your inn for us to get out.

00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:24.540
 You thought I was leaving you.

00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:29.540
 Now we're stuck in the middle of the dining room floor, surrounded by wet shellac.

00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:30.540
 What are we gonna do?

00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:32.540
 Keep quiet, I'm thinking.

00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:33.540
 Yes, sir.

00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:37.540
 And do you have to keep staring me in the face?

00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:39.540
 Father, where else can I stare?

00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:41.540
 Elizabeth!

00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:43.540
 Why are you calling Mother?

00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:46.540
 Homer, I have a very important appointment with a certain gentleman.

00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:47.540
 Elizabeth!

00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:50.540
 Well, do you have to shout all of...

00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:51.540
 Well...

00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:53.540
 Well, what?

00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:55.540
 Well, wouldn't you know it?

00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:59.540
 Elizabeth, let's be constructive. Get us out of here.

00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:02.540
 Here, I'm afraid you'll have to stay there until the chill act drives.

00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:03.540
 What?

00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:05.540
 And why are you there, Homer?

00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:07.540
 Mother, what are you getting out there in the hall?

00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:09.040
 Your geometry book.

00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:09.540
 What?

00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:11.040
 Here, catch.

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:12.040
 Oops.

00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:14.540
 If Henry can do his homework, you can do yours.

00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:16.540
 But Elizabeth, what about me?

00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:18.040
 You can help Homer.

00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:19.040
 Help Homer.

00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:20.040
 Father?

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:23.040
 Gee whiz mother have a heart.

00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:33.540
 Do you see it Henry?

00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:36.040
 Could you boost me higher Father?

00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:39.040
 There is it all that top shelf?

00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:40.040
 No Father.

00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:41.040
 Well...

00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:43.040
 That's a fine thing.

00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:45.040
 I was positive I saw it out here in the garage.

00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:49.040
 Gee whiz father what good is a mechanics handbook at a time like this?

00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:50.760
 It might cover trapezoid.

00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:52.960
 But Father, do you realize it's past 12?

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:53.860
 I realize it, Henry.

00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:55.760
 I realize it very well.

00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:57.120
 And we're not going to waste any more time.

00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:58.560
 What's the name of your math teacher?

00:17:58.560 --> 00:17:59.520
 Mespenant, why?

00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:01.120
 We're going straight over to her house

00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:01.880
 and ask for help.

00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:02.680
 Mespenant?

00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:03.680
 Do you think that's why?

00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:04.280
 Why?

00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:06.920
 I mean, asking her to see me on a weekend,

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:10.680
 considering what she goes through all week.

00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:12.200
 Henry, come along.

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:13.040
 Hey!

00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:14.000
 Back on the garage, Henry.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:14.500
 Quick!

00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:15.200
 Mr. Albright!

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:16.360
 Father, what's wrong?

00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:18.360
 Sam, are you out, Mary Beth?

00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:20.860
 It gets his hands on me, I'll be trapped for the rest of the day.

00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:22.360
 And they get behind the car.

00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:23.360
 Sam!

00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:24.360
 Mr. Olgrich!

00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:26.360
 Okay, keep down.

00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:28.360
 Sam!

00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:31.360
 I'm afraid he isn't out here, Mr. Cleary.

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:35.360
 That's strange. He told me he was very anxious to get those books audited.

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:39.360
 Mr. Cleary, you don't submit Posey meant for you to meet him at his office, do you?

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:40.360
 You think so?

00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:42.360
 Perhaps you ought to drive down there.

00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:43.360
 Perhaps I'd better.

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:46.360
 Let me close those garage doors for you.

00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:51.160
 Mr. Cleary, you didn't snap the padlock, did you?

00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:52.160
 Yes, why?

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:57.960
 Well, it's just that the locks got terribly rusty and Mr. Aldridge keeps putting off oiling it.

00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:01.160
 One of these days we're not going to be able to get it open at all.

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:15.360
 No, Gus, I don't have a bitter junk for you today.

00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:19.660
 "Junk? Oh, didn't you hear Miss Brown? I'm out of the junk business."

00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:20.700
 "Oh, you are?"

00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:23.260
 "Yeah, Sheila Mahash, she gave up the ghost."

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:24.260
 "She died?"

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:28.060
 "No, no, retired. Moved out to the country with some relative."

00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:31.260
 "Yeah, I got a card from her just the other day."

00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:32.960
 "She'd gained eight pounds."

00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:33.960
 "A card?"

00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:36.060
 "Well, written by a friend, actually."

00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:39.760
 "Yeah, they say she's starting to eat like a horse again."

00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:43.660
 "You need any exterminating Miss Brown?"

00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:44.860
 "Do I need what?"

00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:48.180
 exterminating. That's my new line. Need any?

00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:50.620
 Well, none that I think you could handle.

00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:53.980
 Gus, do you know anything about carpentry?

00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:56.540
 Carpentry. Yes, sir, above.

00:19:56.540 --> 00:20:00.020
 I made a nice living at it back in '19, '07.

00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:00.900
 You did?

00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:02.460
 Or was it '08?

00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:03.540
 Gus, could you?

00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:06.020
 No, no, it was '07, all right.

00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:11.060
 I remember because William Jennings, or was it 'At Five'?

00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:12.980
 Gus, the point is,

00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:15.380
 Do you know anything about trapezoids?

00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:16.980
 Yeah. Trapezoids.

00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:20.280
 I just found home a geometry teacher and she's gone skating.

00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:22.080
 Well, what size trapezoids?

00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:23.680
 Hmm. Right.

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:24.980
 Oh, any size?

00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:25.980
 Any size?

00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:28.980
 Miss Brown, you can't build a thing like a trapezoid any size.

00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:30.280
 We're not going to build it.

00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:31.280
 No.

00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:33.280
 And what do you want the carbon to form?

00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:35.780
 Oh, excuse me, Gus. That's my phone.

00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:38.580
 Oh, I see an ant here in the corner of the porch.

00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:40.080
 Of course I just give him a squirt, that's...

00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:41.080
 Don't bother.

00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:43.080
 It'll be on the house, Michael.

00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:44.080
 [DING]

00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:45.080
 Hello.

00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:46.800
 And listen, but this is Alice.

00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:47.880
 Is Will there?

00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:48.880
 Why, yes, Alice.

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:51.320
 Only could you send him over to our house right away.

00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:53.320
 But he's still in the middle of his shellac.

00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:54.080
 What?

00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:55.200
 Alice, what's wrong?

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:57.720
 Our car seems to have a short circuit in the horn.

00:20:57.720 --> 00:20:59.280
 It just keeps blowing and blowing.

00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:00.280
 Oh, my.

00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:02.800
 And it's locked in the garage, and Sam's disappeared.

00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:03.960
 Alice, Gus is here.

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:05.240
 Now I'll send him over.

00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:06.560
 Would you thank you, Elizabeth.

00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:07.040
 Goodbye.

00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:07.880
 Goodbye.

00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:08.880
 Gus.

00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:09.520
 Oh, God.

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:11.960
 I got him, Miss Brown, clean his whistle.

00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:12.960
 Gus, could you?

00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:14.880
 And about that trapezoid.

00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:18.560
 Wouldn't you say they was too dangerous to have around anyway?

00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:22.000
 I saw a man fall off one in the circus one time.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:23.560
 I'm gonna--

00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:25.000
 I'm off for peculiar.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.240
 Gus, never mind that.

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:28.920
 Could you go over to the Aldridge's?

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:31.720
 Their car horn is stuck in the garage door's lock.

00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:33.000
 Oh, sure thing.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.400
 Door's locked, huh?

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:36.800
 Do you happen to have a rat tail file around?

00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:37.840
 No, I don't.

00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:38.720
 A settling torch?

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:39.440
 No.

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:41.520
 Well, I'll find something to open it with.

00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:42.760
 Alright, goodbye, Ms. Brown.

00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:44.160
 Goodbye, guys.

00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:45.440
 Mother!

00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:47.680
 Homer, how did you get out of the dining room?

00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:49.280
 Mother, never mind me, it's Father.

00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:49.920
 What happened?

00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:52.080
 We were standing here in the middle of the room, seein'

00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:56.640
 Father said he couldn't stand being cooped up with me in trapezoids, both, so he did it.

00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:57.280
 Did what?

00:21:57.280 --> 00:22:00.720
 He tried to jump from the middle of the dining room to the living room doorway.

00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:02.000
 Oh, dear.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:03.120
 Can you know what happened?

00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:04.480
 Of course, he didn't make it.

00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:06.080
 Mother, that isn't the point.

00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:08.720
 He was carrying his pot of shellac when he drew it.

00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:11.700
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:26.880
 Henry, do you see Miss Bennett anywhere on the eyes?

00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:29.800
 Not yet, Father, but I'm keeping my eyes open.

00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:30.960
 Are you still upset?

00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:32.560
 Henry, I'd rather not discuss it.

00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:33.280
 Yes, sir.

00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:35.640
 But you'd think Gus could have gotten us out of the garage

00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:38.440
 without breaking down the door with an axe.

00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:39.980
 Henry, what does Miss Bennett look like?

00:22:39.980 --> 00:22:41.400
 - Gee, you can't miss her.

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:46.240
 She's sort of, well, gee, she's very healthy.

00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:47.400
 - Healthy, how?

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:49.520
 - White in a big way.

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:50.360
 - I see.

00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:52.840
 - Henry, oh, boy, Kathleen.

00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:54.920
 - So you finally showed up.

00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:56.960
 Do you realize it's nearly three o'clock?

00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:58.160
 - And Kathleen, let me explain.

00:22:58.160 --> 00:22:59.480
 - That's not necessary.

00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:01.160
 Henry, my interest you to know

00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:04.160
 that Agnes and I had a wonderful time skating with Charlie

00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:05.000
 Claus.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:05.840
 - Charlie?

00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:06.680
 - Yes.

00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:08.040
 Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going over to see

00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:09.680
 If Charlie's resting comfortably.

00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:10.920
 Something happened to him?

00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:12.680
 Agnes threw him over his shoulder.

00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:15.320
 And she wasn't there when he came down.

00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:16.280
 Kathleen listened.

00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:17.400
 Goodbye, Henry.

00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:18.160
 But Kathleen?

00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:19.320
 Never mind, Kathleen Henry.

00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:20.080
 Look over there.

00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:21.040
 Is that Miss Bennett?

00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:21.920
 Where?

00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:23.800
 Well, gee whiz.

00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:26.280
 Father, do you think a math teacher should go around

00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:28.640
 in public doing figure-8s?

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:30.080
 Is that what she's doing?

00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:31.720
 She's trying to.

00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:33.040
 Miss Bennett?

00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:33.840
 Oh, Miss Bennett?

00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:34.840
 Miss Bennett?

00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:35.880
 Oh, Dad.

00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:36.720
 I'm Miss Bennett.

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:39.320
 Henry, you oldridge, could I please speak to you?

00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:41.720
 Oh, stop me, Henry, stop me.

00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:43.920
 Father Quay, I've got you.

00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:44.920
 Oh, my--

00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:47.820
 [LAUGHTER]

00:23:47.820 --> 00:23:49.320
 Thank you very much.

00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:52.320
 Isn't this fun?

00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:53.120

00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:54.120
 Miss Bennett.

00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:57.520
 Henry, I'm like, oh, my own boy, I'm not too steady.

00:23:57.520 --> 00:23:59.520
 Oh, Miss Bennett, I'm Henry's father.

00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:01.200
 Oh, how do you do, Mr. Alden?

00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:01.920
 Would you believe it?

00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:04.280
 I haven't been on skates in 10 years.

00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:05.200
 You haven't?

00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:06.780
 - Thomas Bennett, we have a problem.

00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:07.620
 - Yes.

00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:08.460
 - That is Henry has a problem.

00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:10.260
 That is, well I know it isn't ethical,

00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:12.880
 but we're sort of stuck on that trapezoid.

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:14.800
 - Trapezoid, what trapezoid?

00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:16.760
 - The one that's our homework for Monday.

00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:19.720
 - Henry did I give a problem about trapezoid?

00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:22.280
 - Gee, wait, sure, you wrote it on the blackboard.

00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:23.320
 - I did.

00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:26.160
 I haven't taken up trapezoids with the class yet.

00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:27.000
 (laughing)

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:28.000
 - What?

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:29.800
 - She hasn't taken it up.

00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:31.640
 - Oh boy.

00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:33.840
 - I meant to get into them this past week,

00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:36.760
 But somehow I just put it up and put it off.

00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:39.180
 Miss Bennett, do you mean to say?

00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:40.200
 Do you mean to say--

00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:42.680
 Mr. Otheletch, you're letting go of my arms.

00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:43.600
 Father!

00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:44.600
 Miss Bennett!

 Yes, Alice?

00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:03.440
 Are you all right on the couch?

00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:04.960
 I'm fine.

00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:07.640
 Is that easy chair comfortable, Henry?

00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:08.840
 Yes, mother.

00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:11.200
 Would either of you like another blanket?

00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:12.360
 No, thank you.

00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:13.760
 No, thanks, mother.

00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:15.720
 Well, I just want you both to know

00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:18.440
 I think it was a very brave thing to do.

00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:19.160
 Brave?

00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:22.400
 Yes, pulling Miss Bennet out of the water like that.

00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:25.000
 We didn't do it to be brave.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.000
 Miss Bennet was holding on to us for dear life.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.360
 We rescued her in self-defense.

00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:31.000
 Dear, I know better.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:36.000
 Father, are you really going to take me out of school if Miss Bennet stays at Central High?

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.000
 I haven't decided.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.500
 Sam, don't you think you ought to cool off first?

00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:43.000
 Alice, I'm as cooled off as I'll ever be.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:47.000
 Incidentally, Sam, did you find out what a trapezoid is?

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.000
 Yes, Alice. A trapezoid is a...

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.000
 A trapezoid...

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:55.000
 Well, Alice, do you see that lampshade over the dining room table?

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:56.000
 The one that sort of tilts?

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.000
 Yes, that's a perfect example of a trapezoid.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:05.000
 You know father it just occurred to me it's been hanging over our heads all day.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.000
 Hey Henry!

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.000

 Hey Homer!

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.000
 I've got the fall.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:12.000
 I'm here all the time and here's my geometry book.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.000
 Boy Homer, you sure took your time.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.000
 I couldn't help but my father and I just got through cleaning off the walls.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:18.000
 The wall?

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.000
 Boy you should have seen the way his cans flashed when it landed.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.000

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.000
 Gee Homer.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.000
 Homer what's this all over your book?

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:32.200
 over your book shall I what you think that's a bad shape you

00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:33.380
 ought to see my father.

00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:37.480
 It says it's the first time in his life he got his hair to stay

00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:45.320
 Yes he called to say you weren't at the office either.

00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:46.280
 Alice what did you tell him?

00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:48.280
 I told him you were flat on your back.

00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:49.320
 Good.

00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:52.560
 So he said not to let you up he'd be right over with the book.

00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:52.920
 What?

 He's pushing him.

00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:09.440
 You all right?

00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:10.280
 Choose pushing.

 Boy, Homer, are you girl crazy?

00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:14.520
 She wants somebody new comes to town.

00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:16.200
 What's wrong with taking a look at it?

00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:19.400
 Then move over so I can see her, too.

00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:22.080
 Well, gee, wait.

00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:25.280
 Okay Henry, who's girl crazy now?

00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:26.680
 Girl crazy eh?

00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:31.040
 Well when kids of the age of Henry and Homer, they're all so dessert crazy.

00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:33.040
 Especially when it's jello coming up.

00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:37.520
 A treat to look at and a treat to eat in those sex delicious flavors.

00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:40.920
 Strawberry, raspberry, cherry, orange, lemon and lime.

 All sex with that locked in goodness that makes them taste so rich and fruit like.

00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:50.560
 Cut your jello into shimmering little cubes and pile it into sharpet glasses.

00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:55.000
 Lake it lightly with a fork and combine with sliced oranges or grapefruit.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:58.240
 Jell-O is America's favorite gelatin dessert.
