00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
 Jell-O everybody, the Jell-O family of desserts presents...

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
 Henry Henry O'Rourke!

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
 Coming, Mother!

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
 [Applause]

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 Yes, it's the O'Rourke family based on parages originated by Clifford Goldsmith

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
 and starring Ezra Stone as Henry O'Rourke with Jackie Pelt as Homie.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:50.000
 And yes, it's the Jello family. Oh, the Big Red Letter stand for the Jello family. Oh, the Big Red Letter stand for the Jello family. That's Jello, yum yum yum. Jello please. Yum yum yum. Jello, tap. Be out the pudding, yes, sorry. And now for the Aldridge family.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 [Music]

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:05.000
 One of the things you remember best after you've grown up is the number of the house and the name of the street where you spent your teenage.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 And no doubt it was something like 117L street where Henry Aldrich lives.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 It is early morning and the scene opens in the Aldrich kitchen.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 Sam!

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 I miss the base, Madalis.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
 I know, dear, and could you please shovel a coal a little more quietly?

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 You'll wake the kilners next door.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
 Alice, coal is not something you can shovel quietly.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
 Well, please try. It's just a quarter to six.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 Mary, are Henry's pancakes done?

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 Dear, open your eyes before you stumble and fall into the skillet.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 Yes, mother. My goodness, I can't see why Henry had to force us all out of bed in the middle of the night

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.360
 the night simply because he has to go to work.

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.880
 - Dear, he didn't force us, we volunteered.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.120
 - Who did I did?

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.960
 - Yes, dear.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.560
 - Mother, I couldn't have.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.440
 That's one thing Kermit impressed on me

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.000
 after he got out of the army.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.360
 Never volunteer for anything.

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.480
 - Mary, if your own brother shows this kind of ambition,

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.360
 the least you can do is cooperate

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.960
 and see that he gets off on a full stomach.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.240
 - Alice, where's the wisse broom?

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.840
 - Sam Oldridge, how did you get your pajamas that dirty?

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.560
 - I got into a landslide.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.400
 Where?

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.400
 In the coal bin.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.440
 Where's the broom?

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.160
 Hanging behind you.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.320
 My goodness, you're certainly your son's father.

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.360
 When you're shoveling coal in the middle of the night,

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.480
 what can you expect?

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.600
 Now, Sam, don't you grumble too.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.560
 You're the one who's always after him

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.960
 to show more initiative.

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.360
 Well, I didn't mean for him to show it.

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:35.720
 It's six o'clock in the morning.

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:36.560
 Now, Sam?

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.600
 Besides his schoolwork is just as important as his initiative.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.520
 He and Hormone never get those circulars delivered

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:42.800
 before their first class.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.320
 Sam, old, you certainly don't have much confidence

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:51.080
 your own son. Who on it? I'll get the phone. Would you like the pancakes too

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.120
 father? Mary pancakes are not something you eat when your stomach still asleep.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:01.880
 Henry are you drinking your milk? I'm just starting to mother. Hello? Alice this is

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:07.240
 a bit brown. Has Will showed up at your house? Will. My husband. Is he on his way

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:11.800
 over? I don't know. He was half asleep and I sent him out for the milk and he

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.280
 opened the back door and just kept going.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.760
 Oh my goodness.

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.960
 So if he shows up there, would you give him

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:20.160
 one of Sam's robes and some bedroom slippers

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.200
 and send him home?

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.600
 Yes, Elizabeth, goodbye.

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:23.500
 Goodbye.

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:24.300
 Oh, and Alice?

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:25.200
 Yes, Elizabeth?

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.360
 You don't think this job will be too taxing on Homer, do you?

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.960
 Taxi?

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.680
 Well, I took it for the doctor last month.

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.040
 And Alice, the poor boy has practically no metabolism left

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.960
 at all.

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:37.240
 I'm sure it'll do him a world of good.

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.000
 And I'll keep an eye open for Will.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.600
 Goodbye.

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:40.960
 Goodbye.

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.960
 Mother, is there anything on that telephone table besides the telephone book in the memo pair?

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.960
 No, dear. What are you looking for?

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.960
 A perfectly wonderful letter I got from Kermit yesterday.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:56.960
 I thought as long as I'm up I'd sit down and answer it so he could see the effect it's having on me as soon as possible.

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:00.960
 Dear, this is no time to be answering letters. Please see that Henry gets his pancakes first.

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:05.960
 Yes, Mother. But I could very easily do that and write the first draft at the same time.

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:09.360
 Mary, the morning's complicated enough as it is.

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:10.960
 Henry, are you eating?

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:14.360
 Sure, Mother. Look, I'm already halfway through my half a grapefruit.

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.360
 That's fine, then drink your milk.

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.360
 Hey, Henry!

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:21.360
 In the dining room, Homer.

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:22.360
 Hi, Henry.

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.360
 Good morning, Mr. Aldrich.

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.360
 Homer, dear, it's me.

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.360
 Oh.

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:29.360
 Oh, sure.

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.360
 Oh, are you ready to start him?

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.360
 Just as soon as he drinks his milk and has his pancakes.

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.920
 I'll go see if I told him to mock.

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:38.680
 - Give me room at the table, Henry.

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:39.520
 - What are you doing?

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.720
 - Stuffing the rest of the circulars in these envelopes.

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.280
 - Gee whiz, Hummer, haven't you done that yet?

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.040
 - Henry, I'll be done by the time you're finished eating.

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.560
 - Here are your pancakes, Henry.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:49.540
 - Oh, it's about time.

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:52.200
 Boy, don't you realize we have to be in school by 8.30?

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.120
 - Well, my goodness, that's a good example

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:55.800
 of the appreciation you get around here

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.480
 for working to the bone.

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.040
 Would you mind standing up?

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.240
 - Gee whiz, what are you looking for?

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:02.960
 - Nothing, you can sit down.

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.400
 I just thought the letter might be on your chair.

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:06.320
 - Henry.

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:07.160
 - Why?

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.440
 - Who was that?

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:09.520
 - Mary.

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.000
 - Your sister?

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.320
 - Well sure.

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:13.220
 - Well I'll be done,

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:15.760
 and over all those things sticking out of her head.

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:17.280
 (audience laughing)

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:18.320
 - The curlers.

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:19.520
 - Yeah.

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.520
 Boy, you have to get up pretty early in the morning

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.760
 to see what a girl's like under everything.

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:24.600
 - I'm calling.

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:25.600
 (audience laughing)

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:26.720
 - Homer, what are you doing?

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.040
 - Hey, circulars in the envelope.

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.880
 - No, you're not,

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.840
 you just stuffed a paper napkin into that top one.

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:33.840
 I did.

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.840
 Jane was open your eyes.

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:37.840
 What was that?

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:38.840
 Nothing.

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:40.840
 Just me and the whole clothes tree.

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.840
 You ran into it, father?

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.840
 No, it jumped out on a tech machine.

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:49.840
 Henry, I want to make one thing clear, no matter where you are.

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:54.840
 No matter how many circulars you have left to deliver, at 8.15 you're to drop everything and make tracks for school.

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:55.840
 But, father, we have to finish.

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:57.840
 Sure, we've already been paid too long.

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.840
 That's your responsibility.

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:00.840
 You're just to get to school on time.

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:01.840
 Is that clear?

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:04.120
 Yes, father. Come on, Homer. Let's start.

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:07.220
 But I'm going to finish stuff. You can do it all the way.

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:09.260
 Ben, where are the boys going?

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.560
 To work. Goodbye, everybody. Hi, homie.

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:15.560
 Good evening. It's all to work, we go.

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:19.200
 Hi. Goodness, Sam. Why did you let him go before he finished his milk?

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:21.400
 He'll survive, Alice. Now, come on.

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:23.120
 Where? Back to bed.

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:24.320
 Before we clean up?

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:27.280
 Before I fall flat on my face. Come along.

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:30.040
 Father, I can't find Kermit's letter anywhere.

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:32.040
 Mary, it's 650.

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:33.460
 Father, I have to find it.

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:35.460
 Suppose it falls into some strange hand.

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:36.700
 I suppose it does.

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:38.020
 Father, I just die.

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:39.940
 I'd lie right down and die.

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:42.100
 Good heavens, what sort of a letter did he write?

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:44.180
 Oh, mother, it was beautiful.

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:46.780
 When Kermit writes a letter, it isn't just a letter.

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:49.140
 It's got language in it.

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:50.100
 That's novel.

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:52.180
 [LAUGHTER]

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:55.540
 And it isn't the kind of language I'd like strangers to see.

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:58.020
 Well, if it was in the house, it couldn't have walked off.

00:06:58.020 --> 00:06:59.300
 Now, where did you have it left?

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:02.580
 Oh, that's the whole thing. I'm positive I put it on the desk last night.

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:03.400
 On the desk?

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:03.900
 Yes.

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:07.780
 I know because Henry was sitting next to me putting circulars into those envelopes and...

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:09.300
 and...

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:11.300
 Oh, my goodness.

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:12.200
 Nah, Mary.

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:13.300
 Oh, my goodness.

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:14.500
 Mary, calm down.

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:18.700
 Calm down, mother, calm down when my private life may be spread all over town.

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:19.300
 Mary!

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:21.500
 Mother Kermit practically proposed!

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:22.900
 Father, out of my way!

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:23.700
 Where are you going?

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:26.300
 Out in Stalk Henry, before he roars my lawn.

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:27.800
 Mary!

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:28.700
 Sam's selfish.

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:31.700
 But you catch her death of cold and nothing but her night down at curlers.

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:44.700
 Hair doggy, nice doggy.

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:51.700
 Listen, dog, can't you go away from that gate and let me get up on that friend porch with this circular?

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:54.700
 But I've only got two more left.

00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:57.700
 Please, dog, come on, be civilized.

00:07:57.700 --> 00:07:59.060
 *snoring*

00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:02.020
 Look, suppose I give you a peanut butter sandwich from my lunch.

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:03.700
 *snoring*

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:05.140
 A lot of pieces of lare can...

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:06.580
 *snoring*

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:07.540
 And orange...

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:08.500
 *barking*

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:09.780
 Even if I peeled it...

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:10.740
 *screaming*

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:12.340
 *screaming*

00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:16.020
 What I can say is you will never get to be man's best friend.

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:18.420
 "Momer, what are you standing around for?

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:20.340
 Don't you realize schools in twenty minutes?"

00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:24.980
 I realize, Henry, I realize the one that doesn't realize is Hilliard's dog.

00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:26.580
 He won't let me through their gaze.

00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:29.080
 Henry! Henry Aldrich!

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:29.680
 Who's that?

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:30.280
 Mrs. King.

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:31.280
 Across the street.

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:32.080
 Oh, sure.

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:33.580
 Hi, Mrs. King!

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:37.380
 Henry, your mother called and asked me to keep an eye open for you.

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:39.080
 You're to call home immediately.

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:39.680
 I am?

00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:41.080
 And when he closes up...

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:44.480
 My father's probably worried about my being late for school.

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:48.980
 Mrs. King, would you call my house and say things are working out perfectly?

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:49.980
 Yes, sir.

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:53.980
 And if my mother's worrying, tell her I know I ran out without finishing it,

00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:55.780
 but I'll get some at school.

00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:57.780
 - Come on! - Milk!

00:08:57.780 --> 00:08:59.780
 And thanks a lot, Mrs. King.

00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:01.280
 [snoring]

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:03.780
 - Harry, why can't we skip this house?

00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:06.780
 - Homer, we were paid to do this job right.

00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:09.280
 The trouble is this dog thinks you're afraid of him.

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:10.780
 - He does? - Sure.

00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:12.280
 - Well, he's a pretty smart dog.

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:14.780
 [laughter]

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:15.780
 - Here.

00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:18.280
 Just watch me handle him.

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:19.780
 Listen, doggy.

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:21.780
 Get away from that gate and let me in.

00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:26.780
 [crying]

00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:29.780
 Well, I guess it won't hurt to miss just this one, pal.

00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:30.780
 [crowd laughing]

00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:35.780
 And we can leave the two circulars at that house where our old Miss Fletcher and her older sister live.

00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:37.780
 Two? For one family?

00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:39.780
 And we are here, then, not speaking to each other.

00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:43.780
 We wouldn't learn one of them missing us while raising a blade sale, would we?

00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:45.780
 No, I guess not. Come on, and let's hurry.

00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:47.780
 What for? We've got plenty of time.

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:51.940
 I know, but I want to get to school up humanly to look over my composition.

00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:52.940
 Composition?

00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:54.940
 Let's do today for English.

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:56.540
 Didn't you write one?

00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:57.540
 Not yet.

00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:00.420
 I was playing and writing my own study period on my father.

00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:03.020
 A whole composition and one period?

00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:06.540
 Well, I'm not exactly writing a whole composition.

00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:11.060
 I'm taking the one I wrote for history last week and where it says Abraham Lincoln, I'm

00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:13.500
 erasing and writing in Will Brown.

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:16.100
 That's not a bad idea.

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:20.100
 I'm sure, especially if I keep a carbon copy to show my father.

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:22.100
 Let's cross the street.

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:24.100
 Okay. What's yours about?

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:28.100
 That trip we took to Washington last year. I spent three days writing it.

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:32.100
 It's even illustrated with the snapshots we took in front of the White House in places.

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:34.100
 No kidding, am I mentioning?

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:38.100
 I'll say. Let me read you what you said to that guard in the treasury.

00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:40.100
 You go into that.

00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:44.100
 The explainer didn't know the money was real till after I picked it up.

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:49.260
 I'll read you the hope the hope well to you was can't friend

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:52.660
 Hold my lunch while I go through the rest of my pocket

00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:54.460
 Are you sure you wrote it in?

00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:58.580
 I mean you don't suppose you just think you did Homer. It was no dream

00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:02.420
 I put it right next to my plate this morning, so I wouldn't oh

00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:11.540
 Boy, what's wrong? Oh boy Homer what besides that napkin did you stuff into those envelopes?

00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:14.540
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:21.880
 Frank.

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:22.860
 Yes, Tim.

00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:25.340
 Frank Anderson, please put down that paper.

00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:27.500
 I know you don't like to be upset at breakfast,

00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:29.500
 but this isn't a letter that can be ignored.

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:30.780
 Letter from who?

00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:33.260
 Henry Eldridge to your daughter Kathleen.

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:35.780
 When I got up to close the window at 6.30 this morning,

00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:37.980
 I saw him sneak up on our transport,

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:39.900
 put this letter in our mailbox, and then

00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:44.700
 on the street. The only reason I happened to read it was it was in a plain white

00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:49.980
 envelope and I thought it was a circular. Just read it. Now fill it up. Very well.

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:54.220
 But I think we should leave the kids alone. When they get to our age they'll

00:11:54.220 --> 00:12:00.420
 have trouble enough to do. Whose kitten face? What? Kitten face. That's the way it

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:07.500
 starts. Dear kitten face and it's signed Honey Bunny Boo. Dear it's what's in

00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:11.140
 between kitten taste and honey bunny boo that scares the daylights out of me what

00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:14.060
 could a couple of kids right that could that could

00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:19.180
 well good heavens good heavens indeed but did you read this part about about about

00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:20.980
 what we'll never mind

00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:26.140
 this is practically a proposal I know what are we going to do we're not going to do

00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:30.860
 a thing what trouble with you fill it is you don't recognize a joke when you see

00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:34.580
 it Joe of course no kid could possibly write a thing like this in all seriousness

00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:40.580
 Well, I'm sorry, Frank, but I can't bring myself to regard the possibility of Henry Aldrich as a son-in-law, as a joke.

00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:43.580
 Yes. Well, if you like, go ahead.

00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:44.580
 Go ahead and what?

00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:45.580
 Speak to Kathleen.

00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:46.580
 Me?

00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:48.580
 And make it quite clear I'm behind you 100%.

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:51.580
 Well, Frank, I was planning on you talking to her.

00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:52.580
 Me?

00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:53.580
 My goodness, what the father for?

00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:55.580
 Well, to have Amanda Mantors.

00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:56.580
 Oh, but Frank!

00:12:56.580 --> 00:13:00.580
 Now, really, don't look at me that way. Just remember, I was the one who wanted a son.

00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:09.580
 [Music]

00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:10.080
 Hello?

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:11.880
 Hello, Acme Cut Red Dress.

00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:14.480
 Hello, look, I only have a few minutes before the first bell rings.

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:16.680
 Church bells? No, we don't carry them.

00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:17.280
 Why?

00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:18.980
 No, I'm calling about your circulars.

00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:23.280
 Oh, yes! Our special this week is two packages of razor blades for 24 cents.

00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:24.580
 I know, I folded them.

00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:25.480
 A razor blade?

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:27.780
 No! The circulars.

00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:30.740
 Oh, God. How many packages shall we send up?

00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:33.140
 - What packages? - Aren't you calling to order?

00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:35.820
 Mr. You're not listening. I'm one of your boys.

00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:37.980
 Oh, no wonder you didn't make sense.

00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:40.180
 - Huh? - As far as a fret.

00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:41.580
 - What? - Why aren't you in school?

00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:43.700
 I am, and I'm not one of your sons.

00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:45.300
 - Oh. - Why was delivering for you?

00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:47.700
 If you speak louder, we seem to have bad connections.

00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:50.660
 Has anyone called and said they found

00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:53.900
 my exciting and educational trip to Washington,

00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:55.460
 in with one of your circuaries?

00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:57.180
 Washington, you're going to Washington?

00:13:57.180 --> 00:13:58.780
 - What? - Well, have a nice time.

00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:00.980
 - Come on, huh? - Don't miss the bureau of standards.

00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:03.520
 - He don't understand. This is for class.

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:05.060
 - They're all going? - What?

00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:07.720
 - Now I get you the whole class is going to Washington,

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:09.520
 including my boys, Horace and Fred.

00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:10.920
 - Mr. Please. - Fine idea.

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:13.120
 It'd be nice to get them out of the house for a few days.

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:15.620
 - Look, if he was listening to me.

00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:18.200
 (upbeat music)

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:26.040
 - Good morning, Mrs. Todd. Come right in.

00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:26.880
 Thank you.

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:29.540
 I wonder if you could spare a cup of powdered sugar.

00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:30.480
 Of course.

00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:32.600
 You must excuse my appearance in my kitchen.

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:34.920
 I got the most peculiar piece of mail today,

00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:36.560
 and I'm afraid I've spent most of the morning

00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:38.120
 trying to make head or tail of it.

00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:39.200
 You don't say.

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:42.000
 I think I finally got it figured out, though.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.280
 I think it's a sort of travel advertisement.

00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:45.400
 It is?

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:48.440
 Well, the thing that threw me off is the clever way it's done.

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:50.880
 You see, it's supposedly written by this young boy

00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:52.960
 who'd never been to Washington before.

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:54.760
 Well, that is clever.

00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:57.560
 And judging by the grammar and some pictures that are on it,

00:14:57.560 --> 00:15:01.000
 it's obviously a refugee child who hasn't been in this country long.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.560
 [LAUGHTER]

00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:04.320
 Well, you don't say.

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:07.320
 Well, I got a very strange thing in my mailbox, too.

00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:08.080
 A travel ad?

00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:08.880
 No.

00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:12.320
 It was a plane quite envelope with a paper napkin

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:13.960
 and half a pancake in it.

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:15.360
 [LAUGHTER]

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:17.280
 You won't say.

00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:20.880
 You don't imagine it is something to do with those jackpot radio programs.

00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:21.920
 Like so?

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:24.920
 Oh my goodness, maybe I ought to go home and sit by my phone.

00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:25.920
 Oh, dear, what's wrong?

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:28.920
 You just reminded me of something I forgot to do.

00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:29.920
 Excuse me.

00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:30.920
 Number three.

00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:32.920
 L-3-0-3.

00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:34.920
 L-3-0-3?

00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:35.920
 Yes, please.

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:36.920
 Thank you.

00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:40.920
 Mrs. Ulrich called me this morning to keep an eye out for Henry and I forgot completely about calling back.

00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:41.920
 Hello?

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:44.920
 This is Mrs. King. Is Mrs. Ulrich there?

00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:46.920
 No, this is Mary. Mother's going through the attic.

00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:47.920
 Brain cleaning?

00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:50.920
 No, she thought it might have gotten up there somehow, but I'm sure Henry took it.

00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:52.040
 - You're Henry, Chuck.

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:54.920
 - Oh, well, it's about Henry, I'm calling.

00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:56.360
 As near as I could figure out,

00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:57.720
 he wanted me to tell your mother

00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:59.920
 that he expected the school to run out of milk.

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:01.600
 - Mrs. King, you saw Henry?

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:03.200
 - Yes, he was buying here this morning.

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:04.720
 - Oh my goodness.

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:07.560
 Did he leave anything in your mail box that he shouldn't have?

00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:09.080
 - It was Henry who left that?

00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:09.980
 - You got it?

00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:10.820
 You got it?

00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:12.560
 - Yes, but this is King I beg of.

00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:15.200
 You, I beg of you, please tear it up.

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:16.040
 - Hear it up.

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:17.200
 - Don't read it.

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:18.240
 - But I really can't see what--

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:20.880
 - I beg of you, and thank you.

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:24.040
 You don't know what a load this is of my mind.

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:25.040
 Goodbye!

00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:26.880
 Yes, well, goodbye.

00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:28.880
 What was that all about?

00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:31.120
 I'm to tear up that travel ass!

00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:32.280
 Really?

00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:35.520
 I wonder if I'm to tear up the napkin in 10k too.

00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:46.880
 Oh, the Big Red Letter stands for the General Family.

00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:50.400
 Oh, the Big Red Letter stands for the General Family.

00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:51.240
 That's Jello!

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:52.160
 Yum yum yum yum!

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:53.060
 Jello pudding!

00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:53.960
 Yum yum yum!

00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:54.860
 Jello tap!

00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:56.260
 Be-o-ka pudding!

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:57.560
 Just-a-ree!

00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:00.660
 Yes, Sari, and say, Mr. Seymour!

00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:01.700
 Why, Jello!

00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:04.840
 It's Mr. Dehaven, our esteemed Santaville drug is.

00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:07.580
 Why, sure, and I thought you'd like to know about a new concoction

00:17:07.580 --> 00:17:10.420
 we're serving at the lunch counter these days, it's making a big hit.

00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:12.580
 Well, you know, Mr. Dehaven, my favorite dessert is...

00:17:12.580 --> 00:17:13.980
 Oh, sure, I know!

00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:17.780
 That's why I wanted to tell you about this new idea all the kids are crazy for.

00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:18.680
 Jello?

00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:21.760
 Well, you might call it jello and.

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:23.300
 Well, go on, jello and what?

00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:25.320
 Jello and ice cream.

00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:27.280
 Sure, you just fixed the jello as usual.

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:29.000
 See, in any of the red flavors.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.600
 When it's slightly thickened, you fold in softened, vanilla ice

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:33.600
 cream, and chill and sherbet glasses.

00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:35.520
 It looks so pretty and tastes so tasty.

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:37.920
 Why, even the ladies have been thanking me for the tip.

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:39.480
 And so do we, Mr. Dehaven.

00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:40.760
 Jello's such a favorite.

00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:43.600
 We're all glad to hear of delicious new ways to serve it.

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:45.840
 Now, those red flavors, as you call them,

00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:48.240
 would be strawberry raspberry and cherry, of course.

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:50.480
 And there's also orange, lemon, and lime.

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:51.480
 There might be good too.

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:52.080
 You bet.

00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:54.120
 So look for the big red letters on the box.

00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:57.720
 They spell jello and jello spells a treat.

00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:01.640
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:05.040
 And now, getting back to the troubles of Henry Olridge,

00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:07.040
 it is later the same morning in the scene opens

00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:09.920
 in the corridor of Central High School.

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:12.800
 Miss Eddie, Miss Eddie, could I please speak to you,

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:13.600
 with Sarcum?

00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:15.440
 And the I'm late for my next class.

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:16.400
 Good morning, Miss Eddie.

00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:17.560
 Oh, good morning, Gloria.

00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:20.160
 But, Miss Eddie, there's something very important I have to tell you.

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:20.660
 What is it?

00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:21.560
 The truth.

00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:22.760
 I beg your pardon?

00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:24.760
 Yes, ma'am. I knew you'd be impressed.

00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:26.460
 It's like I told Homer.

00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:27.360
 Why?

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:31.160
 Miss Eddie may not give you that impression, but under everything that's on top,

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:34.360
 she's a person who appreciates the truth.

00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:38.160
 And they just what am I being oiled in preparation for?

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:39.560
 For...

00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:40.960
 Oh, nothing, Miss Eddie.

00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:44.960
 I just want to explain about my composition I was supposed to turn into you today.

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:45.760
 You haven't done it.

00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:46.260
 No.

00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:47.260
 That is yes.

00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:54.020
 I mean, you see, Homer and I were walking down a downtown yesterday and there was this sign

00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:55.260
 in the window, "Boying" wanted.

00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:57.260
 Your competition is about a trip downtown.

00:18:57.260 --> 00:18:58.260
 No, it's about Washington.

00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:00.260
 The one who's the father of our country?

00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:02.260
 No, the one that's D.C.

00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:06.260
 This place was having a sale on razor plates.

00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:07.260
 What plate?

00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:08.900
 We were delivering for.

00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:11.260
 Only I think Homer started into one of the envelopes.

00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:12.260
 Just a moment.

00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:13.260
 Just a moment.

00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:16.260
 Oh, you mean you understand, Miss Eddie?

00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:17.260
 No, I do not.

00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:21.260
 And I've taken about as many of your complicated explanations as I'm going to.

00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:22.260
 But, Miss Eddie...

00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:24.260
 Oh boy, is that Mr. Brabbe?

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:26.260
 It is. And suppose you make your explanations to him.

00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:29.260
 And I'll expect an excuse from him or your composition.

00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:30.260
 But, Miss Eddie...

00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:31.260
 And I've been looking for you.

00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:39.260
 Mr. Brabbe, would you be willing to listen to a very simple explanation of something very complicated that happened to me this morning?

00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:40.260
 Not at this moment.

00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:41.260
 Please take this.

00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:42.260
 What's that?

00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:51.260
 a quart of milk. Your mother dropped by with it a few minutes ago. Well, gee, it was. I hope this isn't a subtle form of criticism of the milk we serve in the school cafeteria.

00:19:51.260 --> 00:20:00.260
 Well, gee, it was no. Oh, and about that explanation. Henry, please take the milk. The moisture's running off and taking this touch out of my cups.

00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:04.260
 Oh, yes, sir. And what? Oh, and what a... What a principle is expected to do. Mr. Brab, and what?

00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:09.260
 I expected to count erasers, settle differences between teachers, men, leaky pipes. Mr. Brab, and what a...

00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:10.260
 Mr. Brad.

00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:11.260
 He keeps pipes.

00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:13.580
 Good heavens, I forgot all about the leak in the boy's locker room.

00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:14.580
 Excuse me.

00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:15.580
 But Mr. Brad?

00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:17.220
 Later, Henry, I have to call the plumber.

00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:19.980
 But look, I even have a circular to prove my story.

00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:20.980
 One circular?

00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:21.980
 This one, look.

00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:22.980
 Oh, I see.

00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:23.980
 Very well here.

00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:24.980
 Oh, what's this?

00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:25.980
 50 cents.

00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:26.980
 You can get me four packages.

00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:27.980
 Yeah.

00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:28.980
 What?

00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:32.220
 And in the future, Henry, please do your razor blade selling outside of school hours.

00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:33.220
 Mr. Brad, wait.

00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:35.580
 You're not giving me a chance to tell the truth.

00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:38.000
 (jazz music)

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:46.180
 - I hope I'm not taking your way

00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:47.540
 from anything Mrs. Zoldridge.

00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:50.620
 - Oh no Mrs. Anderson, things have calmed down beautifully.

00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:51.900
 - Oh that's fine.

00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:54.460
 The reason I called,

00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:57.220
 the reason I called.

00:20:57.220 --> 00:20:58.180
 - Yeah?

00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:00.300
 - Well, you see Henry left something

00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:01.940
 in our mailbox this morning.

00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:03.380
 - Yes I know.

00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:04.220
 - You do?

00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:05.220
 - Of course.

00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:07.820
 Well, how do you feel about it?

00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:10.020
 Oh, I approve completely.

00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:12.020
 You do?

00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:15.620
 You really approve of his leaving a thing like that in our mailbox?

00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:17.020
 Why not, Mrs. Anderson?

00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:19.620
 He left one in practically every mailbox in town.

00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:20.820
 Why?

00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:23.220
 Are you upset with Henry, Mrs. Anderson?

00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:24.220
 I can't see it.

00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:26.120
 The boys fall entirely.

00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:31.120
 After all, as the Twig is bent, Mrs. Allrich, as the Twig is bent.

00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:39.860
 [Music]

00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:41.220
 Come right in, Mrs. Anderson.

00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:42.820
 Oh, thank you, Mr. Bradley.

00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:43.820
 Take a chair.

00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:44.820
 Thank you.

00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:48.900
 I hope you'll pardon my appearance, but we had some difficulty in the boy's locker room

00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:55.420
 and I was giving the plumber a hand and, well, I'm afraid I got quite a dowsing from one of the joints.

00:21:55.420 --> 00:22:00.620
 Well, I wouldn't intrude on your time like this, Mr. Bradley, but it is rather important.

00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:06.580
 quite all right I'm always happy to see one of my mother's now what is our little problem

00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:12.140
 well it is a little problem I trust well I just spoke to Mr Anderson on the phone and

00:22:12.140 --> 00:22:18.100
 he agreed if the boy's family feels that way that is well could you look into Kathleen's

00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:22.060
 marks and tell us if it would be all right if we were to send her to my sister and Chicago

00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:27.460
 for a few weeks you want to take her out of school yes come in Mr Bradley I ran all the

00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:32.460
 way downtown during study hall see but all they'd give me was two packages packages of what?

00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:37.300

00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:41.380

00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:57.020
 (audience laughing)

00:22:57.020 --> 00:22:58.580
 I've seen better.

00:22:58.580 --> 00:23:00.100
 And here, you may have a bath.

00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:01.100
 I'm below the hall.

00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:01.940
 - What?

00:23:01.940 --> 00:23:02.780
 - You mean this is my--

00:23:02.780 --> 00:23:04.740
 - And if you're going to leave personal things

00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:07.060
 in our mailbox, might I suggest you address it

00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:08.820
 to the person to whom it's intended?

00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:11.580
 - Oh boy, Mrs. Anderson, you don't know how I've been

00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:14.340
 trying to put my hands on this.

00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:16.780
 - Mr. Bradley, please excuse my bawaging right in,

00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:18.980
 but this is a matter that simply can't be overlooked.

00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:20.340
 - Miss Eddie, I have a visitor.

00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:22.780
 - Yes, and I apologize, but Mr. Bradley,

00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:24.540
 My radiator is knocking against it.

00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:26.340
 Eddie, I can't discuss it now.

00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:27.140
 But Mr. Bradley...

00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:28.820
 You just go back to your class, Miss Eddie,

00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:30.980
 and I'll get to your knocking as soon as I can.

00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:32.460
 Okay.

00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:35.780
 Oh, uh, Miss Mercedes, I've got good news for you.

00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:38.140
 Mrs. Anderson, just located my composition.

00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:40.580
 Composition? You were all fat in the composition.

00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:41.460
 Oh, sure.

00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:42.900
 But let me have it, Henry.

00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:44.740
 And don't be late for class.

00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:47.500
 We're going to read these aloud in alphabetical order.

00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:51.140
 [audience laughter]

00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:52.180
 Yes, Miss Eddie.

00:23:52.180 --> 00:23:54.180
 That's going to be red in class?

00:23:54.180 --> 00:23:55.480
 Sure, Mrs. Anderson.

00:23:55.480 --> 00:24:03.180
 Well, I don't like to boost my own talents, but I think the class will say that's one of the most interesting compositions they've ever heard.

00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:04.180
 [Laughing]

00:24:04.180 --> 00:24:15.180
 [Music]

00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:18.680
 Would you like another cold compress for your head, Mary?

00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:23.280
 Come on, first. Mother, the only thing I want from my head is a shotgun.

00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:26.480
 Now, Mary, you're taking this whole thing much too seriously.

00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:31.080
 Too seriously when every person in town knows my entire private life?

00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:32.280
 Mary.

00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:39.880
 Mother, if that's a certain person, tell him that as far as I'm concerned, he and I are no longer in the same family.

00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:41.280
 Mary, really.

00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:46.280
 Oh, that's so came, Mother. Mary has every right to feel the way she does.

00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:50.280
 Boy, if I had a letter of mine that read in the book.

00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:53.280
 [indistinct chatter]

00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:56.280
 Henry, and I just want you to know, Mary,

00:24:56.280 --> 00:25:00.280
 I made a mental note of every kid in that class laughed.

00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:04.280
 And it'll be all on day before I'll even give them a short hello.

00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:06.280
 Oh!

00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:08.280
 Henry, I think you better leave Mary alone.

00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:10.280
 Yes, Mother.

00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:14.280
 Mary.

00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:16.280
 No, what?

00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:21.280
 Well, if it'll make you feel any better, I got an "A" for your letter.

00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:24.280
 For sincerity and atmosphere.

00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:28.280
 I'll get the phone.

00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:33.280
 Don't come in here, Homer. Mary's not in the mood for a human company.

00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:34.280
 I don't think.

00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:38.280
 Listen, Henry, don't get mad. I mean, you know how these things happen.

00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:39.280
 What thing?

00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:42.280
 Well, I've got kind of bad news for you.

00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:45.540
 You know that $2 we were paid for delivering the circulars?

00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:46.400
 You lost it?

00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:47.060
 No.

00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:48.720
 It just disappeared.

00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:49.720
 Homer.

00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:51.480
 I'll be done if I know where it went or if.

00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:53.180
 Sure I had it this morning.

00:25:53.180 --> 00:25:57.720
 Homer, you mean I went through all that I did today and I'm not getting any money besides?

00:25:57.720 --> 00:26:00.360
 Well, my goodness. Some people are so lucky.

00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:01.960
 That was Mrs. Scott on the phone.

00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:02.820
 Mrs. Scott?

00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:09.160
 Yes, she got a paper napkin in the mail this morning and she unfolded it a while ago and there were two dollar bills in it.

00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:10.560
 What?

00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:11.060
 What?

00:26:11.060 --> 00:26:13.320
 And she doesn't even know what she did to win.

00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:14.760
 Homer, come on.

00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:16.080
 Henry, where are you going?

00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:18.480
 Just one certain place, mother, and just

00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:21.360
 go through one last simple explanation.

00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:24.360
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:34.560
 Hi, kids.

00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:36.200
 I'm Henry and Dolly.

00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:38.800
 I got your invitation and the answer is yours.

00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:39.520
 Why?

00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:42.720
 For Agnes, invitation, what are you talking about?

00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:46.320
 For the letter left at my door this morning asking me to the school dance.

00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:49.120
 Find Henry Aldrich by!

00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:50.320
 Now listen, Henry!

00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:52.420
 Now listen yourself, Homer.

00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:54.920
 Right now, Mary won't even speak to me.

00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:58.320
 We're out the two bucks we made this morning and now...

00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:03.320
 And just what else did you stop in those envelopes this morning, Homer?

00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:06.320
 Yes, things can get complicated like that.

00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:08.020
 But haven't you noticed this, ladies?

00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:12.520
 No matter how many things there are to do around the house if they never gets too complicated,

00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:15.520
 to turn out one of those easy to fix jello desserts.

00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:21.720
 Yes, jello and those six delicious flavors, strawberry, raspberry, cherry, orange, lemon and lime.

00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:24.920
 All six are rich with that wonderful locked in goodness.

00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:29.420
 Flavors attempting and fruit-like, it reminds you of the orchard and the berry patch.

00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:33.020
 No wonder jello is America's favorite gelatin dessert.

00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:35.220
 So look for the big red letters on the box.

00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:38.900
 They spell Jell-O and Jell-O spells a treat.

00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:43.180
 That name Jell-O is the registered trademark of General Foods.

00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:46.140
 The Oldridge family starring Ezra Stone is Henry with Jackie

00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:49.340
 Kelka's Homer is written by Norman Tokar and Ed Juris

00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:51.100
 with music by Jack Miller.

00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:54.580
 Mr. and Mrs. Aldridge are House Jamison and Catherine Roth.

00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:56.820
 And this is Dan Seymour in New York saying,

00:27:56.820 --> 00:28:00.180
 "The Oldridge family is brought to you by the Jell-O family."

00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:01.180
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:05.020
 Oh, the big red letters stand for the Jell-O family.

00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:08.440
 Oh, the big red letters stand for the yellow family

00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:12.200
 Thanks, yellow, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum

00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:14.520
 Yellow has the octopodding

00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:17.080
 Yes, sorry!
