 The Aldrich family on NBC.

 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
 Henry!

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
 Henry Aldrich!

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.000
 Coming, Mother!

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:22.000
 Yes, it's the Aldrich family, it's transcribed.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
 Written by Clifford Goldsmith.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:43.080
 Boys always look forward to growing up and becoming men.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:48.640
 But once that's happened, they often enough look back upon the time when they were boys.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.280
 Those were the good old days, and with a teenage boy like Henry Aldridge around, they were

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.240
 also the unpredictable days.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.740
 The scene opens in the all-ridge living room. The time is early evening.

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:00.740
 Mary.

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:01.740
 Oh, Mary.

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:02.740
 What is it, Henry?

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:04.740
 Have you seen my new wristwatch anyplace?

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:06.740
 Your wristwatch? Where did you leave it?

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.740
 I didn't leave it anyplace. I just can't find it.

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.240
 Mary, you haven't finished what you were doing in the kitchen.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.240
 I'm going right back there, Mother.

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.740
 And, Henry, I want you to go upstairs and get washed.

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.740
 Yes, Mother. Just as soon as I finish looking for something.

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.740
 And, wash especially well there. Remember Aunt Harry, it's going to be here for dinner.

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:22.740
 You're sure I know.

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.740
 And you know how closely she looks at things.

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.040
 May I ask why you're upsetting all the cushions on the sofa?

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.040
 Nothing.

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.240
 Oh, well, I just happened to be looking for something.

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.240
 I certainly hope you wrote Aunt Harriet and thanked her for the lovely wristwatch she sent you.

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.240
 Yes, Mother, I wrote it a minute. I heard she was coming.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:47.240
 You didn't find anything out of the ordinary when you swept under the sofa, did you?

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.240
 What would you call out of the ordinary?

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.240
 Nothing.

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.240
 Just dust or something.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.240
 What time shall I put the potatoes on?

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:57.240
 Henry, what time is it?

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.240
 Well, it's exactly...

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.240
 Well, it's about...

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.240
 Well, I would say...

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.240
 The time is exactly 26 minutes after 6.

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.240
 Hello, Father. Boy, am I glad to see you.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.240
 Put the potatoes on right away, Mary.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.240
 Henry, I hope you're going to wash before Aunt Harriet gets here.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.240
 You sure, Father? I'll attend to it right after I...

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:14.240
 After I...

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.240
 May I ask why you're crawling around on the carpet?

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.240
 I just wanted to look under this chair for a minute, Father.

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:26.240
 Father, have you seen anything lying around that sort of round and shiny?

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.240
 That's just why.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.240
 Well if you saw it you couldn't help but notice it.

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.240
 Father, mother wants to know if you'll bring that picture and Harriet gave us down from the attic.

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:35.240
 Which one?

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.240
 The Colosseum and ruins.

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.240
 Oh yes, I'll go right up and get it.

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.240
 And Henry, mother says that at dinner you're to sit on and Harriet's right.

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:46.240
 On a right? Or she can see my left wrist?

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:51.240
 Henry Aldrich do you mean to say you lost that beautiful wristwatch she sent you?

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.240
 No, Mary, I'm sure I can find it.

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:58.240
 My goodness, if you can't, you know how depressed Dan Harriet gets over a thing like that.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.240
 That isn't the half of it. She said if I took good care of it, next time she'd give me a camera.

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.240
 Henry, have you dressed yet?

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.240
 Right away, Mother.

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:08.240
 I want you to spend at least 20 minutes getting clean.

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.240
 Yes, Mother.

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.240
 And don't forget to take your wristwatch off before you get in the shower.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.240
 Oh boy.

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:20.240
 Mary, if anyone asks where I am, tell them I'll be right back.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:21.240
 Where are you going?

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:25.240
 I just happen to remember, I left my watch across the street at Elinor's. I'll be right back.

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:41.240
 Can't you help me look for my watch, Homer?

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.240
 Are you sure you left it here at my house?

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.640
 house I must have I've just been over Delanois and it isn't there

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.680
 Henry I don't see how you could lose a watch in my room

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.840
 this is where I remember wearing it last

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.680
 well she was Homer let me see that watch you have on

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.080
 now listen Henry this isn't yours exactly like mine Homer

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.960
 well sure it's the same make but is your strap one as much as this

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.520
 no was your second hand gone

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:11.120
 no but if I could borrow your wrist watch just for the scene

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.720
 No, Henry, you don't know how to take care of her watch.

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.920
 I've never ruined the strap or busted my second hand, have I?

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:18.920
 No, but you've lost the whole watch.

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:22.520
 Listen, Homer.

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.520
 If I give you a half interest in the camera, somebody might be going to give me.

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.520
 Would you let me wear your watch tonight?

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.920
 What could what half the camera do?

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.020
 All right, then, Homer.

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:37.520
 If I give you all of my allowance for the week of February 15th, will you let me borrow your watch?

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.620
 Why would I have to wait that long?

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.620
 I owe everything until then.

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.120
 I wouldn't be interested.

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.120
 But Homer, supposing my aunt Harry had asked me what time it is.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.620
 So supposing my parents asked me what time it is.

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.120
 All right, give me a phone call. I'll be glad to tell you.

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:57.620
 Would you... would you give me, uh, two weeks allowance?

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.620
 Sure, it's a deal. Okay, it's a deal.

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.620
 Shake, shake, shake.

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:08.120
 And Homer, if there's ever anything I can do for you of any nature whatsoever, just you name it.

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.720
 Hey, Henry, here's my watch.

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.120
 Boy, thanks, Homer.

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.120
 Gee, I've got to run.

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:16.120
 It's a good thing we're eating dinner lights and I'll be careful with it.

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:17.120
 Homer!

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.120
 What is it, Mother?

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.120
 You have the correct time.

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.120
 Why, uh...

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.120
 Exactly twelve minutes to seven, Mrs. Brown.

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:28.120
 Homer, could you come here a minute, please?

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.120
 But, Mother, don't you think I ought to straighten up the house first?

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.120
 Will you please come here?

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.120
 Well, sure.

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.120
 Something gone wrong, Mother.

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.120
 May I see your watch please?

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:45.180
 My watch I didn't buy any chance here you say you were giving it to Henry did I?

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:47.460
 Said Henry

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:52.320
 Well, I certainly didn't give it to him. I loaned him my watch home a brown

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:55.460
 But mother he's gonna give me his allowance for the last two weeks in February

00:05:55.460 --> 00:06:00.100
 Oh, but do you realize how much your father paid for that watch? You mean I should give him part of the money?

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:06.960
 I want you to march over to Henry's house and get that wrist watch this minute right now at once

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:08.540
 But mother, isn't a bargain a bargain?

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:10.360
 - Former, do you want me to take your father?

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:11.260
 - Okay, I'll go.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.400
 - And if you dare come home without your watch,

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.640
 you'll go without your allowance for one entire month.

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:36.920
 (

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:38.400
 for you Harriet.

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:41.000
 Cabs liver would have been good enough.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000
 Where's Henry?

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.040
 He ought to be down any minute, Anne Harriet.

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:46.600
 I heard him run upstairs just a little while ago.

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:49.400
 Father never let us be late when we were children.

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:50.240
 Henry?

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:51.240
 Yes Father?

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:54.080
 Do you realize we're pratting we through with dinner?

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:55.080
 I'll be right there.

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:57.080
 I'm washing.

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:59.040
 Sam, as long as you have so much steak,

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:00.840
 give me that piece next to the bone.

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:03.760
 Certainly.

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:04.760
 What on earth is that?

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:06.040
 Henry!

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:08.440
 Hello Aunt Harriet. How are you, Henry?

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:09.740
 Fine.

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:11.940
 No, I'm awfully sorry I'm late.

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:13.640
 Didn't you know what time it was?

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:16.640
 Oh, yes, Father. It's ten minutes after seven.

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:19.640
 Henry, you mean your father?

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:20.240
 What, Mary?

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:21.340
 Nothing.

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:22.340
 Nothing.

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:24.140
 Well, you have some grand Aunt Harriet.

00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:25.440
 No, thank you.

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:28.940
 Aunt Harriet, I can't tell you how much I appreciate the watch you gave me.

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:30.840
 Why didn't you write me about it?

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:32.240
 I did. Didn't you get my letters?

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:33.340
 I did not.

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:35.340
 Oh, let me see the watch, Henry.

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:37.340
 You mean up close?

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:40.780
 I hope I got that baby.

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:44.060
 No, I'll see who it is. Mary, pass Aunt Harry at the potato.

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:44.940
 Yes, mother.

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:47.180
 So you really like the watch, Henry.

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:49.260
 Aunt Harry, I wouldn't part with it for anything.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.100
 Good evening, Mrs. Albridge.

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:53.580
 Hello, Homer. Can I speak to Henry a minute?

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:55.660
 I'm sorry, but Henry's at dinner.

00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:57.260
 But I just have to see him.

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:58.940
 We're having a guest, Homer.

00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:01.660
 Well, uh, if I go into the dining room and speak to him...

00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:04.460
 You'd better go back home and see him tomorrow morning.

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:06.860
 Oh no, I can't. I'll wait here until he's through.

00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:08.860
 But Henry'll be busy all evening.

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:10.300
 Good Mrs. Aldridge.

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:13.820
 I'm quite sure anything you have to say can wait until morning.

00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:15.020
 Goodbye, dear.

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:16.700
 Okay, Mrs. Aldridge.

00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:18.060
 You feel me?

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:19.340
 Who isn't it, Alice?

00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:22.780
 My goodness, Homer Brown never comes over to this house,

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:24.220
 except when we're eating.

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:25.020
 Who doesn't?

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:25.980
 Homer.

00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:26.700
 Oh, Homer?

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:28.460
 Homer Brown?

00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:30.940
 He's the only Homer you know, isn't he?

00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:33.940
 Well, what's the matter with him?

00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:34.940
 Nothing, nothing.

00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:36.940
 Are you all through Henry?

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:37.940
 Yes, Father, I caught up with you.

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:38.940
 I'll clear the table, then.

00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:42.940
 Mary, you help for the dinner. I'm sure Henry would be glad to clear the table.

00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:44.940
 Oh, yes, Mother. For sure.

00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:47.940
 Should Aunt Harriet keep her watch? I mean, or four?

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:50.940
 No, dear. We have clean ones.

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:51.940
 Oh, okay.

00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:53.940
 Henry, don't break anything going through that door!

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:55.940
 No, I won't.

00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:57.940
 But everything on the big kitchen table, dear.

00:08:57.940 --> 00:08:59.940
 Yes, Mother.

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:04.940
 You know, if a body meets a body coming through the right...

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:06.940
 [Singing]

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:07.940
 Henry!

00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:08.940
 Hey Henry!

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:09.940
 She was... who's that?

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:10.940
 It's me!

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:11.940
 Well, where are you?

00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:13.940
 Here, behind the refrigerator.

00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:15.940
 [Laughter]

00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:17.940
 Listen, Henry, I've got to have my watch.

00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:19.940
 But listen, Homer, I didn't pay any for the use of it.

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:21.940
 But if I don't get it, I'll lose a month's allowance.

00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:23.940
 Oh, you can't go back in a bargain.

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:25.940
 But you shouldn't have talked me into it.

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:26.940
 Listen, Homer.

00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:27.940
 Do I or don't, I get my watch.

00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:33.060

00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:01.880
 But Mother, why not at least let Mary? She's gonna do things like that.

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:03.880
 Mary's done more than her share.

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:04.380
 But I haven't.

00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:05.380
 Please sit down.

00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:08.380
 I'll be right back with the pie, Harriet.

00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:10.380
 What's the matter with you, Henry?

00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:11.380
 Well, um...

00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:15.380
 Well, I just don't like to see my own mother wear herself to pieces.

00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:19.380
 And must you drink an entire glass of water in one gulp?

00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:22.380
 Oh! My goodness gracious!

00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:24.380
 Henry, what are you doing?

00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:24.880
 What?

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:26.880
 Here, let me slap you on the back.

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:28.880
 All right, Aunt Harriet.

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:31.380
 What do you think I found in the kitchen?

00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:33.380
 Listen, Mother, let me explain.

00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:36.880
 Explain, I let the burner on under a new pan.

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:38.380
 You left the burner on?

00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:39.380
 I did.

00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:41.380
 Here, Harriet is a piece of pie for you.

00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:45.380
 Well, I couldn't eat a piece that big unless there's some cheese to go with it.

00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:47.380
 Mm, I have the cheese right here.

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:47.880
 Fine.

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:49.380
 Where are you going now, Mother?

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:51.380
 Back to get the rest of the pie.

00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:52.380
 I don't want to be.

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:54.380
 But Henry, the rest of us might.

00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:55.380
 Oh sure.

00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:56.380
 Of course.

00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:57.380
 Mary!

00:10:57.380 --> 00:10:58.380
 Yes, Mother.

00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:02.380
 How many pieces of pie did you cut?

00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:03.380
 Five.

00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:05.380
 Well, I growed in two.

00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:08.380
 And when I just went back out, there were only two left.

00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:10.380
 There's one missing?

00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:11.380
 There is.

00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:13.380
 I guess Mary only cut four.

00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:15.380
 But I'm sure I cut five.

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:16.380
 Well, don't go back, Mother.

00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:17.380
 I can't eat a thing.

00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:19.380
 It's the best pie I ever ate.

00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:21.380
 (whistling)

00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:24.380
 - What did that mean?

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:26.380
 (whistling)

00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:28.380
 - That whistle? - Yes.

00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:31.380
 - Oh, I imagine it's just one of the fellas outside

00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:33.380
 or something. - Well, it sounded as though

00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:35.380
 it were right here in this house.

00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:37.380
 - It sounded as though it was in the cellar.

00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:39.380
 - In the cellar, Mary?

00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:40.380
 - Well, that's ridiculous.

00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:41.380
 But you is.

00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:43.380
 What is there in the cellar that would whistle?

00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:45.380
 (whistling)

00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:48.380
 - Will you have some saul and heria on my pie?

00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:50.380
 Some people like it.

00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:55.380
 My goodness!

00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:56.380
 Isn't that strange?

00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:59.380
 Sam, is the hot water heater down in the basement alright?

00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:01.380
 Perhaps I'd better go down and see.

00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:02.380
 You just said, "No father, finish your pie."

00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:04.380
 I'm halfway out to the kitchen already.

00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:06.380
 It was then just turned the draft off.

00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:08.380
 Yes, father.

00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:12.380
 Hey Homer.

00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:15.380
 Homer!

00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:20.180
 Home, are you down here in the basement?

00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:22.580
 Yes, and I want my wrist watch.

00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:24.980
 Boy, it's dark down here.

00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:26.180
 Where are you?

00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:28.980
 In the Colbin.

00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:31.180
 Listen, Homer, do you want me to get into serious trouble?

00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:34.580
 Do you want me to go up and tell your Aunt Harriet that's my watch you have?

00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:35.580
 Homer, I beg of you.

00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:38.180
 With all that's decent inside you, please don't go off.

00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:39.580
 I'm going up right now.

00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:41.580
 All right, Homer, all right.

00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:43.180
 Here's your watch.

00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:45.180
 Gee whiz.

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:46.600
 She wears, did you drop it?

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:48.180
 I didn't even have it, you dropped it!

00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:49.180
 Where is it?

00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:51.580
 Don't you have any likeness part of yourself?

00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:54.180
 Why would you want to light Nicole Ben?

00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:55.980
 Are you sure you aren't stepping on it?

00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:58.480
 If I am, Henry, you'll be responsible.

00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:01.180
 That's a funny thing.

00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:03.180
 Hello around the floor, and there isn't any sign of it.

00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:05.180
 Let me feel.

00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:06.680
 Hey, do you have it?

00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:08.680
 No, it's a lump of coal.

00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:10.180
 [LAUGHTER]

00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:11.180
 Hey, what's that?

00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:13.180
 My foot.

00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:17.740
 Here, I just found this broom. Stand up in the corner there while I try to find it sweeping.

00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:18.240
 Okay.

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:20.240
 Edra!

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:21.580
 Yes, Father?

00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:23.560
 What are you doing down there?

00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:25.660
 I'm sweeping the cellar!

00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:28.660
 Waking it?

00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:31.260
 Well, it's something I should have done weeks ago.

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:34.220
 Homer, Homer, I found it. It's okay.

00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:34.720
 Oh, yeah?

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:36.860
 Look out, look out, Edra!

00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:43.860
 [ Laughter ]

00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:45.860
 Homer?

00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:47.860
 [ Laughter ]

00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:49.860
 Homer, are you Barry?

00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:53.860
 [ Laughter ]

00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:55.860
 Henry.

00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:58.860
 Just give me my watch and let me go home.

00:13:58.860 --> 00:13:59.860
 Henry!

00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:01.860
 Quick, Homer, my father's coming.

00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:02.860
 Well, let me up the stairs.

00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:03.860
 You have to go upstairs. You gotta go in here.

00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:04.860
 In where?

00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:07.260
 This little room of my father has his work bench and his tools.

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:08.660
 Okay, but to me my watch.

00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:10.860
 And Ray.

00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:12.660
 Don't bother to come down, Father.

00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:14.060
 What's the trouble out there?

00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:14.960
 Are you in there, Homer?

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:15.360
 Yeah.

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:16.460
 How close the door tight?

00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:18.160
 My camp is no latch on the inside.

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:19.060
 You're all close it.

00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:22.160
 Henry, you didn't give me my watch.

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:26.360
 Henry, I asked why you'll keep me in the cello while you're at it.

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:27.760
 Having dinner with us?

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:30.760
 Well, I guess I just didn't stop the thing, Father.

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:32.960
 Who closed the door to my work room?

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:33.760
 Could I have?

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:36.160
 I certainly hope you didn't snap that locks on.

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:37.760
 It's not by itself.

00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:39.560
 That's a nice state of affairs.

00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:42.960
 I've told everyone in this house I've lost both keys to that lock

00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:45.360
 and it must not be closed.

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:46.760
 You mean it can't be open?

00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:49.760
 Not until I get a locksmith tomorrow morning.

00:14:49.760 --> 00:15:03.160

 - Henry! - Yes, Father?

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:36.160
 - Where are you? - I'm in the kitchen asking Mary if there's anything I can do to help her.

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:40.760
 Your Aunt Herod has been waiting here in the living room for you to come and play Kana's still with her.

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:42.760
 Yes, Father, I'll be right there.

00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:45.160
 Listen, Mary, did you put in that phone call?

00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:47.160
 - Yes, Henry. - What did the Rock Smith say?

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:49.760
 His wife said she'd send him over the minute he got home.

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:52.760
 Don't you tell her Homer's been locked in the cellar for more than an hour and a half?

00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:54.760
 Yes, and she was very much impressed.

00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:55.760
 And Ray!

00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:58.760
 I'm coming right away, Father!

00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:01.760
 Don't forget, Henry, what you promised to do for me for putting in that call.

00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:04.760
 All right, Mary, I'll make your bed for you every morning for two weeks.

00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:08.760
 And if I forget to make it, don't hesitate to remind me.

00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:09.760
 Coming, Father!

00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:12.760
 Well, it's about time.

00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:14.760

00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:19.720
 Yes, Aunt Harriet. I give us each 15.

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:23.260
 Henry, do you know anything about Homer Brown?

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:24.260
 Homer?

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:27.760
 Mrs. Brown just phoned he hasn't been home all evening.

00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:29.760
 Is that right?

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:33.760
 Oh, the way this younger generation stays out nowadays.

00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:34.760
 My first job?

00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:35.760
 Yes, Aunt Harriet.

00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:38.760
 His mother hasn't seen him for two hours.

00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:41.760
 Boy, does time fly in a crisis.

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:42.760
 In a crisis?

00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:43.760
 Out of the door.

00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:45.760
 Oh, you stay right here and play canasta.

00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:47.000
 But that might be for me.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.160
 I'll see who it is.

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:49.260
 I'm on my way now.

00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:52.060
 Now if only I can get a few wild cards.

00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:54.460
 How do you do?

00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:55.060
 How do you do?

00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:56.160
 Sorry to kept you waiting.

00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:57.760
 Kept me waiting?

00:17:57.760 --> 00:17:58.360
 Yes ma'am.

00:17:58.360 --> 00:17:59.960
 I'm the locksmith you phone for.

00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:01.660
 Who is it, Mother?

00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:04.760
 Henry, ask your father if he phone for a locksmith.

00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:06.260
 Did there one out there?

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:07.060
 Yes, sir.

00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:08.660
 Well, I can phone for you,

00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:11.160
 but I do have a job downstairs you might attend to.

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:12.860
 Tomorrow morning, saying?

00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:14.560
 Father, who is it?

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:16.560
 Henry, would you please discard?

00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:18.860
 You got somebody locked up downstairs.

00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:24.360
 Locked up?

00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:25.360
 No, sir.

00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:28.560
 Well, this place I was called to has an emergency of some kind.

00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:30.660
 An emergency?

00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:31.360
 Yeah.

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:33.560
 I better go back to shop and check with my wife.

00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:36.060
 Oh, I'm sorry. This isn't the house you wanted.

00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:38.260
 Ah, that's okay, lady. All in a day's work.

00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:39.360
 See you tomorrow, sir.

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:41.360
 Father's the man gone?

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:42.060
 Yes.

00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:43.360
 Well, well...

00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:45.400
 Is Mary still out in the kitchen?

00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:46.260
 Yes, dear.

00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:48.060
 I think I'll get Aunt Harry at a glass of water.

00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:49.560
 I don't want any water.

00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:52.760
 Well, she was-- I'll be very glad to get Aunt Harry.

00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:53.460
 Mary?

00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:54.860
 What is it, Henry?

00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:56.660
 Mary, you got to phone that locksmith again.

00:18:56.660 --> 00:18:57.460
 Aunt Nicole?

00:18:57.460 --> 00:18:59.160
 Sure, only they send him away.

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:00.660
 Why'd they do that?

00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:03.260
 Mary, don't you realize my best friend is down in the basement

00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:04.960
 locked in that tool room?

00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:06.660
 Navy without air?

00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:09.460
 Henry, if you think I'm going to make myself ridiculous by phoning

00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:12.460
 that locksmith every 10 minutes, you are crazy.

00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:13.660
 Look, Mary.

00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:16.660
 Would you be interested if I also sweep your room out for you every morning?

00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:17.660
 Well...

00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:19.660
 Henry, where's that Jack's water?

00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:21.660
 I'm running at her, if...

00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:22.660
 Oh, I...

00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:26.660
 Henry, I'm putting the full responsibility for homeless condition on your shoulders.

00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:29.660
 'Cause when Homer comes to will, you'll want to know who did this to him.

00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:31.660
 Henry, I haven't even seen Homer!

00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:32.660
 Henry!

00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:34.660
 Yes, Aunt Harriet, come in!

00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:37.660
 Here's your glass of ice cold water.

00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:38.660
 Thank you.

00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:41.660
 What did you do? Let the hot water run?

00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:43.660
 That war?

00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:45.660
 I'll put it down and let it cool.

00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:47.660
 I'll put that in a couple.

00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:49.660
 Now, where are we in our game?

00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:51.660
 Not very far, I'll tell you that.

00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:53.660
 Well, let's see.

00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:55.660
 I discarded it, didn't I?

00:19:55.660 --> 00:19:57.660
 I discarded it.

00:19:57.660 --> 00:19:59.660
 Oh. Well, then it must be my turn.

00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:10.660
 Sam, is that someone sewing wood?

00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:11.660
 What?

00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:14.660
 It's bought someone's saw in wood.

00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:18.660
 Well, well, well, let's see what cards I've got here.

00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:21.660
 I thought I heard a saw.

00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:23.660
 You still haven't discarded, Henry.

00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:24.660
 Haven't I?

00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:31.660
 Let's see now, let's see.

00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:32.660
 Well, well, well.

00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:35.660
 What do you mean, well, well, well? Put your card down.

00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:37.660
 I thought I heard that sawing again.

00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:39.660
 It's not as though it came from the basement.

00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:41.660
 Maybe it's the hot water heater again.

00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:43.660
 I didn't even hear that.

00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:45.660
 Well, if you listen there, you'll hear something.

00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:46.660
 Now listen.

00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:48.660
 (humming)

00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:50.660
 Henry, would you please stop singing?

00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:52.660
 I'd like to hear where that sawing is.

00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:54.660
 Oh, excuse me.

00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:57.660
 Dad, Harry, did you know I've been taking piano lessons?

00:20:57.660 --> 00:20:58.660
 I'll wait for you.

00:20:58.660 --> 00:20:59.660

00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:00.660
 Yes, mother?

00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:02.660
 I want you to sit down at that car table,

00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:05.660

 Oh, Mrs. Alvin's.

00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:38.220
 Homer!

00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:39.220
 Mother?

00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:40.220
 Is that Homer?

00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:41.220
 Can they stay here?

00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:44.220
 Homer, what on earth do you have on your clothes?

00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:46.220
 Just a little call, Mrs. Alvin.

00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:50.220
 Do you realize your mother has been worried sick about you?

00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:53.220
 Well, I'll tell you the truth. I've been a little upset myself.

00:21:53.220 --> 00:22:00.220
 Mrs. Alvin, may I please go on the living room and speak to Henry?

00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:06.020
 speak to Henry? Well, would you mind going upstairs first and washing your face and hands?

00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:08.920
 Okay, but then do you mind please speak with Henry?

00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:20.020
 What's the score, Harriet?

00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:24.120
 I'm nearly 5,000 and as soon as I've beaten Henry, I'm going home.

00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:26.220
 Oh, Marie, how would you like another glass of ginger ale?

00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:30.220
 You're young men. Do you realize this is the fourth bottle you've had?

00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:31.220
 It is.

00:22:31.220 --> 00:22:34.220
 Well, if you drink anymore, you're going to go right up in the air.

00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:35.220
 Mr. Palmer!

00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:36.220
 Yes, Mary.

00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:38.220
 Your mother wants to speak to you on the phone.

00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:40.220
 Okay, I'll be right back, him.

00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:44.220
 Do you mean to say he's actually going to leave this room for a minute?

00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:47.220
 Well, I had a nice nap.

00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:50.220
 Father, you've been asleep for two hours.

00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:51.220
 Is that so?

00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:53.220
 Well, I'm glad to see Homer's gone.

00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:55.220
 What makes you think he's gone?

00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:56.220
 think he's gone.

00:22:56.220 --> 00:22:58.220
 Where is he?

00:22:58.220 --> 00:23:00.120
 He's phoning for his pajamas.

00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:06.420
 Oh, Father, it's just a question of time.

00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:09.020
 As soon as his Aunt Harriet goes, I've got this.

00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:10.220
 He's got what?

00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:13.120
 Oh, well, whatever it is, I've had enough for one night.

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:14.120
 You mean, you're quitting?

00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:14.820
 I am.

00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:17.620
 Oh, Henry, I never did get to look at your watch.

00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:19.320
 It's exactly eight minutes after ten.

00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:20.820
 Well, I'd like to see it, please.

00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:24.020
 Well, well, it's just one little thing I'd like to explain.

00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:25.620
 Please give it to me.

00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:26.920
 Yes ma'am.

00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:27.920
 Here it is.

00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:28.920
 Henry!

00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:31.820
 Did you know the second hand is missing?

00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:33.020
 Well now that you mention it.

00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:35.720
 And just look how this strap is worn through.

00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:38.020
 Henry I thought you promised to take good care of your watch.

00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:39.520
 I didn't do that father.

00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:44.520
 Henry, how would you like to have me take this down to the jewelers and have it fixed?

00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:45.520
 Machine and Harry.

00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:49.020
 And while I'm there, I can have them put your monogram on it.

00:23:49.020 --> 00:23:50.520
 Who's monogram Henry?

00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:52.520
 Who's monogram on what?

00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:55.520
 (audience laughing)

00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:58.320
 - Who, who do you think?

00:23:58.320 --> 00:23:59.680
 - You mean my initials?

00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:00.520
 - Naturally.

00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:02.640
 - Why don't they channel you like that?

00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:03.960
 - How do you know he wouldn't?

00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:05.760
 - I mean, oh, and Harriet, she wins.

00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:08.560
 - You're supposing Henry wanted to change his name sometimes?

00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:10.120
 (audience laughing)

00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:11.920
 - Do what, for instance?

00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:12.760
 (audience laughing)

00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:15.240
 - Well, to anything, be sure.

00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:16.680
 - The only girls who's their monograph.

00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:18.640
 - Nonsense, I hear you let me take this,

00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:21.280
 and sometime next week I'll have it engraved.

00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:22.720
 And Harry, I look ridiculous.

00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:23.960
 That's what I say.

00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:27.440
 Young man, you aren't jealous of Henry, are you?

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:28.400
 Why?

00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:29.080
 No.

00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:29.920
 You awake.

00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:32.680
 Someday you may have a watch too.

00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:34.840
 Well, I think I'll be going.

00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:36.200
 Already, Harry?

00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:37.280
 What do you think I am?

00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:38.520
 A night owl?

00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:40.520
 Now, where did I put that watch?

00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:41.880
 You mean you lost it?

00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:43.000
 I have.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:44.320
 Isn't it strange?

00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:47.160
 I put it right here on this table.

00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:48.400
 You, there, young man.

00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:50.200
 Where are you going with Henry's watch?

00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:53.040
 Oh, I was just going to look at it on a better light.

00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:54.360
 Well, please give it here.

00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:55.680
 Now put it in my pocketbook.

00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:56.800
 Yes, ma'am.

00:24:56.800 --> 00:25:00.800
 Yeah, Aunt Harriet, would you like to have me carry your things out of the car for you?

00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:01.960
 What things?

00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:04.200
 Well, your pocketbook?

00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:05.160
 Anything?

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:06.280
 No, thank you.

00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:10.800
 Harriet, you're supposing you help your aunt with a coat while I hold her pocketbook?

00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:14.520
 I'll put my pocketbook down right here, thank you.

00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:18.800
 Aunt Harriet, don't you want to leave it there and go upstairs and see my new wallpaper?

00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:20.720
 You're married. That's a swell idea.

00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:21.920
 You wallpaper?

00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:24.720
 Well, I'll go up and see it, but I know I won't like it.

00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:26.000
 Hand me my pocketbook.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.920
 Do you want to carry a heavy thing like that all the way upstairs?

00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:31.200
 Give it to me.

00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:34.960
 Henry, don't you think it'll be nice if we helped your aunt Harry it up the stairs?

00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:36.800
 Oh, sure. They're very steep.

00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:39.280
 Here, Aunt Harriet, we'll sort of surround you.

00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:41.440
 Let me take you around with the pocketbook on it.

00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:43.040
 That's so bad, boy.

00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:43.600
 It's Henry!

00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:44.840
 Yes, Henry.

00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:45.840
 This is very good.

00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:48.480
 Alice.

00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:49.640
 Yes, Sam.

00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:52.280
 When you please tell me what's gotten into those boys.

00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:55.200
 They're trying to be nice to Aunt Harriet.

00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:56.520
 I just like them.

00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:58.280
 [LAUGHTER]

00:25:58.280 --> 00:25:59.720
 Home is very nice.

00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:03.360
 And fond of her, Sam, he stayed near all evening.

00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:05.360
 Can't he find any girls his own age?

00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:07.120
 [LAUGHTER]

00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:13.600
 Yeah, the body needs the body coming through the white.

00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:14.360
 Yeah.

00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:15.960
 Well, Homer.

00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:17.280
 Oh, yes, Mr. Harvard?

00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:19.280
 Did you like the wallpaper?

00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:21.280
 Oh, uh, very much.

00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:23.280
 Well, Harry, I guess I'll be going.

00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:25.280
 About what time is it, Homer?

00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:28.280
 Well, my friend, it's exactly, uh, 21 minutes after 10.

00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:30.280
 Thank you very much.

00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:32.280
 Alice, what do you think I've lost?

00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:33.280
 Oh, it's a long Henry.

00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:34.280
 You late young man.

00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:36.280
 I'll drive you home.

00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:37.280
 What did you lose, Harry?

00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:40.280
 I locked my car out in front of left the keys inside.

00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:41.280
 What?

00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:43.280
 Then go out and get them.

00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:44.280
 And how would I do that?

00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:46.280
 No, no, no, no, here.

00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:51.280
 out in my pocketbook. Well, the only thing is...

00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:55.780
 Now what? Henry's watch! You mean it isn't there, Aunt Harry?

00:26:55.780 --> 00:27:00.280
 Henry, I'm going home. It's a long home. Now who's that?

00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:05.280
 That's my father, I'm on my way. Whoa, hello Eleanor.

00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:08.280
 Hello Mr. Aldrich. If Henry home, I just found his watch.

00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:10.280
 What? His watch!

00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:15.280
 Where did you find it? He left it over at my house this morning.

00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:18.780
 Now, how would you account for a thing like that?

00:27:18.780 --> 00:27:21.280
 Henry, you also let this letter you forgot to mail.

00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:22.280
 A letter?

00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:24.280
 Oh, yes.

00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:26.280
 Here, Anne-Harry, it is for you.

00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:28.280
 Thank you for my walk.

00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:40.280
 To keep the mortality rate low among our troops in Korea,

00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:44.780
 the armed forces must have an adequate reserve of blood plasma at all times.

00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:49.220
 Every American who can should make a blood donation to the armed forces through local

00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:52.580
 Red Cross chapters or local blood donor centers.

00:27:52.580 --> 00:27:56.500
 So call the Red Cross or blood bag in your community and make an appointment.

00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:59.740
 Do it now because a wounded veteran can't wait.

00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:02.140
 Remember this message from General Ridgeway.

00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:06.700
 Every American who has given blood can and should feel that he personally has contributed

00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:10.300
 directly to the saving of the life of an American boy.

00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:21.300
