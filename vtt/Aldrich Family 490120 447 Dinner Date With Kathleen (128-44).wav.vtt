00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000
 [Music]

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
 And now the Jell-O family presents...

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 Henry...

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.000
 Henry Oldridge!

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
 Coming, Mother!

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 [Applause]

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
 Yes, it's the Oldridge family based on characters

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.280
 by Clifford Goldsmith and starring Ezra Stone as Henry with Jackie Kelka's

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:37.280
 Homer. And yes, it's the Jell-O family with its three famous desserts. Jell-O in

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.280
 those six delicious flavors, Jell-O puddings with that old-fashioned

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.680
 homemade flavor, and Jell-O tapioca puddings, a miracle of goodness, a marvel of

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:48.680
 of speed.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:58.720
 Everyone's a jello good fellow, a very good jello good fellow, so rich, so tempting and

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:59.720
 mellow.

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:04.640
 J-E-L-L-O.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.360
 And now for the Aldridge family.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:20.360
 [Music]

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.360
 The memory of our youth is a priceless possession.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:31.360
 And whenever it starts to fade, there's no quicker way to brighten it up than to join the company of a teenage boy like Henry Aldrich.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.360
 The scene opens in the Aldrich kitchen. It is almost any time.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.500
 time. Henry Aldrich. I know mother and I agree with you. It's perfectly

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.140
 ridiculous for us to have a butler. My goodness. Especially this lathe. But

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.660
 couldn't we at least have finger bowls? Henry I'm using my best napkins and that's

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:54.660
 as far as I'll go. napkins mother? Just plain ordinary everyday napkins?

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:59.620
 They're their hen stitched and monogram. Alice! You know where the evening paper is.

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:02.780
 She wish father aren't even dressed yet it's nearly time.

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.100
 - Certainly I'm dressed.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.140
 - You mean you're not wearing your best suit tonight?

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:07.540
 - Henry, if this suit is good enough

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:08.900
 for my business associates,

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:11.140
 it's certainly good enough for Kathleen Anderson.

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.860
 - I know, but mother, I just got another wonderful idea.

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.420
 Why couldn't Mary wait on table?

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.920
 - Henry, how'd he eat in the kitchen?

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.420
 Henry, I'm surprised at you.

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:22.460
 - Well, not Alice.

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:25.780
 We could buy Mary a maid uniform and let her earn her keep.

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:26.620
 - Now Sam.

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.260
 - Sure, father's got the right idea.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.180
 - I often said children should work their way

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:32.060
 through the home.

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.060
 Sure.

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.660
 From now on, Henry, you can be the upstairs maid.

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:35.660
 What?

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.220
 Sam, will you please stop joking?

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.460
 In the first place, Henry, Mary isn't even going to be here for dinner.

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.500
 Mother, is that candle you're getting out?

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:44.500
 Yes, dear.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:45.900
 Gee, that's swell.

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.660
 Could we serve them in gold candelabras?

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.140
 But I don't own any gold candelabras.

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.780
 You mean, after all, your years of drudgery fathers never bought you any?

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:54.780
 No, see, here.

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.740
 Dear, we have these very nice silver candelsticks.

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:58.740
 Oh, sure.

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.660
 And I don't mean they won't be fine, but do you happen to know anyone we could borrow

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:07.500
 gold ones from? Not without putting up collateral. Collateral? And Henry, what I plan to do just

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.740
 before Kathleen gets here is to bring in all our collateral and put it right in the center

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:16.780
 of the table. Gee whiz, father. Now you're kidding. Henry, please go in the dining room

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.660
 and put the chairs around the table. That's a good idea. And I'll give Kathleen the one

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:25.900
 with the good bottom. Fine. And don't go away, mother, because I just got another idea.

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.420
 Listen, may I ask what's brought on all this? There it seems that Henry and Kathleen saw

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.320
 movie of dinner at the White House and Kathleen was so impressed that Henry

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.580
 invited her to have dinner over here. I see. He felt it was the only democratic

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:44.220
 thing to do. Mother. Excuse me. I think I'll go and sit on the balcony. But Sam we

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:50.940
 don't have a balcony. All right Alice I'll build one. What? Mother did you know you

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.320
 didn't set enough places at the table? Of course I did. Mary's going out so that

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:59.480
 leaves just four of us. But what about Homer and Agnes? What about them? Where

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:00.780
 Are they going to sit?

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:01.780
 Henry.

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:04.960
 She was, you mean, I neglected to tell you I more or less invited home her an Agnes to

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:05.960
 dinner too?

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:10.600
 But Henry, do you realize I've made individual chicken pies and I only made four of them?

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.920
 Well, gee, couldn't you just whip up a couple more?

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:14.920
 Made with canned salmon?

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.400
 Henry, do you mean you definitely invited them?

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.520
 Sure, because Homer's loaning me a bowl of fruit.

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:22.520
 What for?

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:23.520
 To put in the center of the table.

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.840
 Now, dear, we have plenty of fruit without borrowing any from Homer.

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.640
 But what he's bringing is wax, the real stuff.

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:31.000
 Oh my goodness.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.800
 And Homer wouldn't bring his fruit unless it included Agnes.

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.640
 But Henry, look at it this way.

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:39.480
 Would Homer and Agnes be invited to dinner at the White House?

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.000
 No, she was.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.640
 Well, there.

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:42.680
 But neither would we.

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.600
 Oh boy, there's Kathleen now.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.120
 Would you like me to go to the door?

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.360
 You mother and a thing like your apron?

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:49.240
 I'll get it mother.

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.080
 Then don't run, you'll get off like.

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.960
 Well, I'm not running.

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:52.760
 Where's my comb?

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:53.720
 Where's my comb?

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:54.440
 Oh, here it is.

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.280
 Oh boy, mother, where's a mirror?

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.040
 Henry, your hair looks fine.

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.240
 It's all over my face.

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:00.280
 Here, let me help you.

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.680
 Oh, she was mother. Where's my coat? I haven't got my coat on.

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.040
 Henry, it doesn't matter.

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:05.400
 It was here in the living room.

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.080
 There, please, answer the door.

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.040
 I'm like, Kathleen, walk right in on my shirt sleeve.

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.760
 Oh, here it is.

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:14.760
 Where's my sleeve? Where's my sleeve?

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:15.400
 I'm okay.

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.480
 I'll be out in the kitchen.

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:20.440
 Hello, cat--

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.200
 Henry, what took you so long?

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.960
 Oh, then what are you doing out here?

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:27.320
 I stepped outside to get the evening paper in the front door locked on me.

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.800
 A lot? But where's...

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.760
 See, I even combed my hair.

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.560
 That's why your face is all red.

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.560
 She was... no, I just got overheated.

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:40.680
 So maybe I'd just slip out of my coat for a minute.

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.040
 Don't throw it Henry, hang it up.

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:43.640
 Sure, Father, I was just going to...

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:44.680
 Oh, boy, there she is now.

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:45.800
 Father, will you please hand me my coat?

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.000
 It's only Homer.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:47.480
 Homer?

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:49.000
 I saw him coming up the street.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.240
 Oh, I should. I bother with a coat just for Homer.

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:52.360
 You mean you don't want it?

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:53.080
 No, thanks.

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.080
 Kathleen!

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:56.080
 Good evening, Henry.

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.080
 Jean, how did you get here?

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.080
 I walked.

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:02.080
 I know, but I know.

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.080
 I'm sorry about my shirt sleeves.

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:07.080
 Oh, my goodness, if I got the wrong night?

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:08.080
 No, Gee was. Come on in.

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.080
 Thank you.

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:10.080
 Boy.

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:12.080
 Thank you.

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.080
 May I take your hat?

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:16.080
 I don't have any yet, Henry.

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:18.080
 Oh, sure.

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:20.080
 Gee, Kathleen.

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:22.080
 How are you anyway?

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.780
 Just fine, thank you. How are you?

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:28.720
 Oh, I'm fine.

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:30.080
 Won't you come in the living room?

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.080
 All right.

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:33.460
 I'll just slip into my coat.

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:36.680
 There. Would you like to sit down?

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:37.880
 All right.

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:39.920
 Our sofa has one loose spring in it,

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:41.440
 as you'll eventually notice.

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:43.280
 But the chair you're getting at the dinner table

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:44.800
 is in excellent condition.

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:45.880
 (audience laughing)

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:47.880
 Do you couldn't smash it with an axe?

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:48.880
 Really?

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:51.520
 And boy, Kathleen, is my mother excited

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:56.720
 over your being here. All she's done today is talk about Kathleen Kathleen Kathleen.

00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:01.680
 I hope you're saying something nice about me. Boy I'll say she was. You know what she was

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:07.800
 even discussing just a few minutes ago? Fingerballs. Really we're having fingerballs? No chicken

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:16.320
 pot pies. This is my favorite thing. Really? Have you ever had it made with salmon? Chicken

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:17.520
 mixed with salmon?

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:19.160
 No, just salmon.

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:20.160
 (audience laughing)

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:22.240
 That sounds very interesting, Henry.

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:23.840
 Sure, but a person like Homer

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:25.320
 would never know the difference then.

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:27.560
 Henry, did I tell you how much I've been looking

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:29.680
 for with Daventon over here tonight?

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:30.920
 Do you have?

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:32.680
 This is the first date we've had

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:35.720
 in about two months that Homer hasn't tagged along on.

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:36.560
 What?

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:38.200
 And not that I've minded Henry.

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:40.160
 Homer's really a very nice boy,

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:43.200
 but frankly, and that Agnes Lawson,

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:45.080
 my goodness, I've never been so glad

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:47.580
 to get away from two people for one night in my life.

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:48.420
 But Kathleen.

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:50.500
 Every place you and I go, they want to go.

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:52.420
 Kathleen, listen.

00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:53.660
 Yes?

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:58.420
 Well, what I mean is, look, I don't think you understand Homer.

00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:00.500
 I don't think anybody does how good they.

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:01.700
 They couldn't?

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:03.940
 Well, he's always seemed to come in between us.

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:07.100
 Frankly, Henry, sometimes I can't help but get the idea that,

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:09.580
 well, you think more of Homer than you do with me.

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:11.380
 Kathleen!

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:13.980
 Gee, that's the craziest thing I ever heard.

00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:16.660
 - Why, know that now, Henry.

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:17.820
 - You do?

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:19.500
 - After you invited me, OBA to dinner,

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:21.740
 just so we could get away from him.

00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:23.940
 - Well look, before we go any further,

00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:25.740
 could I explain one thing to you?

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:27.420
 - Hey Henry!

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:28.620
 - My goodness, Homer's affected me,

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:30.420
 so I'm actually here as well.

00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:32.220
 - Kathleen, could I please tell you something?

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:34.180
 - Well, where is everybody?

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:35.300
 - Oh, here you are.

00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:36.300
 - Oh my goodness.

00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:39.180
 - Well, Homer, imagine.

00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:41.660
 - Listen, Henry, what are you so surprised about?

00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:42.820
 (laughing)

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:43.780
 - I'm not surprised.

00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:48.360
 Hi! Hi, and boy Henry, where do you see what I have for you in this bag?

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:50.520
 Homer. It's my mother's wax fruit.

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:52.780
 Yeah? Homer, could I speak to you out loud?

00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:57.780
 The only trouble is my father left it on the radiator and the banana has sort of gotten out of cover.

00:08:57.780 --> 00:08:59.780
 [laughter]

00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:02.780
 Well, look. And the apple is practically shriveled up.

00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:07.780
 But don't worry, him. My father says it's the best imitation of a baked apple he's ever seen.

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:08.780
 [laughter]

00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:09.780
 Look. Homer.

00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:12.280
 Oh, I forgot to tell you Agnes can't come.

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:13.280
 Who can't?

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:17.600
 Agnes can. She fell asleep by an open window and got a crick in her neck.

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:20.640
 Hi Kathleen, would you please shove over a little?

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:23.200
 Why? So I can sit down among you and Henry.

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:26.280
 Oh, Homer, could I please speak to you in the next room a minute?

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:29.520
 Oh, boy. You mean dinner's all ready?

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:31.520
 Dinner! Let's see. Let's see.

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:35.120
 Henry, oh, it's not two minutes ago didn't you tell me that Homer wasn't...

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:36.800
 I mean, oh me.

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:39.280
 Kathleen, I never said he wasn't. It was you.

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:41.600
 It was. I wasn't why.

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:47.600
 Kathleen, Henry, what are you both so upset about?

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:51.600
 Is it because Agnes couldn't come or because my banana melted?

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:54.600
 [audience laughter]

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:56.600
 Kathleen...

00:09:56.600 --> 00:10:08.600
 [music]

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:11.200
 I've put the salt and the potatoes, Mrs. Aldridge.

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:12.400
 Thank you, Kathleen.

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:13.600
 And what can I do now?

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:15.000
 Not another thing, dear.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.400
 And dinner won't be ready for another half hour.

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:19.800
 Why don't you just go back into the living room with Henry?

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:24.200
 Well, Mrs. Aldridge, would you be very hurt if I just stayed out here?

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:25.200
 In the kitchen?

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:28.200
 Well, as I said, Henry and I...

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:30.800
 Well, I just feel that you need some help.

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:32.600
 Kathleen, sit down.

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:34.400
 Yes, Mrs. Aldridge.

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:37.800
 Now, dear, I think I know what's happened between you and Henry.

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:41.800
 But do you really think you'll gain anything by staying out here and turning your back?

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:43.800
 But I have my pride, Mrs. Aldrich.

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:47.800
 Dear, would you mind if I gave you a little heart to heart advice?

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:48.800
 Well, no.

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:55.800
 There's one problem that every young woman, in fact every woman at any age, has to face sooner or later.

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:56.800
 You mean?

00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:59.800
 And that's how to get rid of the undesirable friends of...

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:02.800
 Well, I'm sure your mother had to face it with your father.

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:04.800
 And I had... that is...

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:06.800
 You had to do the same thing with Mr. Aldrich?

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:07.800
 Mr. Orchard.

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:09.480
 And I didn't say that.

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:12.520
 But you might as well learn how to cope with the problem right now.

00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:13.520
 Yes, Mrs. Orchard.

00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:17.840
 Now, as a general rule, as soon as you tell a man not to do something, you can be pretty

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:19.160
 sure he'll do it.

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:20.160
 Really?

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:23.480
 And the more you object to his friends, the more he's going to continue seeing those

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:24.480
 friends.

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:25.480
 My goodness.

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:27.640
 Yes, that's men, Troy, your Kathleen.

00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:30.480
 As nice as they are, they're born with that streak in them.

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:31.960
 You don't say.

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:36.640
 So my advice to you is to go back into the living room and be nice to Homer.

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:37.640
 Nice to home!

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:39.640
 Just as nice as you can be.

00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:42.040
 Perhaps even a little nicer than you are the hen.

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:43.040
 Oh no!

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:47.040
 Believe me, Kathleen, I'm more experienced in these things than you are.

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:48.440
 Do you mean...

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:51.040
 And I can count on Henry to get jealous?

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:52.440
 Absolutely.

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:55.640
 And before you know it, he'll be asking Homer to leave.

00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:56.240
 Oh my goodness.

00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:59.040
 Now, go on back in the living room while I see what the potatoes are doing.

00:11:59.040 --> 00:11:59.640
 I know, but some more.

00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:01.240
 Go on there and good luck.

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:05.240
 Oh.

00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:06.440
 Oh.

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:08.840
 I didn't realize there was anyone in the dining room.

00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:10.040
 I'm just...

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:13.160
 I'm just having sort of a discussion with my father.

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:15.720
 Good evening, Kathleen. It's nice having you here.

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:17.160
 Thank you, Mr. Aldrich.

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:19.560
 I'm sorry if I disturbed you.

00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:21.560
 Is she gone, Father?

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:23.880
 Yes, you can turn around now.

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:25.480
 Isn't she speaking to you?

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:26.600
 No, Father.

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:29.560
 And don't you agree she's being unreasonable?

00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:33.560
 Especially since I'm giving her the chair with a good bottom?

00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:33.880
 Well...

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:37.460
 And since I even spent an hour washing all the windows here in the dining room,

00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:39.680
 just so she'd have a swell time tonight.

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:40.180
 Well...

00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:41.080
 Don't you father?

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:42.880
 Frankly, I'd rather not get involved.

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:43.780
 Oh, gee.

00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:47.280
 Maybe if I explained to Homer in a nice way,

00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:49.980
 he'd go home without any hard feelings.

00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:51.180
 Now hold on a minute.

00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:52.180
 Yes, father?

00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:56.080
 Frankly, Henry, I'd hate to think that any son of mine would ever let a woman walk all over it.

00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:56.880
 Oh, sure, but...

00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:59.080
 Now, if you let Kathleen get the upper hand now,

00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:01.080
 she'll never have the proper respect for you.

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:01.680
 She won't?

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:05.040
 There's one thing, son, that every man has to stick up for above all else.

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:07.040
 And that's his right to his own friend.

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:07.540
 You mean?

00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:09.640
 Yes, Henry, I had to be firm with your...

00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:13.560
 Well, what I should say is, every man has to put his foot down once in a while.

00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:15.880
 You mean you had to be tough with mother?

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:18.320
 No, Henry, I haven't been tough.

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:20.680
 I've merely been firm with her.

00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:22.880
 And she's been a happier wife for it.

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:25.960
 Gee, now that you mentioned that father, she does seem awfully happy.

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:28.440
 Listen to her singing out there.

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:30.040
 Certainly.

00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:34.760
 My advice to you son is to march into that living room there and put your foot down on the subject of Homer.

00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:35.640
 You think so?

00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:36.760
 Simply assert your right.

00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:38.200
 When Kathleen's my guest.

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:40.120
 Isn't Homer also your guest?

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:42.680
 Before you know it, Kathleen will be eating out of your hand.

00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:43.720
 You mean I should ask?

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:45.480
 Not ask Henry.

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:46.360
 Tell her.

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:47.400
 I'll go on.

00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:48.760
 Sure.

00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:50.280
 Gee whiz, maybe you're right.

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:53.160
 Kathleen?

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:54.360
 That's the idea.

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:56.120
 Kathleen, you just see here.

00:13:56.920 --> 00:14:00.520
 Before you speak to Kathleen, could I have a word with you out in the hall?

00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:01.180
 Sure thing.

00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:01.840
 Come on.

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:03.280
 What is it, Homer, old-timer?

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:06.420
 Henry, don't call me old-timer. I can't stand it.

00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:09.600
 Listen, Homer, I just want you to know I'm putting my foot down.

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:10.240
 You are.

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:13.560
 There's one thing we men have got to do, and that's a certar right.

00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:16.840
 Henry, listen. You're looking at a heel.

00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:17.640
 You?

00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:19.400
 Homer, you're my best friend.

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:21.720
 Sure. That's what makes it so terrible.

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:22.600
 What do you mean?

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:28.020
 Henry, you're looking at a guy that just kissed his best friend's girl.

00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:28.920
 And if any...

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:29.920
 What?!

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:30.920
 Sure.

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:31.920
 You...

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:32.920
 You kissed Kathleen?

00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:33.920
 Go on, Henry.

00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:34.920
 Hit me.

00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:35.920
 Right under my own room.

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:36.920
 Go on.

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:37.920
 Go on.

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:38.920
 Put up your douche and defend yourself, Homer.

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:39.920
 Come on!

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:40.920
 Defend yourself.

00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:42.920
 Okay, I'll defend myself.

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:45.480
 Put my heart won't be in this.

00:14:45.480 --> 00:15:00.200
 [Music]

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:03.680
 And now for some folks whose hearts are really in their work.

00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:07.480
 Let's listen to Meredith Wilson and his talking people.

00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:09.880
 It's intermission time in the Aldrich family.

00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:10.680
 That's right.

00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:12.880
 And the intermission music will now commence.

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:15.080
 Intermission music? I wasn't told about this.

00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:17.680
 There's music in the taste of jello pudding.

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:20.680
 Oh, how right can you be? Luscious life.

00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:22.680
 Bonewa.

00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:23.880
 And rich chocolatey.

00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:25.080
 Joo.

00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:27.280
 And buttery brown, bony, bony.

00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:28.680
 Brrr, scotch.

00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:29.480
 They're jello pudding.

00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:31.080
 And more people buy jello puddings

00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:33.080
 than any other prepared puddings in the world.

00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:34.280
 They're nourishing.

00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:35.880
 You're darn right. They're made with milk.

00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:36.880
 They're quick, quick.

00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:39.480
 They cook to perfection in just about five minutes.

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:40.680
 They taste grand.

00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:43.480
 Grand, you can't beat those three wonderful flavors.

00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:47.640
 (singing in foreign language)

00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:51.200
 Look for the big red letters on the box

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:54.200
 and get a supply of the whole Jello family of desserts.

00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:57.680
 For ease and speed and variety, get the Jello family.

00:15:57.680 --> 00:15:59.400
 Don't say dessert, say jello.

00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:01.720
 Jello, that wonderful shivering stuff.

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:03.000
 (singing in foreign language)

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.840
 Don't say dessert, say jello.

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:06.880
 (singing in foreign language)

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:08.720
 Don't say dessert, say jello.

00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:11.240
 (singing in foreign language)

00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:12.520
 The Jello family of desserts,

00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:14.520
 If you don't want to say it, sing it.

00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:16.520
 ♪ J-E-L-L-O ♪

00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:21.520
 (dramatic music)

00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:34.520
 And now getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldrich.

00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:38.520
 Due to a slight misunderstanding with Kathleen,

00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:40.520
 Henry accepted some advice from his father

00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:45.280
 his father and went to work hoping to patch things up. Kathleen however was

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:50.360
 acting on advice from Mrs. Aldrich and the result was a black eye for Homer.

00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:54.840
 The scene opens in the Aldrich living room. It is a few minutes later.

00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:59.040
 "Adri!" "Yes Father!" "Who were you speaking to on the phone?" "I just called the

00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:02.480
 Browns father to see if they could accommodate Homer for dinner." "What's that?

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:07.160
 You're trying to get rid of Homer?" "Well considering the way Kathleen feels about it."

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:10.320
 "Henry I thought you were going to assert your rights as a man." "Sure

00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:13.320
 father that isn't my trouble anymore

00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:14.320
 no

00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:19.320
 now

00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:26.320
 what do you know where cathleen is right now up in the medicine chest giving all our attention to Homer's eye

00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:29.320
 what happened to Homer's eye?

00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:31.320
 he forgot to duck

00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:33.320
 what's that?

00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:38.320
 oh and look before I forget when I was talking to mr. Brown he said he had two tickets for the fights tonight

00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:41.100
 it is sure so i said of course you'd like to go with him

00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:42.480
 well you shouldn't have

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:46.980

00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:48.480
 ask her father

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:50.280

 get out from under your feet right after dinner

00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:08.220
 I thought I'd go to the fights with Will Brown.

00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:10.720
 Of course not, dear. I don't mind.

00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:11.620
 Good.

00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:14.120
 Only you're never really under my feet, Sam,

00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:16.620
 and we'd all be very glad to have you here after dinner.

00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:18.420
 You'll have a better time without me.

00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:21.720
 Frankly, dear, I don't see how we can entertain Henry's guests.

00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:22.920
 Alice, uh...

00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:23.620
 Yes, sir.

00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:24.420
 Uh...

00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:26.420
 Henry, what are you staring at?

00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:27.920
 Who are you? I'm just...

00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:29.920
 I'm just tying my shoes.

00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:31.920
 Well, please tie it in the living room.

00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:32.920
 Sure, Father.

00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:35.120
 And, Kathleen, is there something you want there?

00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:38.720
 Why no, Zodg, then suppose you go help Henry with his shoelace.

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:40.380
 I'd be glad to, lollary.

00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:43.160
 Alice, l'm sorry, but you'll just have to get along without me.

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:45.420
 Sam, you can't possibly walk out from the whole evening.

00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:46.380
 Alice, why not?

00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:48.020
 l'll give you several good reasons.

00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:50.120
 Henry, will you please go all the way out of the room?

00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:50.800
 Sure.

00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:53.320
 After the way l've slaved and worked over this dinner.

00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:54.360
 No, Alice, calm down.

00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:57.200
 Kathleen, will you and Henry please run along?

00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:06.700
 [music]

00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:07.560
 Come on, ass.

00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:08.600
 Come and let go!

00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:11.800
 But you've got to get out of bed and come over to the old pictures.

00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:13.200
 But what about my crip?

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:14.200
 You're what?

00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:15.000
 My crip!

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.400
 My crip and my neck, I can't hold my head.

00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:18.200
 [laughter]

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:21.600
 Aggie's nobody's asking you to walk over there on your head.

00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:22.400
 [laughter]

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:24.200
 Besides, Aggie, I need you.

00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:27.100
 Well, my goodness, Homer, I never knew you really can.

00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:29.600
 - Sure I do.

00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:31.500
 Boy, when I got this black eye,

00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:34.140
 all I could think about was good ol' lags.

00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:34.980
 - No kidding.

00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:35.800
 - Sure.

00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:36.640
 - No kidding.

00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:37.480
 - Sure.

00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:38.320
 (audience laughing)

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:39.380
 - Get into the black eye.

00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:41.140
 - Never mind, Agnes.

00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:44.180
 Oh boy, I just double crossed my best friend.

00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:45.020
 - You did.

00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:45.920
 - Sure.

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:49.460
 I can't trust myself any further than I could throw me.

00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:50.300
 - What?

00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:51.740
 - And then all of a sudden I said,

00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:54.900
 boy, if there's one person who can keep me under her heel,

00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:56.420
 it's good ol' lags.

00:19:56.420 --> 00:19:58.420
 How are you sweet?

00:19:58.420 --> 00:20:01.020
 So I don't dare go back to the old witches without you.

00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:01.620
 Come on.

00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:04.020
 But Homer, don't you understand I'm sick.

00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:06.020
 And besides, we're just going to have Dennis.

00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:06.720
 You are?

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:10.420
 And we're having my favorite dish, barbecue pork chop.

00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:12.020
 Barbecued pork chop.

00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:13.020
 Sure.

00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:15.720
 Oh boy.

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:18.120
 Why didn't you tell me that you were that sick?

00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:18.620
 What?

00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:22.820
 Boy, the only thing for me to do is stay here and look after you.

00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:35.820
 [Music]

00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:36.820
 Father.

00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:37.820
 Yes, Henry.

00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:40.820
 Won't you at least speak to mother so we can eat dinner?

00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:42.820
 I'm perfectly willing to speak to your mother.

00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:43.820
 You are?

00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:45.820
 Just as soon as she speaks to me.

00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:46.820
 [Laughter]

00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:48.820
 Did you know she's going up to her room?

00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:50.820
 And dinner's getting cold.

00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:54.980
 I'm afraid I'm not very hungry, but you and Kathleen can go ahead and eat.

00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:56.820
 Well, the only trouble is...

00:20:56.820 --> 00:20:57.820
 What?

00:20:57.820 --> 00:20:59.820
 She won't speak to me.

00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:01.320
 Why not?

00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:03.320
 Because I beat up Homer.

00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:07.820
 Only father I hardly touched him, and she was one minute she...

00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:09.820
 And then the next minute she...

00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:10.820
 Boy...

00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:11.820
 Yeah.

00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:15.820
 And frankly father, I can't say your advice helped.

00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:17.820
 Yes, I realize that now.

00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:23.120
 But, son, the main thing we men have to remember is never to give in.

00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:24.320
 Sure, Father.

00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:26.320
 And when our first plan doesn't work,

00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:28.320
 then we have enough sense to change our tactics.

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:29.320
 Yes, sir!

00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:31.820
 Get your coat on. Here's what we're going to do next.

00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:48.540
 Now then Kathleen, suppose we sit down.

00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:50.140
 All right.

00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:53.620
 Only, when do you suppose Henry, Mr. Aldrich, went?

00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:56.380
 Dear, I don't know, and frankly, I don't care.

00:21:56.380 --> 00:21:57.420
 You don't?

00:21:57.420 --> 00:21:59.020
 Well, then naturally neither do I.

00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:01.700
 You and I are going to enjoy our dinner, Kathleen,

00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:03.340
 just the two of us.

00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:04.900
 We're gonna have the time of our lives.

00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:06.300
 Of course.

00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:08.900
 We'll have a much better time without,

00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:12.900
 without my the chicken pie smell lovely.

00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:14.540
 Thank you, dear.

00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:15.900
 Do you know what they remind me of?

00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:16.740
 What?

00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:18.060
 Henry.

00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:18.900
 What's there?

00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:20.740
 He's so crazy about them.

00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:22.500
 So is Mr. Olrich.

00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:23.900
 My, how that man eats.

00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:25.620
 Henry does too.

00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:27.180
 I made him some brownies once.

00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:29.020
 And do you know how many he ate?

00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:29.860
 No, dear.

00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:32.740
 Well, he ate so many, he had to go home.

00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:34.100
 Right afterwards.

00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:36.780
 Now, Kathleen, don't cry into your pot pie.

00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:37.780
 (audience laughing)

00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:39.220
 Oh, of course not.

00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:41.700
 Now then, may I have your plate?

00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:43.460
 And would you mind entering the phone, Kathleen,

00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:44.300
 while I so?

00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:45.140
 All right.

00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:45.980
 - Hey, back there.

00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:48.380
 (phone ringing)

00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:49.220
 Hello.

00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:50.820
 - Hello, is that you, Kathleen?

00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:51.660
 - Yes.

00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:52.820
 - Guess who this is.

00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:55.620
 - Homer, I can't waste time being nice to you now.

00:22:55.620 --> 00:22:56.460
 - What?

00:22:56.460 --> 00:22:58.020
 - Henry has needed a listen so it won't count.

00:22:58.020 --> 00:22:58.860
 - Huh?

00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:00.940
 Well look, I have bad news for you.

00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:01.780
 - What is it?

00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:04.020
 - I won't be able to mark it for dinner.

00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:05.500
 - I thought you said bad news.

00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:08.580
 - I have to take care of that creek and the nink of agus.

00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:09.780
 - Homer, what are you eating?

00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:11.180
 - Just a pork chop.

00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:12.180
 (laughing)

00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:15.100
 - Well, when are you in Henry going out together next?

00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:17.100
 Well, we were going to go skating on Saturday.

00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:19.100
 Okay, I'll see you over at the ring.

00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:20.100
 What?

00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:21.100
 So long.

00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:22.100
 But Homer!

00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:23.100
 Oh my goodness!

00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:24.100
 Mrs. Aldridge!

00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:26.100
 Yes, Kathleen, would that phone call for me?

00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:27.100
 No.

00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:30.100
 But my goodness, everything's just going from worst to terrible.

00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:32.100
 But now, Kathleen, you just sit down and stop worrying.

00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:34.100
 Mrs. Aldridge, I followed your advice.

00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:35.100
 Where am I?

00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:38.100
 I've driven Henry out of his home, and Homer's still tagging along.

00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:44.100
 Now, dear, just because Henry and Mr. Aldridge have gone out for a while, well, there's nothing to worry about.

00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:44.940
 There isn't?

00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:47.540
 When men do that, it simply means they're sulking.

00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:50.220
 They'll come back, Kathleen, on their knees.

00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:51.220
 Really?

00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:52.620
 If they were doing anything they felt

00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:55.180
 had to be covered up, they'd have sent flowers.

00:23:55.180 --> 00:23:56.020
 They would?

00:23:56.020 --> 00:23:58.140
 Then we'd really have something to worry about.

00:23:58.140 --> 00:23:59.100
 All right, good.

00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:00.740
 You see, Kathleen, what did I tell you?

00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:01.540
 Here they are now.

00:24:01.540 --> 00:24:02.740
 I can show Mrs. Aldridge.

00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:07.060
 Sam was locked out once before tonight.

00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:07.580
 Oh.

00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:09.140
 Mrs. Samuel Aldridge?

00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:09.780
 Yes.

00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:12.620
 Acme Flower Shop, these roses are for you.

00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:13.580
 What?

00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:16.380
 And is there a Miss Kathleen Anderson here?

00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:32.620
 Boy, Father, just feel that air.

00:24:32.620 --> 00:24:35.300
 It's the same air you've been breathing all day, son.

00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:37.380
 It tastes better somehow.

00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:39.020
 I know what you mean.

00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:41.340
 Everything looks better after you've looked at problems

00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:42.980
 straight in the eye and licked it.

00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:46.100
 I'll say. They sure are, aren't they?

00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:46.580
 Who?

00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:47.020
 Women.

00:24:47.020 --> 00:24:47.420
 What?

00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:49.140
 A problem.

00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:50.660
 I suppose so, Henry.

00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:52.660
 The only man who hasn't learned to use his head.

00:24:52.660 --> 00:24:56.220
 Boy, Father, and to think for a while today, I doubted you.

00:24:56.220 --> 00:24:57.340
 You actually did.

00:24:57.340 --> 00:24:58.060
 Sure.

00:24:58.060 --> 00:25:01.620
 But boy, after this, I'll always know who to go to for advice.

00:25:01.620 --> 00:25:02.540
 That's right, son.

00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:04.580
 You can always profit by listening to someone

00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:06.380
 who's had more experience than you had.

00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:08.660
 Well, here we are, home again.

00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:10.740
 I'll go in ahead of you, Henry, and we'll let your mother

00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:11.660
 apologize first.

00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:12.500
 Okay.

00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:15.500
 - Oh Alice, I'm home.

00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:18.020
 - So am I Kathleen.

00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:18.860
 - Alice.

00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:20.900
 Alice.

00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:22.820
 - Mother, we're home.

00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:24.140
 - So I see.

00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:25.740
 Kathleen, have you got your coat on?

00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:27.180
 - Yes Mrs. Aldrich.

00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:28.020
 - Well, Alice.

00:25:28.020 --> 00:25:29.780
 - Don't bother trying to explain, Sam,

00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:31.300
 it won't do you any good.

00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:32.140
 - What, Sam?

00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:35.100
 - And Henry Aldrich, don't you ever speak to me again?

00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:35.940
 - Who I?

00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:38.220
 - Come along, Kathleen, we'll be late for the movie.

00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:39.060
 - Alice.

00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:39.900
 - Alice.

00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:40.740
 - Kathleen.

00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:44.460
 (audience laughing)

00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:45.300
 - Well.

00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:48.900
 - She was out of your account for a thing like that.

00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:49.740
 - Why?

00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:51.660
 - Point father, what do we do now?

00:25:51.660 --> 00:25:53.340
 Change our tactics again.

00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:56.420
 - Henry? - Yes, Father?

00:25:56.420 --> 00:25:58.820
 - I've given you a good deal of advice today

00:25:58.820 --> 00:26:00.620
 based on years of experience.

00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:02.060
 - Yes, sir.

00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:04.340
 - Now I want you to forget every word of it.

00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:05.700
 - What's that, Father?

00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:07.500
 - When it comes to handling women, Henry,

00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:10.060
 I have only one last piece of advice.

00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:11.060
 Yes, Father.

00:26:11.060 --> 00:26:13.060
 Don't accept any from anyone.

00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:39.060
 Boy, Homer, did you turn out to be a snake in the clover.

00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:47.060
 "Could I ask you one thing? Are we gonna let women come between us and spoil a friendship of an entire lifetime?"

00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:48.060
 "Women."

00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:52.060
 "Hah! Sure, him. You're right. Women."

00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:57.060
 "Hah! Ha! Shake! Ha! Shake!"

00:26:57.060 --> 00:27:04.060
 Okay, boys, but just remember this. It's the women folk you can thank for turning out those swell desserts you like so much.

00:27:04.060 --> 00:27:08.340
 much, like those grand and gay treats of shimmering jello.

00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:13.900
 Yes, jello looking so bright and colorful and tasting so rich and good, it reminds you

00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:16.380
 of the real ripe fruit itself.

00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:22.620
 In any of those six delicious flavors, strawberry, raspberry, cherry, orange, lemon, and lime,

00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:25.820
 every jello flavor is an extra special treat.

00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:29.820
 With that famous locked-in goodness that's exclusive with jello.

00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:34.980
 seal right in so it can't get out till your first delectable spoonful.

00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:39.180
 And that's why Jell-O is America's favorite gelatin dessert.

00:27:39.180 --> 00:27:41.580
 Look for those big red letters on the box.

00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:45.100
 They spell Jell-O and Jell-O spells a treat.

00:27:45.100 --> 00:28:00.100

00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:39.020

00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:42.620
 "The Aldrich family is brought to you by the Jell-O family."

00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:44.620
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:28:44.620 --> 00:28:51.340
 Everyone's a Jell-O-good fellow, a very good Jell-O-good fellow,

00:28:51.340 --> 00:28:55.700
 so rich, so tempting and mellow.

00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:57.700
 J-E-L-L-O.

00:28:57.700 --> 00:29:08.700
