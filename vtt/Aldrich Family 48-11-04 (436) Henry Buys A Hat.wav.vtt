00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.320
 Henry! Henry, all great!

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:04.320
 Coming, brother!

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:17.400
 [Music]

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.800
 Thank Heaven, American boys eventually grow up.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.800
 But no matter how important or how old they become,

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.600
 they always like to grow down the boyhood again,

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:32.120
 to recapture their teenage and the adventures of Henry Aldrich. The scene opens in the Aldrich

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:56.280
 front hall. It is Saturday morning. Well, I guess I'm just about all set, Homer. Gee, Henry. Gee, how'd you ever talk your folks into it? I didn't have to, Homer. After all, it's the most natural thing in the world to do. Boy, I bet this is the biggest day in your life since your first pair of long pants. Homer, Gee whiz. My mother and father just suddenly

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.920
 realize that I've reached the age of manhood.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.440
 I wish I would.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.120
 Yes, mother.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.040
 You got your money?

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.000
 Sure, mother.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.040
 Here I want you to tie it up in this handkerchief.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.240
 Mother.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.040
 Oh, Alice, stop worrying.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:09.880
 You won't lose it.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:10.720
 Sure.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.480
 Gee whiz, didn't we all agree?

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:13.960
 I wasn't a kid anymore.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:14.960
 That's right, son.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.000
 Now, run along and use your own judgment about the whole thing.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.040
 Thanks, Dad.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.200
 And Homer, when we get down there, I don't want you saying anything.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.160
 Nothing at all.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.480
 If I ask for your opinion and even if he asked you home, but please don't interfere

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:33.340
 We want Henry to make his decision entirely on his own sure come on Homer. Let's go only Henry

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.460
 If you really can't decide be sure and phone me. I'll be okay mother

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:41.520
 Good luck, Henry. Yeah, you got the handkerchief. Yes, mother. Good boy, please be careful and Henry

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.320
 Alice let him go

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.480
 Sam we should never have let him do it now Alice and is perfectly capable of handling a thing like this by himself

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.820
 Well, maybe he is, but just the same...

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.120
 Why are you putting your coat on?

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.820
 Sam, I'm gonna say a good hundred yards behind him.

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.100
 Alice, you're going to do no such thing.

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:08.940
 [music]

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.240
 Well, here I am, everybody. How do you like me?

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.740
 Henry, oh, Henry, all of your balls, thanks.

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.440
 Oh, she wins. What's so terrible?

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.780
 Sam speak to him.

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.240
 I refuse to say a word to him until he takes that thing off his head.

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.900
 You mean you don't like the hat, Father?

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.660
 Well, after you told me I could choose my own.

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.240
 All he needs now is spats and a cane.

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.600
 Henry, I hardly know what to say to you.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:34.360
 For mother's...

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.320
 My goodness, a straw hat!

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.160
 Dear, what on earth possessed you to buy a thing like that?

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.740
 Look, mother, it's a genuine West Indian straw worth $14.50.

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:47.240
 And on account of winter coming on, I got it for only $3.

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:50.940
 You could hug any of my friends, so I'm walking along under the ash.

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.640
 Mary, mother said I could pick it out myself.

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:54.940
 Oh, no, I didn't.

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.340
 Sam, you were the one who decided your son could choose his own clothes from now on.

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.340
 Alice, he's your son as much as he is mine.

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:06.440
 Look, look, let me sort of walk away from you, mother, so you can get a better perspective.

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:07.040
 What's that?

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.140
 The road trouble is everybody's just looking at it too closely.

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.440
 Pretend I'm walking down the street, see?

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.940
 Yes?

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.140
 Doesn't the hands begin to look better?

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:16.440
 Keep on walking, Henry.

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.440
 Sure, you see my point?

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.440
 There, now it looks fine.

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.440
 This father ain't having a haul!

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:25.440
 Precisely!

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.440
 Henry, will you please stop this foolishness and come back here?

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.440
 Mother, won't you please try to look at the overall effect?

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.440
 You always have to make an adjustment when you see a man you're not used to in a hat.

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:37.440
 I mean...

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.440
 Henry, let's not waste any more time talking.

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.440
 You'll just have to march straight down to the Emporium and return that hat.

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:44.440
 Return it?

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:45.440
 Mother, you don't mean...

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.040
 Mother, you don't mean...

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.880
 You're just kidding, aren't you?

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.320
 I've never been more serious in my life.

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.880
 But she is, Mother. I can't.

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.720
 Father, you see my side, don't you?

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.440
 Sam, will you please explain to Henry

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.360
 that you were wrong about the whole thing?

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.160
 As a matter of fact, Alice,

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:02.800
 I just remembered some work I have to do.

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:03.360
 Sam!

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.240
 Mother, look, I can't go back. I can't.

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.120
 Henry, it's a perfectly simple matter

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.600
 to walk into a store and say,

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.200
 "I've changed my mind about this,

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.640
 and I like my money back, please."

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.120
 Of course it is, Henry.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.120
 Oh boy.

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.760
 My goodness, I do it all the time.

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.600
 But Mother the Quirk will think that I don't know my own mind.

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.200
 Just tellin' your mother refuses to let you have it.

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.240
 After him calling me, sir?

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.400
 Oh, jeez.

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.400
 [audience laughter]

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:35.600
 She was, I can't walk into a store and start talking about my mother as if I was a little

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:36.600
 boy.

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.080
 They're even big boys have mothers.

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.640
 Now please start.

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:40.640
 [audience laughter]

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:42.880
 Gee whiz, mother, I can't.

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:48.920
 I just can't very well Mary would you please take Henry by the hand and Mary don't you touch me

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:55.280
 Listen won't you please try to look at it this way

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.580
 Yes, sir. Is there something I can do for you?

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:16.180
 Well, yes, as a matter of fact, Homer, how would you like to sort of step over there and look at those coats a minute?

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:17.580
 Well, Henry, I'm interested.

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.780
 Oh, you interested in buying a coat, young man?

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:22.780
 Me? She was no. I've got a coat.

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:23.780
 Homer?

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:26.780
 Well, I guess I wouldn't do any harm to investigate.

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:28.280
 Look, uh, mister.

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:32.280
 Look, about this hat, it isn't that I don't like it.

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:33.780
 I knew you'd like it, sir.

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:37.380
 Well, in all my years and hats, I've never seen a face that fitted a hat to where your

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:38.380
 fits that one.

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:39.380
 Yeah, sure.

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:46.980
 That's exactly what worries me, the fit.

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:47.980
 The fit?

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:49.980
 Well, we can certainly remedy that.

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:50.980
 You can?

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:55.380
 Well, I don't mean the fit so much as, well, as my doctor.

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:56.380
 What's that?

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:02.540
 I don't know how it slipped my mind, but according to my doctor, I shouldn't wear a hat, I think.

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:03.540
 Why not?

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:07.140
 Well, I'm sort of losing my hair.

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:07.640
 And--

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:08.140
 We're there.

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:08.800
 So?

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.440
 Well, if you're really losing your hair,

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:12.640
 you don't ever want to be seen without a hat.

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:13.240
 I don't?

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:14.040
 No, sir.

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.040
 Now, just let me set it back on your head.

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:16.940
 But, Mr. What I--

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:19.540
 Always remember to give it a pat, like this.

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:20.540
 There you are.

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:21.040
 Sure.

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:21.040
 Only--

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:23.140
 You're doing hard while I look in this.

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:24.140
 Homer, where are you?

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:25.840
 Right here inside this coat.

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:26.840
 Isn't it?

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:27.640
 [LAUGHTER]

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:30.240
 Young man, are you interested in buying that raccoon coat?

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:31.140
 I'm interesting.

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:31.840
 Sure.

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:32.640
 How much is it?

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:34.780
 three hundred dollars

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:38.200
 well frankly i've certainly lost interest

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:39.160
 mister look

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:41.280
 look about this had either

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:46.200
 i decided to return it return it sure and i'd like my money back please if you

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:46.980
 don't mind

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:49.440
 well that is what's the matter didn't your mother like that

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:50.120
 mam

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:51.640
 mother

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:52.560
 did

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:55.040
 he had nothing to do with it

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:58.520
 well i'm sorry sir but i'm afraid we can't take it back why not what about

00:06:58.520 --> 00:06:59.560
 your initials

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:00.900
 I forgot about the initials.

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:04.120
 There they are, right. On the sweat band, HA, as large as like.

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:05.740
 We never take a hat back once it's been initiated.

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:06.860
 But couldn't you remove them?

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:07.360
 Remove them.

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:07.860
 Yeah.

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:09.640
 How could we remove initials? They're perforated.

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:11.280
 Look, HA.

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:12.280
 Oh.

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:15.800
 Well, couldn't you just add a T to the HA?

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:17.800
 And then you have HA.

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:18.640
 Get out.

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:20.160
 Ah, just a minute, son.

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:30.500
 - Hello?

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:31.340
 - Hello?

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:34.780
 - Hello, is this Mr. Harold A. Corn?

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:36.060
 - All corn, Henry.

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:36.900
 - What's that?

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:37.820
 - 'Cause I mean all corn.

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:38.900
 - Yeah, who's this?

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:40.300
 - Well, you don't know me, see,

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:42.460
 I just found your name in the phone book.

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:43.300
 - You did?

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:45.620
 - Sure, I'm phoning everybody I can find

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:49.180
 who has the initials, H.A. (audience laughing)

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:52.100
 Look, how would you feel about a swell new hat?

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:54.500
 Yeah? What program is this?

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:56.700
 What program?

00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:58.900
 Sure, didn't you say you were giving away a hat?

00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:00.800
 No, she was. I'm selling it.

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:01.600
 Selling it?

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:03.700
 Look, just let me ask you this.

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:05.300
 What size is your hat?

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:07.300
 Eight and a half. What's it to you?

00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:09.700
 Eight and a half. Wow.

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:11.200
 So, just forget the whole thing.

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:13.200
 Goodbye.

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:14.700
 Quick, let's see the phone book, Homer.

00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:15.800
 Are there any more H.A.?

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:18.600
 Sure, only I think all this phone is hopeless.

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:21.100
 Homer, there just has to be one H.A. in center,

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:25.100
 with a six and a half head size who needs a hat what's the next number?

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:27.100
 Elm 669.

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:28.100
 Number 3.

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:29.100
 Elm 669.

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:32.100
 How did you make out on Mr. Alcorn him?

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:35.100
 Boy he was the biggest sore head I ever heard of.

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:37.100
 Yeah eight and a half.

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:41.100
 But I've got a feeling this is my lucky customer coming up.

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:43.100
 He and I sure hope so.

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:44.100
 Hello.

00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:45.100
 Hello.

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:47.100
 May I speak to H. Andrews please?

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:49.100
 Well this is Hildegard Andrews.

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:50.100
 The old a guard.

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:52.100
 (audience laughing)

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:53.100
 - Yes.

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:54.100
 Who's this?

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:55.780
 - Well gee, gee, gee, gee, gee, gee, gee, gee, gee,

00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:57.420
 I don't think you'd be interested.

00:08:57.420 --> 00:08:59.020
 - Well I might be.

00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:01.100
 Come on, who is it?

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:03.780
 - Well no, no, no, I'm sure you wouldn't be.

00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:05.020
 Goodbye.

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:06.940
 Homer, we're just not getting anyplace.

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:08.860
 - Hey Henry, I just got a swell idea.

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:10.540
 Why aren't you filling the police department?

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:11.380
 - The police?

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:12.220
 - Sure.

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:13.740
 After all, I keep fingerprints.

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:15.580
 Maybe they keep head sizes too.

00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:16.740
 (audience laughing)

00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:17.940
 How are your crazies?

00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:18.780
 - Head free.

00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:19.780
 Oh boy.

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:21.180
 Henry, haven't you left yet?

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:22.980
 Flest mother, for where?

00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:26.580
 There, didn't we decide you were to take your hat down to the Emporium and get your

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:27.580
 money back?

00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:28.880
 Well, I'll tell you, Mother.

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:30.180
 I did go down, see.

00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:31.380
 Oh, you did fine.

00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:35.580
 Sure, and I had a long talk with a clerk, see?

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:37.380
 And he gave you your three dollars back?

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:38.380
 Well, not exactly.

00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:39.580
 You mean he gave you credit?

00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:40.580
 Credit?

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:42.180
 That's just as good, Henry.

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:45.380
 You and I will go down later this afternoon and pick out another hat.

00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:46.380
 Mother, wait.

00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:47.380
 You don't understand.

00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:51.340
 understand how you feel but until you're a few years older you need help in

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:54.180
 selecting your clothes. But Mother if you don't let me explain.

00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:56.780
 You're talking about it now. There I have to start lunch.

00:09:56.780 --> 00:09:59.700
 She was home. My mother thinks I returned the hair.

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:03.580
 Why didn't you send her straight? I tried to homework. What's she gonna do when she

00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:07.300
 finds out I've hidden it up in my room? Boy you're in a spa hand.

00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:11.260
 Wait a minute. Who are you gonna phone? The center will times. I've got the whole

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:14.540
 thing figured out. Number please. Elle 909. Elle 909.

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:16.200
 - He's trying to change hands.

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:18.300
 - Mary's boyfriend, Kermit, and he always said,

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:19.700
 "If there's anything he can do for me,

00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:20.940
 he'd be glad to do it."

00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:21.780
 - Yeah.

00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:23.940
 - Sure, and I know he'll be just crazy about my hat,

00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:25.700
 even if his initials aren't H.A.

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:27.500
 - Set it all times, set it up like me.

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:29.980
 - I'd like to speak to one of your reporters, please.

00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:31.060
 Kermit, Hanygan.

00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:33.060
 - Hanygan isn't there, sorry.

00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:33.900
 - He isn't?

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:35.220
 Oh, just a minute.

00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:36.300
 Homer, he isn't there.

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:37.140
 - He isn't.

00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:38.620
 Well, why not leave a message?

00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:39.460
 - Sure.

00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:40.380
 Hello? - Yes?

00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:42.060
 - Look, could I leave a message, please?

00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:43.500
 A very important message.

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:44.340
 - Who is this?

00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:48.580
 why you wouldn't know me but but i'm a member of the general public who reads

00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:49.560
 your paper

00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:53.520
 and uh... i'm trying to locate somebody with the initials h_a_

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:55.720

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:59.640
 but no gee was i just have to find them and i call the police department

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:03.180
 the police were they fool around with a thing like this i told you

00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:05.640
 and i don't think that's what this all done

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:06.040
 who

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:08.120
 uh... the other one give me my money back

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:10.120
 working for how much was involved

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:11.680
 Oh gee, every son I have.

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:12.480
 Is that so?

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:14.040
 Alright, let's have all the information.

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:15.280
 And they show today, Jay.

00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:15.960
 Sure.

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:17.920
 With a six and a half head size.

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:19.160
 Are they gonna help you, Hinn?

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:20.480
 Homer, will you please be the--

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:21.000
 Hello?

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:21.500
 Hello.

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:23.600
 OK, Henry, I can take a hint.

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:24.560
 Mrs. Aldrich.

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:27.520
 The important thing is he has to like stalk.

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:29.440
 Are you in the living room, Mrs. Aldrich?

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:30.160
 Yes, Homer.

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:33.240
 Mr. Aldrich and I happen to be having a private discussion.

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:36.480
 Well, can I hear you say it was almost lunchtime?

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:37.400
 Not quite, Homer.

00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:38.800
 You have plenty of time to get home.

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:49.800
 Yes, dear. Well, are you sure I can't help you in any way, Mrs. Oldrich? Set the table or anything?

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:54.800
 No, thank you. Oh, well, I guess I'll be running along then.

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:57.800
 Goodbye, Alma. Where were we, Alice?

00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:01.800
 I was saying, Sam, that you should take a lesson from what happened this morning and put your foot down.

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:06.800
 That was unfortunate, Alice, but I still maintain we should give Henry one more chance to choose his own hat.

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:09.300
 Sure, I agree with Mr. Aldrich.

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:11.300
 Homer, I thought you'd gone home.

00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:14.300
 Now, let's try to look at this whole thing from a boy's viewpoint.

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:15.800
 I was a boy once myself.

00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:17.300
 Sure, so was I.

00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:22.300
 If you need him down to the Emporium by the hand, you'll destroy every shred of his self-respect.

00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:24.300
 Dear, I don't intend to take his hand.

00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:26.300
 Psychologically, you'd be taking his hand.

00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:29.800
 The same, the important thing is Henry has to have a new hat.

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:33.800
 And since he isn't capable of choosing one himself, then someone has to do it for it.

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:37.100
 When Mrs. Algory, Homer, will you please go home?

00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:40.200
 Sam, listen to me. Someone has to help Henry.

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:42.100
 Well, Alice, have it your own way.

00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:44.300
 No, I'm glad you're being reasonable, Sam.

00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:45.600
 And when you get down there...

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:46.300
 Don't worry.

00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:47.600
 ...to the Emporium with Henry.

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:48.800
 Alice, I'm not going with him.

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:51.100
 Yes, you are, Sam. I changed my mind.

00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:53.900
 You're a man. You are definitely the one to help Henry.

00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:54.900
 Select the new hat.

00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:56.100
 Now, wait a minute, Alice.

00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:57.300
 I think so, too.

00:12:57.300 --> 00:12:58.700
 Homer, will you please go home?

00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:00.700
 [audience laughter]

00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:10.700
 [Music]

00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:14.700
 Well ladies, you'll never be in a predicament when it comes to making a choice

00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:17.700
 if you choose gay shimmering jello for dessert.

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:20.700
 Tomorrow night try raspberry pear whip.

00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:24.700
 Just prepare a package of raspberry jello as usual, then whip it up.

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:27.700
 Fold in a cup of luscious pear pulp and chill until firm.

00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:37.700
 All six jello flavors, strawberry, raspberry, cherry, orange, lemon, and lime have that wonderful locked in goodness that reminds you of the real ripe fruit itself.

00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:41.700
 Ask for jello, America's favorite gelatin dessert.

00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:50.700
 And now getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldrich.

00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:57.500
 Having been told by his parents that he could choose his new hat himself, Henry came home this morning,

00:13:57.500 --> 00:14:01.000
 proudly exhibiting a genuine West Indian straw.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.600
 And then, ordered to return the hat immediately, he ran into difficulties.

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:09.400
 Now, Henry is searching for someone to whom he can sell the hat.

00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:13.000
 The scene opens in the San Rafael police station. It is that afternoon.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.700
 But, Saunter, what's this full of done?

00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:17.700
 I don't know what he's done. All I've found out is a set of old times on his trail

00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:19.700
 and they'd sure like a chance to show us up.

00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:20.700
 You're right.

00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:22.100
 Now here's all I know about him.

00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:24.900
 His initials are HA and his head size is 6 1/2.

00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:26.500
 His head size, that's a new one.

00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:29.500
 From what I can gather, the main clue is a straw hat.

00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:31.200
 Now if you find that, we'll be on the right track.

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:33.000
 Okay, I'll start checking hat stores and cleaners.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.100
 And if you run into anyone from the newspapers,

00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:36.700
 don't let on, we don't know anything,

00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:39.200
 but try to find out who it is we're looking for.

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:48.700
 Mary, please.

00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:51.500
 Henry, let's go. I have to get ready for the beauty parlor.

00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:57.400
 Mary, listen. If you had a brother and he was going to die any minute now, wouldn't you make a move to help him?

00:14:57.400 --> 00:14:58.400
 Of course I would.

00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:00.400
 Well, okay. I've got to have three dollars.

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:02.500
 Henry, do you think I'm made of money?

00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:07.000
 But don't you realize Mother thinks I've got a credit of three dollars at the Emporium and I have them?

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.600
 Don't you realize that Kermit is coming here for dinner tonight and I am a size?

00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:14.500
 Look, Mary. Why waste your money in beauty parlors?

00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:15.000
 What?

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:20.500
 If you're going to marry Kermit someday, don't you think the only fear thing to do is let him see in your natural condition?

00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:21.500
 [audience laughter]

00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:24.000
 Henry Aldrich, marry way before you get mad.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.700
 When is Kermit's birthday?

00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:26.700
 In June, wow.

00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:29.200
 How do you like to buy him a swell present?

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:32.480
 It's worth $14.50 and you can have it for $3.

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:32.980
 No.

00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:33.480
 $2.95.

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:33.980
 No.

00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:35.800
 And goodbye. I have to fix my hair.

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:37.700
 You mean you're not going to the beauty parlor?

00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:40.200
 Of course I am, but I can't go there looking like this.

00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:44.100
 Okay, Mary. Just wait until you want me to be best man at your wedding.

00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:44.900
 Henry?

00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:47.900
 Mother, are you sure there hasn't been a phone call for me?

00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:48.900
 No, dear.

00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:51.900
 Gee whizzer reporter, there won't even answer a phone call.

00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:56.900
 Henry, I have to run over to your aunt Harry in first, but I want you to meet me down at the Emporium in 45 minutes.

00:15:56.900 --> 00:15:57.900
 Has the Emporium?

00:15:57.900 --> 00:16:00.900
 Yes, it seems your father has suddenly disappeared.

00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:02.900
 Well, look, Mother.

00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:05.900
 Don't you think a new hat is just a waste of money?

00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:06.900
 Certainly not.

00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:10.900
 But, Gee, you know how I always lose everything, especially a hat?

00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:12.900
 Why, I won't have it a half an hour.

00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:16.140
 He was, mother, I lose my head if it wasn't fastened on.

00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:20.640
 And now, dear, you really need a hat, and you have a credit of $3 down at the Emporium.

00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:22.640
 Mother, listen, there's something I've got to tell you.

00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:24.960
 You tell me down at the Emporium in 45 minutes.

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:26.720
 But it'll be too late, then.

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:27.900
 What summer?

00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:30.380
 Excuse me, Mrs. Orange, did I knock you over?

00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:32.660
 Not quite, and please don't be late, then.

00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:35.120
 Hey, Henry, where's your hat?

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:36.460
 It's hidden up in my room.

00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:40.040
 Who, listen, I found this pilot, see who wants us to draw a hat?

00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:40.560
 He does?

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:45.940
 Sure, he flies planes from Miami to Chicago, and he wants to stroll to where while he's in Miami.

00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:46.940
 [Laughter]

00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:48.540
 Homer, you don't mean it.

00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:52.860
 Sure, and his head size is six and a half, and he doesn't care a darn about the initials.

00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:56.220
 Oh boy, Homer, let me shake your hand.

00:16:56.220 --> 00:16:57.320
 Sure, yes.

00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:58.320
 Shake out!

00:16:58.320 --> 00:16:59.820
 Oh, I'm sorry, Homer.

00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:01.760
 It's just I'm so graceful.

00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:04.460
 Well, stop twisting my arm and I'll give you his address.

00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:06.560
 Sure, and then let's go upstairs and get the hat.

00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:08.460
 You know what happened to me on the way over?

00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:11.460
 a cop stopped me on the street and asked me my initials.

00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:12.460
 - He did? - Sure.

00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:16.460
 And when I told him HB, he said I was just one letter out.

00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:17.460
 (laughter)

00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:18.460
 That's funny.

00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:21.460
 Do you suppose I nearly won a prize of some kind?

00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:23.460
 - I'll answer the phone, Henry. - Okay, Mary.

00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:26.460
 Only if it's Kermit. Tell him he's Mr. Chan.

00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:27.460
 (phone ringing)

00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:29.460
 - Hello. - Hello, Mary.

00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:31.460
 Dear. - My Kermit.

00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:33.460
 How are you, Kermit? - Fine.

00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:36.460
 As a matter of fact, Mary, I'm on top of the world.

00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:41.580
 the world. You are? I just wanted to prepare you. By the time I come over for dinner tonight,

00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:46.380
 I might be out of obituaries. Really, my goodness, what's happened? Well, I haven't

00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:50.580
 time to explain, Mary, but I'm working on a big story. I'm going to scoop the police

00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:57.380
 department. No. Yes. So, it won't be long now, Mary, before you and I can talk over

00:17:57.380 --> 00:18:03.780
 a breakfast table instead of a telephone. Oh, my. Oh, my goodness. Well, I've got to be

00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:05.780
 getting along.

00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:06.780
 Of course.

00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:08.780
 Goodbye, come in and good luck.

00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:09.780
 Mary!

00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:10.780
 Yes, Henry!

00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:12.780
 Listen, Mary, I give you my word.

00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:13.780
 I didn't mean it.

00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:14.780
 You didn't mean why.

00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:17.780
 Anything I've ever said to you, except when I paid you compliments.

00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:18.780
 Henry, get to the point.

00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:19.780
 That's what I said.

00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:23.780
 Mary, whatever I've done to you, let's both be good sports and give me back my hat.

00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:24.780
 What hat?

00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:26.780
 My West Indian straw that was up in my room.

00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:27.780
 I haven't been anywhere near you.

00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:29.780
 No, Mary, I haven't timed to joke.

00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:30.780
 Now hand it over.

00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:31.780
 But, Henry, I haven't got it.

00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:34.380
 Listen Mary, I'll have Father Sue you.

00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:36.580
 No I had, I'll sue you for both of us.

00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:38.580
 Hey man, I don't think she's got it.

00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:40.780
 But somebody's got it, I can't have lost it.

00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:41.780
 Why not?

00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:43.780
 You'd lose your head if it wasn't fast enough.

00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:47.780
 Oh boy, Homer get out of my way, maybe I'd put it in here.

00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:53.780
 Hey man, you're gonna throw everything out of your whole closet?

00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:56.780
 Hey, cut it out, can you really hit me with that cold hair?

00:18:56.780 --> 00:18:59.780
 Henry, put down that rubber boat!

00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:09.780
 (Music)

00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:11.780
 Yes sir, we clean and block hats.

00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:13.780
 But what I want to know is do you stretch them?

00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:15.780
 - Sure. - Well, you see this straw hat?

00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:17.780
 It's a six and a half, it belongs to my son.

00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:20.780
 And if it's possible, I'd like it stretched, so it would fit me.

00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:23.780
 - Well, may I see the hat, please? - Yes, certainly.

00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:25.780
 - Oh, it's a very fine hat. - Yes.

00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:28.780
 - Genuine West Indian straw. - I, my, your son, has good taste.

00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:33.100
 taste you think so to tell you the truth I agree with you I'm surprised he'd want

00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:38.100
 to part with it well he isn't anxious to but his mother that is I understand what

00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:41.980
 you mean I'm a married man myself it isn't that mothers mean to be unreasonable

00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:47.020
 it's just that no fault of their own their well they're women that's quite true

00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:53.020
 I'd like to help my son out and find his hat from his initials they say yeah now

00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:57.460
 do you think you can stretch it I'm pretty sure I cancer it'll only take about

00:19:57.460 --> 00:20:01.300
 10 minutes. Oh, that's fine. Just make yourself comfortable while I step into the

00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:03.500
 back room and don't go away.

00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:17.300
 Hello. Hello, is that you Mary? Yes, mother. I just got back from the beauty

00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:21.580
 pole. Where are you? Now that the emporium I've been waiting for nearly two hours.

00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:25.660
 Have you any idea where Henry is? He isn't here. And mother, do you realize it's

00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:28.260
 Almost dinner time and come and we'll be here any minute.

00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:29.960
 Oh my goodness, I've forgotten.

00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:31.660
 Mary, you better start peeling potatoes

00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:33.160
 and let your father entertain Kermit.

00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:34.660
 But father isn't here either.

00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:35.760
 He isn't.

00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:37.960
 Well, dear, I'll get a taxi and be home in five minutes.

00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:38.960
 All right, mother, goodbye.

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:40.460
 This is our dear.

00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:42.860
 Father, where did you come from?

00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:44.060
 Good evening, Mary.

00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:45.860
 My goodness, that store has you--

00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:46.660
 that's Henry.

00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:49.460
 Mary, I don't want to hear this hat mentioned again

00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:50.160
 in this house.

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:51.060
 Do you understand?

00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:51.960
 Father, you look upset.

00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:53.360
 Is anything wrong?

00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:55.160
 Mary, let me ask you something.

00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:57.240
 Do I look to you like a common criminal?

00:20:57.240 --> 00:21:00.440
 No, it's not, Bob. You don't look the least sitcom.

00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:05.680
 Mary, I've just come from the police station.

00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:07.800
 The police station? What'd you go down there for?

00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:10.400
 I was taken down there in a police car.

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:11.400
 You were, Bob.

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:12.320
 I was arrested.

00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:13.880
 Really, Bob? Really, and truly?

00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:16.080
 One minute I was sitting quietly in the cleanest,

00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:17.880
 thumbing through the hat fires monthly.

00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:21.200
 And the next minute I was sitting under a bright light answering questions.

00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:28.220
 It seems the cleaner telephones some eager beaver newspaper reporter and he sent the police down.

00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:29.620
 But why did they arrest you?

00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:31.820
 How should I know that it didn't even know themselves?

00:21:31.820 --> 00:21:34.120
 Excuse me, Father, I've got a phone permit.

00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:36.820
 My goodness, when a prominent lawyer gets arrested, that's new.

00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:38.020
 Mary, put down that phone.

00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:38.520
 But Father...

00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:40.020
 Put it down.

00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:44.720
 Do you really mean you'd sell your own father down the river just to get permit out of obituary?

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:46.920
 But Father, our whole future is involved.

00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:47.920
 So is mine.

00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:48.920
 Yours, Father?

00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:50.620
 Age it as I am, Mary.

00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:52.920
 I have a few good years left.

00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:54.920
 Please answer the phone.

00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:55.920
 Hello.

00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:57.920
 Hello, Mary. This is Kermit.

00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:00.920
 Oh my goodness. See you there. Hello, Kermit.

00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:04.920
 Mary, I'm afraid I won't be able to come up for dinner tonight after all.

00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:05.920
 You won't. Why not?

00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:08.920
 No, I'd rather not go into details, Mary, but...

00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:11.920
 ...case I was working on, more or less blew up right in my face.

00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:14.920
 Oh, Kermit, that's a shame.

00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:16.920
 Yeah. Oh, well.

00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:18.920
 Never mind, Kermit. I've got a scoop for you.

00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:20.920
 Oh, you have to promise not to print it.

00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:21.920
 What is it?

00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:23.520
 Yes, what happened to my father?

00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:25.320
 Mary, I really have to go now.

00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:27.720
 How did you enter city was arrested?

00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:29.720
 Oh, arrested?

00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:32.220
 Well, I'm certainly surprised.

00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:34.220
 Arrested? Why, that's terrible.

00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:35.320
 Well, goodbye, Mary.

00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:37.620
 You're hanging up right in the middle of our conversation.

00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:39.520
 And Kermit, why can't you come to dinner tonight?

00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:41.120
 I've got to cover an obituary.

00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:42.720
 Well, everybody, I'm home.

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:44.820
 Look, look, Mary, could you meet me on the corner?

00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:45.720
 From the corner.

00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:46.920
 Mary, have...

00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:49.320
 Gee whiz, here it is, my store.

00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:50.320
 Wait a minute, Kermit.

00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:52.720
 Henry Otter, what on earth have you got on your head?

00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:54.520
 What does it look like, Mary? Mother!

00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:55.720
 Hello, Kermit, listen!

00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:57.120
 Mother, are you in the living room?

00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:58.620
 No, Henry, she isn't home yet.

00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:00.220
 She isn't? Oh boy.

00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:03.620
 When she gets here, Father, will you help me explain how I got tied up?

00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:05.720
 Hey, wait a minute, Henry, what's that thing on your head?

00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:08.120
 An aviator's helmet, Father.

00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:09.320
 Well, yes, but...

00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:11.620
 See, it has ear flaps and everything.

00:23:11.620 --> 00:23:14.320
 Don't you think it's the most practical type hat for me?

00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:15.320
 Where did you get it?

00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:16.820
 From a pilot friend of Homer's.

00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:19.320
 He sort of traded it to me on trust, see?

00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:22.720
 And now that I found my straw hat, all I have to do is take it over to him.

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:25.020
 Henry, about that straw hat.

00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:27.420
 Boy, am I lucky he takes six and a half.

00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:30.120
 Yes, well, the hat is now size seven and a half.

00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:32.120
 What? Why can that be?

00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:33.120
 I never buy it, it is.

00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:35.520
 You don't have to return that helmet to your pilot.

00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:39.420
 Return? Oh, no, father.

00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:40.920
 Let me have a look at you.

00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:42.220
 You, Mary!

00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:43.520
 In the living room, I'll ask you.

00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:46.320
 Oh, boy. Listen, Mother, I can explain everything.

00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:49.680
 Henry, you can explain later. First I have something to show you all.

00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:50.880
 What is it, Mother?

00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:54.120
 Well, while I was waiting for Henry down at the Emporium, I bought...

00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:57.120
 Here I am, everybody. How do you like me?

00:23:57.120 --> 00:23:58.720
 Mother! Mother!

00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:01.120
 Gee, what is it?

00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:04.120
 Why do you use a hat? A hat?

00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:07.720
 I don't believe it. Mother! A brace of pheasant?

00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:09.320
 Certainly, Mary.

00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:15.120
 Alice, you will march down to the Emporium, first thing in the morning and return that pheasant hat, Father.

00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:18.120
 - Return it, but Sam!

00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:20.700
 (upbeat music)

00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:30.840
 - Thank you, Henry.

00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:31.680
 - What, Homer?

00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:32.980
 - Before I'm coming to dinner tomorrow night,

00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:34.340
 you suppose we should tell your mother

00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:36.180
 I'm on a very special diet?

00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:37.180
 - She was, you are?

00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:38.820
 - Sure, because I'm anemic.

00:24:38.820 --> 00:24:40.380
 - You are?

00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:41.620
 - G-Homer, that's tough.

00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:42.460
 - Sure.

00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:43.380
 To build up my strength,

00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:45.880
 I have to have second helping of everything.

00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:49.500
 Well, second helping is what everybody has for when there's

00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:51.780
 Jello Tapioca Puddings for dessert.

00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:55.560
 Yes, Jello Tapioca Puddings, newest members of the famous Jello

00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:56.700
 Pudding family.

00:24:56.700 --> 00:25:00.100
 And they're a miracle of goodness, a marvel of speed.

00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:03.420
 There's Jello Vanilla Tapioca, Jello Chocolate Tapioca,

00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:06.100
 and Jello Orange Coconut Tapioca.

00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:09.800
 All three are luscious, light and delicate, gloriously rich

00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:10.860
 and creamy.

00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:13.180
 And you know that name Jello is a trademark.

00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:18.460
 It's the property of general foods and it tells you that you're getting a genuine jello product.

00:25:18.460 --> 00:25:21.580
 Ask your grocer for jello tapioca puddings.

00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:26.420
 And while you're about it, better get three packages so you'll have plenty for the weekend.

00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:28.860
 That's jello tapioca pudding.

00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:30.780
 [MUSIC]

00:25:30.780 --> 00:25:34.620
 You're showing you'll be in your living room in ours next week at the same time.

00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:35.820
 Good night, bros.

00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:38.180
 [MUSIC]

00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:42.100
 And this is Dan Seymour in New York saying the old Ridge family

00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:44.680
 is brought to you by the jello family.

00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:59.160
 For desserts that are delicious, boy, believe me, you should know, they are made by famous J-E-L-L-F.

00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:11.560
 Listen again next Thursday, same time, same station. One other sparkling half hour was the old recender.

00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:18.560
 This is NBC, the National Broadcasting Company.

00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:21.140
 (bells ringing)

00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:23.720
 (bell dings)
