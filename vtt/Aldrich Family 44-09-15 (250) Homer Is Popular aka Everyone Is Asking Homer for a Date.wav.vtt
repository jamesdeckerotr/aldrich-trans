00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 The All-Great Family written by Clifford Goldsmith

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 And me Henry Olvey

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
 Coming, Father!

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:31.000
 [Music]

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 An out for the Aldrich family with Dick Jones as Henry and Jackie Kalka Palmer.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.860
 Every once in a while for the fun there is in it, grown-ups like to recall the far away

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.880
 pleasures of their own teenage days.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:50.040
 And always right in the middle of those memories, they're romped the boy like Henry Ulterich.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.880
 The scene opens on Henry's front lawn.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:57.920
 Listen, Henry, I'm not arguing with you, but why don't you plan to go to the movies with

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:58.920
 me to marry?

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.720
 Homer, can I help but if Agnes did invite you to her party?

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.840
 Why didn't he dance with her at the dance last Saturday night?

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:10.240
 and we if Agnes gave me an invitation or an bended niece on a silver platter I wouldn't go.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.640
 You know what the Lawson's give it to eat at their party.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.640
 What? Marshmallow.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.440
 Why, why, why, marshmallow?

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.440
 Just one marshmallow without anything on it.

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.640
 Homer, for the last time, I'm going to Agnes's party.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.640
 Alright, alright, you wait 'til I get an invitation to go someplace some time and you weren't invited.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.140
 I thought you didn't want to go.

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:31.640
 I don't, I don't.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.140
 Can't you have as much pride as I do?

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.140
 Look Homer, why don't you call up somebody?

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.140
 Why don't you call up Marie Saunders National for a day?

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.140
 Who? Marie Saunders?

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:43.140
 Why not?

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.140
 You're crazy about her, you know you are.

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:51.140
 Marie Saunders, she was, and we have never even spoken to her, and she's never spoken to me.

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.140
 So, you're always following her around in school?

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:55.140
 I am not.

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.140
 She was the my fault she's always walking in front of me.

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.140
 And besides, and we're just trying to change the subject.

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.740
 Homer, for the last time, I'm going.

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.380
 Okay, then, okay.

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.540
 I always thought you were a social climber, and now I know it.

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:11.140
 Why did you call me Homer?

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.940
 You're gonna live the event, bap.

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.520
 (upbeat music)

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:27.040
 (laughing)

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.240
 - Hey, Gary, what's up?

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.180
 - He is, this is a swell party.

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:32.520
 Is this a swell part?

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:33.960
 - Do you really like it, Colin?

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.160
 Did you get some marks now?

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.000
 - Sure.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.920
 - All right, everybody, quiet.

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.160
 Quiet, let's get out of here.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.240
 - That's what I say.

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.400
 - It's Henry's turn came before, but it's a certain body.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.040
 - It's my turn, old boy.

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.640
 - How's it on, Henry?

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.400
 I'm holding somebody's forces.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.240
 Every heavy hangs over the head.

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.400
 What's the Leona Due to a demon's forces?

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.520
 - Well, there's a blonde little male or a female.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:56.840
 - A female, I think.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.120
 - Yeah, of course.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.560
 - What does he have to do, Henry?

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.560
 Well, make it good, Henry. Make it good.

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.560
 Here's what the owner has to do.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.560
 You want to go to the telephone, see?

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:06.560
 Yeah.

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:07.560
 She has to go to the telephone.

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:20.560
 Boy, am I bored.

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.560
 Boy, do I wish I had something to do.

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.560
 Well, you can be scared about the floor, can't you?

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.000
 But mother, what is there to do sitting up?

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.360
 Is there any reason why you can't preach something?

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.200
 See everybody else.

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.000
 See why don't we move out of this town?

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.900
 Is it my boat you want more popular?

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.200
 I'm popular, I'm popular.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.240
 And what are you lying on the floor, Paul?

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.880
 [LAUGHTER]

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:44.880
 Glenspethone.

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.520
 Well, yes, he is going through here with you.

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:48.680
 OK.

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.680
 If it's the father, what do I say?

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.280
 What do you mean, what do you say?

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.080
 Are you in or are you out?

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.760
 Hello.

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:56.520
 Hello.

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:57.880
 Is it on the ground?

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:58.860
 Yes, who is this?

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:59.680
 Kathleen?

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:00.680
 Oh no!

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.320
 It's whatever it is you think it was Kathleen?

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:04.520
 It is what Kathleen?

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.520
 You want to guess who it is?

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:07.320
 No.

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:08.760
 It's Marie!

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:09.520
 Who?

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.240
 Marie Stonders!

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:12.920
 Well, I'll be done!

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.280
 Am I my darling?

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.160
 No!

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.520
 Well, Homer!

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:17.080
 What?

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:20.600
 Would you think I would care if I asked you something?

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:21.080
 No.

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:23.960
 You would have liked to see me and my wife in room with you.

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.320
 Who you?

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.140
 Oh gee whiz.

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.980
 Come on, what's happening?

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:30.880
 Nothing, I just knocked over the telephone table.

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.580
 Sure, I'd like to see you tomorrow.

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.280
 Do you want me to come up to your house?

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:35.280
 Oh my goodness.

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:36.380
 Oh wait, there's a minute.

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:39.580
 Sure, I don't mind waiting.

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.580
 Hello?

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.580
 Hello, did you change your mind?

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:44.580
 Hello.

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:45.580
 Hi, Mom.

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:46.580
 Yes, Marie.

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:48.280
 Listen, Homer, they just--

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:49.780
 How about your haven't done so?

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:50.780
 Okay.

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:51.780
 It's not hard to see.

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:52.780
 Okay, sure.

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:53.780
 Hi.

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:55.280
 Is this really Marie Saunders?

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.280
 The one with the yellow hair.

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.280
 So he wins.

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.280
 Goodbye.

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.280
 So, boy.

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.280
 Hold her.

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:06.280
 What's her thought?

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.280
 I dropped the phone right out of my hand.

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:16.280
 [Music]

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:20.280
 [Laughter]

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.280
 I was never going back in my life.

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.280
 I nearly died.

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:25.880
 I get home and believe you Kathleen.

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:26.880
 I can't believe you.

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.680
 But as soon as I thought I'd die,

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.380
 I knew I could buy you a Kylie Posh tournament

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:32.480
 and a Foshman.

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:34.080
 It's my turn, old boy.

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:34.880
 Sit down, darling.

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:35.480
 I'm sitting.

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:36.180
 Go ahead.

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.480
 See, when I think of home awaiting some warning saunters

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.880
 and they haven't struck to all tomorrow afternoon.

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.880
 And you can't just see him, Henry.

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:44.980
 But if my brief son has ever found out

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:46.980
 that Kathleen wouldn't that call?

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:48.780
 All right, not quiet, everybody quiet.

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:50.080
 Kathleen's going to start.

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.080
 Heavy heavy hangs over the forehead.

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.180
 What's the Leona Duda, a dangerous fortune?

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:56.180
 Well, does it belong to a male or a female?

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:57.180
 A female?

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:59.180
 Oh, boy, a primary chicken.

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:00.180
 Oh, my.

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:06.180
 Well, the owner of the article over my head has to go to the telephone and call Homer's mother.

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:07.180
 Oh, my God.

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:07.180
 Good.

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:08.180
 Sorry, that's good.

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:12.180
 And when he answers, he has to say he's Marie Saunders' mother.

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:13.180
 Oh, my goodness.

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:18.180
 And she has to tell Mrs. Brown that Homer has been bothering her daughter, and will she please

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:19.180
 see to it that he stops.

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:20.180
 Oh, my God.

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:21.180
 Oh, my God.

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:23.180
 Who asked to do it?

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:24.440
 Egg your castle.

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:27.940
 Oh no, you're not going to shove me out on any limb and cook my goose.

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:31.040
 But, Magnas, you have to. You won't get your bracelet back.

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:33.680
 It's a lace chowing, maybe Homer's mother's on a bed.

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:35.180
 Okay, then phone her in the morning.

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:36.380
 On the morning?

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:37.680
 You smile at breakfast?

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.980
 All you have to do is raise the deuce with her, I guess.

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:44.380
 Tell her that Marie is practically having a breakdown because Homer bothers her so much.

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:56.380
 [Music]

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:57.380
 Hi, Simone.

00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:59.380
 Hello, thank you, Mother.

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:02.380
 Hello, Henry. Did you have a good time at the party last night?

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:03.380
 Oh, boy. Didn't we?

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:05.380
 Oh, boy, Mother. You know what we did?

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:07.380
 I had some time to listen now, then.

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:09.380
 Sam, your breakfast is getting cold.

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:11.380
 Well, boy, every time I think of it,

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:15.320
 think of it. It's the best darn thing you ever heard of. You certainly must have

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:19.180
 had a good job. Let me tell you about it. Leave it to Will Brown. It starts today

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:23.860
 all right. What is Will Brown's enough? I've never seen Will go upset. Who is Mr.

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:27.620
 Brown? Homer's father? Yes, Henry, and I happen to be talking to your mother. That's

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:30.940
 all right. Excuse me. Apparently about five of the brown had a phone call for

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:35.200
 Mrs. Saunders. From whom? Marie Saunders mother. Henry, what I don't say about

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:39.220
 interrupting me. I'm sorry, father. Then what did Mrs. Saunders own her about? He

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:43.460
 He didn't say, but apparently she took Elizabeth over the coast about something regarding Homer.

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:45.020
 What do you think Will wants to do?

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:45.520
 What?

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:48.620
 He wants to know whether he can sue Mrs. Saunders for "Clander."

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:50.520
 Is that good or bad, Father?

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:53.620
 I mean, well, was it "Clander"?

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:59.220
 I don't know. I asked Will Brown what he said, and he said he wouldn't tell me, and I first told him it was "Clander."

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:02.720
 Henry, I want to eat your cereal. This doesn't concern you in the slightest.

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:05.220
 Is that clear, dear? The only thing is that...

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:06.320
 Hey Henry!

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:07.520
 Who is that you?

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:09.280
 Yeah, I want you to finish your breakfast yet.

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:10.720
 Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Haldry.

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:11.720
 Good morning, Homer.

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:13.720
 Why, but you certainly seem to be feeling good.

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:14.720
 I am.

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:18.620
 Boy, Henry, am I glad I decided not to go to that party last night.

00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:19.820
 You are, Homer?

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:20.520
 What happens?

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:22.120
 Don't you wish you knew?

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:24.820
 And listen, if you haven't finished your breakfast, I'm going on.

00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:27.820
 I want to get to school early and have a chance to see.

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:28.820
 To see?

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:30.020
 I want to get there.

00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:31.820
 Homer, about how long ago did you leave home?

00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:33.020
 About a half an hour ago.

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:35.120
 I've been over telling Charlie Clark something.

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:37.720
 And Henry, I'll tell you about it when I see you at school.

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:41.220
 No one has any rights to feel that good at this hour of the morning.

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:43.520
 It's just temporary, Father.

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:46.120
 He isn't going to be feeling that good by this afternoon.

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:46.820
 Henry?

00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:49.920
 Now tell us all about what you did that you're so funny, last night.

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:51.220
 Oh, uh, why?

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:51.920
 Probably.

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:53.120
 It wasn't anything, Mother.

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:54.120
 Wait, just...

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:56.620
 In Mary Out in the Kitchen, I believe she is.

00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:57.920
 Well, excuse me for a second.

00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:59.920
 I want to see whether I can help her cook my eggs.

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:00.920
 Mary!

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:02.420
 What did you want, Henry?

00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:03.620
 Listen, you're...

00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:04.920
 Could you do something for me?

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:07.320
 If you are borrowing money, I have it a thing.

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:08.820
 It's much more simple than money.

00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:11.820
 And would you be willing to phone Mrs. Brown?

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:12.320
 Why?

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:15.220
 Well, all you have to do is say you're Marie Saunders' mother

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:16.720
 and apologize for borrowing her.

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:18.120
 Oh, no, Henry.

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:19.120
 You won't.

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:21.720
 Neither would you be willing to call over.

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:22.520
 What's wrong?

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:24.320
 Well, he's expecting to meet--

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:27.920
 I mean, you know how crazy he is about Jamari.

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:28.520
 He is?

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:29.320
 Sure.

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:30.920
 He practically worships you.

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:32.720
 I'm just asking you to have a date with your behavior

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:34.720
 in structural work for 15 this afternoon.

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:38.720
 Well, all you have to do is time somebody asked you to come over to her plate.

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:40.720
 Well, I had a year old to try and do anything with the car.

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:43.720
 But, Mary, let me tell you what happened last night.

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:53.720
 Hey, Henry. Henry.

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:54.720
 What do you want, Homer?

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:56.720
 I want you to do something for me.

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:58.720
 I haven't got time. I gotta go to class.

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:00.720
 But Henry, usually you have to do.

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:01.720
 Well, first, Homer.

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:04.720
 I've been thinking things over and I want to tell you something.

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:06.720
 Not till I guess who's telling you about this.

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:09.720
 What do you really think of Marie Saunders?

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:10.720
 Why?

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:13.720
 Well, gee, I think she's a prettiest girl in the school.

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:16.720
 But have you ever noticed that she's sort of peculiar?

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:19.720
 I mean, I'm the telephone, for instance.

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:22.720
 She can be just as nice to you as though she was crazy about you.

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:27.720
 And then you're me to hear it's school and boy, she's so bashful she won't even look at you.

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:28.720
 Well, look, let me tell you.

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:31.020
 Let me tell you, Carol, will you stop interrupting?

00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:34.860
 All you have to do is find the first chance to have and give her this nose.

00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:35.660
 What does it say?

00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:36.720
 What gives you this ad-make?

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:37.920
 Just find her and give it to her.

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:38.820
 She'll understand.

00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:40.320
 But homo!

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:41.620
 Oh, hi, Kathleen.

00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:43.620
 You want me to have you caught on your...

00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:44.120
 No.

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:45.220
 What type of train you have?

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:46.220
 Nothing.

00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:47.220
 Just sort of a no.

00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:51.220
 Oh my goodness, I was just talking with Agnes and she said his mother's followed the whole thing,

00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:52.320
 looked like a stinker.

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:55.320
 Kathleen, I hope you don't think there's anything funny about this.

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:56.220
 What?

00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:58.820
 Frankly, I don't think you should have started this whole darn thing.

00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:01.120
 Frank, can we ask if it was our your idea?

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:03.620
 You're the one that told me to find him and say I was Maureen.

00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:05.220
 Sure, but I never dreamed it's...

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:06.220
 You're...

00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:10.220
 Listen, Popley, would you be willing to have a date with Homer this afternoon?

00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:11.220
 I...

00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:13.420
 You know how crazy Homer's always been about you.

00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:14.220
 What about me?

00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:16.920
 But sure, he practically worships you.

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:17.920
 Who is that?

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:18.820
 Homer!

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:22.220
 And don't you think the least you can do is be at the Haven when it gets her this afternoon?

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:23.520
 Oh, no, Emi.

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:26.360
 And what's mine? You think you can put all the blame for this on the moon?

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:28.240
 You're very, very much mistaken.

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:28.980
 Goodbye.

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:31.480
 But, Cass, me, you're just taking it in the wrong way!

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:41.520
 Homer, you're too like yourself.

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:42.920
 I'm in a hurry, mother.

00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:45.440
 Are you three going to hold good about this awful thing, dear?

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:47.760
 Sure, mother. I wouldn't make a thing like that up.

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:48.920
 We had a new year, that.

00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:51.600
 Homer, are you sure you're getting homeless, sir?

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.160
 What's the truth for you?

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:56.800
 Sure, Father. Don't you remember last night when I was going on the floor?

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:58.400
 Well, I've got to go. Goodbye.

00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:00.160
 Hey, but you can't leave that even your cup cut.

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:02.720
 I'm gonna eat it, Mother. I'm gonna take it right along with you.

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:05.200
 You're not gonna take a good-cussed cup out of the tree.

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:07.480
 I know what I'm dumping it into my hand.

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:08.000
 Goodbye.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:08.600
 Over!

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:09.200
 Over?

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:13.800
 I won't do it on anything. I won't be back in the afternoon till making pictures of the trees.

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:17.000
 Well, I can't but the life of the other Samoyu won't get eaten.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.200
 Well, it isn't that I doubt you a little bit.

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:22.120
 And simply thinking things over and I don't believe Homer.

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:24.000
 And this morning Marie found his mother phone.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.560
 Your first impulse was a sewer.

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:27.160
 Yes, that was my first impulse.

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:28.720
 But since then I've had a second impulse.

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:31.680
 And may I ask why our own son would make up a story

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:33.960
 that Marie begged him for a date if she didn't?

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:37.640
 Well, in the first place you stay home and from a mother's point of view.

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:41.600
 And only a mother... I mean, I know Homer better than you do.

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:43.840
 A boy isn't as popular as he liked to be.

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:44.880
 He's close.

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:46.320
 But he got too much pride with me.

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:48.160
 Well, yeah, I'm sorry, but I believe...

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:53.160
 Now wait a little bit. Tell me honestly. Why would any girl want a pomer?

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:58.160
 And that really shows how little you know your path. Well I know girls.

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:00.160
 Hello. Hello. It's Homer Brown, man.

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:01.160
 Oh.

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:05.160
 Homer, is there bell children too? Yes, but Homer isn't here.

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:08.220
 So this is Mary Allry. When you come to Institute,

00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:12.160
 I'll be busy discussing when I suspect Kingdom Downey can they be just so old?

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:16.160
 Today? Homer? Yes, I just thought it'd be nice if you cut a shower together.

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:18.160
 What are you doing with your telling?

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:19.160
 I will.

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:20.160
 Well thank you. Goodbye.

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:21.160
 Goodbye.

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:22.160
 Elizabeth.

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:23.160
 Yes, please.

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:26.160
 Our number is L-2-3-2.

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:27.160
 Yes, please.

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:29.160
 I guess that was the mistake then.

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:30.160
 What are you doing?

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:34.160
 Why, just a girl for hula.

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:37.160
 Apparently she changed her mind.

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:39.160
 Oh, Homer's name.

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:41.160
 Just tell him I'd like to see him again.

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:42.160
 He hates him.

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:43.160
 Who is this?

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:44.160
 He's traveling on his own.

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:47.600
 I just thought maybe he'd like to sit down and have me have my scream with it.

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:48.600
 Yes?

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:49.960
 Were you telling Mr. Brown?

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:50.960
 No, just a minute.

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:51.960
 Yes, Mr. Brown?

00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:53.600
 Are you sure it's Homer?

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:55.360
 You want to sit down and have ice cream with me?

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:56.360
 Oh, yeah!

00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:57.760
 Very well, I'll put you down.

00:13:57.760 --> 00:13:58.760
 Goodbye.

00:13:58.760 --> 00:13:59.760
 Goodbye.

00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:00.760
 And there's a bag!

00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:01.760
 Yes, we do.

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:04.560
 Apparently, I've been misjudging Homer.

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:07.560
 I don't know what it is, but the boy's got something.

00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:08.560
 No!

00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:09.560
 No!

00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:10.560
 No!

00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:11.560
 No!

00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:12.560
 No!

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:13.560
 No!

00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:15.800
 (cheering)

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:23.760
 - Come down, baby.

00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:24.780
 - Get on me, mom!

00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:26.020
 - What are you running, little boy?

00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:28.320
 - I've been looking for you all lunch hour.

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:30.480
 Would you be willing to put in a phone call for me?

00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:31.320
 - No!

00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:34.240
 - Well, you know how crazy Homer Brown is about him?

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:35.080
 - About me?

00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:35.920
 - Yeah.

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:37.920
 She practically worships you.

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:38.960
 - Me?

00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:40.120
 Really?

00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:40.960
 Homer?

00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:41.960
 - Sure.

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:44.840
 Would you be wearing the medium at the Haven's at 4.15 this afternoon?

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:45.840
 No Henry.

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:46.840
 Why not?

00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:49.240
 He's really a very slow guy once you get to knowing.

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:50.240
 Heeee!

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:52.040
 You mean he is a slave?

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:53.600
 Oh no!

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:57.000
 And boy, if you only knew how crazy he is about him.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
 Oh hi Homer!

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
 So aren't you going home for months?

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.640
 Oh I've got to go in this father shop here.

00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:05.640
 Hello Homer!

00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:07.640
 Homer?

00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:08.640
 Wow!

00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:11.640
 My goodness it's so easy to see those always crazy to see me.

00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:13.640
 But that's how that's for you.

00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:15.640
 As soon as he's got you, he won't hide.

00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:16.640
 He just the same.

00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:19.640
 It's not you wouldn't be very much fun to go out with some of my friends.

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:22.640
 Hey, Henry, what do you want, Charlie?

00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:24.640
 You don't seem only going to barber shop there?

00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:25.640
 Yeah.

00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:26.640
 What do you think he ordered?

00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:28.640
 A shave and a lilac water massage.

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:35.640
 a side. Hello. Hello. Is it Alice O'Rourke? Is it Elizabeth? Oh, yes, Elizabeth. Alice,

00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:49.840
 I want to ask you something and I want to serve it in front. Oh, of course. Tell me, what

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:55.840
 did you think of Mrs. Taunter? Mrs. Taunter? Oh, I think she's perfectly lovely. You do?

00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:57.840
 Yes, and she has a darling daughter.

00:15:57.840 --> 00:15:58.840
 You think so?

00:15:58.840 --> 00:15:59.840
 Yes, why?

00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:06.840
 For no reason, Alice. Only her name happens to be coming up with membership and they quill it's next week and um...

00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:07.840
 And um...

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:08.840
 Yes?

00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:13.840
 And I don't want to be pregnant, it's just because we're finally decided that you threatened our husband with a tooth.

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:18.840
 But frankly, if she called me this morning and accused her we're bothering her daughter.

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:21.840
 And so it's my fault of all the girls, how and how they date for them.

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:24.840
 They do all the phone rings calling inside.

00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:25.840
 It does.

00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:26.840
 And now it's...

00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:28.840
 When I call Mr. Saltis, that's the best.

00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:30.840
 He talked after those he'd never heard of me before.

00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:32.840
 Well, my goodness.

00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:34.840
 Elizabeth, you're the best he's been overdoing.

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:38.840
 I don't know, but the point is, who do you want anyone like that in the club?

00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:49.840
 Hello?

00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:50.840
 Hello?

00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:52.840
 Hello, William Brown speaking?

00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:55.920
 So anyone Mr. Brown is Mrs. Brown by any chance there?

00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:57.380
 No sir, this is my office.

00:16:57.380 --> 00:16:58.580
 You have to call our house.

00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:00.380
 Well I did and there's no answer.

00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:02.520
 And can I leave a very important message?

00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:03.620
 Who is this?

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:08.120
 Wyatt, this is a very close friend of Mr. and Mrs. Sonders.

00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:09.400
 Mr. and Mrs. Sonders?

00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:10.200
 Yes sir.

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:12.680
 And Mr. Sonders wanted me to phone and say his wife

00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:15.000
 and very sorry she bothered Mrs. Brown this morning

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.800
 and she didn't mean any word of it.

00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:17.640
 I see.

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:18.440
 Yes sir.

00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:20.540
 And this is a friend of Mrs. Sonders.

00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:21.240
 Yes sir.

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:22.240
 Just a second.

00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:25.240
 Mr. Saunders is right here in my office, I'll let him talk to you.

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:26.240
 He's where?

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:40.240
 Henry Aldrich will be back in just a few minutes.

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:44.240
 But now let's listen to "Allowie Soul" from "Porgi and Beth."

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:46.820
 (upbeat music)

00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:49.400
 (upbeat music)

00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:51.980

00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:54.560

00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:13.340

00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:15.920
 (upbeat music)

00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:18.500
 (upbeat music)

00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:21.080
 (upbeat music)

00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:23.660
 (upbeat music)

00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:26.420
 (dramatic music)

00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:29.180
 (dramatic music)

00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:31.940
 (dramatic music)

00:18:31.940 --> 00:18:34.700
 (dramatic music)

00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:37.460
 (dramatic music)

00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:40.220

00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:42.800
 (upbeat music)

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:45.560
 (dramatic music)

00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:48.140
 (upbeat music)

00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:50.140
 (music)

00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:52.900
 (dramatic music)

00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:55.660
 (dramatic music)

00:18:55.660 --> 00:18:58.240
 (upbeat music)

00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:01.000
 (dramatic music)

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.760
 (dramatic music)

00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:06.520
 (dramatic music)

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:09.280
 (dramatic music)

00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:12.040
 (dramatic music)

00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:14.800
 (dramatic music)

00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:17.560
 (dramatic music)

00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:20.320
 (dramatic music)

00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:23.080
 (dramatic music)

00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:25.840
 (dramatic music)

00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:28.600
 (dramatic music)

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:31.360
 (dramatic music)

00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:34.120
 (dramatic music)

00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:36.880
 (dramatic music)

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:39.640
 (dramatic music)

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:42.400
 (dramatic music)

00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:45.160
 (dramatic music)

00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:47.920
 (dramatic music)

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:50.680
 (dramatic music)

00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:53.440
 (dramatic music)

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:56.200
 (dramatic music)

00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:58.960
 (dramatic music)

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:26.960
 (music)

00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:36.960
 [Applause]

00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:39.960
 Now getting back to the troubles of Henry Alder.

00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:44.960
 Homer Brown, because of a practical joke played on him at a party last night,

00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:48.960
 is under the impression that he has a date that's afternoon with Marie Zombie.

00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:53.960
 Missus Brown is under the impression Marie's mother objects to Homer's attention.

00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:58.560
 And Henry, which is very much that he had had no part in the joke.

00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:01.160
 The scene opens in the old-rich living room.

00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:03.960
 Henry, was that you that just came in the front door?

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:06.460
 Yes, Mother. Has anyone told me?

00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:07.360
 No, dear.

00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:08.960
 Who are you expecting a call from?

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:10.160
 Oh, Homer.

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:12.460
 Are you passing Anderson or Geraldine Long?

00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:13.460
 No, dear.

00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:14.960
 May I ask what the trouble is?

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:15.960
 The trouble?

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:17.960
 Nothing's the trouble, Mother.

00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:19.660
 Well, I know you didn't eat any lunch.

00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:22.960
 And here you are at 4am afternoon with a face of my lawn.

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:26.660
 Mother, you think girls have the right attitude?

00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:27.660
 Well, it's what?

00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:28.660
 Poor anything.

00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:30.660
 Yeah, I don't know.

00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:33.860
 You ask the girl to do something, and they all say no.

00:21:33.860 --> 00:21:36.260
 Boy, I only think about it themselves.

00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:40.760
 Well, why don't you go out to the ice box and get something to eat and see whether you don't feel better?

00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:44.060
 Mother, if I ate everything in the kitchen, I still wouldn't feel any better.

00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:46.660
 And besides, boy, I've got to go out.

00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:48.060
 May I ask where you're going?

00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:48.760
 I'm just out.

00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:49.960
 I'm going to try one more girl.

00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:51.460
 Then the truth will evolve.

00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:52.460
 Hello?

00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:53.460
 Hello, Alice, this is Sam.

00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:54.460
 What was it you wanted?

00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:55.460
 I wanted?

00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:56.460
 I have a message here saying I'm the phone you.

00:21:56.460 --> 00:21:57.460
 Oh yes, I almost forgot.

00:21:57.460 --> 00:21:58.460
 It's about Henry.

00:21:58.460 --> 00:21:59.460
 Here, I'm finally convinced we ought to do something.

00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:00.460
 What's the trouble?

00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:01.460
 Sam, I think he's getting a complex.

00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:02.460
 A complex?

00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:03.460
 What about?

00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:05.460
 Well, dear, I'm not sure, but I think it's about Homer.

00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:07.460
 You know how terribly popular Homer is these days?

00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:08.460
 Homer is?

00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:10.460
 I didn't know anything about it.

00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:13.460
 Well, neither did I until a little while ago.

00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:15.460
 And Sam apparently handed me a message.

00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:16.460
 I'm not sure.

00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:17.460
 I'm not sure.

00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:18.460
 I'm not sure.

00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:19.460
 But I think it's about Homer.

00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:20.460
 You know how terribly popular Homer is these days?

00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:20.460
 Homer is?

00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:23.060
 Sam apparently Henning must know about it too.

00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:24.720
 Well, what do you want me to do?

00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:27.160
 Call him up and try to make a date?

00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:29.400
 Yeah, this is nothing to laugh about.

00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:32.640
 My first impulse was to suggest that we send him to some other school

00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:35.080
 where you get a brand new set of girls.

00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:36.840
 But I don't think that would do it.

00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:37.340
 No.

00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:40.840
 No, because frankly, I think the cause of the whole trouble is his look.

00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:42.540
 It's look.

00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:44.320
 Well, that's something we can't help.

00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:45.240
 You'll grow too.

00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:46.080
 Well, what?

00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:49.760
 That gray suit of yours, Sam, that we had picked over for Henning to wear.

00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:52.760
 He fought it from the start and I think his instinct was right.

00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:55.760
 Now Alice, we went into that battle and just before school started.

00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:59.760
 And it was to get 25 cents a week extra provided he was willing to wear that suit.

00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:03.760
 Alright here, but we didn't know how the girls would react.

00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:08.760
 And I think the thing to do is to get him a new suit even if it means reducing his allowance.

00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:13.760
 Alright, tell him beginning next week his allowance will be frozen at the old level.

00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:22.760
 [Music]

00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:25.260
 Mother, I give you my word, I don't understand this.

00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:26.760
 I don't understand any part of it.

00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:30.760
 Now, Marty, if you did call home around us, why don't you tell me that he has lost your money?

00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:34.760
 Mother, he's never even said a lot to me, and I never said even that much to him.

00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:37.760
 Well, there's certainly something about this, I don't understand.

00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:39.760
 Exactly what does Mother say when she follows you?

00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:42.760
 Frankly, she began dusting those she's got her head.

00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:45.000
 And I told her, now here, now here!

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:46.600
 You know who you're talking to?

00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:47.640
 And what did she say?

00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:48.520
 There's no thing!

00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:50.120
 I'll see you at his mother.

00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:51.320
 Hello?

00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:52.760
 Who?

00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:54.120
 Homer?

00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:55.320
 Oh, is this Homer Brown?

00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:56.280
 Is that Homer?

00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:58.680
 Mary, let me talk to that young man!

00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:09.080
 Oh, then Mary Orvis,

00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:10.120
 is there anything I can do for you?

00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:14.120
 And when I get sodas all I want right now, Mr. Goodhaven, I've already had two.

00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:16.120
 I think I'll wait a little.

00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:18.120
 And what can I do here, Kathleen?

00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:20.120
 I haven't got all of anything more right now either.

00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:22.120
 But I may want another one.

00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:24.120
 When a person I'm waiting for is yes, here.

00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:25.120
 Kathleen?

00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:27.120
 I'll have another one.

00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:29.120
 After all, I've got here a little late.

00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:31.120
 Who are you waiting for, Kathleen?

00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:33.120
 I think I'm one of the boys.

00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:35.120
 I was promised to meet you here.

00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:36.120
 When were you waiting for?

00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:37.120
 Yes.

00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:38.120
 One of the boys.

00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:41.360
 It's a surprise, we all have to get to go home.

00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:42.560
 Yes, isn't it?

00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:45.600
 Listen to heaven, you want to see any boy waiting here, have you?

00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:46.260
 Honey?

00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:48.400
 No, I didn't see anyone except Homer Brown.

00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:49.400
 Oh, get going?

00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:50.300
 Just a little?

00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:51.200
 Just a little?

00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:53.040
 You can see me, but I'm playing with you.

00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:53.800
 Is that right?

00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:54.640
 Honey?

00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:57.040
 My goodness, how did we go with coming in now again?

00:24:57.040 --> 00:24:58.080
 Let's see where--

00:24:58.080 --> 00:24:59.880
 Hey, we all, we can't catch you?

00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:01.280
 Yes, no, yes, no, we're here.

00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:03.080
 No, we are both, hey, isn't it?

00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:05.080
 It's not wrong.

00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:07.480
 Honey, may I take you over just a second?

00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:08.480
 Me, Kathleen?

00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:11.480
 You mind my asking what you three girls are waiting here for?

00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:13.980
 Well, you certainly don't know how many girls you...

00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:14.980
 Why?

00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:17.980
 [Inaudible]

00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:20.980
 Like, I tell you, Adnis, would you like to have a soda?

00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:22.480
 I'm looking at you to see Homer?

00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:24.980
 [Inaudible]

00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:26.980
 If you hot cross, it will be real.

00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:28.980
 This one's got queen.

00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:29.980
 See, where's the phone?

00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:32.480
 Hey, you don't mind my asking if you're crazy.

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:34.480
 Mary, there's anything you worry about.

00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:35.980
 [Inaudible]

00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:36.980
 Go?

00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:37.980
 No, I'm two.

00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:38.980
 Three, two.

00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:39.980
 Oh, you're right.

00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:42.980
 You're coming to a practical jail time, Mary.

00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:44.980
 Why, if you don't have to raise your voice like that.

00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:46.980
 Oh, you're talking like that, I just...

00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:47.980
 Hello.

00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:48.980
 What are those, who's Mary?

00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:49.980
 Who is this, Mary?

00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:50.980
 No, it's Henry.

00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:51.980
 Is this Homer?

00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:52.980
 Yes, you are.

00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:54.980
 I got a message to Mary for.

00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:55.980
 Mary?

00:25:55.980 --> 00:25:56.980
 My sister?

00:25:56.980 --> 00:26:00.980
 Then when you see your teller, I'm sorry, but you'll have to make it some other time.

00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:02.980
 Listen, Homer, why are you doing?

00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:03.980
 For me.

00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:04.980
 I'm watching.

00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:08.980
 You're walking in a time like this? Don't you ever teach your engagement?

00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:10.980
 I'm going out to dinner.

00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:11.980
 Where?

00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:14.980
 Have Marie Saunders, what do you think I'm laughing for?

00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:15.980
 Is that wrong?

00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:17.980
 And you know what my father just decided?

00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:18.980
 Why?

00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:22.980
 He said any boy that is as popular as I am would have an allowance increase.

00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:23.980
 And for you?

00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:25.980
 Boy, and we are my grit.

00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:28.980
 And you know what Marie's family and my family just decided?

00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:29.980
 Wow.

00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:32.980
 Somebody's been doing some furnaces.

00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:36.980
 And boy, if we find out who it was, do we hit him then?

00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:38.980
 Is that right?

00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:40.980
 But hold on, I'm glad you're happy though.

00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:42.980
 I'll say I am, and I hope you are.

00:26:42.980 --> 00:26:43.980
 Goodbye.

00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:44.980
 Goodbye.

00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:48.980
 This is probably one sit-through of the section, I showed him.

00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:51.980
 Oh, yes, Mr. Behaven. I'll sit-through it.

00:26:51.980 --> 00:26:53.980
 Do you mind if I sit down for a minute?

00:26:53.980 --> 00:27:07.620
 The Aldrich family was rebroadcast for the American Armed Forces and the Reliance.

00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:17.620
