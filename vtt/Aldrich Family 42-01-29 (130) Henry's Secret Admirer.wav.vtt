 Postum presents Henry, Henry Olgrich, come here mother!

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
 The Olgrich family written by Clifford Goldsmith.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
 Entertainment for All the Family brought to you by Postum,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
 attempting wholesome drink for All the Family.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.500
 Good evening.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.500
 This is Dan Seymour, extending a hearty welcome on behalf of Post them.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.500
 As you drew up your chairs to listen to the Oldrich family tonight,

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.400
 you probably never gave a thought to the many other people doing the same thing.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:02.400
 But there are millions of them, and they fall into all classes, rich and poor, old and young, men and women.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.400
 Because it doesn't take any specialized group to appreciate the Aldrich family,

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.400
 any more than it takes a specialized group to appreciate Postam.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:17.400
 Anybody who likes a good, lusty drink, a mealtime drink with real authority in it, can't help but enjoy Postam.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.400
 Anybody who likes a distinctive drink will enjoy Postam.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.300
 because post-dom has a very special goodness,

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.100
 a delicious flavor that stands right out

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.700
 because it's all post-doms and only post-doms.

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.800
 So when you want a mealtime drink that's sure pleasure,

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.700
 be sure to choose post-dom.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:03.200
 Next to actually being young again, there's no better way to recapture that feeling than to know a teenage boy like Henry Aldrich.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.560
 For he acts just like you used to when you were that age and so his troubles become your fun

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.920
 The scene opens at the Aldrich breakfast table

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:18.440
 And he's let it for you Sam and another for you thank you Alice Henry is one for you for me mother for me

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.900
 Alice has an advertisement from some summers odd glimmer lake really father

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:28.180
 I certainly hope we aren't going away any places summer. I certainly are not and I agree with both of you

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.180
 What do you know what I'm gonna do?

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.180
 Well, she was a margin. Henry, what's the matter?

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.780
 Nothing, Mother. I was just reading this letter.

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.180
 Well, please eat your cereal.

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:38.180
 Yes, sure, only.

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.180
 Huh.

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.180
 Father, without looking at any of the rest of the sweater, can you make out this word right here?

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.180
 Why, um, that's fiendish.

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.180
 Oh, yes, of course. I thought it was friendly.

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.180
 Mother! Yes, Mary. Is there any mail for me this morning?

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:54.180
 No, dear. Oh.

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.180
 I mean, who's that letter from?

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.180
 Boy, it's just...

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.180
 Hardly anything.

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.680
 Mary, will you please stop trying to read over my shoulder?

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.680
 Every all I was doing was innocently looking to see whether you'd open one of my letters by mistake.

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:05.680
 Well, I have 'em.

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.180
 You don't even know who this was from.

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.680
 Hi, Henry. Are you through with breakfast?

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.180
 Homer, where did you come from?

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:12.680
 Down since Candy Kitchen.

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.680
 Hi, Mr. Aldrich. Want a piece of fudge?

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:15.180
 What's that?

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.180
 Go ahead. It has walnuts in it.

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.180
 Homer, will you please take that bag from under my nose?

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.180
 Oh, excuse me.

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:21.680
 Homer, I could eat a little.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.180
 Henry, you will please eat your eggs.

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.180
 Henry, have a little piece of fudge on the side, Mrs. Aldrich.

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:31.020
 He may not. Oh, mother, can I speak with Homer confidentially out in the hole with second?

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.140
 Do you haven't even started your breakfast? Mother, my egg is hot.

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.700
 See, I mean, it's not cold enough for me to eat my...

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:42.660
 I'd like to talk to Homer about this... about a certain matter, and will you be right back?

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.940
 Yes, Mother, I'll be out of here in the hole for exactly two minutes and not one second longer.

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.100
 What is it, Henry? Did your report card come?

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:52.300
 Come on, look. It's a letter from a girl. Who is she?

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.420
 That's a beautiful part of it. I don't know.

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:55.820
 What do you mean you don't know?

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:58.020
 Well, I know she lives over an opportunity.

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:59.220
 What about what she says?

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:03.420
 "Dear Henry Orridge, I suppose you will think I am very bold, right?

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.220
 You are boring, let her write this.

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.820
 But I'm simply so bored, I can't help it."

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.420
 "What? What's the matter with it?"

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.620
 "I guess you know your friend Nancy Adams who was visiting here,

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.620
 and yesterday she happened to show me her school yearbook,

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:17.420
 and I said, "Who's that picture?"

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:19.420
 And she said, "Why that's Henry Orridge?"

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:22.420
 And I said, "It's such a boring day. I'm going to write to him."

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:24.420
 And she said, "All right, I dare you."

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:25.720
 And I said, "All right."

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:26.820
 And here I am.

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:27.520
 What's that?

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.920
 Although I'm probably no lady for doing it.

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.720
 - Can we let's see that? - Homer, will you please take your hands off it?

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.120
 All I want to do is read it.

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.420
 In the first place, Homer, some of it is confidential.

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:39.420
 - Read me some more. Read me some more.

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:43.120
 - Um, she says, "You should certainly be glad, Henry.

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.320
 You don't live in this boring place.

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.520
 It's friendly. I mean, fiendish.

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.920
 I can hardly wait until summer comes.

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.420
 and we go to beautiful Lake Pass-Patou

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:54.620
 when there is something doing every minute.

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:56.060
 Where are you gonna be this summer?

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:57.620
 - Henry! - Yes, mother!

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.460
 - Can you come back and eat your egg, please?

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:00.400
 - Yes, mother!

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.160
 - And tell Homer to wait out there!

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.200
 - Hey, Henry, could I be leading the rest of this?

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:05.640
 She was Homer, what do you think this is?

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.060
 Just public property.

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:07.900
 - Henry!

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:09.300
 - I'm coming right now, mother!

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.140
 And, good boy, mother!

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:13.300
 Don't you think what father said a little while ago

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:14.440
 was a good idea?

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:15.940
 What he said about what, Henry?

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:17.740
 How long ago in the way this summer?

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:19.440
 - When did I say we were going away?

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:20.720
 I thought you said...

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:24.740
 Oh, Chief Arthur, don't you think this place is darn boring in the summer?

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:26.980
 Boring? I thought you liked it here.

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:28.480
 Mother, it's fiendish.

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.120
 It's what? Fiendish!

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:31.320
 In the summer.

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.120
 I think we ought to go to Wake Pass but two.

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:36.080
 Lake Pass but two, I never heard of it.

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:36.720
 Henry.

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:37.620
 Or at a Homer.

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:41.120
 Are you sure you don't have anything I could be looking at?

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:41.760
 No.

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:44.320
 Now, Henry Homer is your guest. You go find him a magazine.

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.600
 Yes, Mother, I'll get it for him right away.

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:50.600
 And mother at Lake Pass Batu, there's something doing practically every minute.

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.800
 Well, there's nothing wrong with our home right here.

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.200
 Hey Henry, let me see just one more page of it.

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:57.400
 Okay, Homer, if you promise not to handle it.

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.300
 Where were we? At Lake Pass Batu.

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:00.300
 Oh yeah!

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:02.900
 Oh, here's a good part. Boy, this is good.

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:05.600
 It is raining out. It has been all day.

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.900
 In fact, it's been raining most of this week.

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:09.600
 Is it raining in Centerville?

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:11.100
 Isn't it fiendish?

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:13.300
 If there's one thing I find boring,

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:16.800
 It's a sit indoors all day with nothing to do when it's raining.

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:18.200
 That's very interesting.

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.200
 Henry, Kathleen Anderson, watch you on the telephone.

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:22.300
 Call me, Mary.

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:25.100
 Oh, well, Joe, I can't talk with her.

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:26.600
 I'm very busy right now.

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.500
 Don't worry, Henry. Why do you keep stopping?

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:30.000
 Why? She goes on and says,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.200
 "Naturally, I am anxious to hear all about yourself."

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:35.600
 As Nancy tells me, you are very interesting.

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:37.600
 Will you please promise to write?

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.900
 Please, oh, please, oh, please.

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:40.700
 Oh, boy.

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:42.500
 I hope I have not bored you.

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:43.600
 Has ever...

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.800
 Has ever earned...

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:46.800
 Didn't she sign it?

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:47.800
 Yes, but...

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:50.000
 Homer, can you make that first name out?

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:50.800
 Let's see.

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.200
 I can figure out the last name, okay?

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:54.000
 You can?

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:54.600
 Yeah.

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:55.600
 Good water.

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:57.000
 Good water?

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.400
 That's what it looks like to me.

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:00.400
 Homer, there are two o's in there.

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:02.000
 Could it be drop water?

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.000
 Well...

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.600
 I see what that middle letter is in the first name.

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:06.300
 It's T.

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:07.000
 Gee.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.400
 Could it be Walter?

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:09.500
 Walter?

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:10.800
 Walter, drop water.

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:12.500
 Why would a girl have that name?

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:16.500
 Okay, did you see what it is? It's just as clear as day. It's murder.

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:18.500
 Oh. Oh.

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:20.500
 Murder-top water.

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:23.500
 Henry, tell me frankly, do you think you want to write to her?

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:24.500
 Why not?

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:25.500
 Just because...

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:27.500
 Just because...

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:30.500
 And besides Homer, that isn't an "O" in the West. Name it's an "I."

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:32.500
 Oh, why? It's drip water.

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:34.500
 Thrift. Sure, not drop.

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:36.500
 No wonder you had the wrong impression of her.

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:37.500
 Thrift.

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:38.500
 Henry?

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:39.500
 Yes, mother.

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:42.780
 go after the kitchen get your father drink of water drink of water

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:46.260
 I think why it's my little drink water

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:46.500
 is that a beautiful name

00:07:46.500 --> 00:08:03.020
 I don't like to bother you but I do have something I like to talk over with you

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:06.380
 yes what's the trouble well it's about Henry he's been so upset ever since he

00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:09.680
 got another letter this morning and about a half an hour ago he asked whether I

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:11.380
 didn't think he should have his allowance in cream.

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:14.840
 Mother! Yes, Mary. Did you know Henry got another letter this morning?

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:17.980
 Yes, dear. We know all about it. Mary, turn around.

00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:18.780
 What's for?

00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:20.480
 Dear, I think you ought to go down to the headdresser.

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:23.680
 Mother, aren't you interested? That letter was from some loan company.

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:24.780
 Mary, what's that?

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:25.980
 Where did you say it was for Mary?

00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:29.180
 A loan company in Abbott City. I saw it right up on top of the page.

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:32.280
 And then he came to me and asked if he could borrow some money and he was all excited.

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:33.480
 Yes. Father.

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:35.280
 Sam, what do you suppose is the mother?

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:37.280
 Can I see you along for it?

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:39.880
 Oh, oh, hello, Mary.

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:40.880
 Hello, Mother.

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:41.880
 Hello.

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:42.880
 Hello.

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:43.880
 Hello.

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:46.400
 This is nice, but we can be together.

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:48.400
 We very seldom get together.

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:49.400
 Henry.

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:50.400
 Yes, Father?

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:52.200
 What was it you came in here to say?

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:53.200
 Right.

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:54.200
 Well, I'll tell you, Father.

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.200
 Oh, boy.

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:56.200
 I'll answer the door.

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:57.200
 I mean, that's probably from me.

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:59.080
 Now, when it's a Mother, I think it's someone to see me.

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:01.040
 I'm sort of a business arrangement.

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:02.040
 Oh, Mother.

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:03.920
 Hello, I tried to come in.

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:04.920
 What's the idea?

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:05.920
 What do I do?

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:06.920
 I'm keeping your door locked.

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:08.920
 How do you expect your friends to come in?

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:11.920
 My father asked us to keep it locked every morning until he goes to the office.

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:12.920
 Or something, Homer.

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:14.920
 Have you got the 35 cents?

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:15.920
 Yes, here.

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:16.920
 Now, where's the letter?

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:17.920
 Right here.

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:18.920
 Hand it to me.

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:19.920
 Oh, no.

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:20.920
 I didn't say I'd let you read it.

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:21.920
 I said I'd read it to you.

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:22.920
 What did she say?

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:23.920
 What did she say?

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:24.920
 Don't push me, Homer.

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:25.920
 She says, "My dear head."

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:26.920
 Oh, boy.

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:29.920
 I received your four-two page letter and it was a whiz.

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:30.920
 Oh, why?

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:31.920
 Never mind, Homer.

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:36.480
 I hope you will excuse my using my father's business stationery, but my new paper, which

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:39.520
 incidentally is a whiz, hasn't come yet.

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:43.560
 You will ask me to describe myself, and I'll do the best I can.

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:47.560
 Although there are some things I can say because you would think I was terribly conceited.

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:51.360
 First of all, I am five feet nine.

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:52.760
 Homer, could that be nine?

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:54.960
 She wished him the only five feet eight.

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:56.560
 Eight and a quarter, Homer.

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:59.640
 Besides, that isn't a nine, it's a two, it's as clear as day.

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:01.000
 Looks like a nine to me.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.000
 I am five feet two and have rather pleasing eyes, they say.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:11.000
 Although I do wish at times my eyelashes weren't quite so long because they are always somehow getting in my way.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
 What does she have to do, Com?

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
 Homer, stop interrupting me.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000
 As to the color of my eyes, I wish you were here to judge for yourself.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
 Some boys say they are gray. Some boys say they are green.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
 What's the U like?

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.000
 You mean you can have your choice?

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
 Oh, Homer, lots of things change color in different lights.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.000
 Where was I?

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.680
 was I right here what color will you have oh yes as tonight here which is black I

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:39.280

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:45.040
 yes mother are you busy wait I'm carrying out a little transaction you might say

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:49.280

00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:58.280
 dear I just want you to know that if you really need money and would be willing

00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:01.680
 to tell your father what you need it for he might see his way clear to helping you

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:07.400
 out mother I appreciate you're bringing it up but you've got so many things on

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:11.600
 your mind I think it would be best I just didn't bother you mind if I make

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:14.760
 it a point with a hairdresser someday this week no not at all

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:19.060
 Henry Kathleen Anderson phoned you again she did she was I think Center for

00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:22.520
 Girls are just boring Henry yes Homer I'm coming

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:27.200
 Marya you going to the hand dresser yes well why don't you get a feather cut

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:28.600
 Boy, that time is a whiz.

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:29.720
 A feather cut, Henry.

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:31.560
 After I let my hair grow this long.

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:32.120
 Henry.

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:33.440
 I'm coming, Homer.

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:34.240
 Where was I?

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:36.400
 She just got in a shampoo or something.

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:37.200
 You're crazy.

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:39.120
 Here's where I stopped.

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:42.120
 I think your idea of phoning me is a whiz.

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:43.480
 And I'll certainly be thrilled when

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:45.600
 I hear that old telephone ring.

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:47.920
 Yours hastily murdered drink water.

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:50.520
 Henry, is her name really drink water?

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:51.480
 Why not?

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:52.360
 Boy.

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:54.240
 Do you think she could be part Indian?

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:55.280
 Now what's in Homer?

00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:57.280
 What's that at the bottom of the page?

00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:59.280
 Well, she was. I hadn't seen that.

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:00.280
 Huh.

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:02.280
 Instead of your phone on me,

00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:03.280
 why don't I phone you?

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:05.280
 If I never know where I'm going to be next.

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:07.280
 So I'll call you on Friday between five and six.

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:10.280
 You mean you don't need my money? We'll give it back to me.

00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:11.280
 No, all right. We'll not.

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:13.280
 Suppose she calls me "collect."

00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:15.280
 Don't you think she expects me to be a gentleman?

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:18.280
 Well, if I let you keep it, can I be here when she calls?

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:20.280
 No, Homer.

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:21.280
 Boy, just think.

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:24.280
 Tomorrow I hear Myrtle's voice for the first time.

00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:28.240
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:37.400
 Sam, have you thought anything more about our going away

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:37.920
 this summer?

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:39.560
 Alice, I thought we decided not to go.

00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:40.280
 Mother!

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:41.160
 Yes, Henry?

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:42.560
 What time of the now?

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:45.160
 It's exactly 20, very suffice.

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:46.360
 Thank you, Father.

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:48.280
 Alice, if you'd like to take a cottage someplace

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:50.320
 for a couple of weeks, I'm sure I have no objections.

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:51.400
 Well, there's somebody.

00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:52.680
 I can't remember who it was.

00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:55.780
 said something about Lake Pazpatou being a nice place to go.

00:12:55.780 --> 00:12:56.880
 Lake Pazpatou?

00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:00.120
 Somebody mentioned it in the last couple of days and said it was wonderful.

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:00.720
 Farmer!

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:01.080
 Yes?

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:02.640
 Are you sure your watch is right?

00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:03.480
 I'm positive.

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:06.640
 Would you please tell me why you ask what time it is every 60 seconds?

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:07.560
 No reason, Father.

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:10.440
 I was just waiting for it to be five o'clock.

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:12.600
 Henry, why do you have your new blue suit on?

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:15.000
 Well, she wasn't-- I got that on.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.280
 This is the telephone, oh boy.

00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:18.280
 Henry, don't run.

00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:20.240
 She was-- what was that cheer there?

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:20.740
 That's right.

00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:23.000
 I'm sorry, Father. I'll pick it up when I come back.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.400
 Father, just say we are. Please, I beg of you.

00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:26.680
 Henry, what's the matter with you?

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:28.440
 Nothing, Mother, it's just a...

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:29.880
 Hello, hello, I'm distance.

00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:30.680
 What's that?

00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:32.140
 Mother, is that you?

00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:34.080
 Get off the line, the phone just rang.

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:35.520
 Sure, I'm calling you.

00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:36.580
 Has he found you?

00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:38.420
 No, Mother, will you please hang up?

00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:39.960
 Okay, and I'll be right over.

00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:41.220
 No, Mother, you're not to come over.

00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:42.660
 I don't want you even around here.

00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:45.460
 Aren't you gonna be talking to her on my 35 cents?

00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:47.620
 Mother, please, listen to the reason.

00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:49.720
 Look, if I'll tell you something,

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:52.240
 She said in the letter this morning we have say where you are.

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:53.240
 Is it any good?

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:54.120
 Sure it is.

00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:56.920
 So I thought better than any telephone conversation would be.

00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:58.440
 Well, all right.

00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:02.560
 She says she wants me to come to a bow mass tomorrow night.

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:03.600
 To a what?

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:04.920
 To a bow mass.

00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:07.600
 That's a masquerade party over in Abbott City.

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:09.240
 Henry, do you think it's safe?

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:10.600
 What do you mean safe?

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:11.960
 Are you going Henry?

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:12.880
 Sure I'm going.

00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:13.320
 Henry.

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:14.160
 Yes, mother.

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:15.840
 Do you have to hang up right this minute?

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:16.560
 I will.

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:19.080
 Homer, my mother says I have to hang up and I guess she's right.

00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:20.080
 goodbye.

00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:21.080
 Henry.

00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:23.080
 She, mother, did you save my wife?

00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:26.080
 Dear, I want you to jump on your bicycle and go right down to the meat market.

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:28.080
 And I'll write this in a minute.

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:33.480
 But, mother, I'm expecting a very important...a very important woman of government appreciators

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:34.960
 if we didn't have meat tonight.

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:37.080
 We didn't have any last night or the night before.

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:38.080
 Now, please start.

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:39.080
 Well, couldn't Mary go.

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:40.080
 Mary's down at the hairdressers.

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:43.080
 And, Henry, if you can't help me out, I'll have to go and tell your father.

00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:44.080
 Yes, mother.

00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:45.080
 I'll go only again.

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:46.080
 Then please get started.

00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:47.080
 The meat will be already for us.

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:49.080
 Well, just as soon as I...

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:50.080
 As I'm...

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:51.080
 Hello.

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:52.080
 Number three.

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:53.080
 Operator, this is Henry Olbergev.

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:56.080
 I'm expecting a very important call from Abbott City Museum.

00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:58.080
 When it comes, could you switch around to the butcher shop?

00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:11.080
 Now getting back to the troubles of Henry Olderge.

00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:15.080
 Just as Henry was expecting a long distance call from a girl he has never met,

00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:19.480
 He was suddenly and firmly sent to the meat market where the scene now opens.

00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:22.280
 Hey, Mr. Wilson. Mr. Wilson.

00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:23.280
 Hi there, Henry.

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:24.480
 What are my mother's meat ready?

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:25.480
 Here it is right here.

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:28.280
 Oh boy, thanks. Has a telephone call come for me?

00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:30.080
 No, not since I've been on to it.

00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:32.080
 Jim, expecting an important call.

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:33.680
 Oh boy, there she is right now.

00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:35.080
 You better let me answer it first.

00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:37.080
 Oh, we'll keep a tower right here, won't you?

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:39.680
 Hello? Henry?

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:43.080
 Here I am. Oh boy, I guess I got here just the right time, didn't I?

00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:45.080
 I was a phone distance.

00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:46.080
 It is not.

00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:47.080
 Henry...

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:49.080
 Father, is that you? Something happened to her?

00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:50.080
 Something happened to whom?

00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:51.080
 Who's calling me?

00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:52.080
 I am.

00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:55.080
 As long as you're down in town, I want you to run over to the Haven's drugstore

00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:56.080
 and get some cigars for me.

00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:57.080
 No!

00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:58.080
 And hurry home. Goodbye.

00:15:58.080 --> 00:15:59.080
 Father, I...

00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:01.080
 Oh boy.

00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:03.080
 Mr. Wump's the one at long distance call comes for me.

00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:06.080
 Could you tell them they can catch me over the Haven's drugstore?

00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:08.080
 All right, on the way I couldn't.

00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:10.080
 What's the name of the party that's calling?

00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:11.080
 Her name is Myrtle Drink.

00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:14.080
 Why, she'll just ask for me.

00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:26.080
 Alice. Yes, Sam.

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:28.080
 Did you call to Havens and leave that message?

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:31.080
 Yes, I did. But was it you started to say about Lake Paz-Patou?

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:35.080
 Only that I'd heard of someone downtown who owns a couple of cottages up there.

00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:39.080
 Well, that's fine, Sam, because I don't know whether it's just one of my pre-manitions or not,

00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:42.580
 but it seems to me if we could get Henry away from this town this summer,

00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:44.580
 he might not have quite so many problems.

00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:46.580
 Yeah, and go to the telephone again.

00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:47.580
 I'll see what it is.

00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:48.080
 It is Henry.

00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:49.580
 Time to please hurry.

00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:50.580
 Hello?

00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:51.580
 Is this Elm?

00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:52.580
 303.

00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:53.580
 It is?

00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:54.580
 This is long distance.

00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:56.580
 I have a call from Abbott City, so it's to Henry Aldrich.

00:16:56.580 --> 00:16:58.580
 Henry Aldrich isn't here right now.

00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:00.080
 May I ask who the call is from?

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:02.080
 Why, it's a party by the name of Drinkwater.

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:03.080
 Drinkwater?

00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:04.080
 Oh, thank you.

00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:06.080
 Then who was it?

00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:08.080
 Someone from Abbott City, but the name of Alice.

00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:12.660
 I know who that was calling him. I know exactly who that was a fellow by the name of drink water

00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:17.100
 And he's connected with that lone company over an abbot city that hen has been getting lettuce from oh my goodness

00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:33.480
 Mr. Dehaven are you too busy to wait on me? I guess not Henry. Well, first of the phone call come for me

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:35.480
 Yes, two of them

00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:41.720
 No, they were both from your mother she wants you to get a quart of milk at the groceries and then stop at the cleaners and pick up your father's suit

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:47.720
 Oh boy. Oh boy. Just a minute now wrap your father cigars for you. The only trouble is I'm expecting a quote from a girl

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:52.520
 And it's coming here to your drugstore. That's right. There's a big mask right over in Abbott City tomorrow night

00:17:52.520 --> 00:18:00.240
 But you know I'm gonna wear no confederate sold here. What's that? Oh boy? Mr. Heyman. Could I after your phone? It's probably what must be

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:02.720
 Come on, is this long distance?

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:03.720
 Hello?

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:06.720
 Hello, could you worship a bottle of paragord right away?

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:15.720
 Hello? Hello?

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:17.720
 Hello, Abbott City Mortgage and Loan Company.

00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:19.720
 May I speak with Mr. Drinkwater, please?

00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:22.720
 I'm sorry, but Mr. Drinkwater isn't in right now.

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:26.720
 Well, could you tell me whether my son has been trying to borrow money or owes you any?

00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:27.720
 What is the name?

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:29.720
 Henry Orrits.

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:32.720
 Well, we aren't allowed to give out confidential information, sir.

00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:34.720
 I know, but he's my son, and he's...

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:38.720
 I'm sorry, you'll have to speak to Mr. Drinkwater personally, and he isn't here.

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:40.720
 I see. Well, thank you.

00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:41.720
 Goodbye.

00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:42.720
 Goodbye.

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:43.720
 Sam, how much does Henry Odom?

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:46.720
 She wouldn't tell me. She said, as a matter of fact, I know what I'll do.

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:47.720
 What, Sam?

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:49.720
 Now, when Henry comes in, don't say one word about any of this.

00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:50.720
 You don't think we should?

00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:53.720
 I got to drive over to Abbott City on some other business in the next few days, anyhow,

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:55.720
 and I'll drop in and have a talk with Drinkwater.

00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:56.720
 Really?

00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:59.500
 When did I hear Father Sam, it's something you've ever called for.

00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:00.940
 Henry, when did you get back?

00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:01.940
 Yes, I was.

00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:02.940
 Tell us.

00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:05.780
 Henry, I was simply talking about going over to Abbott City sometimes.

00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:06.780
 Oh, that's all.

00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:07.780
 This is strange.

00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:13.020
 Father, do you have any ideas as to when you might be driving over?

00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:15.020
 Oh, any time in the next few days.

00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:18.220
 Well, they have awfully good movies over there sometimes.

00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:23.020
 Wouldn't you like to take Mother and go over to my night and have a good time instead

00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:24.020
 of tonight?

00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:25.020
 Yes, sure.

00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:26.660
 And I might go along with you.

00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:28.660
 Well, we'll see. We'll take it over.

00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:29.660
 But we're there it is.

00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:31.660
 Henry, will you please walk?

00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:32.660
 Why don't you want a message?

00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:33.660
 Well, gee, wouldn't it?

00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:34.660
 Hey, what's the matter?

00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:37.660
 Don't think, mother, I just flew into the telephone table.

00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:38.660
 Well, get up off that floor.

00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:41.660
 I don't need to. I can talk right down here.

00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:43.660
 Come on, phone, distance, phone, distance.

00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:45.660
 Hello, Henry. What did she say?

00:19:45.660 --> 00:20:00.660
 [Music]

00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:04.660
 Hi Mr. Johnson. I came in and see if you found that costume for me.

00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:09.660
 Oh yes, Henry, here it is. This lieutenant uniform is the last confederate outfit I have in the place.

00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:11.660
 Well, gee, that's exactly what I wanted.

00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:12.660

 as a Confederate soldier and she'd like you just as well as a policeman wouldn't she the only thing

00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:40.380
 We never met, and I don't want to confuse her.

00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:42.380
 Can I use your phone a second?

00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:44.380
 Yeah, help yourself. It's right there.

00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:45.380
 Hello.

00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:48.380
 Mr. Johnson, do I get a sword without the two dollars?

00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:50.380
 The sword's 50 cents extra.

00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:51.380
 Oh, number three.

00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:53.380
 I want Elm 787.

00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:55.380
 Elm 787?

00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:56.380
 Yes, please.

00:20:56.380 --> 00:21:00.380
 Mr. Johnson, do I understand correctly if 50 cents left without the sword?

00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:02.380
 Hello, Sam. I'm on it speaking.

00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:06.380
 Father, don't you think I have a hat, a sash, a coat, pants, and sword, a dirt chair?

00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:08.660
 and sort a dirt cheap for two and a half hours.

00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:09.500
 What's that?

00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:10.660
 Just for one night.

00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:11.540
 Who is this?

00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:13.140
 It's your son, Henry.

00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:15.420
 I have a chance to go to a costume ball tonight

00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:17.980
 and generally for two and a half dollars.

00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:18.820
 Two and a half?

00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:19.660
 With the sword.

00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:20.940
 Two dollars without.

00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:21.440
 Good.

00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:22.060
 Take it.

00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:24.540
 Only don't try to get the money from a stranger.

00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:25.500
 Where will I get it?

00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:26.060
 From me.

00:21:26.060 --> 00:21:27.260
 Goodbye.

00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:30.060
 Well, Taylor, thank you very-- goodbye.

00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:32.340
 Mr. Johnson, I can take it.

00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:33.700
 Mr. Johnson, where are you?

00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:34.100
 Hi, Henry.

00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:35.180
 How do I look?

00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:37.620
 Listen, Ed, Carney, what are you doing with that uniform on?

00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:38.460
 I'm gonna rent it.

00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:39.580
 Eddie, I'm gonna let it take him.

00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:40.820
 You have not.

00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:41.660
 Eddie, give me that.

00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:43.260
 Now listen, Henry, you take your hands off that.

00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:44.380
 Now, what are you-- stop pushing me.

00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:45.260
 Now, wait, boys.

00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:46.100
 What's the idea?

00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:47.820
 Mr. Johnson, I want this uniform.

00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:49.700
 Mr. Johnson, I said I take it.

00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:51.180
 Well, Henry's right, Ed.

00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:52.060
 Don't give it to me, Ed.

00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:54.140
 Henry, for the last time, take your hands off me.

00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:55.780
 You make me throw in your hair.

00:21:55.780 --> 00:21:56.780
 Oh, take that.

00:21:56.780 --> 00:21:57.540
 Now, listen, Henry.

00:21:57.540 --> 00:21:58.180
 Now, wait, boys.

00:21:58.180 --> 00:22:00.020
 Let's not have another war over this.

 (Music)

00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:11.020
 How do you feel, Henry?

00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:12.020
 All right.

00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:15.020
 Here, put this cloth on your other eye.

00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:19.020
 Boy, did you take a beating, but I got the costume, didn't I?

00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:21.020
 It's corny, doesn't look so hot either.

00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:23.020
 Where's the costume? Let me put it on.

00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:25.020
 It's still down at Mr. Johnson.

00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:29.020
 After we got through, we said he thought it would look a little better if he gave it a brushing and pressing.

00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:30.020
 Henry?

00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:32.020
 Yes, Mother. He has a letter for you.

00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:36.020
 Are you quite sure you feel real enough to go to that dance tonight there?

00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:38.020
 Look, I never felt better in my life.

00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:40.020
 Well, you know this, I suppose.

00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:41.020

 You're looking right at it.

00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:45.020
 I am?

00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:49.020
 Can me film, do you think I ought to read the letter to you with your eyes feeling the way they do?

00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:52.020
 Now, Homer, I can read it perfectly all right.

00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:56.020
 Dear Henry, as long as I know exactly what you're going to look like,

00:22:56.020 --> 00:22:59.020
 I think it is only fair that you know what I'm going to wear.

00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:02.020
 And so I'm in closing a photograph of me and my costume.

00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:03.020
 She was where is it?

00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:04.020
 Where is it?

00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:05.020
 There it is, right there.

00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:06.020
 Oh boy.

00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:07.020
 Oh boy.

00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:08.020
 Let me see it.

00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:10.020
 Oh boy, Henry, wait until you see it.

00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:12.020
 Homer, I got to knock you down too.

00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:13.020
 Here, take a look at her.

00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:17.020
 Boy, is that a sight for sore eyes.

00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:18.020
 She was home with that?

00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:21.020
 Yeah, Penry, murder, drink water.

00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:23.020
 Why, no, but she looks like an icicle.

00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:25.020
 Hey, no, Homer, but look at that face.

00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:29.700
 a face. Can we do you think that might be a mask that goes with the costume? No,

00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:33.340
 Homer, it's real. And Ram. Yes, father. You want to be ready to go over with me?

00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:38.460
 I'm leaving in a few minutes. To Abbott's city? Yes. Well, the only thing is father.

00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:42.260
 Frankly, I don't think I'll be going to that band. You're not going? Why not? He's

00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:45.940
 just had some bad news, Mr. Aldrich. Henry, do I hear you say you want going?

00:23:45.940 --> 00:23:50.620
 Mother, my eyes are sort of tired. I don't think I'd want to go over there and

00:23:50.620 --> 00:23:54.580
 strain them. Well, I'd actually better get your things on. Sam, I don't think I want

00:23:54.580 --> 00:23:57.820

00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:25.180
 No, as well, I have a copy idea of doing it.

00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:26.100
 Alice, are you coming?

00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:27.300
 No, Sam, you go ahead.

00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:27.900

00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:31.500
 What's that?

00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:32.700
 Yes, it's a whiz.

00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:33.140
 Oh, that is.

00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:35.220
 Sam, you didn't go inside the lease, did you?

00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:36.740
 Alice, I thought you wanted to go there.

00:24:36.740 --> 00:24:38.140
 Yes, someone told me this afternoon

00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:39.620
 we wouldn't like it there one bit.

00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:41.300
 Lake Paspattu, mother?

00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:43.180
 Why in the world do we want to go to that place?

00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:44.380
 Well, that's what I'd like to know.

00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:45.980
 They say it's simply fiendish.

00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:46.340
 I mean--

00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:48.780
 Well, what I'd like to know is what I'm driving all the way

00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:50.660
 over to Abbott City alone for.

00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:57.060

00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:15.940
 May we remind your friends, there's

00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:18.340
 a best way to do everything, a best way

00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:22.300
 to build a bridge or make a suit of clothes to bake a cake or even to make a

00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:26.820
 cup of post them. And the best way to make post them is to follow the directions on

00:25:26.820 --> 00:25:31.340
 the package because they're tested directions designed to make the most of

00:25:31.340 --> 00:25:36.100
 that hearty, robust, post-em flavor. They give you a cup of post-em at its

00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:42.020
 delicious best. So always follow the directions to a swell cup of post-em.

00:25:58.020 --> 00:26:00.020
 Hello? Hello?

00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:01.020
 Hi Henry, is this you?

00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:02.020
 Yes, who's this?

00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:08.020
 Ed Carney, I just want to tell you my father went down and had a talk with Mr. Johnson and I'm going to wear that Confederate uniform after all.

00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:11.020
 You are? To the mass-grade Navix city?

00:26:11.020 --> 00:26:12.020
 And you're going to stay.

00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:13.020
 Or, Siam.

00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:15.020
 And if you show up, I'll knock your block off.

00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:18.020
 Well, as a matter of fact, let me give you a tip.

00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:21.020
 If you get bored, look around for a girl named Muggle Drinkwater.

00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:24.020
 She's got a femmer bob and boy, she's a wiz.

00:26:24.020 --> 00:26:35.020

00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:38.020

 his family and his pals.

 The Ovrich family is written by Clifford Goldsmith.

00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:49.020
 The original musical score is played by Jack Miller's orchestra, Ben Lutlow conducting.

00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:55.020
 Your host tonight is Postam, and Postam is one of America's great mealtime drinks.

00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:58.020
 It's good drinking. Good night.
