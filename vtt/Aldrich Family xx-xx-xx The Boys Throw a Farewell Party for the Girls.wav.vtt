00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
 [Music]

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
 And now for the Audrey Family.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
 Grown-ups ought to go back now and then to a time when the world was younger.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
 The first person to meet on a trip back to the youth will always be a typical

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 scene-age for a like Henry Audrey.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
 The scene opens in the Audrey Front Hall. It's just before noon.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
 Homer, why Henry?

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:52.440
 Oh, has that just said anything to you about coming up to visit her at Lake Witsham

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.000
 I guess it's just what they're mind.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 Yeah.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.520
 I guess it's the same thing with Agnes.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:59.520
 Yeah.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.520
 Yeah.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.760
 Agnes is bound to inviting us to a later road, don't you think?

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:05.760
 Sure, Homer, sure.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.880
 I mean, you consider what we've been to each other.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.880
 If it hadn't been for me, what would she have done with her money all year?

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:13.880
 [Laughter]

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.880
 Except a matter of time, Homer.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:17.880
 Sure.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:18.880
 Sure.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:19.880
 Sure.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.760
 - Have we been an Agnes?

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.400
 They're leaving tomorrow morning.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.600
 - They know him, they know.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.080
 - Homer, suppose they find two other guys up at the lake

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.840
 that are more interesting than we are.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.840
 - You think that's possible, Henry?

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.640
 (loud roaring)

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.120
 - More incredible things have happened, Homer.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.880
 - Henry, we just gotta get ourselves invited up there

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.040
 for a couple of weeks to protect our image.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.000
 - Maybe we ought to go over right now and drop a few hints.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.320
 You know, gradually.

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:48.600
 - I already did that.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.000
 Just last night I happened to make an alias how terrible I'd feel not to you all summer.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.800
 And you know what she said. She said I made her feel wonderful.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.400
 What? So I'd miss her like that.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:06.000
 Oh. She said the thought of my being miserable would keep her happy all summer long.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 I guess she didn't catch on. I guess learn.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.400
 Henny, there's just one thing to do.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.100
 What's the? Ask the girls right out if they wouldn't like to invite us up for a couple of weeks.

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.100
 Ask them right to their face.

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.600
 Sure.

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.400
 And have them think we're anxious?

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.800
 But we are.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.800
 Well, sure we are, Homer, but see, whiz.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.800
 Don't you think we ought to at least warm them up first?

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.000
 See, whiz, we've been warming them up all the way to our own.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.800
 Homer, you're right.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:34.800
 Hand me the phone.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.100
 Here.

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:38.700
 Elm, three, four, four.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.000
 Elm, three, four, four.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.200
 Listen, hey, we'll pass in this one.

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.800
 Don't lie to die, ruse.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:44.800
 Don't lie to ruse.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.000
 Lie to die, lie to die.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.240
 Ask her right out. Don't worry, Homer. I'll put my cards right on the table.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.080
 Hello.

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.040
 Hello, Kathleen. This is Henry.

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.240
 Oh, you know.

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.800
 Hello.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.920
 Kathleen, do you mind if I ask you a direct question?

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.080
 A direct question.

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.040
 That's the way, hey.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.200
 My goodness, Henry, what a direct question.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.200
 Well, Kathleen.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.880
 Yeah.

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.640
 Kathleen.

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.400
 Yeah?

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.360
 Kathleen.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.680
 You know July has 31 days.

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.360
 [Laughter]

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.360
 What?

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.480
 And then there's August in September.

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.240
 It'll stop a lot of these orange.

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.240
 It was a long time.

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.600
 Who didn't have the hose?

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:27.880
 High-cathletes.

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.040
 Don't hold me. Wait a minute. Here's Adley.

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.680
 I'll show you how to ask a direct question, Henry.

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.760
 My mom and Adley's house.

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.040
 Look, Adley.

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.440
 I have a direct question for you.

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.040
 I'll tell you too.

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:45.640
 Agnes, have you ever noticed how hot it gets here in the summer?

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:46.640
 No!

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.040
 Or you could try eggs on the sidewalk.

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.640
 I don't like fried eggs.

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.640
 Neither do I. But if you did, you could.

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.640
 Well, I sure am lucky I'll be able to like winterman class here all summer.

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.640
 Well, you know, but how about me?

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:01.640
 You.

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.240
 I'll tell you what I'll do a little bit.

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:04.040
 Why?

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.040
 Why I'll tell you a little bit I'll tell you what I'll do.

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.040
 Why?

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.040
 I'm not gonna stop.

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.040
 What I'm gonna do.

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.040
 I'm gonna go hang up now, see you now.

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.040
 What I'm gonna do.

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:21.040
 Well, Henry, let's stop lying down here and think of what we can do now.

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:31.040
 [music]

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:35.040
 Boy, Henry, a farewell party. That's a perfect idea.

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.040
 You think so? You really think that'll impress the girl.

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.440
 I'll say I got it all figured out.

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:40.840
 We'll be surely.

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:41.440
 See?

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.240
 All you need alone.

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.240
 Then we'll look at the more terms we'll eat up to inviting us to the lake.

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.740
 Sure.

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:48.440
 Sure.

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.440
 What are you doing to that lamp, Homer?

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:51.840
 I'm schooling the boat.

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:52.840
 What for?

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:57.040
 I'm just trying to make this party as cheap as possible for your parents.

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.640
 Homer, that isn't necessary.

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.840
 Besides, we'll want to dance.

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:02.640
 We will?

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:03.440
 Sure.

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.040
 Well, there'll still be plenty of life.

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.880
 How?

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.880
 Through the dial of the radio.

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.200
 Homer.

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.000
 Besides, what kind of the idea of the party

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.480
 is gonna be here at my house?

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:14.480
 Where is it?

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.520
 Well, your house is very homing.

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.880
 - Mary, I don't think so.

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.480
 My mother's against parties.

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:23.320
 - The end?

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:24.840
 Especially if I'm invited.

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.680
 - Look, suppose we do this.

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.480
 If I go in and ask my mother,

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:31.280
 would you be willing to phone yours?

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:35.200
 - Well, also, but I don't hold out to my toes.

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.320
 Mother, mother, are you in the kitchen?

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:39.520
 Yes, Henry.

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.200
 I'm trying not to get in my way, dear.

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:42.800
 Your father's coming home for lunch.

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.080
 Your mother.

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:47.340
 Mother, if you were a girl, how would you

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:49.840
 feel about a farewell party?

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.080
 If I were a girl, I'd like it very much.

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.840
 You think Kathleen will be impressed?

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.240
 You having a party, sir?

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:59.480
 That's a quiet little get together with Homer and Agnes.

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:00.640
 That sounds very nice.

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:01.720
 You think so?

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:08.720
 Well, Mother, don't you think I ought to have it in a place where I'll feel right at home?

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:11.120
 Henry, we're not having another party here.

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:11.920
 Well, Mother.

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:16.720
 Well, there's a nice boy, Henry, but I'd like to keep my home in one piece a while longer.

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:21.120
 What if you're all a schooler and if I have one here, why?

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:24.420
 I don't think I better schooler learn it 'til she's cooled off.

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:25.720
 He said no.

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.420
 That's one of the things she said.

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:29.420
 [Laughter]

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:31.520
 Mother, you're our last hope.

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:36.080
 I'm sorry, dear, but do you remember what happens when Homer tripped last New Year's Eve?

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:39.280
 That lovely picture of Aunt Harriet got right off the ball.

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:41.520
 I know, only hasn't looked the same since.

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:46.880
 Mother, suppose Homer promises to keep an eye on his seat every minute.

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:49.840
 He was a little bit older, if it'll make you feel any better.

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:53.600
 I was somewhere else to learn the Calcula and look it off at all evening.

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:54.960
 Please, Mother.

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:56.400
 All right, not all.

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:00.400
 And the kitchen's sad, and we're supposed to leave it up to your father.

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:05.780
 father you think we ought to drag in people who might be prejudiced I do

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:11.460

 Whitmer classy tomorrow tomorrow the lost in the Anderson's are leaving so

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:29.180
 soon so when you say a farewell party is a good idea why well what do you know

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:31.180
 Well, if I don't think you would do any harm.

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:32.180
 Gee, Father.

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:34.180
 Oh, I missed you all.

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:36.180
 Can I miss you?

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:38.180
 Oh, you may sign.

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:40.180
 Oh, thank you.

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:42.180
 Well, you think so, Sam.

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:43.180
 You know what, Alice?

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:45.180
 We owe the Anderson's and the Lawson's a little party.

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:47.180
 Why not have them come over to make one big party of it?

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:48.180
 What?

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:50.180
 Well, Sam, that's an excellent idea.

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:53.180
 We can all say goodbye in one cell swoop.

00:07:53.180 --> 00:08:02.580
 [Music]

00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:05.180
 Ah, wait, could you help me do after the peanut butter?

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:06.380
 I'm just going to tell you, you know,

00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:07.980
 because you're going to have something to eat.

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:09.580
 Why bother with peanut butter, John?

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:10.780
 Oh, I'm going to love some.

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:11.780
 Oh, here.

00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:14.580
 John, why wasn't it sweet of the boys who arranged

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:16.380
 a farewell party for a young thing?

00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:17.780
 I'm going to tell you.

00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:18.780
 Here, John.

00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:22.180
 I guess you're not going to put chili sauce on the peanut butter.

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:23.780
 - Oh, my life's just this way.

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:25.620
 You guys can't ask anything

00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:27.700
 to tell a type of a peanut butter.

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:28.860
 (audience laughing)

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:30.660
 But if you have any trouble talking to your parents

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:32.220
 into inviting homeless to the lake,

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:33.660
 I'll say I did.

00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:34.940
 I don't feel I should speak to them

00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:37.540
 with their homework until I grow up and get more sense.

00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:39.420
 Now don't forget, we're not going to tell them

00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:41.620
 about being invited until the last minute.

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:43.900
 They'll be so surprised they'll fall over.

00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:47.460
 - Kathleen, do you think we're doing the right thing, don't you?

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:49.140
 - Do you think we're doing the right thing, don't you?

00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:51.580
 - No, inviting the boys up to the lake.

00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:52.580
 What do you mean?

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:56.580
 I mean, well, there'll be other boys up there,

00:08:56.580 --> 00:09:00.580
 and don't you think we should stand some new blood?

00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:01.580
 You're good.

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:04.580
 You will find some, but why burn our bridges behind them?

00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:05.580
 What bridges?

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:08.580
 I mean, Homer, you and I come back and find they've gotten into

00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:11.580
 certain other girls, what do you think they were?

00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:13.580
 I know you don't like me to mention this,

00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:15.580
 but remember what happened between Geraldine Love

00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:17.580
 and Homer when you went away last night?

00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:18.580
 Yeah.

00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:19.580
 Yeah.

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:20.580
 I know.

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:23.580
 Why, don't know my back work turns.

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:26.580
 I just am squeezing a peanut butter right out of that sandwich.

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:27.580
 I'll see you where.

00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:31.580
 Did I do a brie we all come back to the mop for a couple of weeks and play a play?

00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:44.580
 Hey, wait, where do I put these wah?

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:46.580
 Right next to the barbecue, Homer.

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:47.580
 There.

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:50.580
 I guess we've got enough homework.

00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:51.580
 Sure.

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:53.580
 Boy, and if you were smart of you,

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:56.580
 think of moving our party after you're back in the eye.

00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:57.580
 Thanks, Homer.

00:09:57.580 --> 00:09:59.580
 We wouldn't have gotten anywhere with the girls

00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:01.580
 with their parents right there in the same room.

00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:04.580
 Besides, we'd come right down to what is really cooler out here.

00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:05.580
 Sure.

00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:08.580
 And no pictures to fall off the wall.

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:10.580
 We're all destroying screw.

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:12.580
 Helping move this porch glider, Homer.

00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:13.580
 Okay.

00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:14.580
 Where?

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:16.580
 In front of the barber cutes,

00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:20.580
 We can watch the corn while it's roasting.

00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:22.580
 Where?

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:24.580
 I mean, is this a four-man go-out?

00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:26.580
 Why, it could be home.

00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:28.580
 If you don't mind a little squeezing.

00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:31.580
 See, why should I learn?

00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:34.580
 Well, what are you boys doing with the fireplace?

00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:37.580
 Why, have you ever noticed our living room

00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:40.580
 when more than four people get in it?

00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:42.580
 He lives. It sort of disappears.

00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:43.580
 You don't say.

00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:49.180
 Yes, sir, and under those conditions, we and the girls don't mind being outside in the yard.

00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:50.780
 Well, that sounds sensible.

00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:53.180
 Are you planning on roasting something in the fireplace?

00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:55.180
 Yes, Father. Corn.

00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:56.180
 Corn?

00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:59.180
 Hey, I haven't had roast corn in years.

00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:01.480
 How are you going to do it?

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:02.180
 How?

00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:05.180
 Was there any other way besides wrapping them in corn trucks?

00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:06.580
 You're crazy.

00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:11.180
 The best way to roast corn is put them on a spit and keep swiping them with a paintbrush.

00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:14.780
 - Pancras with burning. - For your both wrongs.

00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:18.780
 The way we did it when I was a boy was wrapped them with mud and dropped them in the cold.

00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:24.180
 - Mud? - Well, they come out so tender and steady.

00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:29.180
 Delicious. You've never had it that way?

00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:30.780
 - No. - I'll say.

00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:34.580
 - Well, you don't know what you've missed. I tell you what I'll do. I'll roast them for you tonight.

00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:38.180
 - Why? But, but, but, Father, what about you again?

00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:40.980
 - We'll move them out here, too. - Howdy, here.

00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:43.380
 We'll all have a good old fashioned cornrows.

00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:45.980
 Henry, this is the best idea you've had in a long time.

00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:47.580
 Thank you, Father.

00:11:47.580 --> 00:12:01.380
 Lacking mud, boy.

00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:03.980
 Quite a home of my father, old dear dear boy.

00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:06.980
 All I can say is he must have had some childhood

00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:09.580
 if he were to run lapping his corn in mud.

00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:10.780
 That's over.

00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:14.280
 The important thing is everybody will be here in a little while.

00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:16.780
 How are we going to get the girls alone?

00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:18.280
 They're going to win this, how you father?

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:21.780
 They can only know I can't turn to you, but we're not going to win.

00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:22.780
 Oh, I couldn't.

00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:24.280
 That might hurt his feelings.

00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:26.280
 Well, no, but we don't want to go through this.

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:29.280
 Oh, it's just each other staring into the face, Julie.

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:29.780
 Wait a minute.

00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:30.780
 Wait a minute.

00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:32.280
 Wait a minute. I think I've got it.

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:32.780
 You have?

00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:33.780
 I am falling.

00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:36.280
 Boy, why don't I turn for Willie to show up?

00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:37.280
 Just ignore him, pal.

00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:38.280
 How?

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:39.280
 What is it, one fella?

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:42.120
 Nothing will be appreciated if you didn't bother us.

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:43.560
 How is I declared to?

00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:44.080
 Good.

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:44.720
 What is it?

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:45.600
 What is why?

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:48.200
 But I'm not supposed to bother you about.

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:50.280
 Anything will be anything.

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:51.800
 Homer, here's my idea.

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:54.280
 Think those-- you know I'm going away for the summer tomorrow?

00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:55.400
 That's fine, Lily.

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:57.520
 That's the best news I've had all day.

00:12:57.520 --> 00:12:58.480
 Goodbye.

00:12:58.480 --> 00:12:59.480
 Goodbye.

00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:00.560
 You want me to beat us?

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:03.200
 Just until next fall.

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:05.040
 Oh, well, that's the way you feel.

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:08.280
 I was going to tell you where I'm going, but now fat can.

00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:08.780
 Good.

00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:11.780
 and spend the whole summer wondering where I am for all I care.

00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:13.780
 - What's your idea? - I won't even write.

00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:18.780
 Homer, Homer, why not take the girls out for a really big farewell party

00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:20.780
 to the best restaurant in town?

00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:22.780
 - One. - A single word.

00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:27.780
 - It's very nice, too. - Not even a punk car.

00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:31.780
 - It's a beautiful car. - It won't cost us a cent.

00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:33.780
 - Or anything. - It will.

00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:34.780
 - No. - Willy?

00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:37.780
 - Yes, Helen, yes, you want me to tell you where I'm going?

00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:40.780
 Well, you and your family eat out a lot, don't you?

00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:43.780
 As much as we can without the filming, my mother.

00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:45.780
 [audience laughter]

00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:46.780
 Well, um...

00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:52.780
 Well, tell me, where would you like to go if you were going on a farewell party?

00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:55.780
 A farewell party? Someone's giving a farewell party?

00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:57.780
 Having to be listening?

00:13:57.780 --> 00:13:59.780
 No! Who we are? No kidding.

00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:01.780
 Where will I?

00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:04.780
 Yeah, I've always thought the white feather in was a swell plaque.

00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:08.780
 "Why, sure, the white feather in! Come on inside, Homer. Thanks, Willie.

00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:12.280
 He fell a-don't fact me, and he ain't gonna tell me a plan."

00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:15.180
 Simple, Homer. Look, if we go in and tell my father,

00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:17.780
 we'd like to take the girls to the white feather in.

00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:19.780
 What do you think will happen?

00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:20.780
 He'll hooray in.

00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:27.780
 And if we're there with the older people, they couldn't very well expect us to do any pain.

00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:28.780
 Could they?

00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:31.780
 - Thanks. - Then later on, we'll go to a movie.

00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:35.780
 And once we're in the dark home, we're set.

00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:36.780
 - Hey, Miss. - All right.

00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:38.780
 - Ooh. - Thanks, Homer.

00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:40.780
 Father, are you home?

00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:42.780
 - Get here, every. - No, I won't.

00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:43.780
 Man, I won't hear of it.

00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:45.780
 Eating our guest's buddy, Corn.

00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:47.780
 - Alice, it's delicious. - No, Sam.

00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:49.780
 Besides, Corn is not in TV yet.

00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:50.780
 - That is? - It is.

00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:51.780
 It is.

00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:53.780
 I'll just make a nice toss salad instead.

00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:55.780
 Alice, what kind of a farewell party will it be?

00:14:55.780 --> 00:14:57.780
 It's just a toss salad and no corn.

00:14:57.780 --> 00:15:00.780
 You don't follow that simple we were thinking.

00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:05.780
 That's why Homer and I thought we might take the girls out to dinner instead.

00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:06.780
 To dinner?

00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:07.780
 Yes.

00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:09.780
 At the white feather in, say?

00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:11.780
 That's the next one I do.

00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:13.780
 Where do we all go?

00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:15.780
 You're coming along, Father?

00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:17.780
 If you don't mind.

00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:18.780
 I know.

00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:20.780
 You'll be way more than married.

00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:22.780
 Well, we better start getting that same.

00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:26.780
 Father, suppose Homer and I pick up the girls in our car and drive them down.

00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:27.780
 Very well.

00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:29.780
 I'll call the Anderson's and ask them to pick us up.

00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:32.020
 Come on Homer, so you wait or fall.

00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:34.180
 Goodbye Mother, goodbye Father, I'll have to run.

00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:35.220
 Where are you going?

00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:36.660
 I'm dancing with Joe Graham.

00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:38.740
 He's leaving for a summer job tomorrow morning.

00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:41.380
 Oh, well Mary, why not join us?

00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:42.180
 You Father.

00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:44.740
 We're having a farewell party at the White Center Inn.

00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:46.900
 You couldn't accept Joe Graham to say goodbye

00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:48.740
 in front of my own mother and father.

00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:50.420
 Hey my goodness, Sam.

00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:51.300
 What's wrong, Alice?

00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:52.900
 See, you don't vote Henry in Homer,

00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:54.580
 feel the way Mary does, do you?

00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:55.940
 About Joe Graham?

00:15:55.940 --> 00:15:59.300
 Sam, you don't think we're forcing our way,

00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:00.900
 in on their farewell party.

00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:03.300
 Oh, I bet they didn't mind not joining them.

00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:05.380
 Sam, they were just being polite.

00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:08.980
 My goodness, they've probably been saving up for this evening for months.

00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:10.740
 Well, Alex, what can we do?

00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:12.740
 Sam is just one thing we can do.

00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:16.580
 Keep all the grown-ups away and that the boys had their own farewell party

00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:18.500
 exactly the way they wanted it.

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:36.500
 [Music]

00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:39.500
 And now getting back to the troubles of Henry Org.

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:43.000
 In order to induce Kathleen and Agnes to invite them to the lake this summer,

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:47.000
 Henry and Homer are taking them to the most expensive restaurant in town for dinner.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:51.800
 Mr. Alders' expense, they hope that he opens and the white feather in.

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:54.800
 Can we just hold your parents, the white feather in?

00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:55.800
 They'll be here home.

00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:56.800
 They'll be here home.

00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:57.800
 We're there waiting for the Anderson to pick them up.

00:16:57.800 --> 00:16:58.800
 They couldn't eat long handle.

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:01.800
 My parents were just about ready to leave when you suited the harm.

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:04.800
 Come on, before we order, let's get one thing to drink.

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:06.800
 Are you taking care of the whole bell?

00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:07.800
 Sure.

00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:08.800
 Including the tip?

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:09.800
 Sure.

00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:10.800
 I don't have to pay for a thing.

00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:11.800
 No.

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:12.800
 What's come over you?

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:14.240
 Come over you.

00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:18.080
 Oh, yeah, it's just a sample of the way we feel toward you.

00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:18.680
 It is.

00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:21.160
 Would you like me to put a nickel in the jukebox, Kathleen?

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:21.960
 What's on?

00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:23.880
 We can have music with our meal.

00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:25.720
 Sure, and help you guys get.

00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:27.160
 Especially backwards.

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:29.640
 Couldn't miss any enough money on us as it is.

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:32.680
 Gee, Kathleen, tonight the sky's the limit.

00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:36.600
 We've got 39 cents put aside for music alone.

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:38.520
 So, that's like for everybody else's turn.

00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:39.960
 Boy, am I star?

00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:41.600
 They're my star.

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:43.200
 I think I'm gonna order.

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:43.860
 I don't know.

00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:44.600
 What are you?

00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:45.600
 I don't know.

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:49.100
 There's a loving special dinner here in the corner for 85 kids.

00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:50.200
 What's on it?

00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:52.100
 Oh no, that's only for children.

00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:53.600
 Up to what age?

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:57.600
 Oh, and I'm gonna have presents on your glass.

00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:58.900
 What's a present?

00:17:58.900 --> 00:17:59.900
 Oh, wait.

00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:01.900
 It's sort of a chicken.

00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:03.900
 Only tougher.

00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:06.000
 And it's on your glass?

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:06.600
 Sure.

00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:07.600
 How do you eat it?

00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:08.600
 I don't know.

00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:11.100
 But don't you think it might be interesting to find out?

00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:12.660
 I was a fazin' too.

00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:14.400
 He's not terribly expensive.

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:15.240
 - Correctly.

00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:17.800
 - And I told you, this is our nice town.

00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:21.540
 - Well, in that case, you know what I've always wanted to try?

00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:22.380
 - Lobster.

00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:23.700
 - Lobster, I'll have that too.

00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:24.540
 - So alive.

00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:25.700
 - Mr. Fazin'.

00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:27.540
 - No, he's a side order.

00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:29.140
 (audience laughing)

00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:29.980
 - Excuse me.

00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:31.260
 I'm Mr. Curly, the manager.

00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:32.780
 Is there a Mr. Aldrich at this table?

00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:33.620
 - Well, that's me.

00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:35.180
 - A Mr. Aldrich wants you on the phone.

00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:36.580
 - Oh, he does?

00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:38.700
 - Yes, he wants to tell me they're on their way over.

00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:40.100
 - Were the rest of you folks like to order?

00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:42.100
 - He wears his arms. - He wears his arms.

00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:44.100
 - As long as they're practically here, we might as well.

00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:47.100
 - Sure, let's order off. - Fine. The phone's right there in the corner.

00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:50.100
 - I'll be right back. - How's your session under glass?

00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:52.100
 - Very nice, sir. This place will be in the house.

00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:54.100
 - Hello, Father. - Hello, son.

00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:58.100
 - Father, where are you? - I'm having dinner with the Anderson's and the Lawson's.

00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:01.100
 - What? - We finally realized it much rather be alone.

00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:04.100
 - Alone? - Father, no!

00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:07.100
 - Now you needn't be polite, Henry. We understand...

00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:12.020
 says. I want you to have a good time and be sure to say goodbye to the girl for

00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:13.460
 us. Good night.

00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:16.460
 I'm always going to burn.

00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:24.380
 You're going to make yourself a special visit with four different flavors of ice cream

00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:26.140
 for only two dollars after.

00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:30.940
 Oh, Henry, you know the lights here make you a

00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:38.940
 softly pale. Homer isn't the light my father just killed it. Why? It's not coming. How

00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:42.180
 will we pay for the dinner? We'll be already ordered. Well we'll have to

00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:49.540
 unorder quick. Oh boy did I go to town. No. No. No. My mom is always watching

00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:53.060
 her and said yes but you see I don't really think I'm worried about that

00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:57.380
 special dessert. You did. That's a good idea. Mr. Kelly suggested a thing called

00:19:57.380 --> 00:19:59.380
 They feel like I'm stabbed.

00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:00.380
 He did.

00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:01.380
 He has to tie the ice cream.

00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:04.380
 This is how ridiculous and what expensive does it have?

00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:06.380
 Oh, boy.

00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:07.380
 We live the end of the year.

00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:08.380
 Yes, Mr. Carley.

00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:10.380
 No, I've met his wife.

00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:12.380
 Stuff yourself.

00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:13.380
 What I know, my friend.

00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:19.380
 So what Homer means is, well, you don't think it's too hot for all that heavy food we ordered?

00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:21.380
 Why not order something in life?

00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:22.380
 I'd call him.

00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:26.380
 Why, Mr. Curley, could you make this up some nice,

00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:30.340
 some nice lettuce sandwiches. I'm afraid not.

00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:34.840
 B-side I'd rather have seven in a blast with lobster on a side.

00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:37.500
 Hey, fellas, it's Willie. What's he doing here?

00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:39.160
 Am I late for what, Willie?

00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:42.920
 It's for what, Willie? My farewell party that Henley and Homer are throwing for.

00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:46.780
 Oh boy. Mr. You want to take my order? Boy, am I

00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:47.620
 I saw.

00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:50.380
 (dramatic music)

00:20:50.380 --> 00:21:01.920
 - Well, what a Mr. Turley say.

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:03.620
 - Homer, you should have heard him.

00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:05.500
 - You should sure look mad.

00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:06.940
 The way he was waiting was orange.

00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:09.500
 I thought Turley was gonna hit you with one of them.

00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:10.340
 - Oh, did I.

00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:11.500
 - Mr. Turley?

00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:13.380
 - Not exactly.

00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:16.140
 We have to come in every afternoon and mop floor.

00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:18.140
 I thought it worked off.

00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:20.140
 That'll take us all soon.

00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:21.140
 I know.

00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:22.140
 You're way.

00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:25.140
 I better get back to the girls.

00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:29.140
 Did Agnes eat everything she ordered?

00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:30.140
 Yes.

00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:33.140
 But all the way she put it, but she put it.

00:21:33.140 --> 00:21:34.140
 Where'd Willie go?

00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:36.140
 Today Haven for a soda.

00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:40.140
 After all he ate, he told him it's something to wash it all there.

00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:42.140
 Hey, I'm a boy.

00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:44.140
 What a meal.

00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:46.540
 - Honey, I never had a love in your tongue.

00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:47.940
 - Mm, self.

00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:50.060
 - And it was a pleasure, Kathleen.

00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:51.300
 - She was doing that on me.

00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:52.620
 - Tell us why.

00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:54.260
 - You won't believe yet, you.

00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:55.100
 - I will.

00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:57.740
 - Can you repel our parents into inviting both of you

00:21:57.740 --> 00:21:58.580
 up to the lake?

00:21:58.580 --> 00:21:59.420
 - What?

00:21:59.420 --> 00:22:00.240
 - Why?

00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:01.260
 - They were saving you for a surprise.

00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:02.080
 - Sorry, y'all.

00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:03.580
 I'm thinking of time.

00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:04.940
 - Why?

00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:06.100
 - Why?

00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:07.500
 - I'll tell you, Kathleen.

00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:09.460
 I don't think we can make it.

00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:10.280
 - Why?

00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:11.120
 - Why not?

00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:13.180
 - We expect to be pretty tied up.

00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:15.020
 - What's a little wrong?

00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:16.340
 - Doing what?

00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:17.980
 - Why?

00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:19.260
 - Why you?

00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:22.260
 - They don't have to power tackling their jobs here.

00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:23.100
 - What is?

00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:26.140
 - Don't pretend Homer, imagine trying to cover up

00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:27.900
 with a pink male.

00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:28.740
 - See?

00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:30.980
 - What are you talking about?

00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:31.820
 - When is Geraldine?

00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:33.700
 You have to decide to stay in town, Homer.

00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:34.860
 - Geraldine, you are.

00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:35.700
 - Ah!

00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:39.180
 - Kathleen, you're getting the wrong idea.

00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:40.020
 - You are.

00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:41.660
 Geraldine isn't gonna be in town.

00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:43.420
 - No, then it's too other girl.

00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:44.920
 - Sure, no, I mean no.

00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:45.760
 (loud rumbling)

00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:47.260
 - I mean, I never would have believed it.

00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:49.780
 - Then after all, it's probably way to the get you inside.

00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:51.260
 - I think we better go.

00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:52.100
 - I'll say.

00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:52.940
 - No way to go.

00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:53.780
 - Aglist.

00:22:53.780 --> 00:22:56.100
 - I don't know if you have a car or a summer.

00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:57.900
 - Have one, Aglist.

00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:00.740
 - Well, that's a fine thing.

00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:02.300
 - That's what I say.

00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:04.740
 - You just need to ever look at any other girl.

00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:05.940
 - Sure.

00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:08.140
 - Besides, who's left in the pillow, Bill?

00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:09.220
 (loud rumbling)

00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:11.620
 - Boy, Homer, what a summer this is going to be.

00:23:11.620 --> 00:23:17.260
 to be. Mapping floors every day and just each other every night.

00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:22.060
 Can we hear me that low? I'm sorry. Well I'm glad you boys haven't left.

00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:25.420
 You wanted to start mopping floors right now Mr. Curly.

00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:28.540
 Well now look, it occurred to me that may have got a little upset a while back.

00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:31.700
 You had every right to. I've been thinking over and I'll tell you what I'll do.

00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:34.420
 Yes Mr. Curly. Yes Mr. Curly.

00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:37.420
 Instead of mopping up and working in the kitchen all summer to pay off the check,

00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:39.580
 I would like to wear two full weeks as possible.

00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:40.580
 That's for you.

00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:42.080
 You're a uniform and everything.

00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:43.880
 And I'll give you five dollars a week to sign.

00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:45.680
 Oh, I'm sorry.

00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:46.980
 Yes, Mara.

00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:48.580
 Oh, boy.

00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:49.880
 You are.

00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:50.780
 I'm so sorry.

00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:52.680
 Do you want to go over at this?

00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:54.680
 No.

00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:56.480
 Hello.

00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:58.480
 Hello.

00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:00.180
 Yes, Mara.

00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:01.680
 Have I got your phone next to you?

00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:02.980
 You called me.

00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:04.980
 Oh, yes, you want to catch him, too.

00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:05.980
 Tell him I'll be there in a minute.

00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:07.980
 Oh, yes, I'm so sorry.

00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:12.940
 Well.

00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:13.980
 You're fine.

00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:17.980
 Well, boys.

00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:19.460
 Boy.

00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:21.380
 Oh, you're going to have to.

00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:22.180
 I was.

00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:23.900
 Who was that?

00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:24.460
 My niece.

00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:24.940
 He's fishing.

00:24:24.940 --> 00:24:25.540
 He's a summer.

00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:26.460
 He is.

00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:27.420
 Oh, summer.

00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:28.700
 Yeah, she in a twin sister.

00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:29.860
 Oh,

00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:34.540
 there's another one who looks like that.

00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:36.460
 Do we both of them work here, Mr.

00:24:36.460 --> 00:24:37.060
 Curling?

00:24:37.060 --> 00:24:39.260
 They help out the afternoon setting tables today.

00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:40.160
 They do.

00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:41.540
 Well, who do you say, boys?

00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:44.580
 Would you like to work the tech off quickly in two weeks?

00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:46.020
 Why?

00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:47.700
 Why?

00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:52.060
 I'll tell you, Mr. Curly, I think we'd rather mop floors

00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:54.460
 and stretch it out over the whole summer.

00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:57.460

00:24:57.460 --> 00:25:05.460
