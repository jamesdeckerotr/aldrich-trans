 Head, please! Head, Rosary!

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.000

 The Old Rich Family starring as Rustone, written by Clifford Goldsmith,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 brought to you by Jello Pudding, their tops in taste.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.300
 To the gallery of typical American boys such as Penrod, Tom Sawyer,

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.060
 Pec's bad boy. We have the name of Henry Aldrich.

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.100
 But now let's go out to the little town of Centerville.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.460
 Our scene opens on the hillside on the outskirts of town.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.460
 The model airplane race Henry and his father worked for weeks to win

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.940
 has just finished. Henry is talking to Mr. Collins, the reparee.

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.900
 Yes, but Mr. Collins, my plane was flying against the very strong headwind.

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.900
 But I made allowance for the headwind.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.340
 You did? Yes, Henry.

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.500
 Mr. Collins, what kind of a watch did you time Henry's plane laugh?

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.100
 With their stopwatch.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.300
 Is it a pretty good one?

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:47.420
 It is.

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.100
 Billy Walker's model covered the course in one half of the second lesson, Henry's.

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.140
 Now, buy my watch, Mr. Collins.

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.060
 Is yours a stopwatch, Dizzy?

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.220
 No, but it used to belong to my grandfather.

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.460
 Is your grandfather an official for this race?

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:05.500
 No, but he carried this watch for 35 years and nothing ever happened.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.660
 Hey, she was look at us.

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.260
 Did it break, Dizzy?

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
 Henry, you're standing on the main spring.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:12.260
 Oh, yeah.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.060
 Excuse me.

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.460
 Here's the stand, too.

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:16.980
 Well, where did Mr. Collins go?

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.140
 He walked away.

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.900
 That's a swell thing for him to do.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.500
 How do you want to make him pay for this watch?

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.620
 Mr. Collins, hey, Mr. Collins.

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:24.580
 Oh, wait a minute.

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.380
 I just went over and got these figures.

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:27.380
 What are they?

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:28.940
 Henry, when your plane was flying,

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.460
 the wind was blowing at 11 and 1/2 miles an hour.

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:32.820
 When Billy Walker's was flying,

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.860
 the wind was 4 and 1/2 miles an hour.

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.300
 So I naturally made an allowance of 6 miles an hour

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:38.340
 in Henry's favor.

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.600
 Well, Henry, does that sound right to you?

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:47.080
 As a matter of fact, isn't four and a half from 11 and a half seven?

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.480
 No sir.

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.320
 No, no, I guess six is right.

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:51.600
 Of course it is.

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.200
 Only it certainly looks like seven.

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.040
 And I could swear Henry's playing one faster.

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.320
 Some place there's been a big mistake.

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.320
 Well, it seems to be the trouble, Henry.

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.640
 Father, you and I lose the race by just half a second.

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.200
 And a half a second is a half a second.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.200
 I know Mr. Collins, but that's all it is.

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.200
 Henry, may I speak with you?

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.200
 Where, Father?

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.200
 Right over here.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.200
 You want to speak to me too, Miss Orange?

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.200
 No, thank you.

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.200
 What is it, Father?

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.200
 Henry, don't you think that as long as we lost the race, it would be better if we said nothing more about it?

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.200
 But Father, Disney's watch didn't register 16.5 seconds.

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.200
 Does his watch have half seconds on it?

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.200
 No, but up until a few minutes ago it always kept perfect time.

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:37.600
 Henry, I happened to be doing some business with Billy Walker's father, and it might be

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.240
 just as well if you didn't say anything more about it.

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:43.440
 But Dad, look at all the time we spent building that plane.

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.280
 After all, we did finish second.

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.280
 Sure.

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.080
 Henry, I want to tell you when your father's something.

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:49.440
 Sorry it is here, but I'd better go back to the office.

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.840
 But you'd be very much interested, Mr. Orange.

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:52.840
 Tell Henry.

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.480
 Henry, I knew all the time there was something, Fony.

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.520
 Henry wasn't every plane that was supposed to go in the race, be made by a father and

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.120
 The sun is your.

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.120
 Well, I'll bet you anything Billy walk on his father didn't make the yes.

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.320
 Well, where do you think they got it?

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:09.520
 I know where.

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.320
 I was just overlooking at it.

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:15.720
 And I remember seeing the very same thing down in Jones's Sporting Goods store.

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:16.720
 Oh, you're sure it is.

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.120
 There's only one thing about it that's different.

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.720
 Billy's is blowing the one up the store was red.

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.220
 Then it can't be the same plane, kind of.

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:25.920
 Now that's what you think.

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.720
 I scratched the little of the blue paint often.

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.720
 Right underneath was the red paint.

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:35.220
 Yeah, Henry, if you win it means a trip to the capital.

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.920
 Well, gee whiz, I don't care what my father says.

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.720
 I'm going down to Mr. Walker's office.

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:40.720
 Now, wait a second.

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.120
 Don't go rushing into this.

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.120
 Why not?

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.320
 I've got a book at home that'll tell you exactly what to do in a case like this.

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:48.320
 Well, what should we do?

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:52.520
 Well, before we come right out on the queue is anybody, we've got to get proof.

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.120
 That's the important thing, Henry.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:55.120
 Naturally, Dizzy.

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:56.420
 Anybody knows that.

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:59.320
 Because you accuse somebody, doesn't mean he's guilty.

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:00.560
 You've got to get proof.

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.520
 I hope you don't think I didn't know that.

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.560
 Yeah, but you don't know as much about those things as I do, Henry.

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.200
 No, well, I know where I'm going.

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:08.240
 Well, follow me.

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.160
 When we bust this case open, it'll shock everybody.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:12.720
 Sure.

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.120
 Especially my father.

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:18.120
 Yes, sir, when he hears of it, he'll be speechless.

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:29.720
 [Music]

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:33.160
 Henry, where are we going? Where are we going? Wait until I show you.

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.120
 Wouldn't it funny, Dizzy, when we were talking with Mr. Collins,

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.560
 I could have sworn four and a half from eleven and a half would leave seven.

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:45.240
 Same here. But I guess you've got to put it down on paper before you can believe it.

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.500
 Yeah, it must have been the fractions that threw us off.

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:51.380
 Didn't I tell you Henry, look in the window.

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:54.380
 Look, well, you mean here in Jones's Sporting Goods?

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:55.220
 Yeah.

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:58.020
 Well, that's the same identical plane the walkers had.

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:00.940
 Come on, now wait a second Henry, let's do this carefully.

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:02.700
 We're going to, we aren't going to rush into it.

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:05.620
 We'll just be casual.

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:06.940
 That's it.

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:10.060
 And all we'll do is make out, we want to buy something,

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:11.980
 and then we'll gradually lead up to the plane.

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:12.480
 Right.

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:13.480
 Come on then.

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:15.980
 (phone ringing)

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:17.580
 Well where is Mr. Jones?

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:18.860
 I guess he must be in the back.

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:20.300
 (phone ringing)

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:22.700
 When he comes out, don't mention why we're here.

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:23.900
 - Are you boys what?

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:24.740
 - Why you?

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:25.580
 - Why you?

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:28.180
 - We are, just the hope we'd look around Mr. Jones.

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:29.780
 - Had airplanes, is he?

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:32.300
 (audience laughing)

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:33.980
 - Did I say airplanes?

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:36.540
 What I meant was, that's the only thing

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:37.820
 we aren't interested in.

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:38.660
 - I say.

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:43.260
 - Mr. Jones, do you carry baseball bats?

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.020
 You're looking right at baseball bats.

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:47.220
 Am I? Oh yeah.

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:49.620
 Oh, maybe that's why I mentioned them.

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:51.500
 How much are they, Mr. Jones?

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:52.700
 Fifty cents up.

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:53.820
 Oh, yeah.

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:54.620
 Um...

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:56.500
 Well, how much are your tennis rackets?

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:57.860
 Dollar 95, huh?

00:06:57.860 --> 00:06:59.780
 Oh, yeah. Well...

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:01.420
 How much are fish and tackle?

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:03.220
 Twenty-five dollars down.

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:04.900
 [Laughter]

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:07.180
 Oh, does he look at the airplane models?

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:08.260
 Oh, sure enough.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.060
 I haven't seen those before.

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:10.940
 Which kind?

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:12.940
 I have a kind Mr. Walker board.

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:13.740
 I mean...

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:15.240
 That kind did he buy?

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:17.740
 Oh, did he buy one?

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:18.740
 Who?

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:21.440
 I thought you said Mr. Walker bought one.

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:23.440
 When did I make that statement?

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:26.540
 No, Dizzy, you misunderstood. What, Mr. Jones?

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:28.540
 No, just what did you boys come in here for?

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:33.340
 Well, Mr. Jones, would you mind if we should ask you something confidentially?

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:34.240
 What?

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:37.340
 Did Mr. Walker buy one of those planes you have in the window?

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:38.240
 Buy one?

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:39.540
 Not here, he didn't.

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:42.080
 I only stopped up at five and they're all right there.

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:43.940
 Are you sure you couldn't have miscounted them?

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:45.040
 Yes, sir.

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:46.080
 Why?

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:47.440
 Oh, nothing.

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:48.640
 Nothing.

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:51.880
 We were just asking out of sheer curiosity.

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:54.340
 - Visually. - Whoa.

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:56.140
 Look who's coming across the street.

00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:58.240
 Well, she was busy. It's Mr. Walker.

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:00.840
 Well, Mr. Jones, I guess we better be going.

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:02.240
 [phone ringing]

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:04.440
 - Good afternoon, Jones. - Oh, hi, Walker.

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:05.740
 Hello, Mr. Walker.

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:08.440
 Sorry, my boy and I had to meet you today.

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:11.800
 Oh, we were glad to have you when I think I'll be going to see.

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.360
 I think I might as well, too.

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:15.880
 Oh, Walker, maybe you can answer a question for these boys.

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:19.240
 Oh, that's all right, Mr. Jones. Don't bother him about it.

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:21.040
 What was the question?

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:25.040
 Well, I can assure you, Mr. Jones, I don't know how the question even came up.

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:29.440
 No, Walker. Henry and his buddy thought you bought an airplane here.

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:32.560
 You mean the plane Billy and I won the race with?

00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:34.120
 Oh, no, Mr. Walker.

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:35.880
 Well, what plane did you mean?

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:38.880
 Well, not any Mr. Walker. Henry's just confused.

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:41.880
 Oh, well, I'm relieved to hear that.

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:44.880
 I'll be seeing Henry's father down at his office in just a few minutes.

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:45.880
 Hello, Henry.

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:46.880
 Hi, your fellas.

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:48.880
 I just saw your father, Henry.

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:49.880
 You did?

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:51.880
 Mr. Collins was talking to him.

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:54.880
 Well, Mr. Collins was quite mad about something.

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:55.880
 About what?

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:56.880
 I'm leaving, Dizzy.

00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:58.880
 Oh, well, so am I.

00:08:58.880 --> 00:08:59.880
 Goodbye, Mr. Walker.

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:00.880
 Goodbye.

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:03.880
 She was dizzy now, look at what you've done.

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:05.980
 Well, I at least tried, didn't I?

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:08.780
 Didn't I tell you my father doesn't want to upset Mr. Walker?

00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:09.880
 You never mentioned that.

00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:11.380
 Well, you should have known anyhow.

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:14.280
 All we did was practically accuse him of cheating.

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:15.380
 That's Henry.

00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:16.080
 What?

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:18.280
 Never mind about your father. Here comes mine.

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:19.180
 I told you.

00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:19.680
 Good.

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:22.880
 I hope the first thing he asks is where your watch is.

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:24.080
 That's friendship.

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:27.580
 I try to help you win the race and what thanks do I get?

00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:29.180
 Family, wait for me!

00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:30.380
 What is Phyllis want?

00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:31.880
 What do you think?

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:35.580
 I just heard Mr. Jones say to Mr. Walker back in the store.

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:36.080
 Why?

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:38.580
 They looked at each other very suspiciously.

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:43.380
 And Mr. Walker said, "Where do you suppose those boys got that idea?"

00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:44.580
 He did, fell asleep.

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:45.580
 Yeah.

00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:47.180
 Do you see that, Harry?

00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:48.380
 And now, and now do you see?

00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:49.380
 I haven't helped you.

00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:50.380
 Well, it's a...

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:51.380
 I don't know.

00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:53.380
 Did he say anything else, fell asleep?

00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:57.880
 Mr. Jones said, "Well, I guess we spiked that."

00:09:57.880 --> 00:09:59.380
 Oh, he did, eh?

00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:00.580
 Is that important?

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:03.380
 Is it important to us? Is it important?

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:06.180
 Well, I gotta go, Henry. I'll see you later!

00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:09.080
 See, with Henry, all we gotta do now is to go through with it.

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:10.180
 Don't you think so, dude?

00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:12.280
 I've got a fingerprint out for it at home,

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:15.380
 and I always knew that someday it would come in handy.

00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:19.480
 We'll find out whether that plane and Billy Walker's did come from the store.

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:22.080
 Sure, all we have to do is get Mr. Jones's fingerprint.

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:24.180
 And then Mr. Walker's.

00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:27.580
 Only maybe we ought to be careful about taking Mr. Walker's.

00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:29.380
 He won't even know we're doing it.

00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:34.620
 And listen, Henry, we want to be really systematic and get everybody's print in town.

00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:35.620
 Everybody?

00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:37.940
 Do you realize how big this town is?

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:39.860
 But, Henry, look what they do in Washington.

00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:42.100
 They don't get a few, they get millions!

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:46.020
 Well, I guess maybe if they can do that in Washington, we can handle this town.

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:46.580
 Come on.

00:10:46.580 --> 00:11:04.700
 Well, here it is, friends, the sixth week of spring.

00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:07.780
 Spring, spring, glorious spring.

00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:13.340
 When a young man's fancy lightly turns to parts of, well, you know the rest of that saying,

00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:18.580
 But now that we mention it, just how true is that old saying about a young man's fancy?

00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:20.580
 Suppose we see if we can't find out.

00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:22.660
 Let's ask some young man for his opinion.

00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:23.660
 Listen.

00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:25.220
 Yes, the statement is perfectly true.

00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:29.420
 In the spring my fancy certainly does turn to thoughts of Jell-O vanilla pudding.

00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:30.420
 Oh.

00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:34.140
 In fact, I can guide more Jell-O vanilla pudding in the spring than in any other season of

00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:35.140
 the year.

00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:37.460
 Except of course winter, summer and fall.

00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:38.460
 Yes.

00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:43.060
 Well, that, ladies and gentlemen, is an observation that everybody will be glad to echo.

00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:47.580
 Just about everyone who has ever tasted it agrees that Jello vanilla pudding is a mighty

00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:49.380
 swell dessert.

00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:55.300
 Jello vanilla pudding has a gloriously smooth texture, as smooth as golden rich cream.

00:11:55.300 --> 00:12:00.380
 And the flavor of Jello vanilla pudding, well, it's simply irresistible, a grand vanilla

00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:04.140
 flavor that hits a new high for luscious delicate goodness.

00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:08.380
 So try this tempting treat just as soon as you can, and find out the truth of another

00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:11.100
 popular saying which goes like this.

00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:13.740
 Then there's Jello the Nilla Pudding for dessert.

00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:16.500
 The thing you think of first is second.

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:30.720
 (

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:35.800
 been cheated out of first place in an airplane model contest and is trying his best to prove

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:36.800
 it.

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:37.800
 The time is evening.

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:39.760
 The scene opens in Henry's room.

00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:45.960
 It's a funny thing, Henry, how my grandfather was able to carry this watch for 35 years

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:48.080
 and I drop it at the end of a week.

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:49.680
 Listen, does he put that away?

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:50.920
 How we got work to do?

00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:52.880
 I've got to get it all back together.

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:56.240
 I've got it all back together except for these two wheels and if I don't find out where they

00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:58.520
 go, my father will kill me.

00:12:58.520 --> 00:12:59.520
 He will, huh?

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:02.520
 But we're coming the most crucial part of our job.

00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:03.520
 Here we are.

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:06.520
 We've got fingerprint powder and fingerprint ink.

00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:09.520
 Henry, aren't your folks having some guests here tonight?

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:13.520
 Well, I don't think we ought to take their fingerprints, does he?

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:15.520
 Listen, I thought you weren't going to show favor, Ted.

00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:16.520
 Yeah, I know, Dizzy, but they're dead.

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:19.520
 All right, then. We just as well not stop this.

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:22.520
 Well, can this fingerprint ink do any damage?

00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:23.520
 How could it?

00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:25.520
 But supposing it should get on something.

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:26.520
 It comes right out.

00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:28.520
 Listen, here are the instructions for washing.

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:35.520
 washing. It says, "Easy method for removing. No worry need because by damage.

00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:41.520
 Merely dip and kerosene rinse and wash with strong abrasive."

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:42.520
 [laughter]

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:48.520
 If first results are not satisfactory, add lemon juice and rub harder.

00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:50.520
 [laughter]

00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:52.520
 Well, gee, there isn't anything to worry about there.

00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:56.520
 Of course there isn't. The only thing is, is when you shake hands with a person,

00:13:56.520 --> 00:14:00.000
 person, I should think they'd feel the ink pad in your hand.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.160
 Do you think they would?

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:03.160
 Why not?

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:04.160
 What would they think it was?

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:05.160
 Almost anything.

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:06.160
 For what?

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:10.000
 Name me one other thing that feels like a pad of ink.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.760
 Alright, how would this be?

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:14.720
 Look, just rub a little ink on the palms of our hands.

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:15.720
 That might work.

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:17.760
 Sure, look, I've got some on already.

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:21.600
 Now watch, when I hold my hand down here at my side, do you notice it?

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:22.600
 No.

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:24.080
 Guys, I think I'll put a little on.

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:28.640
 hurry up so he can be downstairs when the guests begin to come. Okay, I'm all fixed.

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:33.280
 Now wait a second. Wait a second. Have you got a handkerchief? Or four?

00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:40.160
 I've got... I've got one. You're your own. My watch has dropped up in it.

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:43.920
 Oh my god! Here. Take mine here.

00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:48.640
 Never mind. I haven't got that anymore.

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:53.760
 Come on downstairs.

00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:58.000
 When we go into the living room, you let me shake hands with your mother and father.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.680
 Why can't I have one of them?

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:02.480
 Why should you, their son, step up and shake hands with them?

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:04.320
 Do you want to give the whole thing away?

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:06.240
 Well, I get the first two guests then.

00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:07.040
 Yeah.

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:10.720
 And when I get the ink on your mother and father, watch them carefully.

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:12.320
 The minute they touch something,

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:14.880
 Sockle, we've got them.

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:18.640
 You don't think my mother or father brought that plane, do you?

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:22.360
 No, but you never can tell someday they might be wanted for something.

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:23.360
 Henry!

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:24.360
 Yes, mother?

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:25.360
 Are you out in the hole?

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:27.360
 We're just coming into the living room.

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:28.360
 You mustn't stay down here long.

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:29.360
 Oh, we want, Mother.

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:31.360
 How good evening, Mr. Aldridge.

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:32.360
 Good evening.

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:34.360
 Wouldn't you like the shake hands with me?

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:35.360
 Shake hands?

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:37.360
 Weren't you here with us for dinner?

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:40.360
 Yeah, but I just came downstairs again.

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:43.360
 I don't think it's necessary to shake hands.

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:45.360
 Henry, could you hand me my pipe, please?

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:46.360
 Oh, hand it to him, Henry.

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:47.360
 Let me hand it to him, dizzy.

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:48.360
 them dizzy.

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:50.600
 Please, Henry, please, damn, I'll hand it to you.

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:53.480
 Aw, thank you, Alice.

00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:55.920
 Mrs. Orridge, wouldn't you like to shake hands with me?

00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:57.120
 No, thank you, dizzy.

00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:59.640
 Well, you boys sit down before one of your knocks

00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:00.560
 something over.

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:02.000
 I think I will.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.000
 I guess I will, too.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.400
 Henry, yes, mother.

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:07.320
 I don't like to seem rude, but we are expecting gifts.

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:09.600
 Well, couldn't we stay down here just until they've arrived,

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:10.120
 mother?

00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:11.600
 Why do you want to do that?

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:14.000
 Well, don't you think it'd be nice for us to help greet them?

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.160
 Henry, I do, as your mother asks.

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:18.760
 Well, in that case, I think I'll be going home.

00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:19.920
 Oh, must you go?

00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:21.660
 I think I will.

00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:25.660
 Do you like the shake hands now that I'm leaving the door?

00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:28.100
 I don't think it will be necessary.

00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:30.940
 I may not be seeing you again right away.

00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:31.900
 No.

00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:34.700
 Then the least you can do is shake hands with the boy.

00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:38.900
 Well, if it'll make him any happier, here is shake hands.

00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:40.500
 Goodbye, Mr. Orbridge.

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:42.700
 Goodbye.

00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:44.900
 Would you like the shake hands too, Mrs. Orbridge?

00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:47.200
 I'm sorry, but I've got to go out to the kitchen.

00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:49.100
 I'll go to the door with you, dizzy.

00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:51.100
 You know, I think I changed my mind, Henry.

00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:53.340
 I made that call home after all.

00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:54.740
 Just one minute, boys.

00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:56.140
 Nothing you wanted, Father.

00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:58.300
 Dizzy, what's this I have on my hand?

00:16:58.300 --> 00:16:59.140
 Why, uh--

00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:00.060
 This black ink.

00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:01.260
 Why?

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:04.660
 Well, how-- how do you suppose that could have gotten there?

00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:06.580
 May I see your hand?

00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:08.180
 My left hand?

00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:10.380
 Your right hand.

00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:13.140
 Well, what do you know about that?

00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:15.340
 You suppose I could have gotten that from you?

00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:19.640
 And then, may I see your hand?

00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:21.140
 Were you talking to me, Father?

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:23.740
 May I see it, please?

00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:26.340
 Well, will you look at that?

00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:32.340
 If I were you, I would go upstairs and wash my hand.

00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:34.840
 Yes, Mr. Orr, that's the least we can do.

00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:37.840
 I agree, and please do not come back down while the guests are here.

00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:39.140
 But, Father, we've got to.

00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:39.740
 What for?

00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:41.340
 We've got to get there, fingerprint.

00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:44.140
 You're not going to the wedding such thing!

00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:46.140
 No, Mr. Alderman?

00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:48.140
 No. Come on, Dizzy.

00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:50.140
 Now I've got to go out to the kitchen and wash my hair.

00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:54.140
 You know, Dizzy, I had a feeling all the time we shouldn't be doing this.

00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:58.140
 That's only part of the trouble. There's something you don't even know anything about.

00:17:58.140 --> 00:17:59.140
 What?

00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:04.140
 Well, when I came in the front door this evening, I put some ink on the doorknob.

00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:06.140
 On the outside?

00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:08.140
 On both sides.

00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:10.140
 Gee whiz, Dizzy!

00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:16.680
 I did it so we'd be sure to get everybody. We've got to wipe it off if we do and we won't have Prince of anybody but our own

00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:23.220
 Yeah, and one minute mother I hope we won't have to tell Disney father and mother when they come

00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:30.380
 When who comes your mother and father and we we've got a white that door knob off. Give me a handkerchief

00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:35.500
 Yes, father. We're just going to open the front door. You will please go upstairs

00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:38.500
 Yes, but father a mistake has been made.

00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:41.500
 - Please, Mark. - Mr. Orange, can I tell you?

00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:43.500
 Both of you go up those stairs.

00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:46.500
 Yes, father. What do you think we should do in a case like this?

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:49.500
 Well, hello there, Frank Stevens.

00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:52.500
 Oh, so you decided to let us in.

00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:55.500
 Hello there, Molly. Hello, Alice.

00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:57.500
 Well, what do you have there, Frank? Brand new hat?

00:18:57.500 --> 00:19:00.500
 Spring has struck the Stevens.

00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:03.500
 This color is what is known as Dove Grey.

00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:06.200
 That suit he has on is new too.

00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:10.840
 Molly, just because you don't like checks, say,

00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:12.840
 how'd that smudge get on my ass?

00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:13.840
 [LAUGHTER]

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:16.140
 Oh, Frank, even.

00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:19.040
 You suppose they sold it to me that way?

00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:21.940
 I told you all the time the car needed washing.

00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:24.040
 That isn't off the car.

00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:27.120
 If those smudges were on your new suit, I wouldn't mind.

00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:28.480
 Well, may I take your hat, Frank?

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:29.680
 You may.

00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:33.120
 Well, well, that seems to be a smudge on the crown, too.

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:36.280
 Yeah, they can under look like a tweed calf.

00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:41.220
 Put it down, Sam. You probably didn't wash your hands clean.

00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:43.780
 I washed them perfectly clean, Alice. Look at them.

00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:45.800
 Yes, look at them.

00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:47.100
 They're old.

00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:48.900
 Well, I certainly thought I washed.

00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:51.800
 Frank, let me turn your coat collar down.

00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:53.300
 How did that get up?

00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:55.360
 My goodness, yes, there.

00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:58.680
 Frank, there's a smudge on your collar, too.

00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:00.680
 Well, I didn't put it there.

00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:04.040
 Well, all you just stand back from me.

00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:11.960
 Until I came into this house, I was the best dressed man in town.

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:14.440
 Molly, maybe you'd better hang this hat up.

00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:17.160
 I can't take it right now, Sam. I'm going to part of my nose.

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:18.440
 You want a mirror, Molly?

00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:19.480
 No, thank you.

00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:21.480
 She knows where her nose is.

00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:26.120
 Don't say Molly, would you mind looking in the mirror?

00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:27.560
 What's the matter with me?

00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:30.040
 Never mind, just look in the mirror.

00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:31.640
 Oh! Oh!

00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:34.440
 That's where all those smudges have been coming from.

00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:38.040
 Oh, upstairs and watch. And Sam, you go out in the kitchen.

00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:41.640
 Uh... do you have one more place?

00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:43.640
 Henry!

00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:45.640
 Sam, what do you want Henry for?

00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:47.640
 Never mind. I'm going upstairs.

00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:49.640
 Henry Olrich.

00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:50.640
 Yes, Father.

00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:52.640
 Will you and Dizzy please come here?

00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:54.640
 Has something gone wrong, Father?

00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:55.640
 Something else.

00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:58.640
 Of what nature, Mr. Olrich?

00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:01.640
 Did either of you boys put ink around his house?

00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:03.640
 On the front door, Nob?

00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:04.640
 Yes.

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:05.640
 Well, the fact is, Father...

00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:07.640
 What is all this fingerprinting nonsense?

00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:09.640
 That's what we tried to tell you. We didn't do it as a joke.

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:11.640
 We're trying to prove Mr. Walker is guilty.

00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:13.640
 Didn't I tell you to forget Mr. Walker?

00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:17.640
 But he wasn't fair. Tell him about what we have in your room, Henry.

00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:22.640
 Yeah, sure. We've got a cardboard box we found in the Walker trash barrel.

00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:24.640
 And it's the box there airplane came in.

00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:27.640
 And, Rick, I want you to go straight to bed.

00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:29.640
 Yes, father.

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:31.640
 Where do you want me to go, my friend?

00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:34.640
 (audience laughing)

00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:36.640
 - I'm not here. - You did, indeed.

00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:39.640
 May go downstairs and take a look at your father's hat.

00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:41.640
 - Are there something to Prince, Anna?

00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:42.640
 - There are.

00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:45.640
 Do I hear Basil's voice over there?

00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:48.640
 (audience laughing)

00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:52.640
 - I'm coming right down, father.

00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:54.640
 - Do you know anything about this?

00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:57.640
 Well, I... it's this way. I...

00:21:57.640 --> 00:21:59.640
 What's the matter with you?

00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:01.640
 I'm going to sleep.

00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:02.640
 I'm going to sleep.

00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:04.640
 Away from here.

00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:06.640
 It's right here.

00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:08.640
 I'm... I'm...

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:10.640
 I'm here!

00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:15.640
 Basil, look at your grandfather's watch.

00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:18.640
 Father, could I please come down?

00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:20.640
 I'll see you at breakfast.

00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:21.640
 Sam, quick!

00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:22.640
 What's the matter?

00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:24.640
 The gift is at the front door!

00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:37.640
 [Music]

00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:38.640
 Henry!

00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:39.640
 Yes, Mother?

00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:41.640
 Will you please come to your breakfast?

00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:43.640
 I'm on the telephone, Mother.

00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:45.640
 Hello, Mr. Stevens.

00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:48.640
 Yeah, I just started to give you the directions.

00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:51.640
 Dip your hat and carasines, say.

00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:57.240
 Yeah, and if that doesn't work, do you have any lemons in the house?

00:22:57.240 --> 00:22:58.240
 Yes, sir.

00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:01.040
 Just straight lemon juice.

00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:04.840
 And then I think you'll find everything will come right out of your hat.

00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:05.840
 Yes, sir.

00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:07.960
 How's Dizzy this morning?

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:09.960
 Is that right?

00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:12.120
 Is that right?

00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:13.120
 [laughter]

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:14.120
 Mm.

00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:18.600
 I won't be seeing him until the end of the week.

00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:19.600
 [laughter]

00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:20.600
 Huh!

00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:21.600
 [laughter]

00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:23.600
 Goodbye, Mr. Stevens.

00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:26.600
 Oh, Henry, may I talk with you?

00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:28.600
 I haven't eaten my breakfast yet, Father.

00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:31.600
 I'd like to see you now before I leave for the office.

00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:32.600
 Yes, Father.

00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:34.600
 Sit down on this over here.

00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:36.600
 Yes, Father.

00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:43.600
 Did I ask you yesterday not to go around trying to prove that Mr. Walker and his son did not honestly win that race?

00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:46.600
 Yes, but that was before we knew everything, Father.

00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:51.300
 Finding an empty cardboard box is hard as efficient evidence to prove someone has been cheating.

00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:54.600
 But don't you see, you and I are being chipped out of a trip to the Capitol.

00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:58.800
 The fact still remains. I asked you not to do anything more about it.

00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:00.600
 For why, Father? Why?

00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:04.900
 May cause Henry. Mr. Walker did buy that plane.

00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:06.400
 - He did? - Yes.

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:09.700
 I knew all the time he cheated us. Who told you?

00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:12.700
 Mr. Walker told me, and he came over to my office yesterday.

00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:16.000
 She was... Then we did get first prize. We can go after all.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:21.600
 Henry. Henry, did you know that some weeks ago Billy Walker was taken ill?

00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:24.400
 Yes, but far that was way back in February.

00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:29.300
 Did you know that Althonon for nearly two months, the boy lay in bed with a high fever?

00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:34.600
 He wasn't sick the day of the race though. I know he wasn't. I saw him walking around with my own eyes.

00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:41.400
 That's the point, son. What finally broke Billy's fever was the announcement in the center of their times of that airplane race.

00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:42.840
 How could that break it?

00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:46.780
 From the time he went to bed, it was the first and only thing he took any interest in.

00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:49.540
 He certainly couldn't have wanted to go into it any more than I did.

00:24:49.540 --> 00:24:51.140
 Now wait, son, wait.

00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:57.280
 The doctor told Mr. Walker it was absolutely imperative for Bill to have a plane and go into the race.

00:24:57.280 --> 00:24:58.980
 That's the reason.

00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:02.340
 And that's the only reason Mr. Walker went out and bought the plane.

00:25:02.340 --> 00:25:05.300
 I know, father, but gee, we'll look at it this way.

00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:08.300
 I'm going to leave it entirely up to you.

00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:10.820
 You may do anything about it you care to.

00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:14.620
 You mean to say that Billy's going to take that trip to the capital when he knows he cheated?

00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:16.620
 He doesn't know he cheated.

00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:23.220
 Aside from you and my son, there are only two people in this town who know that plane wasn't built in Walker's basement.

00:25:23.220 --> 00:25:24.220
 Who are they?

00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:27.820
 One is Billy's father and the other is Mr. Jones.

00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:30.420
 I knew all the time Mr. Jones was lying.

00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:33.820
 And he humiliated me right in front of Mr. Walker.

00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:37.220
 Henry, are you in the house there?

00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:38.820
 Is that you, Dizzy?

00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:42.260
 Excuse me for coming right in, but I've got some great news for you.

00:25:42.260 --> 00:25:43.220
 Good morning, Dizzy.

00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:44.820
 Good morning, Mr. Orange.

00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:47.460
 I shouldn't be here, but I've got to tell Henry.

00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:50.340
 Listen, I was lying in bed this morning,

00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:51.820
 and I got the subtracting.

00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:53.900
 Subtracting what?

00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:56.140
 Those figures are Mr. Collins.

00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:59.180
 When you take four and a half from eleven and a half,

00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:01.100
 you don't get six.

00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:01.740
 No?

00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:03.740
 You get seven.

00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:05.460
 Billy Walker didn't win that race.

00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:08.060
 You won it by more than a second.

00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:11.060
 Yeah? Sure! It's as clear as anything.

00:26:11.060 --> 00:26:14.060
 The only thing is, Dizzy.

00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:21.060
 When you subtract 4 1/2 from 11 1/2, you do get sex.

00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:23.060
 No! Sure you do.

00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:26.060
 You do? Of course.

00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:30.060
 Well, I'll be done, Henry. I guess you're right.

00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:33.060
 Sure. Sure, I couldn't have won the race.

00:26:33.060 --> 00:26:35.060
 Isn't that right, Father?

00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:41.060
 or once Henry, your mathematics are absolutely correct.

00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:43.640
 (lively music)

00:26:43.640 --> 00:27:01.740
 Ladies and gentlemen, is there a swell, tasty dessert in the house?

00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:05.940
 The answer is yes when you've got a package of jello chocolate pudding on the pantry shelf.

00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:10.860
 There's no doubt about it, with jello chocolate pudding for dessert, you're all fixed for

00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:12.360
 a feast.

00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:16.380
 Because this grand pudding has a flavor that's really and truly delicious.

00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:20.900
 And with the first dip of the spoon, you'll know you're in for a lot of keen enjoyment.

00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:25.980
 Jello chocolate pudding is full of rich, chocolatey goodness, a pleasing mellow flavor that spells

00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:26.980
 real satisfaction.

00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:33.380
 It's a creamy, smooth dessert, unsurpassed for topping off a meal in top-notch style.

00:27:33.380 --> 00:27:37.960
 And you'll find that Jello Chocolate Pudding is both easy and inexpensive to serve.

00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:42.640
 So tomorrow night for dinner, delight the family with this tempting chocolate treat.

00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:47.640
 There's a world of delicious pleasure already in waiting for you in Jello Chocolate Pudding.

00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:29.640
 Henry, I can't begin to tell you how pleased I was with you this morning.

00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:30.640
 Thank you, Father.

00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:33.640
 Oh, do we have any steel wool in the house?

00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:34.640
 What do you want it for?

00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:37.640
 I'm going over and help Dizzy clean his father's hat.

00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:52.640
 Well, if there is anything left of Mr. Stevens' hat

00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:56.640
 happens at when Henry and Disney get through with it, I'll eat mine.

00:28:56.640 --> 00:29:00.640
 The Aldrich family starring as the stone is written by Clifford Goldsmith.

00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:03.640
 Original music is composed and conducted by Jack Miller.

00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:08.640
 This is Harry Bonsell speaking and wishing you a good night for Jell-O Pudding.
