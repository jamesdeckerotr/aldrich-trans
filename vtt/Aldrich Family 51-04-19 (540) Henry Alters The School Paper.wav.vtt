00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 [Music]

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.500
 Henry!

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.000
 Henry!

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 Come on, are they?

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
 [Applause]

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.500
 Yes, it's the oldest family based on characters originated by

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.500
 by K

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.500
 and now for the Aldrich family.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:46.500
 They say that when you grow out of the teenage group it's like being expelled from paradise.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.500
 You can't ever go back. But you can recall that time in your life in the

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.360
 misadventures of Henry Albridge. It's early evening and the scene opens in the

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.180
 Albridge living room.

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.460
 Boy, that's rich.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.260
 Let's hear it.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:03.760
 And we go and read some.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.260
 And the father is trying to read his paper.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.020
 Oh, I'm sorry, Father.

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:13.260
 That's all right. I'm sure my paper isn't as amusing as whatever it is you and Homer are reading.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.860
 We're reading Willie's column in the school paper.

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.740
 Yeah, the Senate bill high, low down.

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.140
 - Would you care to hear a couple of items, Father?

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.260
 - No, thank you.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.460
 I just struggled along with my own paper,

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:26.700
 doll as it is.

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:27.540
 - Yes, sir.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.580
 - And please try to be a little more quiet, boys, won't you?

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.060
 - Oh, yes, Mrs. Aldrich.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.740
 We'll read to ourselves, Mother.

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:34.580
 - Good.

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.820
 (laughing)

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.580
 What is it, Homer?

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.100
 - Listen to this, him.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.180
 What boy was seen with what girl on what day?

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.740
 Having soda at what drug store?

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.740
 I like that. That's the third time this week Willie's mentioned me.

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.740
 [audience laughter]

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.740
 Oh, Homer, Willie's mentioned you too.

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:58.740
 He does. Let me see.

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:59.740
 Right here.

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:05.740
 Yesterday, most of the students in Mr. Miller's manual training class finished their coffee tables.

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.740
 Homer Brown is still working on a breadboard.

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.740
 [audience laughter]

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:11.740
 Some mention.

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.740
 Hey, here's some real dirt. Flash.

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.740
 George Bigelow and Natalie Bishop have...

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.740
 They have actually...

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.740
 It says here they...

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.740
 Please, please, I'm trying to light my cigar.

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:31.740
 Oh, sorry, Tommy.

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.740
 Boys, if I were to take your paper out on the front porch...

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:35.740
 Never mind, I was...

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.740
 If you'd rather we left, Father...

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.740
 Oh, no, no, there's nothing in my paper but news.

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:41.740
 Nobody has...

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:43.740
 ...if anybody.

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.740
 [audience laughing]

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:48.740
 - Hey, here, here's something about Gladys Prennett.

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:49.740
 - No kidding.

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.740
 - Is it that I'm taking you to the baseball game Saturday?

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:53.740
 - Oh.

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:54.740
 - Not exactly.

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:55.740
 - Did I take her to the class dance?

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:56.740
 - No.

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:57.740
 - Well, what does it say?

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.740
 - You better read it yourself, him.

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:00.740
 - Let's see.

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:05.740
 A very cozy twosome these days is Gladys Prennett's and...

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.740
 George Bigelow.

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:12.740
 They can be seen almost any time at the Haven's drugstore.

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:16.740
 Oh, this is nothing more or less than the old journalism.

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:18.740
 It's just a gossip column.

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:20.740
 There's no excuse for printing lies.

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:21.740
 Come on, homie.

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:22.740
 Where are you going?

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:23.740
 Where are you going?

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:25.740
 You'll find it.

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:28.740
 It looks like George Bigelow is spoiling Henry's dinner.

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:31.740
 The speaking of the Bigelow's hand there coming over for Bridge.

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:33.740
 Well, not this evening, I hope.

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:34.740
 Yes, dear.

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:37.740
 Oh, as I just wanted to relax and take it easy tonight.

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:38.740
 Sam, I had to ask them.

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:41.740
 We've been to their house for Bridge the last three or four times.

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:46.740
 I wouldn't mind so much, but the way Frank plays bridge is so annoyed.

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:49.740
 The overbids play the wrong cards, forgets the rules.

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:51.740
 But he always wins.

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:53.740
 That's what's so annoyed.

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:56.740
 Now, this isn't the some way we could get out of it gracefully.

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:58.740
 Dear, I don't know how.

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:01.740
 Frank's a good friend and client, and I don't want to offend him, but...

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.740
 I'm sure you can think of something.

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:08.740
 All right, Sam, but if I make some excuse, I don't want them to catch us at home.

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:09.740
 We'll go to the movie.

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:14.900
 go to the movie the movies no I will not go to the movie tonight very well then

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:21.220

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:01.100
 Cheers.

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:06.660
 Homer, I just happened to think I don't remember our English assignment for homework.

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:08.660
 I'd better call somebody and find out.

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:09.660
 I know what it is.

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:12.500
 It's page 140 to 150 of Ivan.

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:15.340
 Oh, I'll just say my better calling makes sure.

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:17.940
 Operator, please give me Elm 6354.

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.140
 Well, that's George Bigelow.

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:21.140
 I call him.

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:22.940
 He never does his English homework.

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:25.780
 Homer, that doesn't mean he doesn't know what it is.

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:26.780
 Hello?

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:28.380
 Can I speak to George?

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:30.380
 Oh, he isn't?

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:33.380
 Well, do you know where he is, Mrs. Bigelow?

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:36.380
 The Haven's drugstore?

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:39.380
 Oh, somebody called him and he went out?

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:42.380
 Some fella, I suppose.

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:45.380
 Oh, it was a girl, huh?

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:47.380
 Thank you.

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:49.380
 Goodbye.

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:53.380
 Homer, I think I'll go out for a walk.

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:55.380
 Okay, and I'll go along with you.

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:57.380
 I feel like a soda, too.

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:06.020
 [Music]

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:08.620
 What are you looking for here, do you see anything?

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:10.220
 Homer, I'm not looking for anything.

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:12.460
 And besides, there's nobody here.

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:13.660
 Nobody here?

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:15.300
 The drugstore is faulty.

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:17.140
 It was just a figure of speech.

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:17.800
 Oh.

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.100
 And look, there's Windbag, Willie Marshall.

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:22.020
 Do you know what I've got a good mind to do?

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:22.580
 Why?

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:23.580
 Come on.

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:24.620
 Listen, Willie.

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:27.420
 No father meat fellas, I'm working against the deadline.

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:29.420
 Oh, what are you writing, Willie?

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:32.120
 I'm reviewing a new movie that opened at the B-shoot tonight.

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:33.520
 I'm giving it four bells.

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.120
 The picture was that good?

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:36.820
 No, but I got in for nothing.

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:39.720
 Why should I bite the hand that gave me a pass?

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:43.820
 Listen, Willie, you ought to be careful about the lives you prick in your column.

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:47.620
 Oh, yeah? Any lies you say in my column happen to be the truth?

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:48.920
 Is that so?

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:52.620
 Didn't you say that George and Gladys are always here in the drugstore?

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:54.020
 Sure, and it's true.

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:56.380
 That's funny. I don't see him anyplace. Do you?

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:57.380
 Not me.

00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:58.380
 Oh boy.

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:00.300
 Well, for your information, they were just here.

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:02.220
 As a matter of fact, they were right in the next booth.

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:03.860
 Oh, sure, Willie.

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:04.860
 But they were.

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:06.540
 No, Willie. We know.

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:11.260
 Listen, you guys, I tell you, George and Goddess were sitting right in that booth not over five minutes ago.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.300
 Well, if you didn't have to make things up just to be important...

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:15.300
 Hey, Hank.

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:16.300
 What, Homer?

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:17.820
 Willie's half right.

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:19.580
 Here's George's algebra book.

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:20.940
 Let's see.

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:22.820
 That's George's algebra book, all right?

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:25.820
 I'd know that touch of stain anywhere.

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:27.580
 You see, I was telling the truth.

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:30.300
 But it all proves, well, I mean,

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:32.460
 proves that just George was here, not glad.

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:33.620
 Hey, Henry, be careful.

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:35.300
 You dropped something out of the book.

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:36.300
 What's he?

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:37.300
 Oh, what?

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:39.420
 He looks like a girl's writing.

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:41.380
 Well, I'm surprised that you know it's not

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:43.220
 right to read somebody else's mail.

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:45.740
 Newspaper men are supposed to read personal mail.

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:47.180
 It's a matter of principle.

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:47.740
 Just the same.

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:48.980
 I don't think you ought to read it.

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:51.780
 Henry, doesn't it look familiar to you?

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:54.380
 Homer, if you think I think Gladys wrote it, you're wrong.

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:58.100
 And besides, lots of girls use green ink on purple paper.

00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:02.780
 Boy, is this hot? Listen.

00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:06.460
 - Well, I don't think you should. - Please believe me.

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:09.300
 This whole thing is just a misunderstanding.

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:13.220
 No matter who I go out with, it's always you I'm thinking of.

00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:15.540
 Boy, I mean that Gladys.

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:18.020
 As for that party you may have seen me with,

00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:22.180
 I just want you to know that that party means nothing at all to me.

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:23.700
 In fact, less than nothing.

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:26.340
 Did you hear that, Henry?

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:28.420
 So what, Homer?

00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:32.140
 Gladys is old enough to make up her own mind about who she wants to go out with.

00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:34.380
 What an item this will make for my column.

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:36.500
 Willie, I won't let you print that letter.

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:37.220
 Give it to me.

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:39.140
 I won't let him put something in here.

00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:41.180
 Put something in here.

00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:42.500
 Let go of the company.

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:44.500
 You guys.

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:46.100
 Hello, George.

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:46.700
 Here you are, Henry.

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:47.340
 You can have it.

00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:48.340
 Wait a minute, will we?

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:50.340
 I did I leave my algebra book around here?

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:52.340
 Ah, algebra book?

00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:53.340
 What kind?

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:55.340
 The kind you're holding in your hand.

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:56.340
 Let's have it.

00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:57.340
 Hey Gladys, here it is.

00:08:57.340 --> 00:08:58.340
 I found it.

00:08:58.340 --> 00:08:59.340
 Oh, I'm glad George.

00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:00.340
 Hello, boys.

00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:01.340
 Oh, Gladys.

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:03.340
 Boy, am I glad I found this book.

00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:05.340
 There's something pretty important in it.

00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:06.340
 Hey, Gladys.

00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:07.340
 I should say.

00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:08.340
 That's Gladys.

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:10.340
 It isn't here.

00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:11.340
 Well, are you sure?

00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:12.340
 My goodness, George.

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:13.340
 Don't tell me you've lost it.

00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:16.340
 Oh, I put it right here in the chapter on binomial theorems.

00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:20.340
 Henry, is that my letter here holding this?

00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:22.340
 Well, what do you know?

00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:24.340
 [audience laughing]

00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:26.340
 So it is.

00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:28.340
 Come on Homer, not so fast.

00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:30.340
 This letter's been opened.

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:32.340
 I'm gonna punch you right in the nose, Henry.

00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:34.340
 Henry, you opened a personal letter.

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:35.340
 Gladys, I never--

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:36.340
 That's the lowest thing I ever heard.

00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:37.340
 You don't understand, I don't think--

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:39.340
 I think I do understand.

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:40.340
 You do?

00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:43.340
 Yes, and you can just go to the baseball game without me.

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:44.340
 Come on, June.

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:45.340
 Gladys, if you'll just listen--

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:47.340
 Oh, just listen, Gladys!

00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:49.340
 Oh, boy.

00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:52.340
 Well, he went to tell George you were the one who read the letter.

00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:55.340
 Oh, or how could I? You know what a temper George has.

00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:58.340
 You could have told him it was a matter of principle.

00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:01.340
 It was also a matter of principle to keep from getting slogged.

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:04.340
 I hope I can remember how that letter went.

00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:06.340
 Well, you're not going to print that letter.

00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:08.340
 Well, sure I am, and with a head loss.

00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:10.340
 Listen, will he? Why involve innocent people?

00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:11.340
 By who?

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:13.340
 Well, like Gladys.

00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:16.740
 I don't think I'm going to kill a big story like this, do you? I owe it to my reader.

00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:17.340
 Look, Willie.

00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:19.340
 Nothing doing. It's my duty to print it.

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:22.340
 I suppose you know George wouldn't like it.

00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:23.040
 George?

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:24.040
 Sure.

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:27.840
 It's his personal mail you're making public.

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:30.640
 Henry, add a friendship to you, I'll sit on the story.

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:31.640
 You will?

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:32.840
 Gee, thanks, Willie.

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:34.140
 But you'll have to do me a favor.

00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:35.340
 Anything you say, Willie?

00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:36.040
 Just name.

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:39.740
 Well, I have to go over to Abbott City early tomorrow to cover the Teacher's Convention.

00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:43.300
 I want you to deliver my column to the print shop at school tomorrow.

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:43.900
 Is that all?

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:45.460
 Consider it done, Lily.

00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:47.300
 OK, here's a column.

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:48.540
 Either way.

00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:49.300
 Yes, Lily?

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:51.500
 Supposed to be there at 7.30.

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:53.260
 What in the morning?

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:54.380
 7.30.

00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:56.140
 Don't forget, we made a bargain.

00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:58.420
 I don't know if it was such a bargain.

00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:01.300
 OK, Lily, it'll be there at 7.30.

00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:02.460
 Well, I'll see you guys.

00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:04.620
 Be sure it's there on time.

00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:06.140
 Boy, Henry.

00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:08.100
 I'll admit it's pretty early in the morning.

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:12.420
 morning it's the middle of the night. Homer it won't kill you to get up early

00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:17.340
 one morning. Maybe not but it shouldn't do me any good. Well Willie thinks he's such

00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:22.940
 a big shot with his column. Look at this Homer he can't even spell. Why? What do

00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:29.020
 you spell success? S-U-C-C-E-S-S.

00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:33.020
 And he calls himself a journalist.

00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:35.020
 Go on and change it, him.

00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:37.020
 Cross out a seat.

00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:41.020
 Homeless success is supposed to have two seats.

00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:44.020
 But it's not supposed to have two wesses on the end.

00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:46.020
 Are you sure?

00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:48.020
 Are you?

00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:52.020
 Why don't we play safe and cross out a C and a Niss?

00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:55.020
 Good idea.

00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:56.020
 There.

00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:59.780
 There. Yeah, it looks much better.

00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:04.220
 It does it that. Charlie Clark's success.

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:09.300
 A bunch of the boys gathered at Charlie's house to watch him shave.

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:12.620
 This is the second time this semester.

00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:17.940
 Charlie has high hopes of a mustache in the near future.

00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:21.860
 Pretty sensation.

00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:24.860
 But do you know what I have a good notion to do with Willie's column?

00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:25.360
 Why?

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:26.860
 Let everyone know how...

00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:30.360
 Well, let them know the kind that Guy George Bigelow is.

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:31.860
 But you might not like it.

00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:33.860
 That's the point, Homer. That's the point.

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:35.860
 Hand me that pencil.

00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:46.860
 You hear your egg, Sam?

00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:47.860
 Mm-hmm.

00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:48.860
 Oh, thank you, Ollie.

00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:52.860
 Sam, you know my rule about reading the morning times at the table.

00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:55.860
 This is yesterday's Centerville High Lowdown.

00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:59.860
 I was just reading Willie Marshall's column in the school paper.

00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:02.860
 By the way, Sam, Frank Bigelow called you. He wants you to call him right back.

00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:04.860
 All right, Alice, in just a minute.

00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:06.860
 Listen to this, will you?

00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:08.860
 Names in the news.

00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:11.860
 President Truman and General MacArthur.

00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:13.860
 What else did he say?

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:14.860
 That's all.

00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:18.660
 I guess that's Alice.

00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:21.780
 What Centivell High student with the initials G.V.

00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:24.620
 who recently with Natalie Bishop

00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:28.100
 is now being seen in the company of what unsuspecting girl

00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:30.180
 does she know she's taking a chance of being

00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:32.380
 tossed aside like an old shoe tree?

00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:34.140
 (laughing)

00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:35.940
 Oh, this is priceless.

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:37.820
 The popular Centivell citizen Will Brown

00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:39.660
 and father of popular Homer Brown

00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:40.860
 has been raising the question

00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:43.060
 with his popular wife Mrs. Brown

00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:45.700
 over the matter of too much starch in his college.

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:50.700
 No! I'd give a million dollars to see Wilboff's basement he meets.

00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:53.700
 Oh, Alice, I'm in here. You are?

00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:59.700
 Yeah, listen. Mr. Orrit's popular centerville lawyer and father of the popular Henry Orrit.

00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:04.700
 Attended a movie yesterday evening with his wife the popular Mrs. Orrit.

00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:06.700
 What's so funny about that?

00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:08.700
 Oh, now where's your sense of humor, Alice?

00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:10.700
 Oh, I'm glad it starts you, Ms. Orrit's.

00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:13.700
 I just hope the Bigelow's enjoy it when they read it.

00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:14.940
 The Bigelow.

00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:16.940
 Yes, Sam, the Bigelow's.

00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:18.940
 Good heavens, I forgot about that.

00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:20.740
 And I told him you had to work.

00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:21.740
 You didn't.

00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:26.180
 Maybe you can convince Frank that it's a habit of yours taking work to the movies.

00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:30.820
 Things have come to a pretty pass when a person can go to a movie without the whole town knowing about it.

00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:32.020
 Oh my goodness, Sam.

00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:33.020
 What is it, Alice?

00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:35.620
 Do you think that's what Frank Bigelow's been calling you about?

00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:38.660
 Frank would never read the school paper.

00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:40.060
 I don't think.

00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:42.860
 Don't forget Joy's probably brought the paper home.

00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:44.260
 What am I going to say to Frank?

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:45.860
 I don't know, dear.

00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:48.360
 How did Willie find out we were at the movies?

00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:50.360
 Who?

00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:51.360
 Edward!

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:52.860
 Sam, don't blame Henry.

00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:54.360
 Willie was at the movies, too.

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:56.360
 Were you calling my father?

00:14:56.360 --> 00:15:00.360
 I was just about to leave for school if that's what's on your mind.

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:03.860
 It was nothing, Henry, and answer that on your way out.

00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:07.360
 Is that it possible that Frank won't see the paper?

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:08.360
 Hello?

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:10.360
 Hello, Henry?

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:11.360
 Oh, hello, Gladys.

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:12.860
 Is Willy there?

00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:13.360
 Willy?

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:13.860
 Yes.

00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:14.360
 No.

00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:14.860
 Oh.

00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:16.360
 What do you want him for?

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:18.860
 Did you see his column in yesterday's paper?

00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:19.860
 Why you have--

00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:22.360
 I just like to give him a piece of my mind.

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:27.360
 I've been working my fingers to the bone, trying to help George make up with Natalie Bishop.

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:28.360
 You heard?

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:28.860
 Sure.

00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:32.360
 She was angry because he heard that George was running around with other girls.

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:32.860
 Oh.

00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:37.860
 I even helped him write a perfectly wonderful letter that couldn't help but bring them together again.

00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:40.860
 And now Willy is going and spoiled the whole thing.

00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:42.180
 You got Gladys.

00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:44.020
 Poor George.

00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:45.420
 Poor George?

00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:47.820
 Well, I'll have to hang up now, Henry.

00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:49.100
 What's your hurry, Gladys?

00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:50.620
 I've got to go find George.

00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:53.260
 At a time like this, he needs someone.

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:54.460
 Henry.

00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:55.420
 Listen, Gladys.

00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:56.620
 Goodbye, Henry.

00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:58.060
 [COUGHING]

00:15:58.060 --> 00:15:59.060
 Hey, Henry.

00:15:59.060 --> 00:15:59.740
 Hi, Homer.

00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:01.540
 About those things we put in Willie's car.

00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:03.180
 No, I just ran into George Bigelow,

00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:04.740
 and I thought you better know.

00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:05.540
 So?

00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:07.980
 George says that he personally single-handed

00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:10.380
 will make hand burger out of whoever wrote that thing

00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:17.380
 in the car. Oh boy. And we got looking for Willie Marshall right now.

00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:36.380
 And now getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldrich. It's later the same morning and

00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:44.800
 the scene opens in Mr. Olridge's office. Hello. Hello. Can I please speak to Mr.

00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:51.560
 Olridge? Oh, chew Alice. Hello. I couldn't say I didn't recognize your voice. Maybe we had a bad connection.

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:02.720
 I'm sure he's seen that thing in the paper.

00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:05.040
 Did he sound angry?

00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:07.440
 Well, he was a little excited.

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:08.920
 What are you going to say to him?

00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:12.320
 I think I'd better give him a little time to cool off.

00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:15.280
 I don't know why you don't call him right away and get it over.

00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:17.920
 Alice, I hope you don't think I'm afraid of Frank Bigelow.

00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:19.120
 Dear, I didn't say that.

00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:21.280
 Because after all, I haven't done anything criminal.

00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:21.800
 I know.

00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:23.960
 But if you think I have any fear of speaking to him,

00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:25.240
 I'll certainly call him.

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:26.960
 When said?

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:28.440
 First thing in the morning.

00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:38.440
 [Music]

00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:40.440
 Are you sure he didn't get past your home?

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:45.440
 I haven't been watching the entrance for 40 minutes. He can't be in school unless he can't early.

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:47.440
 Were you to the print shop?

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:51.440
 Yeah, he hasn't been there yet. We'd better make sure we get a hold of Willie before George does.

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:53.440
 Gladys is looking for Willie too.

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:56.760
 Boy if Gladys finds out I had anything to do with that column

00:17:56.760 --> 00:18:02.340
 She'll never look me in the face again. And if George finds out she won't recognize your face

00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:07.080
 Why don't think George is really that sore do you

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:15.040
 Do you I know is that George hit Toby Smith once and Toby was out of school for three days?

00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:18.720
 He was and George like Toby

00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:21.360
 Homer will you quit exaggerating

00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:28.800
 There's only one thing for us to do get transfer to Abbott City High. We have to get rid of Willie

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:31.520
 get rid of him you mean

00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:35.040
 For good no

00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:39.880
 No, we've got to keep him out of sight for a few days till George and Natalie make up

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:45.640
 How are you gonna do that? I don't know I'll have to think about it. Hi fellas. Willie how

00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:49.720
 How was the convention yesterday?

00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:52.960
 Pretty dull. How would you like to spend the whole day with teachers?

00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:54.320
 We did.

00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:56.120
 Not the same thing.

00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:58.720
 You guys turned my column in on time yesterday?

00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:00.320
 Sure. How did it look?

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:02.720
 It certainly did, Willie.

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:05.320
 Well, I guess I'll go down on the print shop and look at a copy.

00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:07.000
 The print shop will... Willie...

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.120
 You don't want to do that. I don't.

00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:10.120
 How did I turn?

00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:12.320
 - Well, Willie. - Well, thanks.

00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:14.920
 Come on, you guys, quick problem. Let me pass.

00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:16.720
 Guys, Willie, who's crowded?

00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:18.720
 You are. No over will you?

00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:21.080
 Willie.

00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:22.080
 Why?

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:23.720
 How do you feel?

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:25.880
 I feel fine.

00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:27.960
 I think he looks a little pale.

00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:30.840
 I do? Oh, it's probably nothing.

00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:35.880
 I don't know him. There are all kinds of things floating around that a person could catch.

00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:37.800
 You guys think it's a little warm?

00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:40.200
 No, as a matter of fact, it's a little chilly.

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:41.840
 Gee, maybe I got a fever.

00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:43.720
 He was a little flushed.

00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:45.520
 He just said I was pale.

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:48.200
 Fastest change I ever saw.

00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:53.200
 I don't feel so good.

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:55.200
 Maybe I'd better see the nurse.

00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:57.200
 That's a slow idea, Willie.

00:19:57.200 --> 00:20:00.200
 And we'd better hurry while you're still able to walk.

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:02.200
 Well, I feel terrible.

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:03.200
 And?

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:04.200
 Yes, Willie.

00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:06.200
 Can I lean on you?

00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:14.200
 Uh-huh.

00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:17.120
 Look all right, Willie. What's the matter with you?

00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:18.960
 I've got symptoms, Miss Fox.

00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:20.640
 Symptoms? What kind?

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:23.120
 Well, that's the frightening part. I don't know.

00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:25.880
 Oh, that's the most dangerous kind.

00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:28.000
 It is? Oh, boy.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:32.960
 Hey, Ray, Homer. Are you also victims of this rare malady?

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:34.240
 Oh, no, Miss Fox.

00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:36.640
 No, we just helped Willie tear off.

00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:39.680
 I see. Stick out your tongue, Willie.

00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:40.880
 Stick it out.

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:41.840
 Eh.

00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:43.480
 Oh, dear me.

00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:44.480
 Ah.

00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:46.280
 Have you had any cold lately?

00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:47.980
 Ah.

00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:48.980
 How about headaches?

00:20:48.980 --> 00:20:50.080
 Do you have had them?

00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:52.280
 Ah-hah.

00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:54.080
 Very well, Willie.

00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:55.980
 You might put your tongue back now.

00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:56.780
 Ah-hah.

00:20:56.780 --> 00:20:59.680
 Thanks, Miss Fox.

00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:01.280
 What do you think I have?

00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:04.080
 Willie, I think you have a very severe case

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:06.080
 of the ancient history.

00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:06.880
 What?

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:10.780
 Patients with symptoms like yours usually have that melody.

00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:12.180
 I beg your pardon?

00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:16.180
 We also get quite a few algebra cases and some Spanish cases.

00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:18.180
 So what class have you got?

00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:20.180
 I got study.

00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:23.180
 Well, maybe I better send you home.

00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:36.180
 Oh my goodness, isn't anyone going to get the phone?

00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:38.180
 I've been answering it all day.

00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:41.180
 Frankly, whether I'm not expecting any calls.

00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:43.580
 I don't think anyone will be calling me.

00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:45.580
 I suppose I'll have to answer it.

00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:47.580
 I'm sure it isn't for me.

00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:50.380
 Henry, I really think one of us should have taken the phone.

00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:50.880
 Yes, sir.

00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:51.980
 I guess I should.

00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:53.080
 Who?

00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:54.080
 Bigelow?

00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:55.680
 Oh, just a moment.

00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:56.680
 George.

00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:59.580
 You see, I told you it wasn't for me.

00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:00.880
 A mother, Alice.

00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:01.880
 It's for you, Sam.

00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:03.280
 Frank Bigelow.

00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:06.380
 Well, I suppose I might as well get it over with.

00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:08.380
 Sammy, you haven't spoken to him yet?

00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:10.580
 It kept slipping my mind, Alice.

00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:13.580
 I wouldn't blame him if he were angry now.

00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:15.580
 Hello Frank.

00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:18.580
 Hello Sam. Good heavens, I haven't tried to get all of you French.

00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:23.580
 I know Frank, I'm awfully sorry. Look Frank, why don't we get together for bridge tonight?

00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:24.580
 What?

00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:27.580
 And maybe make a weekly game of it. It's always a pleasure to play with you.

00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:29.580
 Well thanks, Sam. I like that.

00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:30.580
 Good?

00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:37.580
 And listen, Sam, there isn't even calling you. I had a rush deal to develop a completely new corporate setup.

00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:43.080
 It was a big job and since I couldn't get all of you, I had to call in Anderson.

00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:45.880
 Oh, sorry Sam, but I couldn't wait.

00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:48.480
 Oh, that's... alright Frank.

00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:50.680
 We'll see you about seven for bridge seven.

00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:54.580
 Sure, let's get an early start so we can have a nice long evening.

00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:56.580
 Oh, sure Frank.

00:22:56.580 --> 00:22:59.480
 Oh, by the way it's Henry there. Henry, your son.

00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:00.680
 Oh, of course.

00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:03.280
 Will you put him on the phone George wants to talk to us.

00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:04.280
 Alright Frank.

00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:06.280
 Henry, fella whole.

00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:09.880
 - Telephone father, Pry? - Yes, George Bigelow.

00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:11.080
 George?

00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:14.480
 Well, she was father, couldn't you say I'm sick, or not home, or that I--

00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:17.880
 - Nonsense, Henry. I don't know what's happening with you and George,

00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:21.080
 but I can tell you if you have a disagreeable job to do,

00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:23.880
 get it over at once. That's my motto.

00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:25.380
 [laughter]

00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:28.280
 - And now on. - Yes, sir.

00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:30.080
 - Here's the phone.

00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:32.480
 - Hello, George. - Listen, Henry, over.

00:23:32.580 --> 00:23:37.100
 I found out about the whole thing and let me tell you what's going to happen to you wise guy. Oh, yeah

00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:41.960
 Yeah, I'm going to come over and put you right in the nose. All right, George. All right

00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:47.700
 Come on over. Let's make it a nose and I'll put your right back

00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:52.460
 I'm pretty mad myself after what you did to me and glad it

00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:56.420
 Let me tell you a thing or two about now

00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:03.260
 You can't tell me a thing about Gladys.

00:24:03.260 --> 00:24:05.260
 What about her?

00:24:05.260 --> 00:24:14.260
 I'm leaving, Mother.

00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:15.260
 Where are you going?

00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:17.260
 In the baseball game, remember?

00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:19.260
 Oh, who are you going with, Gladys?

00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:20.260
 No, Mother.

00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:22.260
 Gladys is going with Homer.

00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:23.260
 Oh, Natalie?

00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:25.260
 Then Natalie's going with Willie.

00:24:25.260 --> 00:24:27.260
 Then who are you going with?

00:24:27.260 --> 00:24:29.260
 Well, I...

00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:31.260
 Excuse me mother

00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:33.260
 Hot in there!

00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:35.260
 I'm in the right window, George!

00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:37.260
 I mean, right when is yours?

00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:38.260
 George!

00:24:38.260 --> 00:25:06.260
