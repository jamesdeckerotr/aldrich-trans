00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
 [Music]

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.300
 Memories almighty thing you would bring at best.

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.400
 And the farther back you reach, the more faded you remember it.

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.300
 Well, if you want to revise the memory of your youth, there's no better way

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:17.000
 than knowing a lively teenage boy like Henry Aubrey.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.500
 It's morning and the scene opens in the Aubrey's kitchen.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.800
 Now, the itself is almost there to the E.S. Mary.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:23.800
 Is it not that a car?

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:24.800
 No, no, Mary.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.300
 It had a very hard day yesterday letting it sleep.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.700
 - Great, what do you call that, how's it going?

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.260
 - Good, good, good, good.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.500
 - Just go on the clockwalk.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.500
 - Oh, dear.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.100
 Mary's scrubbing it again.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:35.940
 - Yes.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.600
 - But he scrubbed it all day yesterday

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.140
 and he didn't get any of it all.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:40.260
 - I know, but I think it's morning

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.500
 if you can cut some time.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.220
 - The poor boy I'll go calling.

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.860
 - You're gonna start the copy, mop, and please, Mary.

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.380
 - Alice, where's the morning, my friend?

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.540
 - The right beside your plate, Sam.

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.980
 Mary, then you'll bother to use.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:53.780
 - Pardon me.

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.020
 Breakfast is ready.

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.460
 - In just a minute, mother.

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.860
 I think I'm finally getting somewhere with a sidewalk.

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:01.300
 The red paint's coming off.

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.100
 Nobody's starting to turn pink now, and...

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.660
 (crying)

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.420
 Or is it just that the sun's finally come up?

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.420
 Yeah, may I say something?

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.340
 Any young lady who'd fly off the handle,

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.220
 the way that it did yesterday,

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.500
 just because of a little something

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.100
 that somebody wrote on a sidewalk.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.860
 Well, I wouldn't exactly call this a little something.

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.820
 After all, it put me in a very compromising position

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.060
 with Nancy Adams.

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:33.060
 - Side by side. - And I just figure if I can erase out that. If you're going to send another day scrubbing out here, you're going to need your energy. So let's go in.

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:41.060
 - No, no, no, no, no. - Let me go. Let me go. Let me go. Mary, what's happening? - It's in the comfort of starting with. - I'm starting to walk outside. - Well, Mary, what are you talking about?

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:49.060
 - I thought I wrote an error about it to the editor. Let's go there at the morning. - Well, my goodness. Let's see it. - Mary, he didn't go and mention Nancy's in my name, did he?

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.060
 I don't know.

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.560
 Just go on some old boy.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:52.560
 Come on Mary.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.560
 Well, this person or a person's vote on our side.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.260
 Oh, you didn't go and quote the exact

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:58.860
 verbatim words did you?

00:01:58.860 --> 00:01:59.860
 Of course not.

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:00.860
 Excuse me.

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.560
 What this person or person's vote on our sidewalk

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.560
 is not the concern of this letter.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:06.560
 Mm-hmm.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:07.560
 Gee, thanks Father.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.060
 But the desecration of property, both public and private,

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.560
 is a matter which should arise every citizen in Santaville.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.160
 I for one feel it is high time our town council

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.320
 took steps to eradicate the rising tide of vandalism.

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.840
 Samuel W. Aldrich, Samuel D'Happell, you argue.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:27.880
 Then why you're at it?

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.640
 You can just as well have added attorney at law.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:31.800
 - All right.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.520
 - Then right after breakfast, I want you to go down

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.280
 and get a half dozen copies of the paper.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.280
 - For heaven's sake.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.520
 - I'm gonna need at least that many to send away.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.080
 - I just think you're making a big fuss over nothing.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.080
 After all, the letter to the editor isn't such a,

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.200
 you really like him?

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.680
 I think it's a very well written letter.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.280
 It is? Oh, yes.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.720
 And you use such a wonderful choice of words, didn't you, ma'am?

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:54.920
 Ma'am, yes.

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:55.320
 Well...

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.680
 You got what you wanted to get to, boys?

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:57.960
 I lost my father?

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.080
 Oh, well, I...

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.960
 You just wondered if half a dozen copies are going to be enough.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:03.720
 Alex, believe me, it's not that good.

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:04.280
 And I'll be here?

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.840
 Every time.

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.680
 I've already ordered a few extra copies.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:07.640
 You had?

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.520
 But only because I knew you were in this, on mailing them out.

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:11.560
 Oh, good.

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.080
 How many did you order?

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.960
 Enough.

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.880
 And just for the record, I'd like it to be known

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.660
 that the only reason I bothered to write that letter was to help Henry.

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:19.420
 Me, Father?

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:24.420
 Yes, I think once Gladys sees my letter, she'll realize you couldn't possibly have painted that on the sidewalk.

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:25.620
 You really think so?

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.460
 Of course it's just gladness!

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:30.820
 Yeah, the only trouble is gladness isn't too strong on logic.

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:34.340
 Although, excuse me, when I put in a phone call.

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.640
 Let's see, when my sister bailed, when do you have a gun?

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.060
 M203, please.

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.840
 Mother, do you think you would help my marks, any if I showed it to my English teachers?

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.240
 I don't think anything could hurt them.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.040
 Hello?

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.240
 Oh, hello, Mrs. Claddis. This is Henry.

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:52.040
 Oh, yes, Henry.

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.340
 I mean, I speak with Gladis.

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:55.740
 I'm not afraid not, Henry.

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:56.840
 He means he's not there.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.240
 And not just a moment.

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.740
 Oh.

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:59.640
 He's gone out?

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:00.440
 No.

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.440
 As a matter of fact, he hasn't gone out since yesterday.

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:04.240
 Oh?

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:06.040
 He's upstairs in a room.

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:06.840
 Oh.

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.840
 And he's been up there since yesterday.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.340
 Oh.

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:12.440
 Mrs. Claddis,

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.280
 Do you know if by any chance,

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.040
 GLATERS happen to see this morning?

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.600
 - Hang in, ring.

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:18.440
 - Hang in. - Hang in.

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:19.440
 - Hey, look quick. - What's wrong?

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:20.840
 - You better tell me what I just saw.

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:21.780
 - What, you beat it?

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.680
 Mrs. Prentice, there's a slight intercomotion here.

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:25.640
 - When you're listening,

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.120
 - Oh, my. - What I find another sign

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.040
 about you and me.

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.320
 - Well, can't you just wait to watch?

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:30.320
 - What? - I'm gonna say,

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:31.760
 and throw over and do three.

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.440
 - Oh, boy. - Hello.

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.020
 - And Mrs. Prentice, pardon me if I say goodbye,

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:37.000
 temporarily. - Thank you.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.200
 - Goodbye.

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.040
 Who did it?

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.880
 Who's the wise guy?

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.840
 - I don't know, but somebody has to get you.

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.560
 - Not sure, yeah, well I'll show him a thing or two,

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.640
 whoever the wise guy is, come on.

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:49.320
 - He was, what this power of meat-tape

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.240
 is doing on your front porch?

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.120
 - Today's Center of Old Times, isn't it?

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.960
 - Yeah.

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.640
 - Oh, they must be the copies my father ordered.

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:59.440
 - Yeah, he's going into the business?

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.160
 - No, Homer, come on.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.740
 (upbeat music)

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:09.480
 - How much further is it, Homer?

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.080
 - Right in the middle of the next slide.

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:16.380
 If you ask me, some guys have a pretty crude sense of humor, painting the town red with my name.

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:20.680
 Yeah, I just look glad it finds out all the trouble I'm going to for her sake.

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:21.680
 Let's cross here.

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:22.680
 Okay.

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.080
 Well, my father was in the paper once.

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:26.780
 He wrote a letter to the editor too.

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:30.080
 No, it was the time he sued the railroad for Pina.

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.080
 For what?

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:32.780
 Pina, Pina.

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:37.080
 He put a penny more than a penny, so you're nothing to me now.

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:38.580
 He sued them for that?

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:40.480
 No, that was just the way it started.

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:43.480
 My father put his hand up the machine with that stuff.

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:45.080
 The machine?

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.480
 No, his hand.

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.880
 And he missed his train and lost a big contact because of it.

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:50.880
 So he sued.

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:51.880
 Is that right?

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:52.880
 What happened?

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:53.880
 Be corrected.

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:54.480
 You know?

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:56.480
 Well, I'm telling you, Paine's opinion.

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:59.680
 My father said, "There it is, homie.

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:00.880
 Just look at that fence.

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:04.880
 This is the greatest daylight boy if I ever text a guy that did this."

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:05.880
 You know what I'll do.

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:06.880
 Do you know what I'll do?

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:07.480
 Why?

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:08.480
 I'll...

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:12.280
 Well, you're regret it as long as you live.

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:13.840
 Maybe longer.

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:15.720
 OK, here's a brush for you and one for me.

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:17.880
 Come on, let's get started painting this out.

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:20.120
 Well, before we do this, you don't

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.760
 suppose the person who owns this same small pig.

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:24.160
 Pig?

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.400
 Well, you ought to be glad I don't steal them.

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:28.600
 No matter what fact, I bet I've got a darn good pig.

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:29.600
 I'm right there.

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:32.240
 Helping to defamate my character.

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:33.800
 I bet I have a darn good pig.

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:34.800
 Come right on, father.

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:39.640
 My father said those peanuts cost him $200 a pound.

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:41.040
 Come on, let's start painting.

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:42.140
 Okay.

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:44.640
 You start on the Henry and I'll work on Nancy

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:46.640
 and we'll meet in the middle.

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:47.840
 Wait a second, Henry.

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:48.940
 What's the matter?

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:50.940
 See those two men across the street?

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:51.940
 What about them?

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:54.140
 Is that a camera they have there?

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:56.340
 No, I think they're probably surveying something.

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:58.140
 We hope it's here or not.

00:06:58.140 --> 00:06:59.440
 Come on, Homer, let's start painting

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:01.140
 or we'll never get done.

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:01.540
 Hi, how are you?

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:02.340
 See, it's Mary.

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:03.140
 Hi, Mary.

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:04.140
 Hi, Homer.

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:05.440
 Did you do what I asked you to?

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:07.840
 I just came to talk to Mrs. Pettis.

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:12.840
 Did you casually mention that the order tell Gladys to look at the letters to the editor, Karlman?

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:16.840
 Oh, goodness, because I found out that the judges don't take the photo of those times anymore.

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:17.840
 They don't? How come?

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:19.840
 They go back to Venice, it's from Canada.

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:21.840
 Well, what's that got to do with it?

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:25.840
 Well, she said they have not a copy in their office, but they put them out against London.

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:27.840
 Do you, Whiz Mary? If that is typical of you.

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:33.840
 Oh, maybe it's you to do the simplest possible thing in your life. Somebody named Lamben get mixed up in it.

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:37.180
 and we may be back to your house and get one of your father's take.

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:39.500
 Well, I've been saying that if you're going to do that to better,

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:41.340
 I want it because they're going fast.

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:44.340
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:52.420
 In the living room, Alice.

00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:55.220
 Here, do you know what-- what are you doing?

00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:57.820
 Well, I'm just writing something.

00:07:57.820 --> 00:07:58.820
 So I know what.

00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:00.780
 You know the rest of the papers are.

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:02.660
 Oh, there aren't any more.

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:04.160
 Oh, papers are gone.

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:06.060
 Well, it's the race you've been mailing them out.

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:08.060
 Sam, so far, I've only used two.

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:09.060
 I saw.

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:11.660
 Well, Henne came in a while ago and took some.

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:12.960
 One, anyway.

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:15.460
 In the world, few people, I thought I'd like to--

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:17.260
 Alice, I'd like to get your opinion on something.

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:18.060
 What is it?

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:20.160
 Which of these sound better to you?

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:23.560
 Main Street, ma'am, or Perot, the life and limb.

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:25.260
 You're writing a murder, Mr. H?

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.360
 No, no, a letter to the editor.

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:28.960
 Just occurred to me that--

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:31.160
 Alice, have you ever noticed how traffic gets snarled

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:33.860
 around Maine and Ellen Street at five o'clock.

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:36.600
 Or do you think a letter about the new tax assessment

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:38.000
 would be of greater interest?

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.200
 - You wanna get that fan?

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:40.040
 - All right.

00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:41.560
 - Mother, do you want me to start right?

00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:42.400
 - Oh.

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:43.240
 - It's a little early, late.

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:44.080
 - Yeah.

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:44.920
 - Larry, look at this.

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:45.760
 - Who you think?

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:47.600
 - Apparently, a list of things your father's thinking

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:49.080
 of writing to the editor about.

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:51.840
 - Is he gonna be writing to the people every day?

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:52.920
 - I hope not.

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:55.240
 - Or his law practice will just go to pieces.

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:56.080
 - All right.

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:56.920
 - Yes, fan.

00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:57.880
 - Now, that's where you might as well

00:08:57.880 --> 00:08:59.320
 put a light under the potato.

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:00.320
 - Yes, mother.

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:01.580
 - What was that on the phone, Sam?

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:04.360
 - That Alice was the editor of the "Centerville Times."

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:05.360
 - Really?

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:06.360
 - Huh?

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:08.280
 - Seems I've really started something down there.

00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:10.360
 He said a couple of reporters out this morning

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:13.040
 and they just came back with a picture of two of those vandals

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:15.040
 called "Light and the Act of Smearing Up a Fan."

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:16.400
 - Oh, my!

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:18.040
 - And he's gonna run it in tonight's paper

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:20.000
 along with the second editorial he's writing.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.560
 Now that's what I call getting action.

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:24.520
 - I should say, now over those vandals.

00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:26.360
 - Oh, just a couple of kids, he said.

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:27.200
 (laughs)

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:28.640
 Said they both looked as though they had been shot.

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:29.720
 - Oh, dear.

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:32.120
 I'll finally get what's coming to them.

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:33.420
 Grinch it.

00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:35.020
 What do you think will happen to them?

00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:37.220
 I wouldn't be a bit surprised if they both wound up

00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:39.180
 in the foreign school.

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:42.580
 Well, personally, I don't think it was a bit fair.

00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:45.540
 Taking those poor boys by surprise that way.

00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:46.460
 What do you want them to do?

00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:48.500
 I thought food limbs to pose.

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:50.300
 After all, they were violating the law.

00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:53.220
 I realize that, then I realize that.

00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:55.180
 But just think of how the parents of those boys

00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:57.260
 are going to feel when they see that picture.

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.380
 It seems to me that's something a parent should think

00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:04.820
 before him naturally you feel that way you're a lawyer I'm also a parent but you're not a mother

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:10.740
 that is if you were you wouldn't let the editor print that picture how can I stop him

00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:15.620
 he started the whole thing didn't you yes but well you guys can't tell the editor that if he

00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:20.580
 insists on turning the picture you will write him any more letters well Alan

00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:35.580
 Oh, Grottus! Grottus!

00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:37.580
 I don't think she gives you him.

00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:40.580
 What do you think you just go up and ring the bell?

00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:44.580
 Oh, but from what her mother told me this morning, I don't think that's too wild.

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:47.580
 Well, how else are you going to get this copy of the paper to her?

00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:52.580
 If I can just get her to come to the window for a second, I'm sure she'll...

00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:56.580
 Wait a second. I think I know how I can get her attention. Stand back.

00:10:56.580 --> 00:10:59.580
 You know, throwing rocks at us, there's always no way to make up.

00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:02.580
 It's not a rock, it's just a cobble.

00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:04.580
 And I'm only going to hit the window with it.

00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:06.580
 The window...scuse me.

00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:07.580
 Where are you going?

00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:10.580
 I think I'll watch you across the street.

00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:12.580
 Why are you silly? I'm only going to hit it lightly.

00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:14.580
 Watch.

00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:19.580
 Boy, and the coach Nelson was wrong about you.

00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:20.580
 And what way?

00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:22.580
 He said you couldn't even hit the side of a house.

00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:24.580
 Where's another pebble?

00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:25.580
 Here, and then we'll try it one.

00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:26.580
 Can we actually move it?

00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:29.580
 Okay, but remember, lightly, sure, sure.

00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:33.580
 Homer went right through the window.

00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:36.580
 Yeah, but I think about it, I think he...

00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:38.580
 You think so?

00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:40.580
 See, there she is, there she is.

00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:42.580
 Oh, my God, I got it.

00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:45.540
 I hope we didn't disturb you or anything, did we?

00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:47.620
 Is that a picture of all the names you have there,

00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:48.820
 if I had it?

00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:50.180
 - Gladys, what are you doing with that?

00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:51.020
 - What are we doing with that?

00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:52.020
 - What are we getting out of it?

00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:54.020
 - Oh, oh, oh!

00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:57.020
 Gladys, I just want to ask you to give a signal to me.

00:11:57.020 --> 00:11:58.180
 - Morning!

00:11:58.180 --> 00:11:59.500
 - Oh, boy.

00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:03.260
 - Oh, okay, and we have you got any more ideas like that?

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:06.020
 (dramatic music)

00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:11.940
 - And now getting back to the troubles of Henry Alvarez.

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:16.540
 It's just a little later now, and the scene is still outside Gladys Senator House.

00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:19.580
 Now Homer, have you got that straight?

00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:21.040
 I...so...so?

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:23.840
 We just stopped hopping up and down like that.

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:26.440
 But I've still got some water in my ear.

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:30.440
 The last one pops already, but still working on the rice.

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:32.840
 Well, what a dry out by natural means.

00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:37.540
 Now go ahead, and remember, the important thing is to get the paper in the Gladys' house.

00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:38.440
 Okay.

00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:43.340
 and you don't have to mention my name in there unless the situation changes.

00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:45.140
 My daddest.

00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:46.840
 You know what just happened to think?

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:47.540
 What?

00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:51.640
 Wouldn't it be easier for you to just start going to Nancy Adams?

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:53.640
 Oh, well, hi Mrs. Prayman.

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:54.740
 Hello, Homer.

00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:55.840
 Would you come here?

00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:57.440
 Thank you.

00:12:57.440 --> 00:12:59.740
 You suppose I could speak to Gladys, sir, I'm gonna...

00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:01.140
 No, I don't know.

00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:04.040
 You're a pretty good friend of Henry Ausridge, aren't you?

00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:04.940
 Wait.

00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:06.240
 Where a queen is?

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:07.740
 Hmm.

00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:10.860
 Well, I ask you, but I don't know if you're come down.

00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:13.660
 Oh, by the way, Homer, you aren't by any chance

00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:15.020
 through with that newspaper, are you?

00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:17.220
 For this, now, if you're still reading it,

00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:18.060
 then never mind.

00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:19.140
 You'd like to have it?

00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:20.660
 Only if you're sure that you should.

00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:22.620
 Oh, yes, ma'am, here you are.

00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:23.540
 Thank you.

00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:24.380
 I'll call about it.

00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:26.580
 Oh, that is a necessary, you know.

00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:27.460
 It is, no, ma'am.

00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:28.700
 I'll just be running along.

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:30.020
 Goodbye, Homer.

00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:31.700
 And thanks again to the paper.

00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:33.340
 You're entirely welcome.

00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:36.540
 And I hope you and I'm glad I've seen Joy reading it.

00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:38.840
 Oh, I didn't want it to read.

00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:39.640
 You didn't?

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:40.340
 No.

00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:43.240
 I guess he did something to wrap my plate of healing, then.

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:47.040
 Well, well, the guys, but Mrs. Turner,

00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:49.540
 that person was in cleanly to Father I.

 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:59.940
 Not me.

00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:01.140
 Wait a second, Miss Robert.

00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:02.940
 Let me close this door.

00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:03.940
 Yeah, that's better.

00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:05.840
 I'm glad you got that, Miss Robert.

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:07.840
 Frankly, I didn't get what you were driving it on the phone.

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:10.740
 Well, Miss Sanders and I think we had a bad connection.

00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:11.840
 No, we must have been.

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:15.140
 I kept thinking what you were saying was that we should feel that picture of the two vandals.

00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:17.140
 I didn't say that exactly.

00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:17.940
 Of course it didn't.

00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:21.640
 What I said was whether we oughtn't to stop and think about it first.

00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:22.640
 About what?

00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:27.340
 Well, the ceiling of the boy's parents, the possible effects on...

00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:28.940
 Well, that sort of thing.

00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:30.440
 Just thinking is a parent, you think?

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:32.740
 I'm as well as a time of thought that too, you know.

00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:33.840
 Yes, but you're not a mother.

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:35.340
 Huh?

00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:43.340
 I mean, what my wife, what I was going to suggest was that perhaps we ought to have these boys in and just give them talk to the government.

00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:46.340
 Oh, Mr. Holmes, you know what your trouble is? You're too soft-hearted.

00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:51.340
 I know. You know, but that would be kind of kids before, but I have. And you can't pant for them.

00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:52.340
 Well, my wife...

00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:54.340
 Then you'll see the shop we got of them.

00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:57.340
 Why, you just have to take one look at their faces to know that their potential's criminal.

00:14:57.340 --> 00:14:58.340
 Is that right?

00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:01.340
 And those are the kind of kids you're feeling sorry for?

00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:05.940
 Well, my wife, don't you see that publishing their pictures is going to teach them a lesson they'll never forget?

00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:09.680
 Well, I wonder if you'd mind calling my wife and explaining.

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:15.680
 No matter a fact, the more I think of it, the more I feel I ought to give that picture the widest possible script.

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:17.320
 Yes, sir.

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:18.480
 Excuse me.

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:19.960
 Oh, Joe, uh, see you?

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:21.460
 Yes, sir, sir.

00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:22.960
 Come in a minute.

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:27.360
 Uh, Joe, I'll just decide I'd like to move that picture of the two kids in the editorial page for the front page.

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:29.360
 To the front, but what about your editorial?

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:32.960
 Well, let's see if we can help suit that on the front page too.

00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:33.800
 - When's the name?

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:36.240
 - Jack, now what about that other picture I had penciled in?

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:37.240
 - Which one was that?

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:40.200
 - You know, that cab driver and his 13 daughters.

00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:42.520
 Oh, what was that story about again?

00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:43.840
 What was it about?

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:45.480
 Yeah, what did this cab guy to do?

00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:47.720
 Well, he had 13 daughters, isn't that enough?

00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:48.720
 (audience laughing)

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:50.280
 - Oh, we can run that some other time.

00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:52.680
 - Well, the only thing is this cab driver's already put

00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:55.160
 in his order for 40 copies of tonight's paper

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:56.840
 for his immediate family.

00:15:56.840 --> 00:16:00.840
 Oh, well, I was thinking in the back somewhere then, on the source page.

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:01.840
 On the source page.

00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:03.840
 [LAUGHTER]

00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:05.840
 Yeah, with the batting average.

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:06.840
 [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:09.840
 Because I think they story about the bandages.

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:10.840
 Oh, excuse me, Joe.

00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:11.840
 This is Mr. Aldridge.

00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:12.840
 Follow up with that letter.

00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:13.840
 Oh, yeah, please, to meet you.

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:14.840
 How do you do?

00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:15.840
 Yeah.

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:16.840
 Hey, you're going to tell us.

00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:19.840
 If you have to meet in that letter, wait a minute.

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:20.840
 Wait a minute.

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:21.840
 Go get the camera quick.

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:22.840
 Jack.

00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:24.840
 Mr. Aldridge, I think I've wheeled up a whole something.

00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:25.840
 Yes, what is it?

00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:27.000
 It's an idea that's going to--

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:27.680
 OK, Joe?

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:28.180
 Yeah.

00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:30.560
 I'll get this, Joe, and see if you don't think it's dynamite.

00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:31.520
 And it's over.

00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:33.080
 Just stand up against this wall here.

00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:33.580
 What?

00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:34.080
 What?

00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:35.960
 You'll say, well, let me have your hat.

00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:38.680
 Now, just face this way, see?

00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:40.560
 And hold your arms straight out.

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:42.160
 You're pointing, see?

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:43.600
 Look, sir.

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:44.840
 A little more.

00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:46.240
 More?

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:47.160
 All right, get that, Joe.

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:48.080
 Yeah.

00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:48.720
 Got it.

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:50.720
 But if you want my picture for it.

00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:53.160
 I'm going to run it right next to the picture of those two

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:55.660
 with you pointing straight up and face.

00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:58.660
 And the cuts in the cross the top will read, "Get this girl.

00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:01.660
 Dad, we must stop this. Dad."

00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:14.160
 I don't know Homer. I just don't know if that's such a hot idea.

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:18.160
 Why? Why? Did you ever hear of anybody refusing to look at a telegram?

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:20.160
 Sure, when they're sent collect.

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:21.160
 But we're told.

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:24.120
 - Hey, well, what have you got written down?

00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:27.600
 - C pays a this morning's time,

00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:30.400
 probably with potato peelings.

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:31.240
 (audience laughing)

00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:32.400
 - And how is it signed?

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:34.400
 - Oh, who's that?

00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:37.640
 - Just an earlier machine, and that's confusing.

00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:39.320
 - Why not just write anonymous?

00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:40.320
 - Okay.

00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:43.320
 - A-N-N-O.

00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:47.120
 You write it.

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:48.480
 (audience laughing)

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:53.020
 Okay. A-N-O.

00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:56.420
 I come to think of it as anonymous enough.

00:17:56.420 --> 00:17:57.420
 Yeah.

00:17:57.420 --> 00:17:59.420
 Well, do you want to send this?

00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:00.420
 I don't know.

00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:02.860
 Suppose they've already had their garbage collected.

00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:03.860
 You wish.

00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:04.860
 And they make up your mind.

00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:07.860
 Do you realize you practically ruined the whole Saturday from me?

00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:11.460
 Well, the my fault if every store in town has sold out their papers?

00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:15.060
 They didn't really look what's right in store of this paragraph office.

00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:16.060
 Well, I'll be darned.

00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:17.060
 Come on.

00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:19.360
 I didn't think of coming in here in the first place.

00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:20.360
 Sure.

00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:21.800
 They didn't have this morning's paper.

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:22.800
 Nobody will.

00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:23.800
 Of course.

00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:26.960
 And, Homer, I promise you, as soon as I get it over to Gladys's, we'll spend the rest

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:28.880
 of the day on whatever you want to do.

00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:31.640
 The rest of the watchday, it's almost time to suffer.

00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:32.640
 Yeah.

00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:33.640
 Well, let's ask right here.

00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:35.460
 Oh, mister, yes, any--a copy of today's "

00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:36.460
 Center for Times" place.

00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:39.040
 No, but we don't have one this, you know?

00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:42.760
 She will talk of the "Sendingville Prime" and be out of the "Sendingville Prime."

00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:45.200
 Oh, we've had quite a run of them today.

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:46.200
 Boy.

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:47.960
 What am I going to do Homer?

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:51.440
 You couldn't just learn off one more copy for us could you?

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:53.000
 Yes, I was very nuts.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.400
 But that's anyway you might do.

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:55.520
 You see that door there?

00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:56.080
 Yeah.

00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:57.560
 And that's the composing room.

00:18:57.560 --> 00:18:59.480
 When the person there might just have an extra copy.

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:02.080
 He's saying, at least I can do it.

00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:04.320
 What kind of a room do you say a wash hand?

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:05.400
 A composing room.

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:06.720
 Oh.

00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:08.480
 What are they doing there?

00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:09.840
 Well, Homer, don't you know anything?

00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:11.680
 Our composing room is--

00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:15.680
 what's the place where it's a composing room?

00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:17.680
 I guess we better knock first.

00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:18.880
 Knock? What floor?

00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:22.280
 So we don't disturb their train and fraud while they're compounding.

00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:24.280
 Homer, come on.

00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:30.280
 Here's a way of talking to this in polls with all its noise.

00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:31.880
 Do you think anybody we can ask?

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:32.880
 How about that, sir?

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:33.380
 Where?

00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:35.780
 When coming this way, carrying that sort of train.

00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:36.080
 Oh, yeah.

00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:37.880
 Mr. Can I ask you something?

00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:38.480
 Sorry, Sonny.

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:40.080
 The paper goes to press in the five minutes.

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:41.780
 Why don't you come around when they have one of those tours?

00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:42.080
 Oh, no.

00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:42.880
 You don't understand.

00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:45.480
 The man outside said I might be able to get an extra copy

00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:49.640
 this morning's paper in here. Oh, I don't know if that one or not here.

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:53.000
 Well, you hold this one and take a look at my desk. Sure. I'll be sure and hold it

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:59.760
 level, Bob. Yes, sir. Boy, look at this, Tom. Yeah. What is it? It looks like a

00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:03.800
 page from the paper. Isn't that right, Mr? Yeah, that's the front page. It's a nice

00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:08.800
 paper. Well, I tell my folks I was holding it. I was pretty sure I had a

00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:13.000
 paper somewhere isn't it, there. You know what, Bernie? Why? See that's just your

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000
 right in the center of the page.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.000
 Notice when the light hits it one way it's negative.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.000
 Yeah. And then it gets dripped a little like this.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.000
 And see the way it's going to look when it's finished.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.000
 That's right.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000
 These would be a picture of a couple of kids, doesn't it?

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.000
 Yeah.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000
 What are they doing?

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.000
 What's to me like they're painting a...

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000
 painting a...

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.000
 ...mover.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.000
 They need a painting, aren't they?

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000
 Maybe not, but it sure is.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000
 I can't quite see who it is.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000
 Oh boy.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.000
 Somebody in the house?

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000
 Quite like my father.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000
 What?

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.000
 Three.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000
 Can we go get the kill fly?

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.000
 Come and grab it!

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.000
 Get out!

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.000
 Oh boy.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000
 Some are going loose.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000
 What'd you do?

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000
 Mr. I'm afraid we'd go.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:04.000
 Oh no.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:05.000
 Look at my size.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.000
 Look at my size.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.000
 Mr. Ed's kicking on what I ought to do to you, kid.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.280
 You know what I want to do to you kids.

00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:10.280
 No, he's Mr. Lettingly.

00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:11.880
 He's put the paper to bed in just a few minutes.

00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:13.040
 Now what am I going to do?

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:14.040
 Say goodnight.

00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:16.040
 [LAUGHTER]

00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:19.320
 Oh, Mr. Will be glad to help you out.

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:20.240
 Oh, you will.

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:23.120
 I'm sure we send you all to be able to get back together

00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:24.680
 before the paper wakes up.

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:27.680
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:35.080
 I heard someone on the porch.

00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:35.780
 You do?

00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:36.760
 It must be the paper, boy.

00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:37.480
 Excuse me.

00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:39.480
 I'm like that's a cager up.

00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:41.880
 I'll take that, honey.

00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:45.080
 Not funny father. It's me.

00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:46.480
 Oh, oh, hello, Henry.

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:47.680
 Good evening, Father.

00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:49.880
 You've been till now.

00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:50.880
 Why?

00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:54.080
 Homer and I stopped to help a man pick up.

00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:55.680
 Some things.

00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:57.480
 Then it gets you this way.

00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:01.680
 Well, there were quite a few of these things.

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:02.680
 You don't see it.

00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:04.880
 We had some exciting news for you.

00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:05.880
 You'll follow this picture.

00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:10.600
 going to be on the front page of tonight's paper. Yeah, I know. I mean, how do you know?

00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:19.920
 Why you? Well, I haven't been having this paper office and I thought you did. Is it a good

00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:28.480
 picture of your father? Well, was he shy straight? I don't know how straight it is anymore. I

00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:32.180
 Well, I only got a quick glance, mother.

00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:35.480
 Oh, well, isn't it exciting, Henry?

00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:37.480
 Yeah.

00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:41.580
 Well, I must say you don't sound very enthusiastic.

00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:42.280
 I don't?

00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:45.080
 Well, just because I don't sound it, don't think I am.

00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:46.280
 I mean, I'm not.

00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:48.480
 I mean, Henry, is anything wrong?

00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:49.080
 Why, you know--

00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:49.780
 Wait a second.

00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:51.080
 I think I hear the paper boy now.

00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:52.080
 The father before you go out there,

00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:54.380
 I feel there's something I want to tell.

00:22:54.380 --> 00:22:55.880
 And all right, just that they get the paper.

00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:57.280
 You've got to wait it.

00:22:57.280 --> 00:22:58.600
 What I want to tell you about.

00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:02.000
 You know that picture they took of you.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:02.720
 Yes.

00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:06.240
 Well, I think it's only fair for you to know that.

00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:09.240
 The two boys you're pointing at.

00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:11.600
 A home friend made.

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:13.120
 What?

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:14.120
 Sam old.

00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:15.480
 But how?

00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:16.920
 What were you?

00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:18.560
 Good heaven.

00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:20.240
 Hi, everybody.

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:23.280
 Something wrong.

00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:26.280
 I guess it is wrong.

00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:31.280
 Oh, I just told my father about the paper.

00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:34.280
 Oh, I've got a copy of her right here. Would anyone like to see it?

00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:38.280
 Warren, you just couldn't wait to bring the bad news, could you?

00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:41.280
 Well, Henry, that's the point. We're not on the front page.

00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:42.280
 We're not?

00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:43.280
 You mean I'm not either?

00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:44.280
 Oh, you are, you sure, Aldi?

00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:45.280
 Let me see that, please.

00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:46.280
 Sure.

00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:47.280
 Let me look too Sam.

00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:49.280
 Oh, heaven's taste.

00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:52.280
 Then what's that you're pointing at?

00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:55.280
 It's a taxi driver and it's safety and order.

00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:58.280
 [ Laughter ]

00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:01.280
 What are you supposed to be saying?

00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:03.280
 We must stop this.

00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:06.280
 You're a genuine boy.

00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:15.280
