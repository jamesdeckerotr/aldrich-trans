00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 [Music]

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 And now for the all-great family.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 The actions of a teenage boy are above the closing of the thunderstorm.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
 They never see as long as he has an ounce of energy to draw.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
 And with Henry Olvitch, there are usually a few extra ounces in reserve.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
 It is Saturday morning and the scene opens on Homer Brown's front for end.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.800
 Oh my, look at it this way, it's January.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.600
 Stand back, Harry, you're crying.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.400
 And what better month is there to go fishing in than January?

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.000
 Can we, can't you see, I'm busy watching the store and window?

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 What's the thing about home, are you cut a hole in the ice tree?

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.600
 And you sit there and my nights lost the air.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.000
 Oh, it's not too frosty.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 Just healthy.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.800
 Harry, why should I go sitting around in the air

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.000
 when I can watch the store and window from my father?

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.600
 Homer, do you feel well?

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.600
 Yeah, well you step aside.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:04.600
 Boy, after all my father's done for me, it's only a second due.

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.600
 But when we're big of a side sister, let's see him flex your tongue.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.600
 They've been growing ever since summer.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.600
 There's no use after me, Henry.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.600
 When my father wants me to do something, boy, I certainly wouldn't let him down.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.600
 What?

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.600
 Come on, you sure you feel well?

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.000
 Well, I think he's right in the living room there.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.300
 Oh, yes, sure.

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.480
 Listen, look at every word we say.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.280
 Thank you, see, you got the window open.

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.080
 I don't see him, I'm there.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.080
 My mother finally put a foot down on these windows.

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.920
 What?

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.360
 I'm walking outside, and my father's walking inside.

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.120
 Only Kayleigh will listen.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.200
 Oh, Murr, what are you whispering about?

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.360
 Oh, Father, can we just--

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.600
 Oh, you were whispering?

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:48.560
 [LAUGHTER]

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.320
 How are you giving us your bra?

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.320
 Henry, would you mind not confusing, Homer?

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.820
 He could only think of one thing at a time.

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.120
 Right now, he's supposed to be on the window.

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.220
 - Well, Father, can you hear me?

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:00.880
 We can't sound his way home.

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:01.720
 - I was?

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:02.720
 - Goodbye, Henry.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.660
 If you were that father, Homer.

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:08.240
 - Listen, Homer, suppose I go in

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.760
 and have a word with your father.

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:10.600
 - What about?

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.100
 - You know, when the field was better,

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.280
 then you're licked before you start.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.440
 And he's putting your finger in the window, son.

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:19.720
 - Well, it's worth a try.

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:20.720
 I knew what.

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:21.720
 Watch it step in.

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:22.720
 He's pretty rigid.

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.720
 They'll call me if anything here happens.

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.720
 Oh, Mr. Brown, are you watching the window?

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:28.720
 Of course I am.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.720
 And now do you think she is?

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.720
 I just want to get the perspective from back here before I saw it.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.720
 Oh, hand me that darn sponge.

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.720
 Mr. Brown, Mr. Brown, you're quite a fisherman aren't you?

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:42.720
 What then?

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:48.720
 Oh, I mean, fishing is good and spring sure, but no you agree there's no month like January.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:49.560
 For fishing?

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:50.400
 Sure.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.060
 Don't you agree that that's when the fish are biggus?

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.880
 Yeah?

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.400
 Well, they've had some solar to put on waste.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.880
 [LAUGHTER]

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:58.680
 Yes.

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.200
 And I will look down at that way.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:00.720
 Sure.

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.840
 I'll bet if you went down to Fletcher's pond

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.160
 and chopped a hole in the ice, you could catch some whopper.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.900
 Yes.

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:07.280
 I bet you.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.960
 What is that?

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.400
 You mean you agree with me, Mr. Brown?

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.680
 That a person should take advantage of a thing like that?

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:12.640
 I certainly do.

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:13.880
 Oh, boy.

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:14.400
 Thanks.

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.900
 Come here.

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:15.400
 Come here.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.400
 Come here.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.200
 What is that?

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.000
 I fixed it over your father and grieze that this is a perfect day for fiction.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000
 He does.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.800
 Boy, father, you mean they don't have to watch the outside of the windows?

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.000
 Of course you do.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 Rock, why?

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.800
 And the inside too.

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.000
 Listen, Haley, I thought you said.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.600
 And get busy right away.

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.000
 I have to speak to your mother.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.240
 Just think, Father, in January.

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.600
 Henry, I don't want to speak to you again about your seat.

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.240
 Why don't you run along and let me finish?

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:54.200
 My seat, Father.

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.760
 Are you afraid they'll get frosted, then?

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.200
 I'm afraid they'll get chopped off.

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.040
 Oh, sure. I'll stand back.

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.680
 Thank you.

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.160
 Why, look at that ice slide.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.760
 And if you could find time to demo,

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:06.880
 let's talk more regularly.

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.320
 The other way you're supposed to.

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:09.720
 The ice wouldn't form like this.

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.080
 I realize that, Father.

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.360
 And I'll certainly see to it that I do it,

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:14.200
 as you're there.

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.240
 Good.

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:18.520
 And the sitting of my father had all about it.

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:19.520
 How about what?

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:20.440
 Going fishing.

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:21.360
 I'm sorry, anybody.

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:22.960
 I can't find the time today.

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.840
 Couldn't you cap the ice the mother's time?

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.040
 Not very well.

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.440
 Well, we're calling it Henry.

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.400
 I can't get out of it.

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.560
 Your mother is keeping an eye on me.

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:32.680
 She is?

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.680
 Don't look now, but she's right there in the living room,

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:35.280
 when--

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:36.320
 Oh.

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.280
 Hello, mother.

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.120
 Henry, I hope you aren't growing up your father.

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.720
 Now, whether I'm helping him.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:43.560
 You are.

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:44.520
 So are now.

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.380
 I'm stopping out of it.

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:47.880
 There.

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.580
 There.

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:51.220
 You want to go to the phone.

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:52.720
 Oh, thank you.

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:53.320
 Get in there.

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:54.060
 See, father.

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.020
 What are you doing with it?

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:56.320
 You can shop with it.

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.520
 Oh, here he comes down at the bone.

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:00.720
 Oh, is it well, Bob?

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:01.420
 Yes, I don't know.

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:04.120
 I told you a busy, but he said this is very important.

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.420
 Hello.

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:06.520
 Hello, Sam.

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.120
 So why are the day you tied up saying?

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.220
 Well, I'm doing a little cleaning up outside.

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.520
 Oh, then he's telling you to get out of him.

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.520
 Why, as a matter of fact, what's on your mind?

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.520
 Sam, what do you say we go fish?

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:19.520
 A dead?

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.520
 Well, there's no better months to go fishing with you than anywhere.

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:23.520
 But, well...

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:28.520
 You know you're stuck in the hole in the ice, it's been around in the ice, off the air...

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.520
 What made you think of that, Will?

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:33.520
 I heard somebody talking about it. Come on, Sam, what do you think?

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:38.520
 Well, it's a temptation, I'll admit. The only thing is, I have this work I should do.

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:39.520
 Oh, do it tomorrow.

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.520
 When you see Alice want a

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.080
 Met me. I don't have to do it

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:52.320
 Did it work?

00:05:52.320 --> 00:06:02.760
 Well, I'll meet you there in 15 minutes

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.400
 Mary, who pays the bills around here?

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:12.400
 What's up?

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.400
 That is, I think I'll go out and get some some bars.

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:26.400
 I'm at all anyway.

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:29.400
 Hi, Mary.

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:30.400
 Is that you, Homer?

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:32.400
 Oh, come here, let's go. Let's go.

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:33.400
 Where?

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:34.400
 See which way you're through.

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:35.400
 This way.

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:36.400
 This way.

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.400
 This is a fine time for you to decide that.

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:42.400
 Just when I had to chop up the darn sidewalk for my father.

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.400
 Where's your father hiding?

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:48.400
 He didn't hide in any place. He would call the way on a very important conference.

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:51.400
 He was. And besides, I thought you had to stay home and wash windows.

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:52.400
 I don't know.

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:53.400
 I don't know.

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:57.400
 I saw him in awesome place. So I saw him in the sun even less.

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:59.400
 Don't hit a wall anyway.

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:01.400
 Oh, you really can't go.

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:04.400
 Well, but you know how long it's taken me to chop this little bit of ice.

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:05.400
 So long.

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:08.400
 Well, it's going to take me a whole day to finish it.

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:14.400
 If you thought I'd shoveled his walk once in a while, you wouldn't have all of his eyes.

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:20.400
 Oh, good words. What are you eating? A piece of ice, it just flew in.

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:21.400
 (audience laughing)

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:23.400
 Listen, Homer.

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:29.400
 Listen, if you think you can stand around all day eating ice when I'm breaking my darn back,

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:30.400
 what are you getting at, Henry?

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:32.400
 The least you could do is help me.

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:34.400
 But why should we both break our back?

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:36.400
 [Laughter]

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:38.400
 Oh, what?

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:40.400
 Maybe we can still go fishing.

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:42.400
 Have you thought of hot water?

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:43.400
 Hot water? Sure.

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:45.400
 You have a home, haven't you?

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:46.400
 What?

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:47.400
 Sure, it's fine.

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:49.400
 You didn't emphasize the no-turn.

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:52.400
 Oh, gee, what are we standing on and on for?

00:07:52.400 --> 00:08:00.400
 [Music]

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:02.660
 (cheering)

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:08.240
 - Hey, deal that phrase, Will.

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:09.740
 - Yes, sir.

00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:12.240
 - It really keeps you on your toes, doesn't it?

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:13.740
 - Since then, how are you, toes?

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:15.180
 - Oh, they're fine, Sam.

00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:17.480
 It's gone to my keep wiggling them.

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:19.780
 - Family to saw again, let's see if I can get this whole

00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:20.620
 a little bigger.

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:22.120
 You know, you couldn't catch a middle

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:23.780
 through a whole the size of that.

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:25.520
 - The trouble is getting you started, Will.

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:27.920
 - Once I get the saw down in there, we'll be fine.

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:29.360
 - Say, I got an idea.

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:31.360
 You got a pen knife on you?

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:32.360
 Yeah, certainly.

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:33.360
 Here.

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:37.360
 Now if I can just get a little more ice off, I think we can get the floor in there.

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:38.360
 Good idea.

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:41.360
 Yeah, that's getting it, Sam.

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:44.360
 You mind if I run around the bit by you doing that?

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:46.360
 You're not cold, I is.

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:47.360
 Of course not.

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:49.360
 Just a little sip.

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:50.360
 I mean, I will do.

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:53.360
 Alright, clap your arms, Sam.

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:56.360
 Hey, what's that, it's real?

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:59.360
 I'm paying the dollars.

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:02.360
 Say, Sam, yes sir.

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:06.360
 Sam, did you attack any sentimental value to that ten night?

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:08.360
 Well, you're getting off the truth.

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:10.360
 Well, now don't worry, I'll get it back out.

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:14.360
 I have homework come out in the summer and dive for it.

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:16.360
 That's my thing.

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:19.360
 Now wait a minute, hand me my line. What for?

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:23.360
 Well, it's got a good big hook on it. I think I can stick around and hook to penknife.

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:24.360
 I doubt it, but here.

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:29.460
 But here look you go on clapping Sam. I'll drop this in and then give it a try

00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:33.160
 Feel anything now

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:36.160
 Let's just forget it

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:38.660
 Hey, will get off the ice

00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:43.760
 I gotta finish look at that shadow under the eye

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:47.960
 Why do I do hand it?

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:56.560
 Don't just stand there, throw the whole figure!

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:59.560
 I can't, but I will have to cut the line.

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:02.560
 Don't do something, Sam! Don't do something!

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:18.560
 Homework, homework, stop shivering and seeing still.

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:20.560
 Listen here, I'm taking easy.

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:22.560
 You're rubbing the back off me.

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:24.560
 You're circulating again, darling.

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:26.560
 Can't you talk it to you?

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:28.560
 That one feels like sandpaper.

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:31.560
 When I go to the women's closet and get some more towels.

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:33.560
 Is there a link to a loan in your room?

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:34.560
 Look at the sheet on.

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:36.560
 Well, anyway, I'll find you some clothes.

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:40.560
 And all I can say is, the next time you hold the sidewalk,

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:42.560
 I hope you have a little more control.

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:45.560
 Anyways, Homer, it was your own fault.

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:47.560
 Mine's fault, mine's fault.

00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:48.560
 You were.

00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:52.560
 Then you come right out and say, "Turn the hose over here, Henry!"

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:55.560
 You are here. I didn't say, "Turn the hose on me!"

00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:57.560
 And then you jump right in one way.

00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:58.560
 [laughter]

00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:02.560
 The whole boy knows how I feel about what his car is now.

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:04.560
 It's a nice waterfall, James.

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:07.560
 Well, you know what I was just thinking for?

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:10.560
 See, if it's no fun-tapping life on your own sidewalk,

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:13.560
 think I'm a stupor, it's one of the atoms, what your car is.

00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:14.560
 Sure.

00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:20.360
 See you stand around and wake you back and sing some things come along and play your nice water.

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:24.560
 All of these cools and your mix brings you to the line.

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:25.060
 Sure.

00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:28.760
 And right here at home we've got a fireplace and lots of wood.

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:29.760
 So long.

00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:34.760
 Then we can sit in front of the fire with a comic book and a skyscraper sandwich.

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:35.360
 Sure.

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:35.860
 Sure.

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:38.360
 Some of them somewhere.

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:42.760
 I'm going to be with...

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:44.760
 I'm going to get a family.

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:46.760
 I'm going to have to...

00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:48.760
 I'm going to get a tattoo here.

00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:49.760
 Extensive?

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:51.760
 I thought I saw a milli-line.

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:52.760
 What do you want?

00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:54.760
 Mother wants to see who's out on the living room.

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:55.760
 He does? What's more?

00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:57.760
 I don't know. But you better come out down.

00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:59.760
 I can't even give me a...

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:01.760
 Mother!

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:04.760
 No, no, no, no. I don't think I've ever been so curious in my life.

00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:05.760
 Hey, mother.

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:06.760
 Let's go out the window here.

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:08.760
 Look at the condition of our truck walk.

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:11.360
 Why, good, this is a solid piece of art!

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:14.360
 The person just missed a bell right on his mailbag.

 If your father's policy is safe,

00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:22.160
 then you have all that ice cleaned off today.

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:24.160
 Brother, this is after a gift of power.

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:25.160
 I'll give you my word.

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:26.760
 Wait, wait, please, for good hold on.

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:28.360
 We're going out? You are, dear.

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:30.560
 I want you to go straight out to take this pond

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:32.160
 and, Mother, I've changed my mind.

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:33.160
 What about that?

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:35.160
 I don't want to go to breakfast time anymore.

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:37.560
 Well, I want you to, and you're the ten-year-old father

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:39.560
 to come home immediately.

00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:41.560
 Father, the twickers are?

00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:42.560
 Yes, dear.

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:43.560
 Mrs. Brown and I are positive.

00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:44.560
 That's where they went.

 He's having his cocks on, sir?

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:47.560
 My conference.

00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:48.560
 Oh, he is.

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:49.560
 He's standing there.

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:50.560
 He's out there with Mr. Brown.

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:51.560
 This is.

00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:52.560
 He is.

 We're all these dogs.

 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:12:57.560 --> 00:13:05.560
 Anybody home?

00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:06.560
 Hey.

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:08.560
 Hey! Anybody home?

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:10.760
 What is the fire, Mr. S?

00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:13.760
 Oh, I'm sorry to be so noisy, but this isn't an emergency.

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:15.560
 - If you're not an act. - I sure.

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:16.960
 You want to come in? No, I can't.

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:18.560
 I have to get back down to flesh and pine.

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:19.360
 What's the trouble?

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:21.060
 My friend and I went down there fishing,

00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:22.960
 see, and all of a sudden there was this big

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:24.160
 that was splashing around.

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:26.060
 - Under that? - My friend is hanging on

00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:27.960
 for dear life, and the hole isn't taking off

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:28.960
 the porting out.

00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:29.960
 He's all a thing.

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:31.460
 And man, is he struggling.

00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:33.660
 If we don't get him out fast, we're gonna lose him.

00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:36.160
 Now look, you find an act around the side on the ground.

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:37.500
 Oh, fine. Thanks a lot.

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:40.000
 You get right down there and don't worry.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.000
 Father, it'll be part of my stupid surprise.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.040
 Get you down to the pond right away.

00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:48.600
 Where are my boosters back?

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:52.000
 Quick, you better get me a rope.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000

 with the eye that preceded only in selling both their father's on the idea

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:13.900
 so far the men are having difficulty landing their face and the boys have been sent out

00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:16.740
 to find the scene opens at such a spot.

 I'm treating the Jack.

00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:22.980
 Now listen, ma'am, I got up to that farmhouse and back as quick as I could.

00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:24.100
 Well, at least you've been moving.

00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:26.220
 Here, you hold the pick right and that needs to come.

00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:27.100
 Let's do space.

00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:29.820
 Oh boy, it's good to sit down.

00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:31.460
 I get to sit down the way, Will.

00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:32.820

 Well, it's a lady of some kind.

00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:39.220
 Have we seen her?

 Oh, ma'am.

 Look, Sam, it's a lady of some kind.

 I'm not coming up at the Lord's end of the car.

 We've been looking all over and we haven't been able to find anything.

00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:55.220
 Well, say, we've been here for over an hour.

00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:57.220
 We haven't seen anybody around here.

00:14:57.220 --> 00:14:59.220
 I'm seven. I have the toxins in these glands.

 Look, I'm sure it's expected.

00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:01.220
 A car in the sense that I knew.

00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:02.220
 Why, I thought it was more.

00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:04.220
 You don't think it's going through up its purchase tree?

 We have time. Come on, Will. On your feet.

 What's Sam? What about our sick?

00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:15.220
 We can't worry about that now.

00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:18.220

00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:44.220
 It's a mystery.

00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:46.220
 You don't find our father here.

 That's fine, Ed.

00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:48.220
 It's a little going home.

 Oh, my baby, there are lots.

00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:50.220
 Oh, Homer.

00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:52.220
 Homer, where are you?

00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:53.220
 I'm from here.

00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:54.220
 I'm from here.

00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:56.220
 Oh, here I'll help you out.

00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:57.220

 Hey, wait.

00:15:58.220 --> 00:15:59.220
 You know what I think?

00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:01.220
 I think there are lots.

00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:03.620
 How could we be if this is what your time is?

 The human, if it's just over a thing.

00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:06.320
 What?

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:08.220
 And I'm the thing to do, I'm like this.

00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:08.820
 Time.

00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:09.820
 Summer.

00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:13.020
 Summer, this isn't any basis, a piece of strength.

00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:15.620
 Now listen, I'm not that mean.

00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:16.820
 But look, Homer.

00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:18.820
 Look, it's trying to achieve.

00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:20.620
 It is an assembling.

00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:23.820
 Seriously, it's a white one, so I follow it along.

00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:25.820
 Except it is re-ggling.

00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:27.420
 She lives here right.

00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:29.820
 What do I think, Summer, is snowing.

00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:30.820
 What is it?

00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:32.320
 You go down to a hole in the ice.

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:33.320
 Bring me to a hole.

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:33.820
 What?

00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:35.520
 There's a structure in the end of it.

00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:36.520
 It's great to see it.

00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:38.120
 Well, all these do on.

00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:38.820
 Pull it out.

00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:39.820
 Pull it out.

00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:42.320
 The hole is in the middle.

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:44.320
 And if he was hooked up here, I'd let it snow.

00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:44.820
 Why?

00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:47.320
 And then, I'd say, it's a miracle.

00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:48.120
 You're that a hole.

00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:49.320
 Well, I could dream.

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:50.820
 Bring me to the good top.

00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:51.820
 I'm going to see the hole.

00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:54.120
 Get back to the house before we wake up.

 You walk, you're always, Sam, and I walk fast.

00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:15.120
 I think that's where it's at. It's not flowing in what's past.

00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:18.120
 Yes, and I walk into all the trees I'm going to walk into.

00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:21.120
 You're still bumping into trees, walking backwards.

00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:24.120
 I can stand it better that way.

00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:26.120
 Anyway, here's like a spot.

00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:30.120
 Boy, I'd like to get my hand from a guy who started us on this wild goose day.

00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:32.120
 Well, we'd be pretty well had to go.

00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:35.120
 Well, suppose somebody really had fallen through the ice.

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:36.120
 We had to go, sure.

00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:39.120
 I wouldn't have minded going up there and taking a quick look around.

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:43.120
 Now, I'm just right around here.

 Do you remember what thing we tried out to find you?

00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:57.600
 Oh look at that. Look at that. No all over the place. Oh well. Even if we do find the tree.

00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:01.920
 How are we gonna find the king? Well if we can only keep our sense of humor we'll be all right.

 No. Oh the ice can't be forgotten yet. Oh we'll never find it in this snow Sam.

 Oh, that's fun. I got something much better.

00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:07.100
 Who and I was feeding the fix to you and who are you?

00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:09.100
 What a game for a miracle.

00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:12.100
 Oh, thanks. Guess what we found inside it, Mother?

00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:13.100
 What, dear?

00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:15.100
 It's something I've always wanted, a pen knife.

00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:17.100
 What's done?

00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:24.100
