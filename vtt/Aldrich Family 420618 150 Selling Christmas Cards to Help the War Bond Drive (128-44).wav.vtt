00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
 Henry, Henry Oldridge, coming mother.

 [Applause]

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
 Postum presents the Ulrich family, written by Clifford Goldsmith and starring Ezra Stone.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
 The entertainment for all the family brought to you by Postam,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 attempting wholesome drink for all the family.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 Postam.

 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:54.000
 Before we join the Aldrich family for our regular visit,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 I'd like to present briefly the case of the vanished man.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.880
 Mom, Mom, is there around anywhere now?

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.440
 He just went upstairs, Billy.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.640
 And look, if you're aiming to ask your father

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.960
 for that fishing rod now, don't.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.380
 He's got indigestion again, and he's so grouchy,

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.000
 I wouldn't even ask him for the time.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.880
 Now, there's a case that I'd say calls

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.520
 for immediate investigation,

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.800
 where nobody suffers repeatedly from indigestion

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.120
 without good cause.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.720
 And in many cases, the trouble may be coffee.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.640
 For while lots of people can drink coffee

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.120
 without harmful effect, many others frequently

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:26.520
 suffer discomfort.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.860
 If you think coffee disagrees with you, start drinking post-em instead.

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.960
 There's nothing at all in post-em that can possibly upset you.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.520
 And it's such a delicious, different drink you won't mind giving up coffee in the least.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.400
 So give post-em a fair trial.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.560
 It may be that even after two short weeks, you'll find yourself no longer troubled

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.720
 with indigestion thanks to switching to post-em.

00:01:47.720 --> 00:02:04.200
 [Music]

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.560
 Henrod Scofield, Tom Sawyer, Huck Finn.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.200
 They're more than just characters in books for the things they say and do,

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.760
 or the things real boys say and do.

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.360
 And Henry Aldrich is another of these typical American youngsters.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.060
 A boy from your own block, perhaps from your own home.

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.760
 Now our scene opens at the Aldrich telephone.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.960
 Hello, operator. I want Elm 629.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.360
 Elm 629.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.760
 Henry, tell them exactly what you think of them.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.960
 She was, they must have arrived by now.

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:33.960
 Number, please.

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.760
 Operator, I just gave it to you.

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.360
 Elm 629.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.060
 Henry!

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:39.060
 Yes, father?

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.460
 Are you through with that telephone?

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.860
 No, sir. I'm still trying to get my number.

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.380
 Allow Santaville Station.

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:50.220
 This is Henry Yoldridge. I sent away for a package about ten days ago, and I wonder whether it's come yet.

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.020
 A package?

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:52.920
 Yes, there are some Christmas cards.

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.460
 Did you say Christmas cards?

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:55.340
 Yes, sir.

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.500
 Well, if you checked them that long ago, they've probably been thrown out by now.

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.940
 What's that? Oh, I didn't check them. I'm still waiting for them.

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:02.600
 How's that?

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.200
 They're samples for next Christmas.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.420
 Homer Brown and I are going to sell them from house to house only. They're not here yet, and we're worried.

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.100
 - Given the dues, Henry. - Well, you're talking with the ticket office.

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.340
 Hold the line now. Connect you with the express department.

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:15.900
 Well, that's what I want to talk to.

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.660
 - Gee whiz. - What does he say, Henry?

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.540
 He's switching me. He thinks they may have been thrown out.

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.580
 Thrown out? What does he think we're going to show people for samples?

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.780
 Hello. Sentable express office.

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.620
 Hello. Do you have any Christmas cards there?

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.700
 What's that? What did you want?

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.260
 This is Henry Aldrich.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:33.980
 Henry Aldrich isn't here.

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.820
 [LAUGHTER]

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.260
 I know it. He's here.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
 Who is he want to speak to me Henry?

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.260
 Let go of the receiver Homer, you're twisting me.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.260
 Hello, hello, did you want the Centible Express office?

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.260
 Yes, have Henry you older than Christmas cards come?

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
 Watch that, will you speak a little louder please?

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.260
 Where are my Christmas cards?

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:58.260
 You know it's a funny thing but it sounds as though you keep saying Christmas cards.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
 I am, they were sent by Express!

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.260
 Well this is a fine time to be calling us, you should have reported it last January.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
 But I just ordered them in May.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.820
 May? Well, why don't you come down here sometime and fill out a tracy?

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:13.060
 Well, jeez, don't you realize there's a war bond drive on?

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.260
 Watch that. We don't get those samples. We can't get any orders to buy bonds with.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.460
 I'm sorry, but you'll have to come down.

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:22.860
 But wait, I... Hello? Hello?

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.860
 That's telling him where to get off Henry.

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.360
 Imagine.

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.060
 Henry!

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.060
 Yes, Father?

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.860
 Are you through?

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.860
 Yes, or for a second?

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.460
 Could we ask you something?

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:34.760
 Not until I put in my call.

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:35.760
 But it's important.

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:36.600
 What's it about?

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.400
 Why, uh, Christmas, Mr. Aldrich.

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.120
 Will you boys please get away from this phone?

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.960
 Yes, Father.

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.760
 Will you let us know as soon as you can discuss it, Mr. Aldrich?

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:45.920
 Yes, Alice.

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:47.320
 I'm going to phone Mr. Thomas.

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:48.680
 What are you going to say to him, Sam?

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.000
 I'm going to ask him quite frankly

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.040
 why he can't attend a few more committee meetings.

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:54.240
 You aren't going to say anything you'll be sorry for, are you?

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.400
 I'm not going to be one bit sorry.

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.800
 Here we are, ready to start a big bonclove drive.

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:59.720
 Everybody's for it.

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.120
 They think it's a fine thing.

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.240
 But a few in this town aren't doing anything about it.

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:04.400
 Isn't Mr. Howard healthy?

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:09.400
 He is not. There's another example. We have a chance to get some war-bond show cards at cost.

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:14.400
 And Mr. Howard, the treasurer of the committee can't show enough interest to make up his mind as to how many show cards we need.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.400
 Well, dear, if I were you, I'd resign from the committee.

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:17.400
 And call off the war?

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.400
 Well, you can't fight it. Single-handed.

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:20.400
 Father!

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.400
 Yes! Alice, where's the phone book?

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:23.400
 It's right there on the stand.

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.400
 I know you've got a lot on your mind, Father, but would it be all right if I should ask you just one thing?

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.400
 What about Christmas, remember?

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:31.400
 Christmas?

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.400
 Yes, sir. Have you bought your cards yet?

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.880
 Henry, will you please step out of my life while I look up this number?

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:38.440
 Hello operator, I want Elm 232.

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:39.400
 No, wait a minute.

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.640
 I just thought I'd ask my mother whether I can go down to the express office.

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:44.080
 Father, where are you going?

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:46.040
 Down to the office and put on a call.

00:05:46.040 --> 00:06:00.160
 Now then, tell me once more why you came down here to the express office.

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.840
 Well, I'm Henry Aldrich and my friend and I

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.460
 you're going to sell Christmas cards, see?

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.300
 Say that again, please. You're doing what?

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:11.300
 We're selling Christmas cards for next Christmas.

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:12.800
 Oh, well, I wouldn't be interested.

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:13.780
 But wait.

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:14.740
 [LAUGHTER]

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:16.480
 You told us to come down here.

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:18.260
 Here's the whole thing.

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.740
 We sent away for some samples, see?

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:23.820
 We're going to take orders, but you don't have to put any money

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:26.940
 down until September 1st, and we'd like to know where they are.

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:28.060
 Is that clear?

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:28.780
 Yes.

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:29.980
 Where, what are--

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:31.300
 --our Christmas cards.

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:33.380
 Henry, maybe I better explain it to him.

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:35.100
 No, Homer, you'll only confuse him.

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:37.660
 All I know is there's nothing like that here.

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:39.060
 What are we going to do?

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:42.340
 Here it is June and Christmas is getting closer every month.

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:43.300
 I'll say.

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:46.700
 She was going to use all the profits to join the War Barn Club.

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:47.900
 You are?

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:50.620
 Well, I'll take a good look, but I'm pretty sure that if there

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:53.900
 were any Christmas cards in this office, I'd know about it.

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:56.300
 Could one of you boys help me with this package, please?

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:56.940
 Yeah, sure.

00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:58.020
 Hello, Mrs. Howard.

00:06:58.020 --> 00:06:58.980
 Hello, Henry.

00:06:58.980 --> 00:06:59.940
 Oh, thank you so much.

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:01.200
 That's all right.

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:03.940
 This is heavy, isn't it?

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:04.580
 Thank you.

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:06.180
 I always said you were a gentleman.

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:08.660
 Well, thank you, Mrs. Howard.

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:12.660
 Would you-- would you be interested in some samples

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:16.980
 of Christmas cards provided we can find them?

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:18.180
 That's very funny.

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:18.980
 What is?

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:20.420
 No, really, Mrs. Howard.

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:21.940
 We're selling them for bonds.

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:22.420
 For what?

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:24.300
 Don't you know war bonds.

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:26.380
 We're going to give 10% of our income.

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:28.740
 Wouldn't you like to have us come over as soon as our samples

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:29.780
 come and take an order?

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:34.420
 You want me to sit down on a hot day like this and pick out my Christmas cards for next winter?

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:35.420
 Why not?

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:38.120
 And Mrs. Howard, I guess we haven't made ourselves clear.

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:40.820
 What they do is print your name on each card.

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:42.320
 That's what takes the time.

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:43.160
 Sure.

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:45.020
 Especially if they print it in Old English.

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:46.900
 You mean it takes six months?

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:50.100
 Well, if you want it done right it does.

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:53.780
 And Mrs. Howard, if you put it off, the first thing you know,

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:57.780
 snow will be falling and the Christmas bells will be ringing.

00:07:57.780 --> 00:07:59.900
 - Oh, my goodness, what's that? - What's what?

00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:01.780
 - Oh, just a freight train. - Oh.

00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:04.780
 Couldn't we interest you, Mrs. Howard?

00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:06.020
 (audience laughing)

00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:08.060
 Just to sort of help our drive?

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:09.460
 Well, do you have any playing cards

00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:11.700
 that aren't too fancy with just Merry Christmas on them?

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:12.820
 Oh, yes.

00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:14.260
 I'm pretty sure we have.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:15.780
 And they're cheap, I think.

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:17.060
 Well, I'll tell you what to do.

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:18.500
 Mr. Howard does all the ordering,

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:20.260
 so you phone him, and if it's all right with him,

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:21.180
 it's all right with me.

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:22.380
 Well, thanks very much.

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:24.500
 Do you want your name printed in Old English?

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:25.460
 Yeah, she might as well,

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:27.220
 as long as we've got plenty of time.

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:29.860
 Hey Henry, there's no shipping here that I can locate.

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:30.660
 You're sure?

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:32.820
 Oh Mr. Harris, I want to send that box of books there,

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:34.420
 collected, it's all marked and everything.

00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:35.940
 Yes, man, you want to wait for a receipt?

00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:37.140
 No, I'm in a hurry.

00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:39.860
 I want to get home before I get stuck in a snowdrift.

00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:40.860
 What's that?

00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:41.420
 What's that?

00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:44.340
 Merry Christmas.

00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:45.340
 What did she say?

00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:46.180
 It's all right.

00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:48.340
 Are you sure our package isn't here?

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:48.980
 Yes, sir.

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:52.260
 Because see, how are we going to buy barns if we can't go to work?

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:53.420
 You buying barns?

00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:55.260
 Sure, that's what this whole thing is about.

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.460
 Sure. Henry and I are having a drive.

00:08:57.460 --> 00:08:59.460
 In conjunction with the rest of the town?

00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:00.760
 Oh, sure.

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:02.860
 Well, I did notice that important.

00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:05.560
 Now, you say your package was shipped about how long ago?

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:07.460
 Ten days ago. Wouldn't you say Homer?

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:08.560
 That's the way I figure it.

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:11.360
 I see. Do you know whether it had anything breakable in it?

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:12.160
 Breakable?

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:13.660
 Yes, any glass.

00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:15.360
 Glass?

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:18.260
 No, I wouldn't say so. Would you, Homer?

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:23.360
 No, I've never seen a glass one that I can remember.

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:26.400
 No, I'd say definitely, no glass.

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:30.000
 Well, let's fill out one of these blanks here and see whether we can get a tracer started.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.160
 And please make it urgent.

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:31.920
 Oh, yes.

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:33.200
 And add no glass.

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:37.720
 Do you think it'll take very long because until it gets here, we're practically at a standstill.

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:43.600
 Well, I don't suppose I ought to do it, but since it's connected with the Bond Club Drive, I'll send the main express office a wire.

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:54.460
 Hello? Hello? Is this Mr. Bush's office?

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:55.260
 This is Bush.

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:56.660
 This is Sam Ulrich.

00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:58.560
 Say, I was just talking with Ted Thomas.

00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:02.260
 I asked him to do a little work on this bond club committee, and he seemed very much pleased.

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:02.760
 Yes?

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:05.060
 In fact, he said he was for it 100%.

00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:05.760
 Fine.

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:07.360
 The only thing is, he says he's sorry.

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:11.660
 He has a couple of other things that he's going to have to give his time to, and he suggested you take his place.

00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:13.060
 That's for the bond committee, Sam?

00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:13.560
 Yes.

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:16.660
 It's fine. It's just fine. Let him have the opportunity.

00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:18.460
 In fact, I'm 500% for it.

00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:20.660
 Well, that's fine. Now I'll tell you what we want you to do.

00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:23.100

 in fact he's five hundred percent for it

00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:06.460
 that's more than anyone else i've called up this morning

00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:09.340
 if you talk to mister harvard yes he said he doesn't think a thousand show

00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:12.700
 cards and necessary to advertise the band out of the one is to do keep it a

00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:16.000
 secret well he said he wants to think it over and you're calling back

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.920

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:20.920
 Not right away. I'm going to sit down and rest a minute.

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:33.920
 And we let you the telegram express company, Sanders.

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:35.820
 I still can't believe it, Homer.

00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:36.820
 Read it again.

00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:41.820
 It says, "Audrich Centerville, have no record shipment of Christmas trees this year."

00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:45.220
 Wire further details collect.

00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:46.920
 Well, if that isn't the darnest thing,

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:48.920
 How could people be so dumb, Henry?

00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:50.820
 What do you think we all say and reply?

00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:53.020
 Tell them we can't understand that telegram,

00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:55.020
 will they please wire us more details?

00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:56.920
 Well, that isn't going to get us anywhere, Homer.

00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:59.620
 We've got to send them a very careful explanation.

00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:00.420
 All right, only.

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:02.620
 I don't know how we're going to do it in 10 words.

00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:04.220
 Why should we worry about 10 words?

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:05.420
 They say send it collect.

00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:06.420
 You got a pencil?

00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:06.720
 Sure.

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:07.820
 What do we say?

00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:10.020
 Gentlemen.

00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:11.120
 Gentlemen.

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:14.520
 Then how about don't want Christmas trees?

00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:15.220
 Sure.

00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:16.220
 That'll tell them.

00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:22.620
 We cannot purchase war bonds because order we placed 10 days ago has not arrived.

00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:25.820
 Sure. Have you misplaced Christmas cards?

00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:27.820
 Some of those were New Year's cards, Homer.

00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:29.020
 They were?

00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:32.380
 Let's just say, have you misplaced holiday greetings?

00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:34.220
 That's good. That'll tell a whole story.

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:40.540
 Hear Homer, take it over to the ticket office and finish writing it down while I phone Mr. Howard.

00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:41.420
 What for?

00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:43.820
 Tell him his wife wants him to place an order with us.

00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:46.920
 You know the more I think about this telegram the better I like it.

00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:48.200
 What's Mr. Howard's number?

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:49.240
 855.

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:50.360
 855.

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:51.180
 Sure.

00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:52.120
 Number please.

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:53.720
 Elm 855.

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:55.280
 Elm 855.

00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:59.000
 Can we do you think we ought to cut out any of this just to reduce the cost?

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.200
 What do you think?

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:04.080
 Well, the only word that isn't necessary is gentlemen.

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:07.280
 Why should they have to pay to be pulled a thing like that?

00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:09.220
 Okay, scratch it out.

00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:10.520
 Mr. Howard speaking.

00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:12.220
 Hello, this is Henry Aldrich.

00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:13.220
 What did you say Aldrich?

00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:16.460
 Yes, sir. Oh, yes. You're calling about the cards, aren't you, old rich?

00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:17.900
 The cards? Yes, sir.

00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:20.420
 That's a coincidence. I was just sitting here thinking about them.

00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:22.220
 You were? About how large are they?

00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:26.060
 Well, I'm sorry, but the samples aren't here yet.

00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:27.820
 Have you any ideas for the price?

00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:29.020
 You mean by the dozen?

00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:31.820
 Oh, you aren't trying to be sarcastic, old rich.

00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:33.620
 What's that? Well, I'll tell you what I'll do with you.

00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:36.100
 If your heart's sent on it, I'll settle for 500.

00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:36.820
 What's that?

00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:38.380
 Not one more. That's all we have.

00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:39.900
 500? That's right.

00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:43.060
 Well, what kind of lettering would you like on them?

00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:44.660
 Something in the way of Old English?

00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:48.560
 Old English? Don't you think black letters would be easier to read at a distance?

00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:49.460
 At a distance?

00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:52.260
 Well, they're going to be tacked up on telephone poles, aren't they?

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:53.760
 Are they?

00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:55.760
 Is this Mr. Howard?

00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:57.260
 Yes, this is still Mr. Howard.

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:59.360
 Are you sure you want 500?

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:01.360
 Yes, sir. We can cover this town easily with that.

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:01.860
 Goodbye.

00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:03.960
 Homer! Homer!

00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:07.860
 She was... We've got to send another telegram to the express company and hurry them up.

00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:08.160
 Why?

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:10.260
 Mr. Howard's taking 500.

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:11.360
 In Old English?

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:16.360
 [Music]

00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:18.360
 Have you seen this, Joe?

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:19.360
 What is it?

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:20.360
 The Adjustment Desk ended up to us.

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:22.360
 It's a telegram from Centerville signed Aldrich.

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:23.360
 What's it about?

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:24.360
 I don't understand it.

00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:25.360
 It says don't want Christmas trees.

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:28.360
 Cannot purchase war bonds because order placed ten days ago not arrived.

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:30.360
 Have you misplaced holiday greetings?

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:31.360
 Well, that's clear enough.

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:32.360
 What sense do you make out of it?

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:34.360
 They're having some kind of a bond drive.

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:36.360
 But what are they using Christmas trees for?

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:38.360
 Don't ask me, probably for decorations.

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:40.360
 And they decided it was a bad idea.

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:41.960
 But we don't have any shipment of trees.

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:43.960
 All right, fine, and everybody's happy.

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:46.560
 Hey, but Joe, why do they say "Have you misplaced holiday greetings"?

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:49.360
 Hey, what's that? Isn't that a period right after misplaced?

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:50.160
 Is that a period?

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:52.360
 Sure, but it ought to be a question mark.

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:53.760
 Here's how it goes.

00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:58.060
 Cannot purchase war bonds because order placed ten days ago has not arrived.

00:14:58.060 --> 00:15:02.160
 Have you misplaced question mark holiday greetings, old rich?

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:06.160
 What are the holiday greetings for?

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:08.560
 I don't know. Isn't next Sunday, Father's Day?

00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:11.560
 Sure, but how they know I'm a father.

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:12.660
 And look at this, Joe.

00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:14.720
 What they're looking for is a shipment of bonds.

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:15.520
 A war bond?

00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:16.720
 Yes, that's so right there.

00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:19.000
 The driver's held up because we misplaced the shipment.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.640
 Gee, Bill, that's a pretty serious thing.

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:22.100
 Uh, telegram, Mr. Cooper.

00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:23.060
 What's this one about?

00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:25.200
 I don't know, but it's marked right.

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:26.440
 Oh, it's another one from Aldrich.

00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:29.140
 It says must have shipment, have sold 500.

00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:31.140
 Holiday greetings.

00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:33.680
 Well, that guy, isn't it?

00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:35.880
 We're going to get into trouble, Bill.

00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:37.880
 You better send that up to the superintendent

00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:39.880
 Let him try to figure it out.

00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:51.880
 [Music]

00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:54.880
 Well, it seems the more telegrams Henry Aldrich sends,

00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:57.880
 the more thoroughly confused the express man becomes,

00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:01.880
 which just goes to show ladies and gentlemen how very easy it is to misunderstand.

00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:06.880
 You, for instance, may think that iced postam is just another cooling summertime drink.

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:10.560
 Actually, it's much more, a drink with a real surprise.

00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:14.360
 For the flavor of ice-postum is unlike anything else you've ever enjoyed.

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:18.120
 It's not like coffee, any more than coffee's taste is like tea.

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:20.360
 Ice-postum has a special flavor.

00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:24.000
 And perhaps the best way to tell you just how delicious that flavor is,

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.880
 is to say that when you taste ice-postum, you will wish for a magic pitcher of it.

00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:31.160
 So that no matter how many glasses are poured out,

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:33.640
 there'll always be plenty of ice-postum left.

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:37.240
 Directions for making ice post them are on every post them container.

00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:41.800
 So tomorrow, make up a big pitcher full. It keeps perfectly in the ice box.

00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:46.080
 And when the family comes to the table, fill up long tall glasses with ice,

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:50.600
 pour in golden brown post them, add a little cream and sugar if you like,

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:54.360
 then serve and see everyone drink his glass dry

00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:56.640
 of this grand summertime refreshment.

00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:58.040
 Ice post them.

00:16:58.040 --> 00:17:05.580
 [Music]

00:17:05.580 --> 00:17:08.240
 Now getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldrich.

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:11.480
 Henry and Homer had planned to take orders for Christmas cards

00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:14.240
 in order to make enough money to buy a war bond.

00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:18.280
 When the samples for the cards did not arrive, they wired the express company.

00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:20.140
 They wired a second time.

00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:23.040
 While the boys are waiting at the station for a second reply,

00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:25.960
 the scene opens in Mr. Aldrich's office.

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:28.260
 Hello? Is this John Clark?

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:29.240
 This is Mr. Clark.

00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:30.680
 Well, this is Sam Allers John.

00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:31.240
 Yes?

00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:33.840
 I was talking with Mr. Bush this morning about our bond drive.

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:36.060
 I wanted him to do some work on one of the committees.

00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:37.200
 Yes, is he going to?

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:40.480
 Well, he wants to. He's for us 500%.

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:44.240
 But he's tied up right now and he suggested I call you and see whether you couldn't help us out.

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:46.400
 Well, that's fine. That's fine. I'm glad you called.

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:48.200
 Good. Now I'll tell you what we'd like to have you do.

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:51.520
 Now, wait, Sam. Is this something that has to be done in the next few days?

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:52.580
 Yes, it'll have to be.

00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:53.960
 Well, that's too bad.

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:56.360
 Because after next week I could give you all the time you want.

00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:57.460
 But you can't right now.

00:17:57.460 --> 00:17:59.360
 Well you know how things aren't my business Sam.

00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:01.460
 I'm with your heart and soul but my hands are tied.

00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:01.960
 I see.

00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:04.560
 You know me Sam, I'm for this drive a thousand percent.

00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:05.360
 And I wish you luck.

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:05.960
 Goodbye.

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:06.560
 Goodbye.

00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:09.160
 Here's the box I just arrived at the voltage.

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:10.160
 A box? What's in it?

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:13.160
 A supply of 10% pledge buttons for the bond drive.

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:16.160
 Are they all 10%? Aren't any of them a thousand percent?

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:18.160
 [phone ringing]

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:19.360
 Hello Sam always speaking.

00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:20.160
 This is Howard.

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:20.760
 Yes, Howard.

00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:22.860
 Sorry I was up when you called but I got your message.

00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:23.460
 My message?

00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:24.920
 Yes, and I don't understand it.

00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:26.340
 What message are you referring to?

00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:28.380
 Whether I prefer red or green envelopes.

00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:29.380
 For what?

00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:30.960
 For the cards, the show cards.

00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:32.380
 I would be born envelopes for them.

00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:33.580
 That's what I'm asking you.

00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:36.520
 But we said you don't want to go to the expense of ordering a thousand envelopes.

00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:38.280
 A thousand? Now look here, Aldrich.

00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:40.380
 We agreed to order only 500 cards.

00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:41.080
 Oh, we did?

00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:42.880
 So let's not spend any more time discussing it.

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:44.060
 I've got a lot of things on my mind.

00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:46.060
 Are you too busy to come to a meeting at two?

00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:48.420
 I'm afraid I am, Sam. I've got a late lunch of engagement.

00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:50.380
 But you call me when it's over and let me know what you did.

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:51.060
 Yes, of course.

00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:51.720
 Goodbye, Sam.

00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:52.460
 Goodbye.

00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:55.820
 - Sam! - Alice, what are you doing down here at the office?

00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:57.300
 Sam, I thought we'd go to meet for lunch.

00:18:57.300 --> 00:19:00.060
 I've been waiting in front of the Emporium for half an hour for you.

00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:02.900
 I'm sorry, Alice, but I've got work to do on the Bon Club parade.

00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:05.660
 Dear, do you have to work this hard? Why can't Henry help you?

00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:08.260
 Now, Alice, what good can one boy do?

00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:17.100
 Read it again, Henry.

00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:19.140
 I've already read it four times, huh?

00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:21.180
 Well, read it again. I can't believe it.

00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:24.180
 Aldridge Centerville greetings to you.

00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:28.180
 Entire force trying to trace shipment for bond drive

00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:32.180
 if unable-located vis-ry ordering through treasury department.

00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:34.180
 Please wire further wishes.

00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:35.180
 They're crazy, Henry.

00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:37.180
 And it's signed by the general superintendent.

00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:39.180
 Well, that's what's the trouble.

00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:41.180
 Do you know what my father does when he can't get action?

00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:42.180
 What?

00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:44.180
 He goes straight to the president of the company.

00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:45.180
 Does that help?

00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:46.180
 Sure, let me have your pencil.

00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:47.180
 Here.

00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:50.180
 She was, don't they realize we're losing orders left and right?

00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:53.860
 the big parade. We don't want to ride on a float if we haven't even bought our barn.

00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:55.700
 That's what I say. What are you writing?

00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:59.380
 President of the Express Company. Time is growing short.

00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:01.860
 Now how about time is shortening?

00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:09.060
 Yeah, time is shortening. Losing orders. What will we do about barn parade? Please send greetings.

00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:12.900
 That's telling them Homer. Do you think it's clear?

00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:18.100
 Clear? Why it says plain as day. And look, just as soon as we've sent this,

00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:19.700
 Let's call Mr. Howard again.

00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:20.300
 What for?

00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:22.900
 I just thought of something else we forgot to ask him.

00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:32.700
 And he calls while I was out for lunch, Miss Gray?

00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:34.700
 Yes, Mr. Howard. Mr. Aldrich's son, folks.

00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:35.600
 His son? What did he want?

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:37.200
 He's apparently helping his father.

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:40.100
 He wanted to know whether you want your middle initial printed on the cards.

00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:40.800
 On what cards?

00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:43.200
 On the show cards I imagine for the bond drive.

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:44.600
 They're going to print my name on them?

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:47.300
 I imagine they are. I'm supposed to call Mr. Aldrich back.

00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:49.640
 Well, I didn't realize that we're going to do anything like that.

00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:53.760
 The old rich boy asked about Mrs. Howard too, but I explained that she has nothing to do with this.

00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:54.640
 That's fine.

00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:57.240
 Miss Gray, now how many of those cards did I tell you to order?

00:20:57.240 --> 00:20:57.900
 500.

00:20:57.900 --> 00:21:00.140
 Yes, well I don't think 500 will be enough, do you?

00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:01.040
 I don't know, sir.

00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:02.920
 As a matter of fact, that wouldn't be anywhere near enough.

00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:03.600
 Now here's what you do.

00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:04.620
 Call Sam Aldrich, see?

00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:05.060
 Yes, sir.

00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:06.580
 Tell him I want at least a thousand cards.

00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:08.120
 Where, though, without your middle initial?

00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:09.780
 If he doesn't mention it, don't you?

00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:12.720
 After all, I don't want him to think my name has anything to do with doubling the order.

00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:13.260
 Yes, sir.

00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:16.000
 Besides, I don't really care whether the J is in or not.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.000
 Yes, Mr. Howard.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.740
 (dramatic music)

00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:25.320
 Mr. Aldridge.

00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:26.160
 - Yes, Mr. Thompson.

00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:27.380
 - The editor of The Times is here.

00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:28.920
 He wants you to go over some coffee with him.

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:30.300
 - Yes, of course.

00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:31.320
 Tom, come on in.

00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:32.160
 - Oh, hello, Sam.

00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:33.760
 I just stopped by to show you the story

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:35.480
 about the bond driver running tonight's paper.

00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:36.400
 - Fine, fine.

00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:37.400
 - Gotta give it the front page.

00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:38.280
 Nearly half a column.

00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:39.120
 - Yes.

00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:39.960
 - Half a column?

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:40.920
 You couldn't spare any more than that.

00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:42.520
 - Well, half a column's quite a bit, Sam.

00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:43.360
 Tells the whole story.

00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:44.200
 - The only thing is--

00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:45.520
 - Sam, you know me.

00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:49.800
 for this drive but I can't overdo it. After all my subscribers expect to find

00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:52.880
 some news in the paper. The only thing is Tom the other paper is going to give

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:56.400
 their entire front page. We need the same from you. You mean some of the folks

00:21:56.400 --> 00:22:00.280
 are against this drive? No, most of this town is working its head off. But there

00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:04.080
 are a few Tom that need waking up. The other ones we've got to sell on investing

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:08.160
 10% of their income for the rest of this war. Don't you worry Sam, everything is

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:13.520
 gonna be fine. Excuse me. Hello Sam already speaking. Mr. Allridge, it's the

00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:15.960
 Centerville station we got a telegram here for you.

00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:17.080
 -The telegram for me?

00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:18.040
 -I think it's for you.

00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:20.840
 It came in while I was out, says Aldrich Centerville.

00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:22.000
 -Go ahead. Who's it from?

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.840
 -The president of the Express Company.

00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:25.840
 -From whom?

00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:26.720
 What's he say?

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:27.640
 What's it about?

00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:29.600
 -He says, "Greetings.

00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:33.640
 I'm doing everything in my power to facilitate your bond drive.

00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:38.440
 If you do not get full cooperation from our local representative, please wire."

00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:42.000
 -Well, well, then you say that's from the president himself.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:42.960
 -Yeah.

00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:46.120
 And he's doing everything in his power to facilitate our bond drive.

00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:47.120
 Yeah?

00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:52.360
 And what's the rest if we do not get fully cooperation from local representatives, please wire?

00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:53.840
 Yeah, and greetings.

00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:56.560
 Greetings. Yeah, but that's not the important part.

00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:59.960
 And you say it's signed by the president?

00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:01.200
 Yes, sir.

00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:03.040
 Are you sure that's for me?

00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:04.800
 It's addressed to Ulrich.

00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:06.720
 Well, then I guess it is.

00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:07.760
 Yeah, goodbye, Mr. Ulrich.

00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:08.760
 Goodbye.

00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:09.880
 Well, Sam.

00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:10.720
 What's that, Tom?

00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:12.960
 There's never everybody that gets a telegram like that.

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:13.800
 I beg your pardon.

00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:18.960
 Now tell me, frankly, Sam, about how much space do you think this paper ought to give to make this drive a success?

00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:21.560
 Well, to tell the truth, that should be up to you.

00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:24.680
 But we'd like a lot more than we're getting a great deal more.

00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:26.880
 And, frankly, Sam, I think you should have it.

00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:28.080
 Oh, excuse me.

00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:29.680
 Hello, Sam, already speaking.

00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:31.840
 Mr. Oldridge, this is Mr. Howard's secretary.

00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:32.340
 Yes?

00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:36.680
 Mr. Howard wanted me to tell you that if you feel we need a thousand of those show cards, it's all right.

00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:39.680
 Yes? Well, I'm glad he came around to my point of view.

00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:41.880
 I'm just sorry I didn't ask for 1500.

00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:44.580
 Well I think it would be alright if you ordered 1500.

00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:46.280
 You mean it's alright with Mr. Howard?

00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:48.980
 Oh yes, and prints them any way you want to.

00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:50.180
 Yes, well that's fine.

00:23:50.180 --> 00:23:51.380
 Sam, may I speak with Howard?

00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:53.080
 Mr. Gray, is Mr. Howard there?

00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:54.380
 Just a minute, I'll call him.

00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:55.080
 Hey Tom.

00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:58.180
 Mr. Roldridge, there's a gentleman in the outer office that wants to see you.

00:23:58.180 --> 00:23:58.680
 You see me?

00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:00.180
 From the express company.

00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:00.980
 Yeah?

00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:02.780
 Excuse me Tom, I'll be right back.

00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:03.380
 Hello?

00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:05.680
 Uh, Howard, this is Tom from over to time.

00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:06.280
 Yes?

00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:09.080

 Thank you. Hello, Jenny.

00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:46.080
 Yes?

00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:47.080
 This is JJ. I won't be home for dinner, Jen.

00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:48.080
 Why not?

00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:50.080
 I've got to do some work on the Bond Committee.

00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:52.080
 Probably be midnight before I get home.

00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:55.080
 But JJ, I've arranged a bridge game for tonight.

00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:57.080
 Well, cancel it. The Bond Drive is more important.

00:24:57.080 --> 00:25:00.080
 Yes, dear. Oh, has Henry Aldrich been in touch with you?

00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:01.080
 No, what about?

00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:02.080
 Christmas card.

00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:04.080
 Jenny, this is no time to think about Christmas cards. Goodbye.

00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:05.080
 Good bye.

00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:10.080
 Hello? Hello? Is this Sam Aldrich?

00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:11.080
 Yes?

00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:13.080
 Well, this is Clark. Say, Sam, why didn't you call me again?

00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:14.080
 What about?

00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:17.080
 The bond drive. We can't sit back and expect you to carry the whole load.

00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:18.080
 Well, I certainly appreciate that.

00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:22.080
 Don't you think we ought to talk to folks and to invest in 15% each week instead of just 10?

00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:25.080
 Well, we'll talk about it. We'll talk about it.

 - Sam, Sam just look at the float that's going by.

00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:43.800
 - Which one?

00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:45.360
 - The one just coming up to the reviewing stand.

00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:47.360
 - Oh yes, yes, very good.

00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:49.960
 - Is the float that Henry and Homer are on inside yet?

00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:51.600
 - Uh, not yet.

00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:52.960
 They ought to be along in a minute though.

00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:55.560
 - The sandwich company here in town bought the most bonds.

00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:56.560
 - The express company.

00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:58.480
 - The express company?

00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:03.640
 Yes, for some reason the main office in Chicago wired that they'd be willing to top the pledge of any firm in town.

00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:05.480
 Well, what's that knife, though?

00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:08.880
 Hey, you know those short cards Howard, oh, gave them pretty guys.

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:11.080
 Well, there certainly are a lot of them.

00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:14.680
 You know, it's weird, JJ Howard and the Spoken, and he's just been putting them up.

00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:17.480
 Oh, incidentally, don't let me forget to tell Henry when he gets home.

00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:20.480
 There's a package at the house from the Excelsior Greeting Card Company.

00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:20.980
 Yeah?

00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:22.880
 Yes, it came this morning by Apostle Pose.

00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:23.380
 Yeah?

00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:26.280
 Sam, Sam here comes the float that Henry's on.

00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:26.780
 Where?

00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:29.580
 - We down the street, see him, Sam, see him? - Oh yes!

00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:30.980
 Sam, where did they get the truck?

00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:32.820
 They expressed company loaned it.

00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:35.780
 But Sam, hire Henry and Homer in track suits.

00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:38.380
 They're supposed to be relay races, Alice, don't you see?

00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:41.180
 Oh, oh yes, isn't that nice.

00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:42.980
 What is that that Henry's handing over to Homer?

00:26:42.980 --> 00:26:45.380
 A torch, Alice. See the sign above them?

00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:47.780
 They represent the spirit of total effort.

00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:48.980
 A total what?

00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:50.780
 Effort, Alice. Effort.

00:26:50.780 --> 00:26:53.580
 This drive is the greatest thing this town has ever had.

00:26:53.580 --> 00:27:04.300

00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:06.660
 Henry Aldrich will be back in just a moment.

00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:09.580
 Meantime, let me pass along this friendly suggestion.

00:27:09.580 --> 00:27:15.700
 If you think coffee disagrees with you, try making Postam your regular mealtime beverage instead of coffee.

00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:22.580
 And for a grand summertime drink for all the family, be sure to try refreshing, delicious, ice Postam.

00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:26.140
 (dramatic music)

00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:27.660
 - Henry, I wanna have a talk with you.

00:27:27.660 --> 00:27:28.500
 - Yes, Father.

00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:30.340
 - You and Homer looked fine on that float,

00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:32.460
 and it's fine if you would have wanted to sell Christmas cards

00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:33.540
 in order to buy a bond.

00:27:33.540 --> 00:27:34.380
 - Yes, Father.

00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:36.380
 - But I don't think you should go from house to house

00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:38.500
 carrying that torch in your track suits.

00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:41.240

00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:48.180

 to our armed forces in all parts of the world.

00:27:50.620 --> 00:27:58.320
 Listen again next week, same time, same station, for another sparkling half hour with your favorite youngster, his family and his pals.

00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:02.780
 The Aldrich family starring Ezra Stone is written by Clifford Goldsmith.

00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:06.300
 Original music is composed and conducted by Jack Miller.

00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:10.900
 This is Dan Seymour saying, "You will enjoy fragrant, flavorful postum."

00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:16.540
 And remember, postum contains nothing at all that can possibly upset your digestion.

00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:35.540
 Jell-O puddings take no additional sugar to make,

00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:38.540
 and they give you the most luscious puddings you ever tasted.

00:28:38.540 --> 00:28:40.540
 Try Jell-O butterscotch pudding.

00:28:40.540 --> 00:28:44.540
 It's gloriously rich and smooth, so creamy it melts in your mouth,

00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:48.140
 and how you'll love its swell golden butterscotch flavor,

00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:50.540
 a flavor that's really a thrill to taste.

00:28:50.540 --> 00:28:53.540
 When you order jello, order jello puddings,

00:28:53.540 --> 00:28:56.540
 jello chocolate, vanilla, and butterscotch puddings,

00:28:56.540 --> 00:28:59.040
 jello puddings need no additional sugar,

00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:03.540
 and they taste just like grandma's only more so.
