00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 In just a moment enjoy the Aldrich family.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
 But first this is Bob McKenzie.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 A little later this evening, why not stop off at the Phil Harris Alice Faye household just for last?

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 As another Sunday feature theater guild on the air will star John Lund and Vivekka Lindfors

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
 in Robert Nathan's heartwarming story of two refugees from war to Europe in their flight to freedom.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
 Our story is titled The Seagull Cry.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
 Then for mystery fans, there's another dragnet case history

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 and our newest Sunday show, Barry Craig,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
 a confidential investigator.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
 Just stay tuned to this station,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 and now it's the Aldrich family on NBC.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 [music]

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 Henry! Henry Aldrich!

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 Coming, mother!

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 [applause]

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 Yes, it's the Aldrich family as transcribed written by Clifford Goldsmith.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 Someone once said that when you finally grow up and leave your teenage behind you,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
 it's like being expelled from paradise. You can't ever go back.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 But there's one thing you can do.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.200
 You can recall that wonderful time of your life in the misadventures of Henry Aldrich

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:32.360
 The scene opens in the Aldrich living room. It's mid-afternoon now listen Mary for the last time

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:38.720
 I'm not gonna ask you again. Where is it? I don't have it Henry. All right, Mary. All right. Just remember

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.680
 I'm not gonna ask you again good wish I go around humiliating myself. That's what I say sure

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:50.400
 The last time Mary where'd you put it? Henry I give you my word. I don't know where it is anymore than you do

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.700
 All right, Mary, but I just want you to know that I know you took it.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.000
 Mary took what, Henry?

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 My...

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 Nothing, Mother. Nothing at all.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.500
 Now, wait a minute, Mary. Don't go upstairs.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.500
 I'd like to make you a proposition.

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:03.800
 Now, Mary?

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.800
 But, Mary, will you let me start your bureau?

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.400
 If I promise to put everything back...

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.000
 No!

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 Henry?

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.600
 Sam!

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:11.400
 Hello, Father.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.900
 Dear, why in the world are you coming home from the office at this time of day?

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.400
 But a very special reason.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.900
 Now, let me forget this envelope.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:18.800
 Envelope?

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:19.800
 Is that why...

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.720
 with you please call Mary and tell you want to downstairs at once what for she

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.400
 locked herself in a room and Rick would you come in here and just a minute father

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:35.120
 I have to go outside for something and why are you home so early well all summer

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.480
 I've been saying that sometime Henry and I ought to pack up and go off on a

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.080
 camping trip here you want going on a camping trip in October on you why not

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:48.760
 I'm all caught up at the office October Alice there's a tang in the air all the

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.720
 leaves are starting to turn color. It's a wonderful idea.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.880
 What is there so wonderful about sleeping on the hard, damp ground with trees dripping

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.880
 things on you all night?

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.720
 Here gets the poison out of your system. I'll come back a new man and after all I did promise

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.280
 Henry. I'm sure he's forgotten all about it.

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.400
 I'll hear you'll enjoy it. I'll hear you'll enjoy it.

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.200
 How long will you be gone? Oh maybe two or three nights.

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.440
 Sam Aldry.

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.880
 No, there. What do you think he's called Henry?

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:15.880
 Where is he?

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.380
 He ran out in the yard and got the ladder out of the garage,

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.880
 and now he's putting it up to my window.

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.380
 Henry, will you please take that ladder back?

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.380
 Mother, he practically is!

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.380
 Listen, Mary, for the last time.

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:29.380
 Good.

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.880
 See?

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.380
 Did you hurt yourself?

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.380
 Don't let her arrive.

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:38.380
 I think.

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.880
 Henry!

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.880
 This is all right, Father. I can fix your ladder.

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.880
 Will you please come in the house?

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:56.200
 There Alice is a good example of why I should take Henry on a trip. He needs to get away from the house

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.640
 What's wrong with the house?

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:05.520
 Nothing nothing. It's just that Henry needs to work off a little of that energy out in the fresh air theory was just out in the yard

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.160
 That isn't the same thing

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.200
 What Henry?

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.720
 Did that ladder cost a great deal Henry? Yes, sir

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.320
 And Sam, I've got to go up and get something in marriage.

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:16.820
 Very well.

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.420
 Wait a minute, Mother, I'd like to go with you.

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:19.220
 Henry.

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:20.220
 Yes, Father?

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.220
 Would you mind waiting here, please?

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:23.520
 Do you want to speak to me now?

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:24.520
 I do.

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.120
 Oh.

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.920
 Henry, how would you like to get away from all this?

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:32.520
 You're going to send me away just because I broke the ladder?

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.320
 How would you like to go on a camping trip?

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:36.320
 Hello?

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:37.320
 I go with you.

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:38.320
 In October?

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.320
 The weather prediction is warm and sunny for the next few days.

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:42.820
 Perhaps the last good ones will have.

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.020
 How about it?

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:45.060
 Go camping?

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:46.420
 Just the two of us?

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:47.920
 Yes, I will start this afternoon.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.580
 Sleep right out in the woods.

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.060
 Catch our own fish, cook our own grub.

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.060
 The only thing is, Father, in a struggle.

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.620
 I have to go to the movies tonight.

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:58.260
 To the movies?

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:59.340
 Yes, sir.

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.260
 A bunch of us sort of planned to go this evening.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.620
 Wouldn't you rather get out and eat your own fish?

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.580
 For Chief Westfather, they're counting on me

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:08.620
 to sit with them.

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:10.460
 Couldn't we go some other time?

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:13.620
 Well, not as well as today. Not any later this year.

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.980
 What's more, Homer Brown and his father may go with this.

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:18.700
 Homer and Mr. Brown?

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:20.700
 That throws a different light on him.

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:23.780
 But Homer's seen the picture and it doesn't matter to him.

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:26.220
 I see. Very well.

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:27.540
 Couldn't we go tomorrow, father?

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:29.980
 No, Henry, if you don't care anymore about it than that,

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:32.100
 then you needn't even think of going on.

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:34.420
 Mr. Alberts!

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:35.500
 Come in, Homer.

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:36.700
 I am in.

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:37.200
 I know.

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:37.940
 Hi, Henry.

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:38.740
 Hello, Homer.

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:43.380
 Mr. Alrich, my father wanted me to come over and tell you he doesn't know why he didn't think of it before.

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:46.100
 But we can't possibly go on that camping trip.

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:46.840
 Why not?

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:50.240
 We have to go to a wedding this afternoon, in a party afterwards.

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:51.720
 That's quite all right, Homer.

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.540
 I'm not sure I wanted to go camping anyway.

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:56.440
 Aren't you going at all, Father?

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:57.840
 Alone.

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.660
 Well, look, she was Aga with you.

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:00.840
 No, thank you, Henry.

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:02.940
 Sir, when you come upstairs, please...

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:04.240
 What's the trouble now?

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:07.840
 Mary's dead in the key in her door and she can't get it unlocked.

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:09.440
 I'll be right there.

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.880
 Father, wouldn't you like to join us at the movies?

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:12.880
 At my expense?

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:14.880
 Thank you, I would not.

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:16.760
 Henry, what did your mother say?

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:17.960
 Was there a matter with Mary?

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.600
 Boy, do you know what she did to me, Homer?

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:20.760
 Just to be humorous?

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:21.640
 No, what?

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:23.120
 She stole my diary.

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:24.480
 Your diary, Henry?

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:26.240
 A five-year diary.

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:27.360
 I just started it this year.

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:28.120
 And Mary has it?

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:29.120
 Sure.

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:31.120
 And it's got into what I think of everybody I know.

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:31.880
 Including me?

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:32.380
 Sure.

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:33.000
 Well, come on.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.000
 I hope you look for it.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.880
 Henry, may I have a talk with you?

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:37.760
 With I, Mother?

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:39.020
 Hello Mrs. Orich.

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:39.780
 Hello, Homer.

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:42.680
 Would you mind stepping into the hallway for a minute?

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:45.680
 What do you want me to do out there, Mrs. Orich?

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:48.420
 Just wait till I'm through talking.

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:49.820
 Oh, oh, I get it.

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:52.620
 Well, I'm sure whatever it is, Henry didn't make it.

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:55.340
 Mother Mary started the whole thing by taking my diary.

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:57.540
 That isn't what I want to talk about.

00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:00.140
 Dear, your father feels rather badly.

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:00.740
 Father does?

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:02.860
 Because you'd rather not go camping.

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:03.860
 Oh.

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:05.300
 But mother, I told him I'd like to go.

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:08.300
 He said you insisted on going to the movies.

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:10.900
 Yeah, I don't know where we ever got that impression.

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:12.700
 I'll admit I did mention the movies,

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:15.300
 because it's a picture I feel it's my duty to see.

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:16.800
 I didn't refuse to go camping.

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:20.200
 Well, you see, dear, your father does enjoy doing things with you.

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:23.300
 And I'm afraid this time he was just a little hurt.

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:24.800
 Oh.

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:28.300
 Well, yeah, I didn't realize he was that sensitive.

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:30.300
 Maybe I ought to take him camping.

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:31.300
 Would you like to?

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:33.300
 Sure, I'd do him a lot of good.

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:38.440
 He needs to get away from the house for a while the house sure on the fresh air and different surroundings

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:42.580
 What's the matter?

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:46.340
 Came out too far

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:51.620
 Looking for something of Henry

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:59.160
 He heard his finger opening my door and he's feeling very sorry for himself mother a yes

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:02.660
 I'm not speaking to Mary. Will you please tell her I'll go up and get the iodine?

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:07.660
 Mother, I think Henry's entirely too sensitive.

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:10.660
 Mary, dear, do you know where Henry's diary is?

00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:14.660
 Well, exactly what do you mean by that, Mother?

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:16.660
 I mean, did you hide it?

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:18.660
 Well, yes, but...

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:20.660
 Well, yes, but...

00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:21.660
 Well, yes, but...

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:23.660
 That's what puzzles me.

00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:24.660
 Where did you put it?

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:25.660
 In the cold, haper.

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:26.660
 In the cold, haper.

00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:27.660
 In the cold, haper.

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:28.660
 In the cold, haper.

00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:31.660
 And when I went back to get it, it was gone!

00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:35.660
 Oh, I don't really have even the slightest ideas to where it is.

00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:37.660
 For all I know it may have gone to the laundry.

00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:40.660
 Now Mary, I don't think that was very nice.

00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:43.660
 But Mother, there wasn't one word in it, the laundry could take a pen sat.

00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:47.660
 Mrs. Allrich, is Henry still upstairs?

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:49.660
 Homer, what are you doing in there?

00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:53.660
 Well, did you know one of the drawers in your desk is locked?

00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:55.660
 Homer, please leave my desk alone.

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:59.660
 Mary, I want you to do something for me.

00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:03.260
 something for me what is it father you see this brown envelope yes well before I

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:06.540
 forget when I missed a Warren calls for it will you please be sure that he gets

00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:11.340
 it certainly father Sam are you and Henry really going camping yes Alice we had a

00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:15.980
 little talk upstairs and I agreed to take him I'm married did I write Mr. Warren's

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:19.700
 name on the envelope oh my goodness father I can certainly remember Mr. Warren

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:22.500
 can't I don't lose it it's extremely important

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:26.900
 Mother if father tell you I agreed to take him yes Henry every what's not

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:31.500
 Don't you wish you knew can't you tell me it's something very private

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:35.700
 Sam I'll go in the kitchen and boil a couple dozen eggs for you and Henry to take with you

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:41.240
 She mother you don't need a boil in the air. No Alice. We'll cook our own food. What food the fish we catch

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:46.480
 All we want is a little flower so we can make biscuits and some bacon what over I

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:53.960
 Did what does this mean? It says Sam dropped in tonight, and I found him terribly nice

00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:58.960
 But very sensitive who's very sensitive home or where did you get that?

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:02.740
 Well, you know that lock drawer in your desk and may I have it please?

00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:12.340
 Alice when did you write that never mind we can't read it we certainly may not I'm going to take it out and burn it

00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:16.060
 Well, come on, honey. Let's go up and get into our whole close your father

00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:22.540
 So long over you're leaving me Henry don't you want to go home? Well, I was gonna look for your diary some more

00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:25.660
 Wait a second Homer. I just had a wonderful idea

00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:32.480
 Boy, will it kill Mary? It will she's got a brown envelope Homer a brown envelope. She says it's very private

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:36.440
 Before I go Catholic I'm gonna get it and hide it you are sure sure

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:41.140
 The only thing is Homer. You're not afraid of Mary. Are you?

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:47.060
 No, but maybe I really are after all Henry you aren't gonna open the envelope are you she was no

00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:50.860
 We're just gonna hide it for a few days to get even. I think it's a great idea.

00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:55.740
 Sure. And boy, will that teacher a lesson about taking things that don't belong to her?

00:10:55.740 --> 00:11:09.660
 Father.

00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:11.420
 Yes, Henry?

00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:15.500
 I don't mean to be critical, but don't you think the fish would bite better if we didn't whistle?

00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:17.980
 Yes, good idea.

00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:20.620
 Nice, tangy day, isn't it?

00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:24.020
 Just look at those leaves, brown, red.

00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:27.020
 I think I'll cast out here in this other direction.

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:31.500
 It will seem to be biting very well.

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:34.700
 Yeah, them time. They're just getting used to us.

00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:38.140
 Boy, I have to laugh every time I think of it.

00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:39.420
 Every time you think of what?

00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:40.860
 Don't we act even with Mary?

00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:41.660
 You did.

00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:43.340
 See, did I hide something of hers?

00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:44.340
 Yeah.

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:47.660
 I have ever once said, "You're not good, John, I came to visit us."

00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:49.260
 He left his bag off in his room.

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:50.860
 Father, I think I got a bite.

00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:51.360
 Good.

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:53.560
 If we just keep quiet now, be quiet.

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:56.260
 Now you hook a little.

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:57.260
 That's what I'm doing.

00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:59.560
 Who's he whiz?

00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:00.260
 How is that?

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.060
 He kicked our knapsack into the water.

00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:04.860
 Oh, I can get it.

00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:05.960
 Be quiet, though.

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:09.260
 All I have to do is to take my shoes and socks off,

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:12.160
 and wait right out to wear the pack of snags.

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:14.260
 You better hurry, Father. The current's taking away.

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:15.260
 Here I go.

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.260
 Mmm.

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:18.260
 It's a little chintz.

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:19.260
 I'm here.

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:20.260
 [laughter]

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.260
 I'll get it all right.

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.260
 Be careful, Father.

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:25.260
 Mmm.

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:27.260
 Don't let it be for that I thought.

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.260
 You want to throw me your coat, Father?

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:30.260
 No.

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.260
 I just have to take one more step.

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:34.260
 [crash]

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:35.260
 Hey, who is Father?

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:36.260
 Father?

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.260
 Where are you, Father?

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:40.260
 [cheering]

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.260
 (Squeaking)

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:49.260
 Mary, don't you have the slightest ideas to where you put it?

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:52.260
 I'm almost positive that I put it here on this hall table.

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:55.260
 And it was a brown envelope? Yes, about this big.

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.260
 Is that Mr. Warren waiting in the living room?

00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:59.260
 And no, dear, it's Will Brown, his uncle.

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:01.260
 Well, I'm going to ask him something.

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:03.260
 Oh, Mr. Brown! Yes, Mary?

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:07.260
 Does your Mr. Warren really need that envelope today?

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:12.640
 He sure does. He was down at your father's office this morning and got a little excited or something and walked off and left it.

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:13.640
 I see.

00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:16.300
 Just how valuable is it?

00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:20.200
 Well, it wouldn't be valuable to anybody else, but it certainly means a lot to my nephew.

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:21.400
 It does.

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:23.200
 He had his marriage license in it.

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:25.000
 How is that all?

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.500
 That's all he's planning to be married at five o'clock.

00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:28.500
 Today?

00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:33.000
 I hope you don't think I'd be wearing a cutaway like this a day ahead of time.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.500
 Whoa!

00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:37.500
 Yes, sir, my nephew's old futures in that envelope.

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:40.200
 Look, Mr. Brown, would you mind sitting down just a minute

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:42.500
 while my mother and I go through my room once more?

00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:44.500
 Well, I won't sit down exactly.

00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:46.000
 I don't want to ruin this coat.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.500
 I'll just sort of lean against the wall.

00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:58.500
 What about this dick on the fire, Henry?

00:13:58.500 --> 00:13:59.500
 That's what I'm doing, father.

00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:02.500
 Do I smell something burning?

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:04.500
 It's just a fire, I think.

00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:07.500
 Boy, these fish here are tasty, aren't they?

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:08.500
 Yes.

00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:09.500
 Has some more?

00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:10.500
 They don't mind if I do.

00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:14.500
 Cheerless, smarter mother to put this can of sardines in an app sack.

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:17.500
 Your mother thinks of everything.

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:19.500
 They're even important.

00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:21.500
 Gee, you ought to see the big one I just got.

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:22.500
 Big what, sardine?

00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:23.500
 Mosquito.

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:26.500
 How do you want shivering, are you?

00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:28.500
 No, I don't know. I'm almost dry.

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:29.980
 Almost dry.

00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:33.180
 Sir, it is wonderful out here in the woods in October.

00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:36.020
 Feel that tang in the air, huh?

00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:38.340
 That little brown sorry he couldn't come with us.

00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:39.900
 Who's wedding do you have to go to?

00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:42.500
 His nephew, John Warren.

00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:44.340
 Hmm, 20 minutes to six.

00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:46.300
 Gotta be just about married.

00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:48.020
 Fathers, do you deserve?

00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:52.660
 Yes, take this knife and cut a piece of that cake.

00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:54.300
 Oh, gee whiz.

00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:56.460
 Cut from the end that didn't go in the late.

00:14:56.460 --> 00:15:03.460
 You know, son, as soon as we're through eating, I think we'd better move on to a place where there aren't so many mosquitoes.

00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:06.460
 Father, maybe you did smell something burning.

00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:07.460
 What is it?

00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:11.460
 She whiz, I didn't know you put your shoes right next to this fire.

00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:21.460
 You go through that pile of papers, dear, and I'll go through this one.

00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:24.460
 I've been through all of them twice, mother.

00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:28.460
 I just went through the trash pile and there's no sign of any license there.

00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:32.460
 Will Brown, you haven't been going through the trash pile in that cutaway, have you?

00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:33.460
 I used a long rake.

00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:35.460
 Did I just hear the palm ring?

00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:36.460
 If you did, don't answer it.

00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:37.460
 Why not?

00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:42.460
 They've been heckling us for two hours. When we find the envelope, my nephew can get married and not until then.

00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:44.460
 My goodness, look at this.

00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:45.460
 What, Mother?

00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:47.460
 I just found a Christmas card we never opened.

00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:48.460
 What?

00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:52.460
 I wonder how Mrs. Standish has been so cool to me all year.

00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:53.540
 in the old year?

00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:56.220
 I'm waiting till you see how my nephew reacts to you.

00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:57.860
 Where's he going on his honeymoon?

00:15:57.860 --> 00:15:58.700
 It's a new Hampshire.

00:15:58.700 --> 00:15:59.740
 It's a new Hampshire.

00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:01.460
 Well, they like it there.

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:03.940
 They will if they ever get there.

00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:05.620
 Father, where are you?

00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:06.580
 Here, Homer.

00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:08.340
 Well, look, they want me to tell you

00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:10.060
 the brides having hysterics.

00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:10.940
 Oh, my goodness.

00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:12.300
 hysterics, Homer?

00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:14.340
 She says she's never going to speak to the groom again

00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:15.180
 as long as she lives.

00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:17.500
 That's a fine thing.

00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:18.780
 Are all the guests still there?

00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:19.460
 Sure.

00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:21.420
 When I left, they just finished the wedding cake.

00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:23.420
 Here, I brought you a piece.

00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:25.420
 Not now!

00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:27.420
 Does help us look for that license?

00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:29.420
 Well, what did it look like?

00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:31.420
 It's in a brown envelope.

00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:33.420
 A brown envelope?

00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:35.420
 Yes, dear.

00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:37.420
 A brown envelope?

00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:38.420
 About this large?

00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:39.420
 What's the matter with you, Homer?

00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:40.420
 Have you seen it?

00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:42.420
 - Am I a license? - Yes.

00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:44.420
 No, sir!

00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:46.420
 Do you know what I think?

00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:49.420
 I think we ought to get in the car and find Mr. Allrich.

00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:51.420
 - Say I'm old, Rich. - He's with Henry.

00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:54.420
 I'm positive that'd be the safest thing to do.

00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:57.420
 - Where is it they're camping out? - They set up near McCorkel's Rock.

00:16:57.420 --> 00:16:59.420
 McCorkel's Rock's way up there?

00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:02.420
 Well, J-Father, we could find them in less than two hours.

00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:05.420
 And I have a feeling that's the only thing to do.

00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:08.420
 Alice, call the wedding and tell them to go ahead with the reception.

00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:11.420
 We'll get the bride and groom married later.

00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:13.420
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:22.740
 We'll return to the Aldrich family in just a moment.

00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:24.860
 His voice has thrilled millions.

00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:28.020
 His curly locks have been compared to spun gold.

00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:30.380
 His background is that of a man of the world.

00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:31.500
 Who is he?

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:33.300
 Nobody but Phil Harris.

00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:35.980
 And tonight you can join Phil and his long-suffering wife,

00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:39.540
 Alice Faye, in another of their funny misadventures.

00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:44.180
 Then your weekly theater guild on the air presents John Lunn and Vivica Linfers

00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:49.300
 in a tender story of two war offerings, Seagull Cry by Robert Nathan.

00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:51.940
 Next comes two of the top NBC news programs.

00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:55.540
 First, Martha Roundtree's panel conference Meet the Press,

00:17:55.540 --> 00:17:59.300
 then the American Forum of the Air with Theodore Granik as your moderator.

00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:05.060
 On both shows, NBC microphones will bring you the people who are the names in tomorrow's headlines.

00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:08.340
 So check your local newspaper for broadcast times.

00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:10.740
 Stay tuned to this NBC station.

00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:13.380
 For theater guild on the air, the Phil Harris Alice

00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:17.020
 Peycho, Meet the Press, and the American Forum of the Air.

00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:20.020
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:28.700
 And now getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldrich.

00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:31.860
 To get even with his sister who had lost his diary,

00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:34.940
 Henry has hidden an envelope which he believes is hers,

00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:37.460
 and he's gone off on a three-day camping trip.

00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:41.460
 He's unaware of the fact that the envelope contains an important marriage license.

00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:44.460
 The scene is in the woods. The time is late at night.

00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:46.860
 Father, where are you?

00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:48.460
 Right here, Henry.

00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:49.360
 Where?

00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:50.360
 I'll display you.

00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:50.860
 Oh.

00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:54.860
 You think we'll like this place better in the last two places we unpacked in?

00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:57.160
 Marisin' a mosquito anywhere near here.

00:18:57.160 --> 00:18:58.960
 Now, line down and get comfortable.

00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:02.660
 Gee, I wish our flashlight hadn't dropped in the water.

00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:04.360
 You don't need a flashlight.

00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:07.060
 Father, have you any idea where we are?

00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:12.460
 I know exactly where we are. We're about a mile and a half from the main line of the Y and R railroad.

00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:13.980
 Now, lie down and go to sleep.

00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:14.980
 I am.

00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:18.220
 Heee, this is the life, isn't it?

00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:20.380
 You think it'll rain?

00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:21.980
 There isn't a chance.

00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:27.060
 See, what was that?

00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:31.900
 Just a thunderstorm, way over on the other side of the valley.

00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:34.460
 I'll close your eyes and go to sleep.

00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:35.380
 Yes, Father.

00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:38.660
 I wonder why the stars are now?

00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:41.360
 Give them time. They'll come out.

00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:45.360
 Too bad Will Brown and Homer couldn't have come along with us.

00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:46.960
 Who's why did you say it was?

00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:50.960
 Mr. Warren, the young business man who just moved to town.

00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:53.560
 I expect to do a lot of business with him.

00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:58.660
 What's that?

00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:00.460
 Just some animal.

00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:04.960
 Why don't you just relax, Henry, and enjoy nature?

00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:06.860
 Sound like a train whistle.

00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:09.860
 Well, it might have been a train over on the Y&R.

00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:10.860
 Oh.

00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:15.660
 Listen, Father, don't you think we ought to go some other place?

00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:18.060
 No, Henry, there's no sense in trying to go anyplace else.

00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:20.660
 We'll be just as comfortable here as if we were home.

00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:25.460
 Father, is it raining where you are?

00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:29.460
 Well, just a little.

00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:31.460
 You better pull your blanket over your head.

00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:35.160
 (music)

00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:37.160
 For our train whistle sounds closer.

00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:38.860
 Well, of course it sounds closer.

00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:41.360
 It's going to pass within a mile and a half of it.

00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:46.160
 (music)

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:49.460
 Father, Father, the headlights are going right at us.

00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:50.760
 What's that?

00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:53.160
 Do you feel any ties under you?

00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:54.860
 How did we get way over here?

00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:55.860
 Come on!

00:20:55.860 --> 00:21:00.360

 Henry!

00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:14.360
 Sam, oh, [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:16.360
 Do you hear anything, Father?

00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:18.360
 Oh, Sam!

00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:20.360
 Maybe they went a little farther into the woods.

00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:22.360
 Oh, man, they couldn't have gone.

00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:23.360
 What's the matter, Father?

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:25.360
 Nothing I just fell down again.

00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:27.360
 I never thought when I put this cut away on,

00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:29.360
 I'd be wearing it out hiking.

00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:31.360
 [audience laughter]

00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:33.360
 Do you watch your piece of wedding cake now?

00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:36.360
 I do not! All I want is that license!

00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:39.360
 Dear Homer, tryin' that light over this way.

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:40.360
 What is it?

00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:43.360
 A campsite. Somebody cook their supper here.

00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:44.360
 Where?

00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:46.360
 Right there. See ya. Siding can to burnt shoe.

00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:49.360
 [audience laughter]

00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:52.360
 Probably a couple of tramps. Come on over.

 [audience laughter]

00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:57.360
 Is...is that rain, I feel?

 Oh, Justin leaves rustling.

00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:03.360
 Was that leaves, too?

00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:06.360
 Oh, Sam! Sam Audrey!

00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:22.360
 Father, are you sure the front door was locked?

00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:24.360
 I am. Let's try the back door.

00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:26.360
 That's what I'm doing.

00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:29.360
 You don't you think we ought to call mother?

00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:30.360
 No.

00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:31.360
 Real softly?

00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:33.360
 There's no use disturbing your mother.

00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:34.360
 It's nearly midnight.

00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:35.360
 Bless you.

00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:36.360
 Thank you.

00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:39.360
 Mother, why couldn't we sleep over at the Browns?

00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:40.360
 We drove by the lights.

00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:41.360
 We're still on.

00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:42.360
 The guests are still there too.

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:45.360
 We're not walking in on any wedding party looking like this.

00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:48.360
 We're the last people in the world they want to see tonight.

00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:51.360
 Gee, even the windows are locked.

00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:53.360
 Father, I know what we could do.

00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:54.360
 What?

00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:59.440
 the garage no and your mother never let us hear the last of it oh incidentally when

00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:02.320

00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:06.680
 lost a frying pan how about your shoe that we lost well that was an old shoe I

00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:11.280

00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:34.920
 Wake up, you father!

00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:36.920
 I know it.

00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:38.920
 Hello?

00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:40.920
 Hello, is this Alice Aldrich?

00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:41.920
 Yes.

00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:43.920
 This is Margaret Kilmer next door.

00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:44.920
 Oh.

00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:46.920
 I don't want to laugh you in the middle of the night,

00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:50.920
 I got my bedroom window a moment ago I saw two men prowling round to a house.

00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:52.920
 - Oh, man? - Yes.

00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:54.920
 Are you sure everything is law?

00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:56.920
 Oh, yes. At least I think everything is.

00:23:56.920 --> 00:24:00.920
 Well, then I wouldn't worry dear. They'll probably go away in a few minutes.

00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:02.920
 Yes, of course.

00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:04.920
 I hope I am disturbed you.

00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:06.920
 Oh, no. No, not at all.

00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:08.920
 Goodbye.

00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:12.920
 - How do you want it? - It wasn't anyone. Mary, just Mrs. Kilmer.

00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:13.920
 Mrs. Kilmer?

00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:17.920
 She says not to worry, but there were two men outside.

00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:18.920
 Two men, mother?

00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:23.920
 Now don't be afraid. Every door and window is locked, except perhaps the cellar door.

00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:24.920
 Didn't we lock that?

00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:27.920
 Mary, we've got to go down and see whether we did or not.

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:28.920
 At this time of night?

00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:31.920
 Yes, dear. Let's not turn on any lights.

00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:33.920
 I won't, mother.

00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:38.920
 I don't wake you in the hall, dear, while I answer the phone.

00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:40.920
 Who do you suppose it is?

00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:43.920
 Hello?

00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:45.620
 Ms. Albright's this is Joe Graham.

00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:46.620
 Who?

00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:48.920
 You know the best man at John Lauren's wedding.

00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:49.920
 Oh yes!

00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:52.920
 Do you have any ideas to wear Mr. Brown on corner with?

00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:56.920
 Yes, up to McCorkel's rocks to look for Henry and Mr. Aldridge.

00:24:56.920 --> 00:24:59.920
 Well, they haven't come back yet. We're getting a bit worried.

00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:00.920
 My goodness.

00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:03.920
 Maybe I better take a couple of the guests and go out and try to find them.

00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:05.920
 Well, hope I didn't wake you up.

00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:07.920
 Oh no, not at all.

00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:08.920
 Bye!

00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:09.920
 Goodbye.

00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:10.920
 Mother!

00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:13.720
 Yes, dear. I just found out and locked the cellar door.

00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:14.620
 You locked it?

00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:16.420
 I never was so frightened in my life.

00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:18.220
 And I was just in time, Mother.

00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:20.620
 I could hear somebody right outside.

00:25:20.620 --> 00:25:23.420
 Dear, I'm sure we're perfectly safe. Everything is locked.

00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:27.420
 What's that?

00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:28.420
 Mary.

00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:31.420
 Listen, Mary.

00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:34.920
 Mary, someone's putting a ladder against the side of the house.

00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:36.720
 They're gonna climb in one of the windows.

00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:37.820
 Shouldn't we call the police?

00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:38.620
 Yes, dear.

00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:41.880
 And you all the time, Henry, shouldn't have left that ladder lying there on the ground.

00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:42.960
 Wasn't it broken?

00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:45.420
 I thought it was. I don't see how it was.

00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:49.260
 I thought it was!

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:15.620
 time is it so 10 minutes to three are we almost home father we are Mary yes

00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:20.240

00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:42.200
 bad Homer and Mr. Brown didn't get there for the ceremony. Well my goodness the

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:46.320
 way they looked when they did get back it's just as well. Anyway it was a very

00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:51.160
 nice wedding. Didn't you think the bride looked lovely? Oh yes mother. That is

00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:57.160
 sleepy perhaps but lovely. What's the like her so much? She was pretty darn cool

00:26:57.160 --> 00:27:00.160
 to me you don't say

00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:05.000
 a lot to father and all richard you can't you know certainly not enough to

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:05.880
 over

00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:07.560
 it's just

00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:09.520
 well it's just frankly

00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:16.520
 i think there was a little too much to hang in the air

00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:27.280
 Radar can't do the entire job of protecting our country from a surprise air attack.

00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:30.280
 That's up to us as individual citizens.

00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:36.280
 Right now, the air defense command needs 300,000 more volunteers for its ground observacore,

00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:42.280
 made up of patriotic citizens who contribute a few hours of their spare time each week.

00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:50.280
 Both men and women from teenage up can join the ground observacore and perform a valuable service to our country.

00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:52.760

 Hey, Ray, did you see your diary here?

00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:16.240
 She was, Molly, where did that come from?

00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:18.160
 I just came back with a laundry.

00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:19.600
 What's this piece of paper with it?

00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:20.960
 I didn't read it.

00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:25.640
 It says, "We cannot accept responsibility for laundering this article, but

00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:28.640
 suggest you send it to a reliable dry cleaner."

00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:43.360
