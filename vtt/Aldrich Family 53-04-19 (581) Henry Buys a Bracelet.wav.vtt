WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 They are free men.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:08.000
 The ambulance convoy, eight of them, United Nations ambulance is with red coffees,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
 standing at the far side of the tent, ready to come up at any moment.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 Everything has gone very smoothly.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
 The last of the men, the litic cases, came in last.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
 They're being checked by the doctors right now.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
 The men are getting coffee and cigarettes and a few comfort items.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.500
 The convoy that came down from the other end of the neutral zone came in six dilapidated

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.500
 looking ambulances.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.500
 Some were pointy, some gray.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.500
 They had red crosses painted on them.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:44.740
 The prisoners wore a blue-headed great coat, blue denim hat, and most of them found all

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:48.500
 blankets, blue in the shape of a horseshoe.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:54.500
 Now we have the name of that first man, Bob's Hairpoint can tell you more about it.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.900
 The first man, the first American to be turned over to what?

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:05.300
 Was Private Carl Sertkausen from Washington Heights, New York.

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.620
 He suffered from cross-pipe in both seats.

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.420
 He was with the Third Division when he was captured.

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.420
 He seems to be in pretty good spirits right now as do most of the other

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.220
 prisoners who so far been returned.

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.060
 All together we've gotten in a distance in the health arena,

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:29.060
 A number of cities, a couple of Filipinos, a place in the South African and 14 Americans.

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:34.060
 I just talked with the recent games, the training, who was handling this first part of the operation,

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.060
 and he said everything is going very well.

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:45.060
 The men are now being processed, and they should be on their way to freedom village in just a few moments.

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.060
 This is Bob's viewpoint at Hanwan Jump, and now back to the United States.

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.260
 We repeat that name again for you. The first American prisoner turned over to you and authorities in Korea.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.220
 He is private Carl W. Kirchhausen of

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:06.940
 214 Audubon Avenue Washington Heights, New York City. Meanwhile the names of 13 more American prisoners in tonight's exchange

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.660
 are expected to be released at 8 30 p.m.

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:18.380
 NBC will broadcast the names of all American prisoners released in the current exchange. Stay tuned your NBC station for the later news.

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.380
 Henry, Henry, Old Rich, coming mother.

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.380
 [applause]

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:31.380
 Yes, it's the Old Rich family of franchise, written by Clippett Goldsmith.

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.380
 [music playing]

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.380
 In every plan, there is always allowed a margin for error.

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.380
 Also, in any day with a typical teenage boy like Henry Aldrich in it,

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:59.380
 there's always a margin for error, or for excitement, or the unexpected.

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.380
 The scene opens in the Aldrich living room.

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.380
 But, Mother, you don't see my point of view.

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.380
 Henry, that's the trouble. I do see your point of view, but I don't think you're trying to see mine.

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.380
 Yes, I am sure I am. I've tried very hard to see your point, but geez.

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.380
 I just can't see it.

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.540
 Well, in the first place, Eleanor will misunderstand the whole thing.

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.540
 Why should she misunderstand?

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.180
 Look, Mother, why don't you try and see it from my point of view?

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.740
 Henry, I realize you want to give Eleanor something nice for her birthday, but this...

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:30.860
 Well, Henry, I still pay your entirely too young.

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:32.000
 Too young, Mother?

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.820
 You spend $18.5 an hour on that iron?

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:36.620
 Don't you see my point of view?

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:41.460
 Henry, for the last time, when a young man gives a young lady an extensive piece of jewelry,

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:43.900
 it usually carries some meaning with it.

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.980
 What meaning you mean she'd be insulted because it isn't gold I

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:52.200
 Mean dear. I think you should take it back to the jewelry store where you bought it and get something else

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.760
 Mother they haven't anything else in there, but jewelry

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:59.460
 That's an electric percolator and don't you think if I gave her a thing like that she's really misunderstand?

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:12.820
 My own oh wait a minute

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:15.820
 Oh, hello Homer. I didn't recognize you with a hat on.

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:17.820
 She was up and calling you for three blocks.

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.820
 You mind if I walk along with you? No.

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.820
 Oh, you hear this is your birthday. Many happy returns.

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.820
 Thank you, Homer. How did you know about it?

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.820
 Oh, I get around. I'll even happen to know one of the presents you're going to get.

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.820
 You do, Homer? Yeah, but I can't tell you.

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.820
 Oh, how do you happen to know so much? I got to use. I got to use.

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:41.820
 Who's giving it to me? Well, I can't tell you that either. I'm sworn to secrecy.

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:44.220
 Did you know you're two months older than Henry?

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:45.220
 I am.

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.220
 Yeah, it's not too bad.

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.820
 Maybe that's why he's buying you such a swell--

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.820
 I mean, is it Henry that's giving me something?

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:54.820
 Well, to be frank, yes.

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:56.820
 And I don't think it'll be too big for your wrist.

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:57.820
 I mean--

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:58.820
 But for my wrist?

00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:59.820
 She wish.

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:01.820
 You shouldn't have tried to guess the whole thing.

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:03.820
 Oh, I haven't the slightest idea of what it is, though.

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:04.820
 Well, sure you have.

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:06.820
 You just said yourself it was a bracelet.

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:07.820
 I did?

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:08.820
 Sure.

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:10.820
 And I'll bet you even know what kind it is.

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:16.900
 It's a silver bracelet and it has a padlock on it the shape of a heart with a key one of those homework

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.160
 I saw one in the store just the other day and

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:25.980
 Homer Henry is really giving me one of those bracelets. Yeah, but when you open the package be surprised fall right over

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:36.700
 Hello hello

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:40.900
 Yes, I heard you, Alice, but I still don't see what you're worrying about.

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:43.400
 Well, of course you don't, dear. You're a man.

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:48.500
 But, Sam, suppose Eleanor is crazy about Henry, and he gives her that very expensive bracelet.

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:50.500
 Well, there's only one thing she can think.

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:51.500
 What?

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:53.700
 Oh, Sam, you're simply being perverse.

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:56.600
 Well, I've just been talking with Harriet, and she agrees with me.

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:00.400
 Alice, right this minute, I'm busy. Can you call me back in half an hour?

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.000
 But what isn't clear about it?

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.100
 That isn't what I mean. I'm in a conference right now, and I haven't time to discuss Eleanor Wentworth's birthday.

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:08.700
 Well, very well then, dear, goodbye.

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:10.260
 Goodbye.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.260
 Now then, Mr. Roberts, I'm sorry we were interrupted.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.260
 Mr. Alberich, what I want granted is a complete right of weight.

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:16.460
 I agree.

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:18.060
 But I think they should give you something.

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:20.260
 They should give you--

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.820
 did you ever give a girl a piece of jewelry?

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:25.220
 You mean besides my wife?

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:26.500
 Well, let me put it this way.

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:27.860
 Have you any children?

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:28.700
 No, sir.

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:29.860
 I'm sorry to say we haven't.

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:30.980
 What's your problem?

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:32.500
 Well, we have a son in high school, see?

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:34.780
 And he's apparently trying to give some girl.

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:35.700
 She's a very nice girl.

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:37.960
 I'll say that for him an expensive bracelet.

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:38.900
 Yes.

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:40.860
 Diamonds?

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:41.700
 Diamond?

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:43.860
 No, I don't think he went as far as diamonds.

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:45.860
 Then it rated cost around $18.

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:48.020
 And you feel you all think of us something better?

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:50.780
 Oh, no, Mrs. Always feel it's too much.

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:52.940
 That is, and proportion to--

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:58.620
 to-- well, now getting back to that right of weight.

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:00.420
 Oh, yes, yes.

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:02.700
 Well, when you draw up the papers, Mr. Alwaysch,

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:05.020
 I wanted made clear in the first paragraph

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:10.020
 But just what is it that's troubling your wife, Mr. Albridge?

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:12.020
 (audience laughs)

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:14.020
 Do you think a girl would assume she would engage

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:15.020
 if she received a bracelet?

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:16.020
 Well, why would she?

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:18.020
 That's exactly what I told my wife.

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:20.020
 Where do women get these ideas?

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:22.020
 But getting back to that right away, Mr. Albridge.

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:26.020
 (lively music)

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:36.020
 But, Mother, I don't even think you've tried to see my going to be alone.

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:39.020
 Eleanor, for the last time, I think you'd be making a great mistake.

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:42.020
 But, Mother, Homer says it's just an innocent...

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:45.020
 An innocent Facebook with a padlock of shape of a heart,

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:47.020
 and I've always had my heart set on fire.

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:50.020
 Well, dear, perhaps someday your father, now I'll get you one.

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:52.020
 Overcoming from Henrietta, so much more!

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:54.020
 That it's just the pulling. Mother, where are you going?

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:57.020
 Into the living room and have a talk with your father.

00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:59.020
 And the piece doesn't all right for me to accept it, may I?

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:02.020
 That's a very foolish question, dear, because you know very well

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:03.620
 Your father's going to say no.

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:05.820
 Betty, I'm going to say no to what?

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:08.120
 Bob, do you know what home is told, Eleanor?

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:09.700
 Henry is coming over here this evening

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:12.100
 to give her a very expensive silver bracelet.

00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:12.940
 Yeah?

00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:14.580
 Wonder where he got the money.

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:17.060
 Do you think that's the main thing for us to worry about?

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:19.420
 Don't you realize we have to assume a little responsibility

00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:20.500
 in raising our daughter?

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:22.180
 Ah, there's nothing wrong with Eleanor.

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:24.740
 And besides, do you realize the front doorbell is ringing?

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:25.860
 I'll answer it.

00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:28.620
 But dear, I can cook three meals a day for this family

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:30.260
 and make all decisions, too.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:33.760
 Elizabeth, don't you think we ought to see the bracelet before we decide any time?

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:34.660
 I do not.

00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:36.160
 I'll see who's at the door, mother.

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:36.860
 I'll see who it is.

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:38.460
 Eleanor, have you been crying?

00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:39.660
 No, mother.

00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:41.460
 My goodness, my eyes are just tired.

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:43.860
 Here, I think you were making him tired too much of it.

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:53.260
 Oh, hello,

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:54.860
 I want to ask you something.

00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:57.060
 Don't mention the fact that it was on a bracelet, will you?

00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:57.760
 Why not?

00:08:57.760 --> 00:08:59.760
 Well, she wants one and I haven't got the money.

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:01.760
 [audience laughter]

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:03.260
 Say, have you been crying?

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:04.260
 C'mon!

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:05.760
 Of course I haven't!

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:06.760
 Oh.

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:08.260
 What is it, Sunburn?

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:09.260
 No.

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:10.260
 Would you mind going home, Homer?

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:11.260
 No?

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:12.260
 Yes, please.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:13.260
 Get down off this porch.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:14.260
 I mean, I said something I shouldn't have.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:15.760
 I didn't say you said anything.

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:17.760
 Only can't I be alone if I want to.

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:28.760
 [music]

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:30.520
 Who are you going, Henry?

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:32.360
 Henry, can't you tell me where you're going?

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:34.360
 Homer, will you please stop bumping into me?

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:36.360
 She was just shoving me all over the sidewalk.

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:37.440
 All right, Henry, all right.

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:38.760
 If you're not interested.

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:40.000
 I was just going to tell you something

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.440
 that died important.

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:42.440
 What about Eleanor?

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:44.040
 But never mind, that's all right.

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:45.800
 What about Eleanor?

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:47.680
 Don't you think she saw it a moody?

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:49.200
 Whoo, Eleanor?

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:51.480
 Listen, Homer, Eleanor has one of the most cheerful

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:53.280
 dispositions of any girl I've ever known.

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:54.720
 Sure, I agree with you.

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:58.080
 Then the next minute she can kick you right off her front porch.

00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:59.760
 Listen, Homer, let's have an understanding.

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:01.840
 Right here at this corner. Which way are you turning?

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:03.880
 Which way are you? I'm going right down the street here.

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:04.880
 All right, I'll come along.

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:08.040
 Are you going to the Santa Fe jewelry store?

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:10.080
 How do you know I am?

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:12.160
 Well, she always, I just recognized that package.

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:15.320
 - What are you going in there for? - Never mind. Just never mind.

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:17.640
 Are you taking Eleanor's bracelet in to have it engraved?

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:20.840
 Listen, who told you I got her a bracelet?

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:22.120
 I get around, Henry.

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:25.920
 Do you know where I could buy one for Agnes for less than $18.5?

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:28.320
 How do you know this one cost about much?

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:29.520
 I get around, hand me.

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:32.820
 Listen, where did you get $18.5?

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:35.020
 I tried to borrow a quarter from you yesterday.

00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:37.520
 Homer, for the last time with you, please run along,

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:39.020
 I'm going into this store.

00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:40.520
 Don't you want me to come in with you?

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:42.520
 No, now go away. Go on away, Homer.

00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:45.020
 You know, Henry, you're moody in an Eleanor.

00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:47.520
 And don't hang around outside that window.

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:49.820
 You something I can do for your young man?

00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:51.620
 Yes, sir. I want to have a little talk with you.

00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:52.620
 Yes, sir.

00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:56.320
 Oh, you're the young fellow who bought that very beautiful silver hand

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:57.660
 I'm robbed of bracelet.

00:10:57.660 --> 00:10:58.860
 Yes.

00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:00.420
 Could we step back here a ways?

00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:01.480
 I beg your pardon?

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:05.020
 Well, I brought this bracelet back because you see.

00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:06.580
 There's something wrong with it?

00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:07.900
 Oh no, there's anything wrong with it.

00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:10.740
 But when I got home, my mother--

00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:12.340
 whether she has some bad news for me.

00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:13.900
 You mean your mother doesn't want you to keep her?

00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:14.940
 Oh no, no, it isn't back.

00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:16.740
 You see, my girl--

00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:19.260
 you see, well, it's this way.

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:20.340
 Doesn't she like it?

00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:21.540
 She hasn't even seen it.

00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:23.100
 Oh, she's gone away?

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:24.740
 Well, in a way, she has.

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:27.140
 Well, that place will be a nice surprise for her.

00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:28.540
 I'll wrap it up and send it to her.

00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:30.040
 Oh, no, no. You can't do a thing like that.

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:31.540
 Why not? It's too late.

00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:33.040
 My mother says the way things are now,

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:34.740
 it wouldn't be right for me to give it to her.

00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:37.440
 Oh, she's marrying someone else, huh?

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:40.440
 Well, why not give it to her and call it a wedding present?

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:41.740
 A wedding present?

00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:44.740
 Or how about that percolator up there for three more dollars?

00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:45.740
 Oh, no.

00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:48.140
 Oh, I think I'd just like to get my money back.

00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:49.340
 Your money back?

00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:51.940
 Well, before we do anything as rash as all that,

00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:54.140
 have you seen these ladies ring?

00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:58.340
 They look just like diamonds, imported precious stones from Denver.

00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:01.740
 And I challenge you to tell the difference between these and real diamonds.

00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:03.740
 But wouldn't I just have my money back?

00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:16.140
 - You have some celery, Ethel? - No, thank you, Gary.

00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:18.740
 Now, what was it you stopped to tell me about Mr. Aldrich?

00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:22.740
 Well, I was in his office today, seeing his wife calls and she's all upset.

00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:28.340
 They've got a boy in high school who wants to give his girls some kind of a piece of jewelry and she didn't think he should.

00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:30.140
 Then I certainly agree with her.

00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:31.240
 You agree with her?

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:34.240
 What's wrong with the boy giving his girl a birthday present if he wants to?

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:35.940
 That's because you've never had any children.

00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:38.440
 What do you mean, I've never had any children? You've never had any either.

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:39.440
 But I'm a woman!

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:41.440
 [laughter]

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:45.840
 And Gary, it isn't necessary for you to point that story at me.

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:49.140
 I'm not pointing it at you. I just want to know what's wrong with a kid doing it.

00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:50.340
 What's wrong with it?

00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:51.940
 It just isn't done that, though.

00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:54.440
 Who said so? Past the law that said it isn't done.

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:58.840
 Gary, in the first place, any present from a boy means a great deal to a girl, let alone jewelry.

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:00.040
 Why shouldn't it mean anything?

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:03.640
 Don't you remember on my 16th birthday when you gave me some handkerchiefs?

00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:05.240
 Angerchiefs? What's that got to do with it?

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:07.640
 Well, we got married, didn't we?

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:09.640
 Always. That what did it?

00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:10.940
 No, no, no.

00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:14.440
 Gary, for the last time, stop shaking that sewing in my face.

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:23.040
 Oh, Mary. What do you say, Henry?

00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:26.640
 Well, look, could you keep something under your hat and not bother mother about it?

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:28.640
 Didn't you pass on all your subjects this month?

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:31.840
 Oh, yeah, sure. But I was downtown just now in this salesman.

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:33.240
 I mean...

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:37.440
 How would you like to buy a nice $18.5 bracelet cheap?

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:39.840
 Why Henry, how rich? Where did you get that?

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:41.840
 Mary, don't wave it around where everyone can see it.

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:45.240
 Listen, I'll sell it to you for $17.

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:47.040
 I haven't got $17.

00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:48.040
 We got $16?

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:49.440
 No. How about $15?

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:51.740
 Henry, I haven't got $15 on broke.

00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:53.540
 But she whiz.

00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:55.040
 Well, look, as long as you can't buy it, Mary.

00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:57.000
 Do you see anything against my giving a thing like this

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.400
 is a present?

00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:01.940
 I hadn't read that awfully sweet of you.

00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:02.840
 Now, wait a minute, Mary.

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:03.640
 Give it back to me.

00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:04.940
 I didn't mean--

00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:08.040
 Mary, I was just asking you a hypothetical question.

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:09.840
 You mean you're taking it back?

00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:12.600
 I don't even got $14.

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:13.240
 Mary?

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:14.080
 Yes, mother?

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:15.720
 Will you please come here a minute?

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:16.640
 Why?

00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:18.480
 Oh, yes, you're in just a second.

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:19.980
 Mary Holbeast, aren't they?

00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:22.380
 Henry, I want you to bring that bracelet with you.

00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:23.780
 The bracelet?

00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:24.980
 How did you...

00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:27.180
 Oh, look, Mother, I'm not disobeying you.

00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:30.480
 I just thought Mary would like to buy it and keep it in the family.

00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:33.480
 Dear, I thought you told me you'd return that bracelet.

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:36.680
 Oh, no, Mother. What I told you was I took it back down to the jewelry store.

00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:38.480
 But the fella was so nice to me.

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:41.180
 He said he thought I was making a great mistake and not keeping it.

00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:43.680
 But did you tell him I said you would have got your money back?

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:44.680
 Oh, yeah, sure.

00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:48.180
 And he said you probably meant very well, but you didn't know what was going on in the world.

00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:49.180
 He said what?

00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:52.680
 She mother, he said, "Powers give girls presents like this every day in the year."

00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:58.180
 Henry, I want you to take that bracelet and go downtown to that jewelry store and get your money back at once.

00:14:58.180 --> 00:15:01.180
 And let them think our whole family doesn't know what's going on anyplace?

00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:04.180
 I don't care what he thinks. Now, please start.

00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:05.680
 Yes, mother.

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:08.680
 And as a matter of fact, I think he took advantage of you.

00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:11.680
 Of me? How could anyone take advantage of me?

00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:13.180
 - All right. - Yes, ma'am?

00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:15.180
 Mrs. Markle was just on the phone.

00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:16.680
 Oh, Villy, what did she want?

00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:21.240
 She said she didn't like to butt in, but she thought she had a solution to some problem we have.

00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:23.040
 You mean about the bracelet?

00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:24.040
 The bracelet.

00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:26.320
 Alice, have you been spreading that all around town?

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:27.160
 Now, Sam.

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:30.720
 Mother, Mother, could you consider this from just one other angle?

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:32.560
 Henry, stop.

00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:33.720
 Yes, Mother.

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:44.840
 Homer, will you give me nine dollars for us?

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:47.280
 I have to pay the whole nine dollars in cash in me.

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:49.280
 You mean you want a little time on it?

00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:51.180
 Well, she with the stores are closing in an hour home,

00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:53.180
 and I got to get something for Eleanor for her birthday.

00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:54.080
 I can't just--

00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:55.240
 Well, as a matter of fact, Kim, she

00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:58.240
 may be pretty disappointed if she doesn't get this bracelet.

00:15:58.240 --> 00:15:59.280
 Well, she doesn't know anything about it,

00:15:59.280 --> 00:15:59.780
 home.

00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:01.720
 I haven't so much as mentioned to her.

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:02.920
 No, I know you haven't.

00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:04.560
 But I have a hunch.

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:06.840
 I mean, something tells me that this bracelet is what

00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:07.920
 she's looking forward to.

00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:08.520
 Just the same.

00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:10.360
 Will you give me $6 for it?

00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:10.800
 $6?

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:12.520
 I guess it would be crazy about it, Homer.

00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:13.000
 I know.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.240
 But you know what the guy at the jewelry store

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:17.840
 told me when I took it back the second time he said there won't be another bracelet

00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:23.160
 like this one around until crawl even then they may not make them why that isn't

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:27.620
 the point Homer he said with any year this bracelet will double in value it will

00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:30.800
 well sure and then a fagnes gets mad and gives it back to you look at the

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:33.640
 profit you've made

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:44.000
 - Alice? - Yes, sir?

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.840
 Did Henry get the bracelet thing settled?

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:47.540
 Yes, dear, apparently he did.

00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:49.940
 He said he's going that downtown in just a few minutes

00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:53.340
 and see whether he can find a nice present for Eleanor for $6.

00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:56.940
 Yes? I don't know, but what I agree to that part of it,

00:16:56.940 --> 00:16:59.540
 although I still say the whole thing's a tempest in a teapot.

00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:03.340
 - Now, Sam... - Alice, all the boys in town are apparently doing it.

00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:05.040
 Didn't Henry tell you about Homer?

00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:07.240
 He's giving Agnes a bracelet exactly like the one

00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:08.840
 Henry was going to give Eleanor.

00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:11.340
 Really? And Homer's folks don't object?

00:17:11.340 --> 00:17:15.060
 No. Will Brown agreed with me. What's wrong with it?

00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:17.140
 Well, don't get Henry all upset again.

00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:20.940
 He's come around to our point of view and taking the whole thing very nicely.

00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:22.940
 That's more than his Aunt Harriet did.

00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:25.740
 It's just what voted she said when she phoned Sam.

00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:28.860
 She said she'd disgust the whole thing with her bridge clap.

00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:31.940
 And they all agreed Henry shouldn't give Ellen another bracelet.

00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:33.500
 Really?

00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:37.060
 And when I asked if they took a standing vote on it, she hung up.

00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:40.660
 I bet anything Aunt Harriet called back to say they've taken a vote.

00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:42.660
 You better let me take a stand.

00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:43.940
 Hello?

00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:44.860
 Hello?

00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:46.180
 Is this Mrs. Orridge?

00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:46.780
 Yes?

00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:48.180
 Mrs. Apple-Robot.

00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:50.260
 Oh, yes, Mrs. Robert. Hello.

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:53.820
 Mrs. Orridge, my husband was down at your husband's office this morning and...

00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:55.860
 I know you think it's none of my business.

00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:59.260
 But Gary and I have just thought of something that may interest you.

00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:00.500
 Really? What is it?

00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:04.980
 Well, we have come friends who have a boy and they had exactly the same problem you have.

00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:09.180
 He wanted to spend every cent he could on a pair of earrings for some girl.

00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:11.740
 And do you know how his parents went away from it?

00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:12.740
 Oh.

00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:14.780
 They sent him on a trip to the Canadian Rockies

00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:16.780
 and hired a guy who took him into the woods

00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:19.580
 and he didn't even see a girl for a month.

00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:20.780
 You don't say so.

00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:22.900
 And when they came out, he'd gotten all about the girl

00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:24.660
 and was crazy about the guy.

00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:25.660
 Really?

00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:28.100
 And instead of the hearing, he sent this girl

00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:31.260
 a lovely dear's head with Adler.

00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:32.740
 Really?

00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:34.980
 Of course you cast him, Henry that saw.

00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:36.900
 Vacation hadn't even started.

00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:41.300
 But many men always define some thick wood near home where we could go and forget.

00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:42.300
 Yes.

00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:44.300
 Well, thank you very much.

00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:45.300
 I was in crime all right.

00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:47.300
 And do let me know how everything comes out.

00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:48.300
 Out of the woods?

00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:49.300
 Oh, well, I know.

00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:52.300
 I suppose in one way that's where we all are in this.

00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:53.300
 Yes, aren't we?

00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:54.300
 Well, good-bye.

00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:55.300
 Good-bye.

00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:56.300
 What was that, Alice?

00:18:56.300 --> 00:18:59.300
 Well, somebody else, Sam, worrying about Henry.

00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:03.300
 Now do you see how this town would have talked if we let him go ahead?

00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:04.300
 Goodbye, Mother.

00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:05.300
 I'm going downtown to see what I can find.

00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:06.300
 Oh, just a minute, dear.

00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:07.880
 a minute here.

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:11.740
 Sam, how much would a nice deer's head cost?

00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:12.900
 A nice what?

00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:14.660
 Well, I don't mean anything fancy.

00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:16.220
 No antlers.

00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:17.860
 A deer's head, Morgan?

00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:19.060
 Yes, Henry.

00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:20.660
 You mean one of stone?

00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:21.820
 No, Sam.

00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:23.020
 Only stuffed.

00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:24.980
 Alice, what are you talking about?

00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:26.500
 My goodness, if that's somebody else

00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:28.020
 trying to tell us how to--

00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:30.180
 If they can't suggest anything better than a deer's head,

00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:31.180
 hang up.

00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:33.060
 [LAUGHTER]

00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:33.560
 Hello?

00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:35.300
 Hello, Mrs. Al, would you tell me there?

00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:37.380
 Oh, yes, Homer. He's right here by the phone.

00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:38.980
 Oh, Dr. Meemaw, but she whizz.

00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:39.980
 Hello?

00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:41.660
 Hello, Henry. My mother says it's all off.

00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:42.660
 What's that?

00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:44.300
 When I told her I was going to get back to that place,

00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:45.580
 but she nearly hit the ceiling.

00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:48.100
 I want my $6 back.

00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:49.700
 Didn't you tell her what I told you to?

00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:51.700
 Sure. And she said, "Am I giving back to the fact

00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:53.140
 that you have for mine for life?"

00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:55.500
 Homer, she's faunpy that narrow-minded.

00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:57.140
 Look at what you're doing to me.

00:19:57.140 --> 00:19:58.140
 [LAUGHTER]

00:19:58.140 --> 00:19:59.140
 [APPLAUSE]

00:19:59.140 --> 00:20:00.140
 Thank you so much, Homer.

00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:01.140
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:02.140
 [APPLAUSE]

00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:03.140
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:09.780
 [applause]

00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:12.920
 We'll return to the Aldrich family in just a moment.

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:15.580
 Tonight, Thea DeGilles on the air will present

00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:18.740
 the Petrified Forest by Robert E. Sherwood, starring

00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:20.300
 Jerome Power.

00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:23.260
 This is another performance by some of the superb actors

00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:26.660
 that Thea DeGilles has teamed up with the outstanding plays

00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:28.460
 of the past and present.

00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:30.660
 Of course, no Sunday would be complete without a visit

00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:32.860
 to those two happy householders,

00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:35.000
 Phil Harris, now it's safe.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.000
 Then your two regular NBC thrillers,

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:39.500
 Dragnet, Barry Craig,

00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:42.340
 confidential investigator, come along next.

00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:45.600
 So for the Pops in Sunday night radio entertainment,

00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:48.040
 stay tuned to NBC.

00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:50.620
 (lively music)

00:20:50.620 --> 00:21:02.620
 [Music]

00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:05.620
 Now getting back to the troubles of Henry Audrey.

00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:10.620
 Henry has been trying unsuccessfully to get his money back on a bracelet that he bought for Eleanor,

00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:14.620
 and that his mother felt was famous, understood as a gift.

00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:16.620
 The scene opens in Eleanor's living room.

00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:19.620
 But Mother, I still don't understand your point of view.

00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:23.620
 Well, I know your father and I were both seven years older than you and Henry before he gave me anything.

00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:26.620
 And even then, do you know what his first present was?

00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:27.620
 What?

00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:30.620
 It was simple and it was in good taste, but it was very nice.

00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:31.620
 What was it?

00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:34.620
 Another bound volume of poems by Lord Tennyson.

00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:35.620
 Lord Tennyson.

00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:40.620
 With good edge pages and that booklet more than me than anything I've ever owned.

00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:41.620
 Really?

00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:45.620
 And on the fly, maybe inscribed so many worlds, so much to do.

00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:48.620
 So little done such things to be.

00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:52.620
 But mother, the lock on the bracelet looks just like a padlock.

00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:54.620
 Homos, you can even open it with a key.

00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:55.620
 Ellen, haven't you been listening?

00:21:55.620 --> 00:21:58.620
 Betty, are you still worrying about that bracelet?

00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:00.620
 Bob, I'm not worrying about it.

00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:02.620
 I'm simply trying to show her all the way to you.

00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:05.620
 Now, Betty, why not look at the whole thing this way?

00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:08.040
 (jazz music)

00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:20.620
 - I don't think you understand me.

00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:22.800
 All my friend wants me to do is give you this bracelet

00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:24.260
 and get his money back for him.

00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:25.180
 - I see.

00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:26.740
 - So could I have it please.

00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:30.660
 - How about this string of genuine jade beads for $10?

00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:32.420
 - Well I wouldn't be bad.

00:22:32.420 --> 00:22:34.260
 Would they be classified as jewelry?

00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:40.940
 Jewelry don't be foolish why would be be classified as jewelry the only thing is he said I should get his money back

00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:46.420
 He's in a very embarrassing situation. I know all about it. His girl is marrying someone else. Yes

00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:49.340
 You mean she ever oh

00:22:49.340 --> 00:22:53.460
 Oh, well gee, it's worse than that what happened she died

00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:55.940
 die

00:22:55.940 --> 00:23:00.100
 Oh, well, yes, sir, and he's gonna get us something else. I mean he wants his money back

00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:02.620
 He doesn't want to get something nice for himself.

00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:04.020
 He wants his money back.

00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:06.100
 And look, I've got a phone this girl right this minute.

00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:07.180
 I thought she was there.

00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:08.540
 She is, but I want to warn her.

00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:10.060
 I mean, her family.

00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:12.580
 I don't want a family that she isn't going to get--

00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:14.860
 I mean, it's very bad news.

00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:17.020
 How about a pen and pencil set?

00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:20.540
 Well, Calvin, I made it clear he wants his money back.

00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:23.260
 Listen, I've got a brother that's got a store off the street.

00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:25.380
 Now, how would you like to take a look at what he's got?

00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:28.380
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:30.960
 (upbeat music)

00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:38.940
 Eleanor, I don't think it's very nice

00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:40.900
 if you just saw it on your birthday.

00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:42.380
 I'm not talking, mother.

00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:44.060
 I just don't feel like talking to anybody.

00:23:44.060 --> 00:23:46.460
 Betty, what were all those phone calls

00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:48.460
 you've been taking for the last couple of hours?

00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:50.420
 Thankfully, Bob, they were all friends of ours.

00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:52.380
 Why do you know if we were really going to let Eleanor

00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:54.140
 accept that bracelet? (gasps)

00:23:54.140 --> 00:23:54.980
 Oh, my goodness!

00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:55.820
 Now, Eleanor!

00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:57.660
 The girl's right, it's nobody's business but ours.

00:23:57.660 --> 00:24:00.700
 As a matter of fact, I think it shows a very healthy interest.

00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:03.460
 And incidentally, Agnes Lawson's mother calls.

00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:08.460
 Why? They heard this afternoon somehow that Homer's planning to give Agnes an expensive bracelet too.

00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:09.860
 What stand are they taking?

00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:13.260
 What to tell the truth, Bob? The Lawson family is split wide open.

00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:15.760
 Which are they against? The bracelet or Homer?

00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:20.060
 Oh my goodness, that won't be heavy right now.

00:24:20.060 --> 00:24:22.960
 Now remember, Eleanor, about everything else you are a lady.

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:24.860
 Mother, won't you please change your mind.

00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:25.860
 Now be here.

00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:27.560
 Eleanor, don't run to the door.

00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:28.960
 Walk like a lady.

00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:31.560
 I'm walking, Father.

00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:32.640
 Hi, Eleanor.

00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:34.280
 I'm a many happy return to the day.

00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:35.720
 Thank you, Henry.

00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:36.840
 Who wants to come in?

00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:38.360
 OK.

00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:39.880
 Hi.

00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:40.880
 Are your folks home?

00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:41.480
 Yeah.

00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:43.560
 Mother and Father just went out into the kitchen.

00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:45.280
 Shall we go in the living room?

00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:46.640
 All right.

00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:49.480
 I've got a little present here for you.

00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:50.680
 For me, Henry?

00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:52.400
 The only thing is, before I give it to you,

00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:53.440
 I want to tell you something.

00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:55.720
 Well, Henry, first before you tell me anything,

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:59.080
 I feel I ought to say something to you.

00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:01.320
 You do? What about?

00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:03.320
 About that present you have there.

00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:07.520
 Henry, frankly, it was awfully sweet of you to get in your bracelet.

00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:08.520
 I mean...

00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:10.720
 Well, look, Eleanor, do you mind if I tell you something?

00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:13.120
 Because here's the way everybody feels about it.

00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:14.520
 Eleanor, yes, Mother.

00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:16.320
 Will you step on here to the front hall, please?

00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:18.720
 Yes, Mother. Only I think you're on never-sarily worried

00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:20.720
 because I gave you my words.

00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:21.920
 Excuse me, Henry.

00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:22.520
 Sure.

00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:24.320
 Eleanor, I haven't accused you of anything.

00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:25.820
 I simply want to speak to you.

00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:27.020
 What about, Mother?

00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:28.360
 Your father and I have just been talking

00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:30.120
 with Agnes Lawson's mother again.

00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:31.360
 Since she, your parents,

00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:32.360
 raise random and Agnes,

00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:34.560
 accept her bracelet from Homer.

00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:37.260
 I guess we'll have to let you keep Henry.

00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:38.400
 Oh, Mother!

00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:39.860
 But you explained that it isn't

00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:41.100
 a single thing,

00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:43.100
 that at best it's only a birthday present.

00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:44.240
 Oh, yes, Mother!

00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:45.640
 You understand the circumstance.

00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:46.640
 Oh, yes, Mother!

00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:48.000
 Of course I do.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:48.840
 Oh, Henry!

00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:50.240
 Yes, O'Nore.

00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:51.140
 Thank you, Mother.

00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:52.140
 Thank you, very much.

00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:53.180
 Don't beg me.

00:25:53.180 --> 00:25:56.180
 I'm awfully sorry to keep you waiting like this.

00:25:56.180 --> 00:25:59.180
 Henry, what was it you were going to say about that present you have?

00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:02.180
 I'll tell you. Why don't we just wait?

00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:04.180
 Oh, we don't have to do a thing like that. Henry?

00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:07.180
 Well, Henry, sometimes when a boy gives a girl something,

00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:10.180
 it's completely misunderstood. You know what I mean?

00:26:10.180 --> 00:26:14.180
 It is. But it's a girl that's sensible and realizes that it's just a present.

00:26:14.180 --> 00:26:16.180
 Well, without any special transmit connection.

00:26:16.180 --> 00:26:20.180
 Just the same element. I think... No, no, I don't think I better give you this.

00:26:20.180 --> 00:26:21.180
 I better give you this.

00:26:21.180 --> 00:26:24.180
 I know you're excuse me, I've got to make you give that to me.

00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:26.180
 You mean you're going to take it away from me?

00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:28.180
 Henry, I can hardly wait to open it.

00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:29.180
 I don't think you're going to like it though.

00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:31.180
 Oh yes I am.

00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:32.180
 And I know what you've done.

00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:35.180
 You put it in this big box of booming.

00:26:35.180 --> 00:26:37.180
 But that was already in the bracelet.

00:26:37.180 --> 00:26:40.180
 It isn't.

00:26:40.180 --> 00:26:44.180
 You mean it couldn't possibly be a bracelet?

00:26:44.180 --> 00:26:46.180
 Nope.

00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:47.180
 You want to give it back?

00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:48.180
 No.

00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:50.940
 My goodness, if the girl was sensible about what a person gives,

00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:52.140
 it really doesn't make any difference.

00:26:52.140 --> 00:26:53.440
 What it is, only...

00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:55.440
 I don't understand how I've done this thing.

00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:58.180
 You can go ahead and open it, if you'd like.

00:26:58.180 --> 00:26:59.680
 All right.

00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:01.680
 My goodness, what is it?

00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:03.180
 It's a...

00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:05.180
 It's a book.

00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:06.180
 A book?

00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:07.680
 Well, isn't that nice?

00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:08.680
 It's leather.

00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:10.680
 Leather.

00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:12.180
 Oh, hang it.

00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:13.680
 It's "Tannison."

00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:15.680
 The poems of Lord Tennyson.

00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:18.640
 Sure. The bookstore was the only store still open.

00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:22.940
 Oh, Henry. Of all the things you could have given me.

00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:27.040
 Anything else? Well, it would have just been another present, but...

00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:31.760
 Lord, Tennyson, do you know what happened to my mother?

00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:34.020
 You like it?

00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:35.200
 You mean you really like it?

00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:39.720
 Henry, as long as I live, it's going to mean more to me than anything I own.

00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:41.840
 Would you like something on the fly, please?

00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:44.200
 Sure. Oh, my handwriting isn't very good.

00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:45.360
 Oh, that part is important.

00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:47.600
 Just take your fountain can and write.

00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:50.760
 Don't worry, so much to do.

00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:53.040
 So little done, such things to be.

00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:57.400
 (audience applauding)

00:27:57.400 --> 00:27:59.980
 (upbeat music)

00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:09.960
 (somber music)

00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:19.960
 The Aldrich family is transcribed as written by Clifford Golsen.

00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:22.960
 Henry is played by Bobby Ellis and homa by Jack Grime.

00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:25.960
 Mr. and Mrs. Aldrich are house Jameson and Barbara Robin.

00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:27.960
 Your announcer is Dick Dutton.

00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:34.960
 In two hours, a special war prisoners released report on NBC.

00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:36.960
 NBC.

00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:39.040
 (buzzer)
