00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.480
 [Music]

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:18.000
 And now the Jell-O family presents Henry, Henry Oldridge. Come here, mother.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.720
 [Applause]

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.760
 Yes, it's the Oldridge family based on characters originated by Flippigold Smith,

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:35.920
 and starring Ezra Stone as Henry with Jackie Kelt as Homer. And yes, it's the Jell-O family.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.760
 [Music]

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:45.360
 Oh, the Big Red Ladder stand for the Jell-O family. Oh, the Big Red Ladder stand for the Jell-O family.

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:52.560
 Back Jell-O Union, yeah. Jell-O Pudding, yum, yum, yum. Jell-O Taffy, Oka Pudding, yes, sir.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.560
 And now for the Aldrich family.

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:12.560
 Right in the middle of everyone's memories, there is always a teenage boy.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.560
 And if he's like Henry Aldrich, he is right in the middle of plenty of other things too.

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.560
 The scene is the Aldrich living room. The time is evening.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.560
 Alice! In his sand!

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.960
 There's the ex-relief for the dining room table.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:26.960
 Why, dear?

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.360
 I thought I'd have the committee work in there.

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:29.960
 And we're going to need lots of room.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:30.960
 Let me see.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.560
 The last time I saw that Lee Henry was using it on his bed for a desk.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:36.560
 A desk?

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:37.860
 Yes, he was doing his homework.

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:38.860
 In bed?

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.460
 Yeah, that's the place he seems to concentrate this.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.160
 I'll ask him what he did with it.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:44.160
 You mean he's still here?

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.160
 Yes.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.860
 I've been trying to get the financial committee together for weeks.

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.360
 And we'll need all the peace and quiet we can get.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.860
 Sam, I give you my word.

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.220
 Henry will be at the school play where he can't possibly bother you.

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.260
 Meanwhile, why not sit down?

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.860
 Of course.

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:58.860
 You were all flush.

00:01:58.860 --> 00:01:59.460
 I'm all right.

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.060
 I've been married to you long enough to know when you're flush.

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.860
 Now I remember it's in the whole closet.

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:06.460
 What is?

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.460
 You see how over here did you are?

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.460
 The leaf for the dining room table.

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:11.360
 Mother!

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.560
 They're waiting!

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:13.860
 In here, dear!

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:14.360
 Good night, Mother.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.260
 Good night, Father.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.060
 Good night, Henry.

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.660
 Turn around.

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:17.860
 Let me see how you look.

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.260
 Mother!

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.960
 Dear, why are you wearing that old blue tie?

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.460
 Why didn't you wear that nice one?

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.100
 Aunt Harriet gave you for Christmas.

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.100
 The red one.

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.460
 The red one, mother?

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:28.860
 To the theater?

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.760
 She was, do you want Gladys to think I have no breeding?

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.260
 No, I suppose it's all right.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.780
 Now, do you have your ticket?

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.740
 She was sure right here.

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:38.580
 A hanky?

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:39.580
 I've got two of them.

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.580
 One up here, one down here.

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:42.420
 (audience laughing)

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.460
 Did you tie your money up in it?

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.460
 Gee, mother, how juvenile do you think I am?

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.620
 Henry, you've got to learn not to ask leading questions.

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.620
 What about the pins in your new shirt?

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:54.620
 Did you get them all out?

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:55.620
 Of course!

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.620
 Well, check the tails again.

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.620
 I wouldn't want you to sit on a pin and do it your time.

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.620
 I give you my word, Mother. There isn't a pin on me.

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.620
 And boy, I better get going. This is my first date with Gladys.

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.620
 And I don't want to keep her waiting. Good night, you all.

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:10.620
 Drive carefully, dear.

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.620
 Be sure you've got enough gas.

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.620
 There's plenty, Father. I checked the car from head to toe this afternoon.

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.620
 I even washed it.

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.620
 Alice, was that our son?

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.620
 My goodness, he certainly seemed to have everything in hand, didn't he?

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.620
 Doesn't that please you?

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.620
 I'm not sure.

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:32.620
 What?

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:36.620
 I mean, Sam, he doesn't seem to need us anymore.

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.620
 You'll always need his allowance.

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.620
 Yes, I'm serious. He's growing up.

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.620
 It was inevitable, Alice. It's nothing to cry about.

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.620
 I'm not crying. It's just...

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.620
 Am I? Feel like I've suddenly lost my little boy.

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.620
 Mother!

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:55.620
 Look at this.

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:56.620
 Henry, what's wrong?

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.620
 I choose one of where are my shoes?

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:59.620
 No, what?

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.620
 I choose! I ran out of the house in my bedroom.

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.620
 They must be up in your room.

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:05.620
 Oh, boy.

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.620
 Don't run, dear. You're losing your trousers.

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.620
 She was, did I forget my belt, too?

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.620
 You better check everything again.

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:18.200
 Yes, mother and while I'm doing that would you please look up Gladys's address in the phone book?

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.200
 I never asked for work. You were

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:26.400
 Alice it looks like your little boy had come back

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:42.240
 Is this the well-being and sure Gladys and I certainly want to apologize boy

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.120
 I never realized roe X was way back here

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:52.360
 You don't know as a matter of fact. I understand this is a play you want to see from the spa back is possible

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.000
 So we go to what's sure?

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.520
 Seventh and eight seats in

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.640
 Would you excuse us, please?

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:08.460
 Excuse us. Oh, oh, hi Cynthia. Excuse us. Oh my goodness. Can we look what's right in front of me?

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:11.660
 Oh boy, where did that pole come from?

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:14.660
 I'm glad you take my seat.

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:17.660
 I can really see fine if I just tell you a little.

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:19.660
 Gee, what is glad I said?

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:21.660
 I couldn't have you tilted on our first day.

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:23.660
 We wouldn't be polite.

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:24.660
 Let's change.

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:26.660
 Alright.

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:29.660
 May I have my program now, please?

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:30.660
 Your program?

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:32.660
 Oh boy, how did I forget that?

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:34.660
 Excuse me, I'll be right back.

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:36.660
 Excuse me.

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:38.660
 Excuse me.

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:41.660
 Oh, oh hi Cynthia.

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:44.660
 Excuse me, excuse me.

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:47.660
 Safe, Charlie, did I have two programs please?

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:49.660
 Sure, I'm here, thanks.

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:52.660
 Excuse me, excuse me.

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:55.660
 Oh, excuse me, Emily.

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:58.660
 Oh, she was Cynthia, did I get you again?

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:01.660
 Excuse me, excuse me.

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:03.660
 Hair gliders.

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:05.660
 Thank you Emily.

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:07.420
 - Hey, hey, hey.

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:09.820
 (laughing)

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:10.920
 - Well, anyway.

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:12.620
 - Who's that?

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:14.060
 - Homer Brown.

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:16.460
 Boy, some people never grow up.

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:17.300
 - What do you mean?

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:21.060
 - Imagine yelling all over a public place like that.

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:23.420
 Boy, I certainly want to apologize for her.

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:26.100
 - I don't mind that, I think it's cute.

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:27.580
 - Cute?

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:29.220
 Homer Brown, cute?

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:31.740
 - Isn't that a nice nice guy you're wearing?

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:32.980
 - That red one, yes.

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:35.380
 Did you know that red's my favorite color?

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:36.880
 Well, do you, where?

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:40.080
 I mean, I didn't see all this for getting ready to stop the overture.

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:42.180
 Could I have my purse, please?

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:43.180
 Your purse?

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:44.980
 You mean I have?

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:47.080
 Didn't I give it to you just before we left my house?

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:48.180
 Well, do you, where's no?

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:49.080
 Oh, my goodness.

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:49.880
 Oh, my goodness.

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:51.380
 I must have left it on the whole table.

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:52.980
 What am I going to do?

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:55.580
 I don't think anyone will steal it, Gladys.

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:59.180
 Oh, would you be a beer and hop into your car and run home for us?

00:06:59.180 --> 00:06:59.980
 Now?

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:01.180
 And my purse.

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:03.180
 I don't have my hat, did you?

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:05.280
 And I understand this is a very sad place.

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:06.880
 Well, I wouldn't mind letting you want to mind.

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:07.680
 Yeah.

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:09.680
 I've got one up here and one down here.

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:10.680
 [LAUGHTER]

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:11.680
 Yeah, I'll get you to help.

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:12.880
 Oh, you missed it.

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:13.480
 What's that?

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:15.180
 That's my first time.

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:17.780
 But glad as you won't need more lipstick

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:19.280
 until I take you home.

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:20.280
 [LAUGHTER]

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:23.280
 That's why, if you must know my glasses are in the purse.

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:24.280
 Glasses?

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:25.080
 [LAUGHTER]

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:26.280
 Thank you, Dr. Shout.

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:29.280
 Well, as you, Gladys, I didn't know you needed glasses.

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:29.980
 I don't.

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:32.280
 I just wear them to keep my mother happy.

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:34.280
 suppose we don't tell your mother

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:36.780
 you don't have to be miserable all evening

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:39.280
 look glad it's very well

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:43.480
 but i'm thinking about how you feel about me early in our friendship

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:44.840
 but glad it's not even

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:46.540
 well that is naturally

00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:48.640
 well if it's that important i'd be

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:50.400
 glad to get to your purse

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:52.800
 tell me i knew you were a gentleman

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:54.080
 and you'll have a back phone

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:57.360
 sure because i'll be awfully lonely without you

00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:59.360
 oh boy

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:01.560
 i'll be back before you know it

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:02.560
 Excuse me.

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:03.960
 The present on the whole table.

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:04.960
 You sure?

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:05.960
 Excuse me?

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:06.960
 Excuse me.

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:07.960
 Excuse me.

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:08.960
 Ouch!

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:09.960
 Hi, Henry.

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:16.960
 Boy, Willie, boy, a fine parking attendant you are.

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:25.960
 What the hell are you stop blaming it on me?

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:27.680
 Who else can I blame it on?

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:30.360
 She was looking at all the cars parked in front of mine.

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:32.440
 I parked everybody's car as they came in.

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:33.720
 What'd you come to early for?

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:35.400
 To avoid trouble.

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:36.560
 Get me out, will we?

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:37.560
 Get me out.

00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:38.400
 I will.

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:40.200
 Just as soon as I study the situation.

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:43.080
 Listen, I have to go all the way back for Gladys' glasses

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:45.000
 and the play's going to start any minute.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.440
 And we must have known Elton hired me

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:47.960
 to take charge of a parking lot,

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:50.560
 and I'm not going off half-cost.

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:53.080
 Now, the way I figure it, all I have to do

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:56.520
 is move this mask back and that's cheap out,

00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:59.040
 and then you can slip your car through the space.

00:08:59.040 --> 00:08:59.880
 I can?

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:01.880
 I'll move it. Keep an eye on my rear.

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:02.880
 Willy, if you ask me.

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:03.880
 I know what I'm doing.

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:04.880
 Out of my back bumper.

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:05.880
 Fine.

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:06.880
 I'm clearing back.

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:07.880
 Sure.

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:08.880
 Here I come.

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:09.880
 He was coming.

00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:11.880
 Keep on coming.

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:13.880
 Oh boy.

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:15.880
 Everybody had a puppy that was clearing back.

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:16.880
 You are?

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:18.880
 Was your front bumper that had...

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:19.880
 Pull up.

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:23.880
 Holy moly, all this!

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:27.880
 What's wrong now?

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:28.880
 The bumper's a lot.

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:29.880
 They are?

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:30.880
 Well, what do you know?

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:33.880
 We'll just don't stand there, will we do some?

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:35.880
 Let's not move our heads, Ken.

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:39.880
 All I have to do is move that today and up front and we'll have a whole thing with it.

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:40.880
 And, Willie, that's crazy.

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:43.880
 If you're going to move anything, it should be this red convertible.

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:45.880
 Henry, you're the one who's crazy.

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:46.880
 It's a sedan.

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:47.880
 The convertible!

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:50.880
 Listen, Henry, are you insinuating I don't know the parking business?

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:59.880
 [Music]

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:01.680
 Now, where were we, gentlemen?

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:04.180
 Right in the middle of fiscal expenses, Mr. Audrey.

00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:04.880
 Oh, yes.

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:07.180
 Shouldn't we wait until Ferguson gets back?

00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:10.380
 Mr. Harris, this statement has to be ready for the meeting tomorrow.

00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:12.780
 Why did Ferguson have to go to the school anyway?

00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:15.880
 It seems, Mr. Kilmer, he left his car to his son,

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:18.380
 and now his bumpers are locked with another car.

00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:20.080
 Well, that couldn't take very long.

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:24.320
 Yes, but before they can straighten that out, they have to get the rest of the parking lot untangled.

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:26.780
 I think we better go on without it.

00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:28.020
 Yes, I suppose so.

00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:32.460
 Now, I think the best way to start is to figure out our asset.

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:33.160
 Asset?

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:35.220
 Mr. R.W.E.S. we don't have any assets.

00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:38.680
 The club is 250 in the red and everyone knows it.

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:39.640
 I know, Mr. Head.

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:40.820
 I make a motion.

00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:42.540
 We just make up a report chain.

00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:46.540
 We owe $250 and not worry the club about how it happened.

00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:47.200
 Oh, Mr. Head.

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:48.140
 I second the motion.

00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:48.940
 How about some bridge?

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:50.940
 Now Mr. Kilburn!

00:10:50.940 --> 00:11:03.440
 Listen, Henry, what's the idea of calling me out of the auditorium in a time like this?

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:04.940
 I had to, Homer.

00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:08.940
 But screaming, kitten, just playing the old aunt, and I think she's just about to get murdered.

00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:09.940
 But Homer...

00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:12.940
 I've been looking forward to that since the curtain went up.

00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:16.940
 But Homer, I can't get my car out of the parking lot. I'll have to take a street car.

00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:19.540
 This is the first date I've had with her.

00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:20.040
 What?

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:22.240
 Homer, don't you understand?

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:25.240
 The only part I got was you have a date with a streetcar.

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:25.940
 [Laughter]

00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:28.040
 Now, Homer, with Gladys Prentice,

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:30.640
 so won't you please do me a favor and sit with her?

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:31.140
 Me?

00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:32.440
 So she won't be lonesome.

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:33.640
 Nothing doing him.

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:34.540
 What a home, brother.

00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:36.940
 I saw that pole right in front of your seat.

00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:38.040
 Pole?

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:39.640
 There's a pole there?

00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:41.440
 You know, dying well.

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:43.940
 Come on, hardly even noticed it.

00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:45.640
 That's how infotecimal it is.

00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:48.340
 - It's been tassel, it's been tassel, huh?

00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:49.340
 - Oh!

00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:51.540
 - And she was, if you lean a little,

00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:53.040
 you hardly know it's there.

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:56.440
 - Oh no, when I get off balance, I get a headache.

00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:58.540
 - Look, is it worth a quarter to your mouth?

00:11:58.540 --> 00:11:59.620
 - 50 cents.

00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:00.460
 - 50?

00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:01.840
 - Well, she was, you should be willing to have

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:04.140
 a little headache for that kind of money.

00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:05.220
 - Okay, I'll do it.

00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:06.700
 - Gee, thanks Homer.

00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:07.900
 - 75.

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:09.020
 - Now listen!

00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:12.660
 - Can we eat a headache in the polar worth at least 75 cents?

00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:14.740
 - But that hardly leaves me enough for sodas.

00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:16.340
 Okay, Henry, step aside.

00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:17.180
 Where are you going?

00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:18.840
 Back to my seat and watch thing be.

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:19.680
 Get there, Lynn.

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:21.320
 Okay, okay, okay.

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:23.040
 Here's your 75 cent.

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:23.860
 Hey.

00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:25.680
 So glad us I'll be back before she knows.

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:27.160
 Okay.

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:30.320
 Yes, Mr. and Dr. Isaki.

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:31.920
 Yes, Ms. Hotchkiss.

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:33.320
 She's been learning.

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:34.960
 Well, she was already.

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:36.960
 I better inspect the body.

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:39.160
 Excuse me, can I get in this row?

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:40.200
 Thanks.

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:41.520
 Excuse me.

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:43.360
 Excuse me.

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:44.360
 Excuse me.

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:46.360
 Oh, so high Cynthia.

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:58.360
 Sam, I feel terribly guilty about having to leave.

00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:00.360
 Yes, yes, of course.

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:02.360
 But I'm sure you and Mr. Kilmer can appreciate my position.

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:04.360
 After all, you have children of your own.

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:09.360
 Yes, but couldn't Mrs. Harris take the saddle shoes down to your daughter, Cynthia?

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:11.360
 I have the car, Mr. Ahrich.

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:12.360
 Oh, oh yes.

00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:17.360
 Yes, but I'm certainly going to speak very sharply to Cynthia about interrupting our meeting like this.

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:20.360
 I was against her wearing open toe shoes from the start.

00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:22.360
 Well, if you must go, you must.

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:25.360
 Well, and if I don't come my bet, I may not.

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:26.360
 No, no, we won't.

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:27.360
 Good night.

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:28.360
 Good night.

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:31.360
 Mr. Aldrich, I've just finished heading up those figures.

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:32.360
 Yes.

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:35.360
 And according to my addition, we have $194 in the bank.

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:36.360
 What?

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:37.360
 That's impossible. We have a deficit.

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:39.360
 I know. I must have gone all somewhere.

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:41.360
 Let me see those figures.

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:47.600
 a year. Mr. Kilmer you've added our membership to our assets. I have my mind.

00:13:47.600 --> 00:14:00.500
 Oh boy. Excuse me. Hey fellow what do you think you're going into the auditorium?

00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:04.320
 Have I missed much? Only the first act. Let me see you take it. Take it you already

00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:08.480
 took it. Me? Well maybe not you but somebody took it. Look fella try and know

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:10.920
 When you're the third guy who's tried that excuse tonight.

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:14.120
 Well, but it isn't any excuse my girls inside waiting for me.

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:15.360
 Yeah, and Rolex.

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:16.840
 Now I know you're a gay crush.

00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:18.640
 You've arisen an empty seat in that row.

00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:21.000
 Well, she were naturally homers in it.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.960
 Look, I have strict orders not to let anyone in without a ticket

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:25.240
 and that's that, so stand back.

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:27.440
 But she was, I sold more tickets for this drunk lady

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:29.320
 than anyone in school, ask Mercedes.

00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:30.840
 She knows I had a ticket.

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:31.960
 Mercedes isn't here.

00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:33.120
 What? At a time--

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:35.680
 Look, fellow, why not stop trying to be a welter

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:37.400
 and give me a dollar and I'll sell you a ticket?

00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:39.680
 But she was only half left as 50 cents.

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:41.120
 Well, can't you borrow the rest?

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:41.780
 Barmer?

00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:42.920
 Sure.

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:44.680
 Well, that's an idea.

00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:46.840
 Could you loan me 50 cents?

00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:47.600
 No, wait a minute.

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:49.240
 Well, I just purchased that.

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:50.720
 Oh, that's just it, my girl.

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:53.000
 Since she can't see a thing without her.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.200
 Well, why not see if she's got as much as a dollar in there?

00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:59.080
 Open Gladys's purse?

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:01.520
 Sure, girls always carry get mad money.

00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:02.280
 Oh, I couldn't.

00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:02.960
 Why not?

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:04.400
 She might get mad.

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:06.560
 Besides, what would she think of my character?

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:08.440
 Listen, it'll just be a loan, will it?

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:09.960
 It is as though you won't pay a back loan.

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:12.220
 - No. - Well, okay.

00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:15.280
 Stand back while I open it.

00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:16.720
 You see any money?

00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:17.560
 - Not yet.

00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:20.280
 - Could you hold a few of these things?

00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:21.640
 - No. - Okay.

00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:23.840
 Here's your comb, notebook, glasses,

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:25.960
 library card, key chain, compact.

00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:27.560
 A map!

00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:31.120
 Left glove, hanky, another glove, left the right.

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:32.680
 A laugh!

00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:33.840
 How about money?

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:36.440
 I think I hear something rattling near the bottom.

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:39.940
 Here's her mirror mending tape needle and

00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:41.940
 thrift lifesavers.

00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:42.940
 What flavor?

00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:43.540
 He's gone.

00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:45.540
 That's glottishes all over everything.

00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:46.040
 Flipping.

00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:48.740
 Oh boy.

00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:49.540
 Wait a minute.

00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:50.240
 Where are you going?

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:50.840
 So let's think.

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:52.740
 Just roll under the auditorium door.

00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:53.440
 I told you,

00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:53.740
 fella.

00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:55.240
 You don't go in there without a ticket.

00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:56.540
 Now listen, fella.

00:15:56.540 --> 00:15:58.040
 Listen yourself, fella.

00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:06.240
 [Music]

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:10.120
 Oh! The Big Red Letter stands for Evigello Family.

00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:13.840
 Oh! The Big Red Letter stands for Evigello Family.

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:15.760
 That's Jello. Yum, yum, yum.

00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:17.680
 Jello Pudding's, yum, yum, yum.

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:22.320
 Jello Tack, Bianca Pudding's Yes or Weeee!

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:27.840
 Yes, and there are dozens and dozens of swell treats you can make with the Jello family of yum-yum desserts.

00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:31.420
 And here's a grand new combination to surprise the folks with tomorrow.

00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:37.320
 Maple Nut Tapioca, made with Luscious Light and Mellow Jello Vanilla Tapioca pudding.

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:41.060
 Just prepare a package of Jello Vanilla Tapioca as usual.

00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:47.400
 Then chill and serve with log cabin syrup, topped with chopped nut meat, sauteed in a little butter.

00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:54.540
 It's a wonderful dessert. Delicious Jello Vanilla Tapioca, with tangy maple syrup and crunchy nut meats.

00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:57.380
 Try all three jello tapioca puddings.

00:16:57.380 --> 00:17:01.100
 Jello chocolate, vanilla, and orange coconut tapioca.

00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:02.420
 They're ready prepared.

00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:06.100
 All you do is add milk and they take about five minutes to cook.

00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:09.020
 Look for 'em on your grocery's dessert shelf.

00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:10.820
 Jello tapioca pudding.

00:17:10.820 --> 00:17:13.580
 (dramatic music)

00:17:13.580 --> 00:17:20.380
 And now getting back to the troubles of Henry Oldridge.

00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:22.660
 Henry left the performance of the school play

00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:27.020
 in order to get Gladys's purse. But when he returned he couldn't get back in without

00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:32.500
 his ticket. Meanwhile he is hired Homer to sit with Gladys and keep her company. The

00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:36.660
 scene opens in the auditorium just as the second act is ending.

00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:38.660
 Hello? What's this?

00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:40.660
 Inspector, is it a clue?

00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:46.020
 Yes, Miss Hotchkiss. A very... a very vital clue.

00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:50.980
 vital crew and if this doesn't lead us to the killer my name isn't Inspector

00:17:50.980 --> 00:17:53.340
 Hornblow of Scotland Yard.

00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:54.860
 [applause]

00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:58.060
 Oh my goodness, that would be the most knowing that in the first time.

00:17:58.060 --> 00:17:59.620
 Did you really enjoy it, Gla?

00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:03.500
 No, I did. I guess I grabbed your arm a couple of times, didn't I, Homer?

00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:05.340
 Gee, I didn't mind.

00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:09.340
 Would you like to go out to the hall for another glass of water?

00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:10.780
 No, I don't think so.

00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:11.780
 That's good.

00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:15.780
 Boy, did that Cynthia Harris step on my toe the last turn?

00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:17.180
 I wonder where Henry is.

00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:18.180
 Henry?

00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:19.980
 Henry Aldrich.

00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:21.380
 Aren't you worried about him?

00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:23.980
 Well, it wouldn't be very polite to be worried, you think?

00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:24.780
 It wouldn't.

00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:27.380
 No, it wouldn't mean I wasn't having a good time with you.

00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:28.580
 Oh.

00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:29.980
 You know who I are?

00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:31.980
 What's that I seem to be?

00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:33.580
 Gee.

00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:35.580
 Gee, it's suddenly gotten warm in here.

00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:38.780
 Oh, I was thinking it was getting a little chewy.

00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:39.380
 Yeah?

00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:40.580
 Would you like my jacket?

00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:41.980
 Oh, I couldn't deprive you.

00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:43.180
 Gee, I don't mind.

00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:45.580
 Well, suppose I just follow a part of it.

00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:47.580
 A par?

00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:49.580
 They just agreed.

00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:53.580
 Oh, I'll tell you. I don't think my folks will be too happy if I tore it off.

00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:56.580
 Oh, goodness, you're cute.

00:18:56.580 --> 00:18:58.580
 I am.

00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:02.580
 Hey, you just let us put you on around my shoulders. I wouldn't be so dressed.

00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:05.580
 Oh. Oh.

00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:07.580
 How's that?

00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:08.580
 Much better.

00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:10.580
 Oh, my goodness, whoa!

00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:11.580
 Where?

00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:14.580
 I got window and back there. See those two hands on the ledge?

00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:17.740
 She was a must be some guy trying to sneak in that way.

00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:19.040
 What's that in her hand?

00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:20.740
 Well, I'll be doing it.

00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:23.140
 Grattice it isn't a fellow, it's a girl.

00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:23.640
 It is.

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:25.640
 Sure, that's a personal left hand.

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:27.840
 Well, my goodness, isn't that disgraceful?

00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:29.380
 There goes a janitor after her.

00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:31.280
 What's he doing with that window, Paul?

00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:33.680
 Oh boy, he's gonna let her have it right on the knuckle.

00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:35.280
 I swear to the ouch!

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:36.780
 [laughter]

00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:38.320
 Oh, I give it to him.

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:40.520
 She's doing hands disappear so fast.

00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:41.720
 Oh, right.

00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:42.920
 Yes, Grattice.

00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:44.920
 Did you know you took your arm away?

00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:45.920
 I did.

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:48.920
 Yes, and it's getting very chilling again.

00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:53.920
 Graddish, don't you think it would be a good idea if I went back to my own seat?

00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:54.920
 Why Homer?

00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:58.920
 I mean, she was Henry's my best friend and he did pay for your ticket.

00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:00.920
 Well, you're doing him a favor.

00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:01.920
 I am.

00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:03.920
 Certainly. He wants me to have a good time, doesn't he?

00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:04.920
 Yes, but...

00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:05.920
 Well, I've been miserable sitting alone.

00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:06.920
 Sure, but...

00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:09.920
 Homer, please put your arm back where it was. I'm freezing.

00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:10.920
 But...

00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:11.920
 Homer...

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:13.920
 How's that?

00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:16.920
 Mmm, that's better.

00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:20.920
 Oh boy, am I a heel?

00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:32.920
 Willie, where are you? Right in front of you, Henry.

00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:34.920
 Boy, this basement is dark.

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:37.920
 Are you sure we can get into the orchestra pit this way?

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:38.920
 Sure.

00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:43.180
 When I played the tube in the school orchestra, I used to sneak out this way all the time.

00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:47.800
 Boy, my suit must be a wreck. I fell right off that window sill into a thorn hedge.

00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:48.800
 Hold it.

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:50.320
 But we turn here.

00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:51.320
 Willie, are you sure?

00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:53.720
 Positive. I memorize the space-ment like a book.

00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:54.220
 You do?

00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:56.720
 You throw when you're carrying a tube, but you can't be too careful.

00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:57.720
 [laughter]

00:20:57.720 --> 00:20:58.520
 Come on.

00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:01.720
 Gee, Willie, I certainly want to thank you for helping me out like this.

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:05.420
 Well, that's okay, Henry. After all, I was responsible for tying up your car.

00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:08.120
 What did Mr. Nelson say when he fired you?

00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:12.120
 I wasn't exactly fired. I retired by mutual agreement.

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:14.760
 Did he at least get paid?

00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:17.720
 Well, I'll tell you the truth, Henry. I didn't think I ought to press that point.

00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:22.040
 Especially since the fire department had to come over and help untangle those cars.

00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:26.560
 A hold it, Henry. What's the matter? We should be almost to the door of the orchestra pit.

00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:30.120
 Where? Well, feel along the wall on your side for a pipe.

00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:32.400
 What for? It was right to the door. Oh.

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:35.560
 Feel around. Okay. Did you find it?

00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:38.560
 Well, he was at a steam pipe. Yeah, I found it.

00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:41.560
 Well, keep following it and go forward. Sure.

00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:45.560
 When you get to the orchestra pit, sneak in behind Agnes' lost in space.

00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:48.560
 Okay. Well, let's be quiet, huh?

00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:58.560
 Henry, you're not something over?

00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:01.560
 No shovels.

00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:04.060
 - Kelly, half a dozen of them. - That's funny.

00:22:04.060 --> 00:22:06.360
 I don't remember those being there last winter.

00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:08.860
 - Willie, you mean we're lost? - Well, not exactly.

00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:10.860
 I just don't know where we are. - No.

00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:12.060
 - What is it my fault, Henry?

00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:14.860
 This is the first time I've come through here without my tuba.

00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:16.860
 - [music playing]

00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:28.260
 - You said you. Can't you tell me who murdered my ass?

00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:31.460
 - Miss Hotchkiss, I think you'll be walking through that door.

00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:34.860
 That door in a moment. All right, men, scatter.

00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:37.760
 Oh, my goodness, I'm dying. I'm just dying.

00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:38.960
 Have you ever seen the mark?

00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:39.760
 I'm dying.

00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:42.760
 She also am so excited, my tozer curl.

00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:45.460
 Yes, doctor. I hear someone.

00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:48.960
 Quickly turn out the lights and careful men,

00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:50.160
 he may be armed.

00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:52.260
 Oh, man, you terrified of my hair.

00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:53.960
 Hold this. How's that?

00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:56.960
 My goodness, coat hands warm up.

00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:58.960
 She was a pretty cold yourself.

00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:01.760
 - Well, but you better keep out the door.

00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:03.100
 (sighing)

00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:04.600
 - I'm your toes man.

00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:06.380
 - Oh my God, look, the door's out there.

00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:07.220
 - It's your murder.

00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:08.060
 - What are you doing?

00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:08.900
 Who is this?

00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:09.900
 - I don't know.

00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:12.300
 - Will you are you sure this is the door to the orchestra?

00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:13.860
 (crowd laughing)

00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:15.980
 - Well, instead of murder it sounds familiar.

00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:17.480
 - All right, men, glad it.

00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:19.480
 (crowd laughing)

00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:20.320
 - Hey!

00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:21.160
 - No way!

00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:23.420
 - You've come to the end of your road.

00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:26.460
 - Now listen, you guys, I pay for my ticket,

00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:27.820
 and I'm coming in.

00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:30.820
 (audience laughing)

00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:37.820
 - Now, Sam, calm down.

00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:38.820
 - I am calm, Alice.

00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:40.520
 It's just that after all these years it hurts

00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:42.820
 to find out I've missed Judge Ralph Kilmer, so complete.

00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:44.820
 - Now, dear baby, you had a good reason for leaving.

00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:45.820
 - Good reason?

00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:47.820
 His excuse was he had to go to the school auditorium

00:23:47.820 --> 00:23:48.820
 and take his daughter home.

00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:50.320
 - Yeah, that doesn't sound unreal.

00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:52.320
 - Because you've got another attack of our hiccups

00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:53.820
 from laughing at the school play?

00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:56.320
 - Laughing, I thought it was a serious drama.

00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:59.320
 Exactly, certainly could have thought of a better excuse.

00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:03.320
 Fine meeting, Ferguson runs out, then Harry, now a cure-mer.

00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:06.320
 Well, there's one thing to be said, you certainly can't blame Henry.

00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:08.320
 Well, that's something.

00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:11.320
 Why, good is that, couldn't be Henry, it's only 10.30.

00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:13.320
 Henry, is that you?

00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:15.320
 Yes, Mother, it's sigh.

00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:16.320
 Here, come in here, please.

00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:19.320
 Mother, if you don't mind, I'd like to go right up to bed.

00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:21.320
 Yeah, are you home a little early?

00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:22.320
 Are we?

00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:23.320
 Is the playover already?

00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:29.820
 ready? Well, you might say it ended a little unexpectedly. Oh, I see. Incidentally,

00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:34.260
 be in this Eddie phone this evening. She did. And she was so pleased about your

00:24:34.260 --> 00:24:38.660
 selling all those tickets. She has a little surprise for you. Surprise. Yes,

00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:43.620
 she's going to see that you get a part in the next place. Me? Yes, there isn't that

00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:47.920
 night. Well, I'll tell your mother. And naturally, I appreciate it, but I've

00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:54.560
 suddenly lost all interest in appearing on the stage. You have. Yeah, all you do is get up there and

00:24:54.560 --> 00:25:00.240
 make a fool of yourself. Oh my goodness, I'm going in and make you a glass of hot milk with

00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:05.840
 butter. On top of everything else I'd go on through. Henry, please answer the phone. Who I?

00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:11.040
 Father, suppose it's a member of the cast. Answer it, Henry. I have to finish this report. But they

00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:13.440
 They bring her for three months.

00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:15.440
 Oh boy.

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:16.440
 Hello.

00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:17.940
 Hi, Hannah, old timer.

00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:18.940
 Homer, is that you?

00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:19.940
 Sure.

00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:22.240
 What they do to you after they roll down the curtain.

00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:23.240
 I'd rather not say.

00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:25.940
 Henry, it isn't as bad as that.

00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:29.640
 They promised to print who the murderer was in the school paper next week.

00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:31.140
 Homer, what about Gladys?

00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:33.840
 Wait, that's where I'm calling from.

00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:35.240
 I just took her home.

00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:36.240
 You did?

00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:39.240
 Well, you tell her I'll bring her her purse over there the first thing in the morning.

00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:40.240
 Okay, Dan.

00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:44.400
 When the optometrist promised to have her glasses fixed by three o'clock tomorrow.

00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:46.240
 Something happened to them?

00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:47.400
 In a way, Homer.

00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:50.640
 They somehow came into contact with a window pole.

00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:52.120
 So am I.

00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:53.120
 And Homer.

00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:54.960
 Homer is Gladys very mad.

00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:55.960
 Mad.

00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:57.840
 Because I wasn't with her all evening.

00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:00.280
 Well, she doesn't seem very mad.

00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:01.280
 She doesn't?

00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:02.280
 No.

00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:04.720
 As a matter of fact, she said she had a wonderful time.

00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:06.320
 We'll cut it out, Gladys.

00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:07.320
 That too.

00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:08.320
 What's that?

00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:09.320
 Oh boy.

00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:21.320
 Oh, boy. Homer, what's going on? Nothing, and nothing. Only Henry. Yes? I just want you to know you've got a 75 cent refund coming to you.

00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:33.320
 [music]

00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:37.320
 Oh, I went up to make a new grassy certain party I know turned out to be.

00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:40.320
 Snake and the grass, Agnes, are you referring to good old home?

00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:41.320
 I'll say I am.

00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:44.320
 What Agnes, you're talking about my best pal?

00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:46.320
 Your best pal, your best pal.

00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:47.320
 Oh, sure.

00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:48.320
 Oh, okay.

00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:50.320
 Then what was your best pal doing with his arm?

00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:51.320
 I'm glad it's all he knew.

00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:54.320
 She was so, that's what happened.

00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:56.320
 Boy, what a snake and the grass.

00:26:56.320 --> 00:27:00.320
 Well, sometimes that's the way it goes with the best of friends.

00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:02.320
 But ladies, when it comes to desserts,

00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:04.480
 Here's one that never lets you down.

00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:07.440
 Jello tapioca puddings, a miracle of goodness,

00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:09.080
 a marvel of speed.

00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:11.520
 Jello tapioca puddings are ready prepared,

00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:13.000
 nothing to go wrong.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.600
 All you do is add milk,

00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:17.280
 and they take just about five minutes to cook.

00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:20.960
 There's Jello vanilla tapioca, luscious light and mellow.

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:24.240
 Jello chocolate tapioca, rich and candy good.

00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:26.680
 Jello orange coconut tapioca,

00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:29.760
 tangy orange with rich tropical coconut.

00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:31.840
 Jello tapioca puddings,

00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:37.720
 three delicious new reasons why more women by jello puttings than any other

00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:39.440

 Mr. and Mrs. Olridge, our house, Jameson and Catherine Roth.

00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:05.960
 And this is Dan Seymour in New York saying,

00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:09.380
 "The Olridge family is brought to you by the Jell-O family."

00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:10.700

 New as new as a whole boat of banker's convention.

00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:34.680
 Amazing, the only one of its kind.

00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:35.680
 That's minute rice.

00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:38.680
 Minute rice for magically quick, quick meals.

00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:41.680
 No washing, rinsing, draining or steaming with minute rice.

00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:43.680
 Just drop it in water and bring to a boil.

00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:45.680
 Absolutely no more cooking needed.

00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:49.680
 Minute rice is quicker to fix than potatoes, and it always comes out perfect.

00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:53.680
 You'll think of scores of wonderful, one-dish meals with minute rice.

00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:57.680
 So remember the name minute, minute rice in the red, white and blue box.

00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:09.480

00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:12.280
 Gracie, it's Burns and Alan. They built me first.

00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:13.080
 They do?

00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:13.680
 Sure.

00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:16.080
 Oh, and I'll have the deal for now. You have sent to you.
