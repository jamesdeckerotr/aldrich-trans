00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.000
 [Music]

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 You don't need to tie a string around your finger in order to remember to the teenage boy you want you or want worse.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
 Any boy will bring back those memories, especially if he's Henry always.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
 The scene opens in Homer Brown's house.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 The time is early afternoon.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 Elizabeth, is the coast clear?

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.000
 Yes, yes.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 Homer that's clear as me.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 Good. Give me a hand with these things.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 My goodness, will all these pucks and brushes

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 set the place of the room, Woodward?

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
 I'm not so loud. You want Homer to hear?

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 Wait, Henry, coming over.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 You should be here in a minute now.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
 Well, I can understand why you don't want Homer around when you paint.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 I'm just thinking of you, Elizabeth.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.160
 He's just got me in a pot of paint and he'll crank up your whole house.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.460
 And what makes you think so?

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:02.760
 He's Homer, isn't he?

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:03.600
 [Laughter]

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.500
 If you couldn't make an exception, is he one?

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.800
 After all, it seems Thursday, next week.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.800
 I know, and I bought him a ukulele. That's enough for any boy.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.200
 [Muffled]

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.500
 Does that sound like Homer?

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.900
 The little, but don't be foolish. I'd be painting.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.600
 [Muffled]

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.300
 The quicker pieces, this stuff I'm so spending on time.

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.600
 He is. Oh, my goodness, you're not behind the sofa.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.400
 [Muffled]

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:35.400
 Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. I'm calling. I'm... what's that sticking out from behind the sofa? Who do you think? He thought of missing the phone, though I didn't recognize you.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.400
 (Laughter)

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:49.400
 Did you lose something? No. Oh. You're fixing the sofa? No. Doing exercises? No. Well, I'm saying how you speak. With mother? No. Who's there?

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.400
 Oh my.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.400
 Do you have a few walks to meet the captain's central?

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.400
 Oh, yeah.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.400
 Did you see my chemistry, sir?

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:56.400
 Your chemistry, sir?

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.400
 Oh, all right.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.400
 Here I am, ready to start the biggest experiment of my life, and this disappears.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.400
 It's on the bottom-side of the pantry.

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.400
 I bothered it to base that chocolate greek the other day.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.400
 You want to eat it with my chemistry, sir?

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.400
 No wonder I felt so peculiar.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.400
 Yeah, you felt peculiar because you ate five pieces.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.400
 All right, I bothered with your sodium bicarbonate.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.400
 This is famous baking soda.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.400
 It is.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.960
 Yeah, now go get it.

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.040
 Sure, father.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.560
 But you think it's very fine,

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.560
 because I'd like to put anything on a chemistry set

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.800
 to convey for a take with it.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:27.600
 Now, let's see.

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.280
 I think this is the right price.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.200
 I mean, look, you won't get home a take, too.

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.640
 I think you could've used the way to eat

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.000
 the heat out of the house before you start.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.960
 I'm not starting, but it can't hurt to test the color.

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:37.840
 And I'll stand back.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:38.880
 Come on.

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:39.880
 Mother!

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.240
 You're so smuggly!

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.800
 I'll never make it back to the cold cold cold cold.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:43.280
 I'll give you a little.

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.480
 Stand in front of me.

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.960
 Is it all right if I borrow a few things from a kitchen?

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.200
 - And then what more? - An experiment.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.400
 If you can use chemistry to take one advice first,

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.240
 then very well, if you promise to return everything,

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:56.560
 then you can borrow what to need.

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.040
 - I already have.

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.080
 And mother, yes, she is.

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.240
 - You're looking for father.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.800
 He's under the piano.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:03.640
 (audience laughs)

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:04.960
 - Oh, I'm going to a piano room.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.120
 - Stay under there, father, I'm going.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.440
 - Wheel of browns just look.

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.640
 You've got green paint all over everything.

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.600
 - Elizabeth, it isn't all over everything.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.240
 Just a few spots on the wall and a little on the ceiling.

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.500
 Henry, come in here.

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:19.500
 Hi, Mr. Brown.

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:20.500
 Hi, Mr. Brown.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.000
 You started painting yet?

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000
 Henry, quiet.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.200
 Homage right upstairs in his room.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.800
 Oh, was I raising my voice?

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.040
 I'm a crazy wordy.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.640
 Henry, are you sure you have everything straight?

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:30.640
 Sure.

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.940
 I'm to get Homer out of the house and not bring him back until you're through fooling

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:34.940
 around with the woodwork.

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.840
 Henry, I'm not fooling around.

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:37.840
 Oh.

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.080
 Do you think you'll have any trouble getting Homer out of the house?

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.920
 Sometimes he's as stubborn as a mule.

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:42.920
 You're brown.

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.880
 It's tough as when you get something in his mind.

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.380
 I'm trying to find it hard getting it out.

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.220
 You don't have to worry, Mr. Brown.

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.220
 All I have to do is smile at Homer and he was,

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.360
 I can get him to do anything I want.

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:54.620
 Excuse me.

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.460
 Homer, what are you going to do about those green spots?

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:59.460
 Oh, God, just hand me the seven-five.

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:01.140
 Homer?

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.140
 Homer, are you having your room?

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:04.900
 I have a little room.

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.380
 Say, say, Homer, what are you saying with me?

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:12.380
 He was, what are you making with that chemistry fest, money?

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:14.180
 Homer, that's against the law.

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.380
 - Well, I don't mean I'm making a money tournament.

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.220
 You're inventing a hair grower.

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:19.060
 - What for?

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.420
 - To grow hair.

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:21.260
 - I'm what?

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.100
 - Hey, he is.

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:24.540
 (laughing)

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.660
 - But a homer, you've already got more hair than you need.

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:28.500
 - I know.

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.860
 - He looks like a head of lettuce now.

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:32.940
 - And I'm not making it for myself.

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:33.780
 - No?

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.580
 - No, it's just as human beings in general.

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.580
 There's an article in this magazine that says,

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.300
 "The guy who finds something like that will make a fortune."

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:42.140
 - No kidding.

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:44.140
 I'm going to stand back while I put in some leaves.

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:45.140
 Yeesh!

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:48.140
 It would make cakes rise and make you the same things as the hair.

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:55.140
 A whole year old-timer, going full around with things like hair restore.

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:58.140
 When we could be outside, doing really important things.

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:59.140
 Like what?

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:00.140
 Well, I...

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:01.140
 Well...

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:05.140
 Did you know they're starting to rip up Main Street today?

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:08.140
 They are, sure, from Burch to Ticamor.

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:12.140
 You see the kind of important things that are going on in the outside world?

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:14.140
 Well, growing hair is important.

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:15.140
 It's true.

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:20.140
 Homer, did I mention I was planning on our going to a movie too?

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:21.140
 On May.

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:22.140
 No saying.

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:23.140
 Plus a soda afterwards.

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:24.140
 I'm not interested.

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:26.140
 Well, how about now?

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:29.140
 But Homer, look, I'm smiling.

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:32.140
 Homer, something stubborn is a mule.

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:33.140
 the mule.

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:39.140
 (music)

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:46.140
 Can I, will you please stop driving when Homer the fresh air is good for again.

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:49.140
 That is so good for me. Why are you forcing me to go to the movie?

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:51.140
 I'm not forcing you.

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:53.140
 Then let go of my arms.

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:55.140
 Look, Homer, old timer.

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:59.140
 Just give me one good reason why you don't want to go to the movie.

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:01.140
 I've seen the picture.

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:05.140
 I know, but give me one other good reason.

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:08.140
 Why should I go to the movie when I could be making a million dollars?

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:11.140
 And helping myself a man to go home.

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:12.140
 I'm going home.

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:14.140
 Homer, you can't go home, and that's that.

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:15.140
 Why now?

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:18.140
 Homer, please don't ask me. Why not? You just can't.

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:20.140
 Oh.

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:22.140
 What do you mean by a remark like that?

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:24.140
 Oh.

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:26.140
 Oh.

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:28.380
 Can we answer me one question?

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:30.780
 Did my parents tell you to keep me away?

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:31.780
 Your parents?

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:33.940
 Homer, you have no right to ask that.

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:35.780
 Oh!

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:38.260
 Look, Homer, I'm gonna get y'all whole bag of sour bowls.

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:39.420
 Who over yourself?

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:40.420
 Sour bowls.

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:42.320
 I'm the only two happy to go in the candy kitchen

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:44.260
 here and buy you some on me.

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:45.700
 Now don't you move, Homer.

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:47.220
 Say right, then.

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:49.260
 Your hand, old timer.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.220
 Anything we say.

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:53.100
 Oh, that new one, huh?

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:54.420
 Oh, hi, Lily.

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:56.300
 Why are you standing around with them like that?

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:57.300
 Like why?

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:59.500
 Like you're looking, but your mouth hanging open and everything.

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:00.540
 Oh, are you willing?

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:02.100
 Have I been a school?

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:03.820
 I know, but why do it in public?

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:04.780
 [LAUGHTER]

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:05.780
 Know what, Lily?

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:08.740
 I'm doing a surprise party tonight.

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:11.100
 You're all sure my parents even have family

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:12.660
 trying to keep me away from their house

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:14.260
 while they're getting everything ready?

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:15.180
 Oh.

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:16.740
 You don't want to know?

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:18.980
 Why do you suppose they're throwing you today?

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:20.780
 My birthday isn't so next week.

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:22.020
 I don't know.

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:23.660
 Oh, now that I've seen something,

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:27.060
 My father did mention something about going out of town next week.

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:28.060
 Sure.

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:30.460
 Sure, well, have a good time, Homer.

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:31.260
 What do you want to know?

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:32.060
 Nothing.

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:34.560
 Happy returns of the day and all that sort of stuff.

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:35.660
 Well, what's the matter?

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:36.760
 Oh, nothing, Homer.

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:39.760
 I guess your mother's just inviting your closest friend.

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:41.060
 You know, we weren't invited.

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:41.860
 Oh, well, that's OK.

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:43.160
 Homer, don't give it another thought.

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:44.060
 Well, I don't mind.

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:45.060
 Well, I'm not hurt.

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:47.060
 Well, I love it, old work.

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:50.460
 Well, you never see a messaged somewhere.

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:51.800
 It was my social noise.

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:54.160
 Is anybody I wanted my party is you.

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:55.360
 You mean that homeless?

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:56.060
 You are.

00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:57.060
 I'm not personal.

00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:58.060
 I'm not.

00:07:58.060 --> 00:07:59.560
 Here comes Henry.

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:01.060
 I don't want him to know I've caught on.

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:02.060
 Oh, sure.

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:03.060
 Here, no.

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:05.260
 We're a whole bag of sour balls.

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:06.260
 Different colors.

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:07.260
 Oh, hi, Willie.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:07.760
 Hi, Henry.

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:08.860
 Well, it's the long home.

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:09.460
 We're all the--

00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:10.460
 You know when.

00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:11.460
 You know where.

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:12.460
 You know where.

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:13.860
 We'll be talking about.

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:14.960
 Oh, nothing.

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:16.460
 Hand all the time.

00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:17.460
 Well, come on.

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:18.460
 Let's go.

00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:18.960
 Go where?

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:19.960
 To the movies.

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:23.760
 Even though it's a terrible picture, I certainly wouldn't surprise you.

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:25.260
 Well, do you?

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.260
 And I'll tell you what else, him.

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:28.760
 This time, it's on me.

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:30.760
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:38.360
 And where did you say you were, Henry?

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:41.160
 At the movies, Mrs. Brown, I'm fine with you there.

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:42.360
 You got home where to go?

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:44.360
 Oh, I got him to go, all right.

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:45.860
 Oh, that's fine.

00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:47.360
 And Mr. Brown still has half of it.

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:49.560
 But it's in your world, and it's stealing to do.

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:51.720
 I thought he was just doing the woodwork.

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:54.120
 - Well, his best dad had once it twice more,

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:56.720
 so he decided to do a complete job,

00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:59.200
 so keep her away as long as possible.

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:00.840
 - Well, about that,

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:02.720
 if you haven't heard from Homer

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:04.800
 in the past 15 minutes, have you?

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:06.560
 - Tell me, you haven't lost him, have you?

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:09.320
 - No, no, I haven't lost him.

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:11.280
 He's just a little misplace, that's all.

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:12.760
 - Oh, I've missed him.

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:15.240
 - Got up to go for drink of water, see him?

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:18.920
 He whiz, and you know how terrible he is on direct.

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:20.920
 We probably just went back to the wrong street.

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:21.920
 Elizabeth.

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:22.920
 Oh, here we are.

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:24.920
 Henry, Mr. Bonnaby, Betty, I've said it.

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:25.920
 Homer, 10's up here now.

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:26.920
 Mr. Sure, Mrs. Brown.

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:29.920
 I'll go over to the theater with a fine-tilt comb.

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:30.920
 Goodbye.

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:31.920
 Goodbye.

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:32.920
 Elizabeth, are you still with the phone?

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:33.920
 Oh, no.

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:36.920
 I've got to call the hardware store. We'll need some more paint.

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:38.920
 But will you have plenty of that for the living room?

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:41.920
 Yes. But I was thinking, if we do the living room,

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:44.920
 think how shabby the hall will look by contrast.

00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:47.920
 Will Brown, you mean you've started again?

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:57.920
 (music)

00:09:57.920 --> 00:09:59.920
 Hi Mr. Trissel.

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:00.920
 Oh, my...

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:02.920
 Are they really as soon as I get these jelly rolls in the window?

00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:03.920
 Take your time.

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:08.920
 Boy, if there's one thing I like to stand around and smell, it's a bakery.

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:09.920
 Eh...

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:12.920
 Ah, what can I do here?

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:13.920
 What?

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:15.920
 I'm just sort of picking up on...

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:18.920
 What? Oh boy.

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:19.920
 What's wrong?

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:21.920
 I think that looking at grass case here.

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:22.920
 Oh, those are my special orders.

00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:24.920
 That's taken back. The one with pink icing.

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:26.920
 What does that letter in say?

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:28.920
 Happy anniversary to Virgy and Fred.

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:29.920
 It does.

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:33.920
 You know, upside down, Virgy looks something like Homer.

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:36.920
 What is it you're after, Oliver?

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:38.920
 I look like I'm after something.

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:39.920
 Yep.

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:42.920
 Mr. Sky, so I don't want you to give away any secrets.

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:44.920
 Did my mother place an order today?

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:50.320
 Yes, it is. Oh boy. I've got it written down here.

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:53.320
 "Rive brave, half a dozen rolls and some donuts."

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:55.320
 That's all? Yep.

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:58.320
 You couldn't be in a safe home, could you?

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:02.320
 He suppose my mother could avoid a case that said Happy Birthday, Homer.

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:06.320
 And he thought he said Happy anniversary, hurry, he and Fred.

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:09.320
 Oh, she ordered with donuts.

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:14.320
 Oh. Well, when I think of it, I am pretty fond of donuts.

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:19.320
 I guess they are more practical for a party who don't have to fly some parties.

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:22.320
 Now that I think of a donut here perfect.

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:24.320
 Oh, but these donuts can't be for a party.

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:25.320
 Why not?

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:27.320
 Not right, it's a pretty small party.

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:29.320
 You mother just ordered six.

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:30.320
 Six.

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:32.320
 You want one, two, three, four, five, six?

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:33.320
 Yeah.

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:35.320
 Mr. Fiverr, you must be wrong.

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:36.320
 Wrong.

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:37.320
 You must have had six dozen.

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:38.320
 Six dozen?

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:39.320
 Sure.

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:43.320
 He was how far would six donuts go with a mob that's coming to my house tonight?

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:44.160
 - How can I?

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:46.920
 (dramatic music)

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:54.740
 - As the fleet seems proudly out

00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:57.360
 under the Golden Gate Bridge for their spring maneuvers.

00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:02.060
 - Homer, Homer, are you in this row?

00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:02.900
 Homer?

00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:04.760
 - Young man, would you mind moving?

00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:05.600
 - Yes, sir.

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:08.000
 - You're blocking the United States fleet.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.640
 - Oh, excuse me.

00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:11.960
 Homer!

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:15.560
 the battle line seems like great people to the imaginary enemy

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:20.800
 young man with you please be quiet but lady could you please tap that fellow

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:24.520
 sitting next to your mask him if he's home or brown that's not home a brown

00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:27.360
 it looks just like him that's my copy bag

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:34.680
 I was sure I recognize his hair that's not hair that's ahead of neck it

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:40.620
 I'm moving off yes ma'am besides I think I see him down front anyway now the

00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:42.740
 Please let's go to the Burnt Soundwell at the enemy.

00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:44.660
 - Come on, Burnt.

00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:47.000
 Oh, I'm going to run along to run along the street.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.960
 Let's go now on. - No, I'm going to park him home.

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:50.520
 I'm going to let go of you, sexy.

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:52.040
 - And what I thought. - I'm going to.

00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:53.700
 - I'm going to run along. - I'm going to run along.

00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:55.900
 - I'm going to run along. - I'm going to run along.

00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:59.700
 - I'm going to run along the street. - I'm going to run along the street.

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:05.880
 - I'm going to run along the street. - I'm going to run along the street.

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:07.960
 - Donnie, would you please stay behind that street?

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:09.940
 - I guess you want to see how you were coming along

00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:15.380
 with my pants. I'm after first point in just a few minutes. Yeah. I'm supposed to

00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:20.900
 stay away from home until supplicing in a way. Yeah. I'm being surprised you know.

00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:26.980
 That's fine. That's how I happen to get caught with my pants on press. You don't

00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:31.620
 happen to have a door open do you? No why? No reason I just thought I told a

00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:36.700
 draft. I thought I used your phone. All you need is a nickel son. It's a

00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:41.140
 pay for them. Hey what's it there. I'm showing again.

00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:46.060
 Suppose I wrap this over code around my way. OK but be careful with

00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:48.180
 facing on a public street you know sure.

00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:53.580
 I'm nine one one.

00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:55.220
 Yes ma'am.

00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:57.580
 I'm a sir. What is this now?

00:13:57.580 --> 00:14:00.700
 Did you press those hands so I was a little taller.

00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:02.500
 How could I do a thing like that?

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:04.620
 Well I know I'm no tailor.

00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:17.300
 a miracle man. Is this Adney? Yeah. I just called ask if your cousin Eloise is still visiting you.

00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:23.300
 You're a what? No reason. But if you want to bring her along tonight, it's perfectly alright.

00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:27.300
 Say your what? You know Adney. You know.

00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:30.300
 Sir, do anything weird you should have had around in Paul's house.

00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:32.300
 Oh sure you were.

00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:33.300
 Listen on the what's up.

00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:36.300
 Adi, don't tell my mother, but I know.

00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:37.300
 No what?

00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:39.300
 About my surprise party tonight.

00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:40.300
 You're having a party?

00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:42.300
 You were invited, either?

00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:43.300
 No.

00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:46.300
 She was my mother showing all the pieces on this thing.

00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:49.300
 Look, Adi, if you're definitely to come.

00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:50.300
 Adi, Adi.

00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:51.300
 Sure, and Eloise too.

00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:53.300
 How are you, doll? How are you?

00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:54.300
 I'm going to have a shot in the way.

00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:55.300
 Where are you wearing?

00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:56.300
 All right, Mel.

00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:57.300
 No, no, no.

00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:59.300
 Wait, what are you doing here?

00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:01.300
 where only I'll be correct.

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:03.860
 Why is he gone? I haven't been following him.

00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:05.300
 He's calling past me.

00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:06.300
 Hey, homo.

00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:07.300
 Come on.

00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:09.300
 What's up, Lily?

00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:10.300
 Oh, I kept running.

00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:13.300
 Homo, do you know you have that over-cold on roll?

00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:15.300
 It's a never mind, Lily.

00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:16.300
 Oh.

00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:17.300
 Well, the reason I've been looking for you,

00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:19.300
 Charlie Clark and Toby Smith are pretty upset

00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:20.300
 about nothing uninvited.

00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:23.300
 And two, listen, Lily, would you give them up

00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:25.300
 and tell them it's a mistake and they're definitely the term?

00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:26.300
 Okay.

00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:28.300
 Maybe you better stop by the bakery on your way

00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:31.300
 in order to ignore dozens of what donuts

00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:34.300
 with all these extra people coming, we're gonna need them.

00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:37.300
 Okay, and you happen to have five nickels for a quarter.

00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:40.300
 I better pick up and see who else my mother forgot to invite.

00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:50.300
 And now getting back to the troubles of Henry Olgre.

00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:52.300
 When Henry reveals to let him go home,

00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:57.300
 Homer jumps at the conclusion that his parents were throwing him at the prize party.

00:15:57.300 --> 00:16:03.300
 And while he's been checking on all the preparations, Henry has been trying desperately to locate him.

00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:06.300
 The scene opens in a phone booth at the movie house.

00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:08.300
 Mother, are you still there?

00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:12.300
 Yes, dear. Your father's coming to the phone now. Are you in some kind of trouble?

00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:15.300
 Trouble, Mother? Huh? She was what my giving him in trouble?

00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:17.300
 What is he, your father?

00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:18.300
 Hello.

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:20.300
 Boy, father, am I in trouble?

00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:21.300
 What's happened now?

00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:29.300
 Why, it's sort of hard to explain, but could you come right down to the colonial theater and testify to your son's character?

00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:30.300
 Go, "Parachts"?

00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:38.300
 Yes, sir. And explain to the manager that I'm usually very well behaved in that I've never molester the lady in my life.

00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:49.300
 He had to be able to be kicking walls out as he was sexy-canded.

00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:51.900
 I thought Will was just doing the living room woodwork.

00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:53.500
 That's the way it started.

00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:55.100
 And thank goodness he's about to,

00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:56.900
 all the assu-cinnages are that poor.

00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:58.900
 Come on, goodness, what happened?

00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:00.900
 He overlapped.

00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:01.900
 He walked?

00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:02.900
 He overlapped.

00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:04.300
 From one room to the other.

00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:06.100
 Oh, Alice, don't you know what that's to do?

00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:07.500
 Why not?

00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:09.500
 He overlapped with that too.

00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:11.700
 I found the bottom.

00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:15.700
 In the kitchen, I mentioned from I was actually a terrible figure

00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:19.200
 perfectly powerful saying here what happened well my cousin

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:21.780
 always didn't make me have a strength to do it alone

00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:22.700

00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:30.500
 house and have a play guy go now don't you think if you rule that tell him to stay

00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:31.460

00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:39.700
 yeah don't worry it's a fine party that you're growing far

00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:40.380
 but I'm

00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:41.380
 that I am

 - This is a new thing to tell me.

00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:44.180
 - Maybe I shouldn't tell you this.

00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:45.820
 This is bound by Homer, no.

00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:48.300
 But he might have caught on when Henry tried

00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:50.340
 to keep more of him than a house all day.

00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:51.940
 - Oh my goodness.

00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:53.940
 - And Elizabeth, you suck down on that soon.

00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:55.420
 - How about tell, how long we just okay?

00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:56.500
 - But I should go to the party.

00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:58.380
 - I didn't have any answer to come in.

00:17:58.380 --> 00:17:59.380
 - Oh yes.

00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:00.380
 - What the hell is what I'm gonna do?

00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:02.020
 What's the surprise party?

00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:03.640
 If you mean you didn't know,

00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:06.140
 I've never been so surprised in my life.

00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:06.980
 - Oh, there.

00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:09.100
 - I'll never be able to get to these Eddie and Ty.

00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:10.540
 You're gonna have the party anyway.

00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:12.300
 - The moment it's second or last, you would be great.

00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:14.700
 You thought if I didn't, well, look, Elizabeth.

00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:16.900
 It probably won't be many, young students.

00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:19.620
 Why not get a few bottles of ginger ale and some cookies,

00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:21.140
 and they'll have a love later.

 I need a phone, Alice.

 - Who are you gonna call?

00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:26.460
 - It's Isaac, basically, and double my order of donut.

00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:39.060
 - All right, Homer, now how do you want your haircut?

00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:45.060
 Well Mr. Latham, you notice when you look in my hair in a certain way, it reminds you of a head of leather?

00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:47.060
 Well now that you mention it.

00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:50.060
 Could you just sort of look more like a head of a fabric?

00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:53.060
 Uh, no, dry. I hope so.

00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:54.060
 Yes, sir.

00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:57.060
 So, you're having a surprise, buddy.

00:18:57.060 --> 00:18:59.060
 Yes, sir.

00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:00.060
 Don't move.

00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:04.060
 Mr. Latham, should I mention I'm inventing a hair restore?

00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:06.060
 Yes, what for?

00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:12.300
 We saw hair. When I get it perfected, would you be interested in trying it out on some of your customers?

00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:15.580
 When you get it perfected, I'd be interested in trying it out of myself.

00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:17.420
 Oh sure.

00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:21.180
 Yes, uh, Barbara with a bald head, great poor recommendation.

 Oh, hi, Henry.

 Hey, who is the home owner of you, Ben?

 What are you mad about?

 - What?

 - Homer, it's still, isn't it, a tick-free shop.

 - It might interest you to know, Homer,

00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:43.900
 that you owe me for a box of cocklets.

00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:46.300
 My father had a bar for that lady in the theater.

 - What lady?

 - Well, make one side close and one side close.

 - 10, look what I picked up.

 - But what do you buy those for?

00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:23.660
 - They're just a thing to brighten up the party.

 Oh boy.

 You're crazy, Homer. There's no party.

 You're a Henry. That's why I have to take him to the corner, coming.

 Homer, you've got to listen to rings.

 Well, the children seem to be enjoying the donut.

 As a matter of fact, I think they're playing a little game with them in the kitchen.

00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:35.180
 What sort of game?

00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:39.280

 Most of it. Where's Will?

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:48.380
 Out in the backyard. He wanted a fitting cigar door before he soaked his brushes.

 - But he was, no.

00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:38.820
 Boy, Mrs. Brown, you certainly could've saved me

00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:40.500
 a lot of trouble if you'd let me know

00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:42.160
 that that's what you were up to.

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:44.120
 - Hey, Ray, what happened to your hair?

00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:45.360
 My hair?

00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:48.500
 I just got in the way of Mr. Latham's scissors.

00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:50.960
 My goodness, some boy, if you think I'm bad,

00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:52.720
 You should see Homer.

00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:55.520
 He looks like an eggplant.

00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:56.880
 Look, there he is.

00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:59.240
 Well, I finally convinced him that there

00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:03.720
 wasn't any surprise party, and he went off-store.

00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:06.160
 I'll get it to have a donut in some ginger ale.

00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:08.480
 Henry, you look all worn out.

00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:09.800
 Hello, who's so-on, Mother?

00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:12.000
 I just called to tell you I made you a little late,

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:12.840
 getting home.

00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:14.320
 Homer, where are you?

00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:15.880
 I'm driving on vacation.

00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:17.880
 I got a jar for the evening.

00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:19.160
 What kind of a jar?

00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:21.160
 I'm making a downer.

00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:22.160
 - No!

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:23.160
 - I need a come on home.

00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:24.160
 - I can mother.

00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:25.160
 We have two dozen to go,

00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:28.160
 and I'm just beginning to get the hold and the sand in.

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:31.160
 (upbeat music)

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:32.160
 - I got the sand!

00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:33.160
 - Oh, I'm in.

00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:34.160
 I'm in.

00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:35.160
 I'm in the down of your head, kid.

00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:36.160
 - No, listen, I'm in.

00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:37.160
 - I'm in.

00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:38.160
 - It's cut on the by.

00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:39.160
 It's just cut on the by.

00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:40.160
 - Okay, I guess okay.

00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:42.160
 But where do you take a look at your own hair?

00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:43.160
 - What?

00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:44.160
 What's the matter with you?

00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:45.160
 - He was.

00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:46.160
 It's turning green.

00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:47.160
 - What?

00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:50.160
 Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:52.400
 (buzzing)

00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:54.640
 (buzzing)
