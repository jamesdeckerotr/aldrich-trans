 Postum presents...

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
 Henry!

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 Henry Oldridge!

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.000
 Coming Mother!

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
 [Applause]

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
 Postum presents the Oldridge family written by Clifford Goldsmith.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 The family brought to you by Postam, attempting wholesome drink for all the family.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 Postam.

 [Music]

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
 You know friends, one of the things that makes music so enjoyable and relaxing

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 is the perfect harmony of every section of the orchestra with every other section.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.880
 But suppose that just the opposite were true.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.860
 Suppose the brasses played in one key in tempo,

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.220
 the strings in another, and so on.

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.960
 (dramatic music)

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:14.080
 Well, that would make for anything but harmony, wouldn't it?

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.200
 Well, it's much the same idea when your nerves are out of tune.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.360
 Your whole life is out of harmony.

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.920
 You ring a definitely discordant note among your friends.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.560
 So why not just ask yourself next time you're edgy and jumpy

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.080
 if maybe coffee is to blame. It might very well be, you know, for even though many people

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.840
 can drink coffee without getting nervous, many others cannot. If you think you're one

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.560
 of those others, switch to post-em by all means. Post-em contains no caffeine or other

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:47.520
 stimulant, nothing that can set your nerves on edge. And as a mealtime drink, post-em is

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:53.560
 out and out delicious. So start drinking post-em regularly instead of coffee, and then see if

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:59.080
 If you don't soon fiend, feel completely in tune again, thanks to your switch to hearty,

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:17.420
 delightful post-em.

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.800
 Give a teenage boy a problem to solve, and you start what always turns out to be a wrestling

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.720
 match with the boy and the problem alternately throwing each other. Henry

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.400
 Aldrich however usually ends up victorious but gasping. The scene opens at

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.760
 the Aldrich breakfast table.

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.760
 Could I have the cream please father?

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:38.760
 Here you are Henry.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.640
 Thank you. Boy. Here it isn't necessary to eat your breakfast as though you were

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.400
 going to some kind of a race. But mother I'm in a hurry. I've got a very full

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.240
 day. Boy. Henry can't you slow down just a little?

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.880
 Alice, I don't like to undermine your discipline, but I happen to know Henry does have a very full day.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:56.880
 Boy, I'll say.

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.180
 He's got to empty the ashes in the cellar. He's got to pick up the backyard.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.680
 Father, that is the kind of full day I was thinking of.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:03.680
 I've got this list.

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.080
 See? What list, Henry?

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.280
 She was look at it. Just look at it.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:12.780
 One grandfather's plot, one fur coat, man's, one dining room table with chairs, one rose bush.

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.880
 Now, wait a minute. What is that you're reading?

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.580
 My list. My list.

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.380
 One pound of butter with muffins, one fireplace, an egg beer, and a cigar.

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:21.420
 What's that, Henry?

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.220
 A cigar mother for Homer.

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.860
 What's that?

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.220
 Homer smoking cigars?

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.820
 No, father.

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:26.740
 He doesn't smoke it.

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:28.260
 He just charges the ramen his pocket

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:29.580
 because he's got a lot of money.

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.860
 Henry, may I ask what this is all about?

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:32.940
 Did I tell your mother?

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.420
 It's for the school play.

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.780
 And I've got to get all that list by tomorrow night.

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.060
 How about the ashes?

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:39.380
 The ashes, father?

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:40.700
 We don't need any ashes.

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.540
 Henry, do you mind not asking why?

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.540
 If the play is going to be put on tomorrow night,

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.460
 you hadn't started to get any of these things before now

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.180
 because they didn't tell me until yesterday

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.740
 that I was to be plot man. Jimmy Bartlett was before that and they fired him.

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:57.540
 They fired him? Sure. He wasn't good at getting anything at all, so I, so I gave him the lead.

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:58.260
 Henry!

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:59.180
 What, Mary?

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.280
 Now I asked what Mother's egg beater is doing in your lunchbox.

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.180
 That's that, Mary?

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.200
 Oh, and now, the minute, Mother. I was going to tell you about that egg beer.

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.060
 Only Mary brought it up too soon.

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.980
 Hi, kids. Henry, why are you taking my egg beater?

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.800
 It's for Kathleen. She makes an entrance. She's from the kitchen, and it shows that's where she came from.

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:16.620
 Much, sir?

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.860
 Kathleen, Father. Her mother's dead.

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:23.540
 Kathleen's mother sure in the play and she's keeping house for her father Homer

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:27.900
 She's homers unspoiled daughter

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.000
 Kathleen

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.900
 Kathleen Anderson is Homer Brown's daughter. What's the wrong with that Mary?

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:39.460
 She's only a couple of months older than he is and as a matter of fact as a man he says Homer looks more like an old man than anyone in the school

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:44.540
 Henry if I let you take our egg beater. Will you see that it gets back to me? Oh sure mother?

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:49.520
 Yeah, I hope you don't think I'd go and leave a perfectly good thing like an egg beater over to school do you well

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:54.440
 Then I'll put it back in your spot. Thank you and Mary the next time you go searching through my lunchbox

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.920
 Please ask for permission and then what are you doing under the table?

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:01.480
 I'm just looking at the legs father. I'm just saying it though come off

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:06.680
 I take it over and you take it over when you take what over where the dining room table for the play

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:11.600
 Henry you are not under any circumstance is going to take this table. I can't have it

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:14.320
 But gee, was what's home we're going to eat off of?

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.320
 May I ask what we're going to eat off of?

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.420
 Couldn't we be the kitchen father? It's only for three days.

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:22.820
 Henry, do you remember last year when we loaned our sofa for the school play?

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:26.220
 Yes, father, but that wasn't my fault it fell off the back of the car.

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:30.720
 That isn't the point. This dining room table has been in this house for twenty years.

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.920
 If there were those in your school who have never seen a dining room table before,

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:37.220
 you may bring them over one at a time and let them take a look at it.

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:39.120
 But that's as far as I'm willing to go.

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.680
 Okay, then how about how about a fur coat?

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:44.600
 Can I borrow one of those a fur coat?

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:49.460
 It has to be a man's fur coat. It's for Homer. He's very wealthy seeing the fur has to be on the inside

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:52.360
 Yes, well, you've come to the wrong man for a thing like that

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:56.800
 It doesn't matter. In fact, I'd like to get a pair of her gloves for him too, and maybe your fur hat

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.520
 Exactly where is the scene laid in his dining room? Oh

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:07.080
 Homer comes into his dining room wearing a fur coat a fur hat and fur gloves and sits down to dinner

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:12.460
 Sure, I see he can't get in the cold. He can't do you think all to get some or what?

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:18.360
 Hi, Henry already for school. I'll be right in one second Homer. Good morning Homer

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:24.260
 What's that you have in your mouth a piece of bubble gum Alice? What was that? That was me mr.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:25.840
 All rich good morning

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:32.140
 Homer I wouldn't snap my gum in here if I were you oh sure excuse me come on home while I get my things on okay

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:34.140
 Don't run, dear. I'm not running.

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:36.140
 Listen, Henry, I had an idea last night.

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:41.140
 You know that place in the play where I take a thousand dollars out of my pocket and give it to Jimmy Bartlett?

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:45.140
 Yeah? Well, gee, I wouldn't have a whole thousand just losing my pocket, would I?

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:48.140
 Why not? I'd be afraid to carry it around, Henry.

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:51.140
 Why don't they have a cash register that I take it out of?

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:54.140
 A cash register? Right in your dining room?

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:56.140
 Why can't I afford one I'm rich?

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:59.140
 I know, but rich people have things like saves.

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:01.140
 A safe? Well, I'd settle for a safe.

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:06.100
 safe. As a matter of fact, that's a very good idea. Sure, Homer. Henry, you forgot

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:10.500
 something in here. Oh, gee whiz. I know what it is. It's my darn list. And that

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:14.260
 Henry is one reason why I don't want you to borrow this dining room table. Father,

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:17.620
 I agree with you. I agree with you entirely. I've driven the dining room

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:21.540
 table right out of my head. Good. Now, if you could only get me a safe, I'd be

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:25.940
 perfectly happy. A what, dear? A safe mother. There's a very important place

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:30.020
 where Homer has to have, has to have. Henry, do you realize how much a safe

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:34.180
 ways. Well I don't mean a big safe father like in a bank. I mean something about

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:38.980
 about. Yeah well you can just drive the safe out of your head doom. You mean I

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:43.940
 can't have one? Hey Henry we're gonna be late. I'm coming Homer and as a matter of

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:49.620
 fact I'm sort of sorry ever took this darn job. Goodbye Henry. Goodbye. Henry goodbye.

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:56.260
 I guess he didn't hear you dear. Sam. Well. Do you don't you think we ought to

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.620
 contribute a little something more than just an egg beater to this play.

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:01.620
 You mean you want to let Henry have this table?

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:06.100
 Now dear, I didn't say this table. But don't you think you could at least find him a safe?

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:07.860
 Alice, are you? Are you?

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:11.540
 Sam, this is the first time I've ever seen Henry get so wrapped up in anything.

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:14.100
 Why, dear, it's the most important thing that has ever happened to him.

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:15.700
 But where am I going to get a safe?

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:20.020
 You've a lot of influence, Sam. And if you explain it for a high school play,

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:23.940
 my goodness, I should think there'd be lots of people who could fare us safe for three nights.

00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:36.940
 (Music)

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:43.940
 Hello, Santa Villa Press Office. Yes? Have we got a what? Sure we got a safe.

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:49.940
 Who's this being? Oh yes, Mr. Albridge. Now could you tell me again what it is you want?

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:58.240
 to play with? Oh, you're in a play. Oh, I got you. Well, we got one here. Yes. We're

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:00.940
 three and a half tons. What's that?

 [MUSIC]

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:13.940
 Hello, Harriet. Can you hear me?

00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:17.940
 Yes, Alice. What we need is a nice warm, heavy coat that's lined with fur.

00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:21.940
 It's for a rather wealthy man that's a widower.

00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:23.940
 How about my Persian lamb?

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:26.940
 If you're a Persian lamb, Harriet, it has to be a man's coat.

00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:30.940
 Alice, where would I ever get a man's coat, especially a furline man?

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:33.940
 Well, I just thought you might possibly know of someone that has one.

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:37.940
 Just a minute, Harriet. Henry, are you home from school already?

00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:40.940
 Yes, Mother. Where's Mary? I think I've got a little job for her.

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:44.940
 Dear, I'm talking with your aunt Harriet about a fur coat for you. You are old boy.

00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:46.940
 Alice, I have another idea.

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:47.940
 Really?

00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:50.440
 Often one of my colleges is a leather windbreaker.

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:53.940
 It's mine, but it's tough like a man's and it's lined with rabbit.

00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:54.940
 With rabbit?

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:55.940
 It's hip blank, Dallas.

00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:56.940
 Just a minute, Harriet.

00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:59.940
 Henry would wrap it down to the hips, be alright.

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:00.940
 Just to the hips, mother.

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:02.940
 And have Homer's late show.

 What's that, a saint?

00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:27.940
 Mr. Aldrich, I'm sorry, but I'm afraid I didn't hear you.

00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:29.940
 Did you say you were looking for a saint?

00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:30.940
 For your son?

00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:37.260
 Oh, oh now I understand you. Oh yes indeed we have a very small safe. It's only about

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:44.940
 18 years high. Far away? You mean take it away? But Mr. Orridge it's cemented right into the wall.

 Henry, what are you dragging that dead bush into the house for?

00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:04.620
 Well, that's just what I started to tell you.

00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:07.260
 You know that hat you have, Mary, with the roses on it?

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:08.260
 Yes.

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:12.300
 Well, look, I'm not asking to let me do it myself because I might damage it, but I'm

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:14.140
 perfectly willing to let you do it.

00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:16.420
 And I'll even give you a line of credit on the program.

00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:17.420
 If I do what?

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:19.260
 Haven't I made it clear?

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:22.780
 All you have to do is very carefully take the roses off your hat and sort of tie them

00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:23.780
 on this boy.

00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:26.380
 Why, Henry, all the joy won't do any such thing.

00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:32.760
 Which part is it you object to do you think I'd feel when the curtain goes up and there's my hat spread all over a bush Henry

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:37.980
 You want it on the telephone? I am mother. Oh boy is this a day? I bet that's about the oysters

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:44.620
 The what the oysters I've been having some trouble digging up some oysters for the second act. Hello. Hello. Is this a senator?

00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:49.360
 Don't fish market. What's that? Is this Henry? Oh, she was is that you Kathleen?

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:54.580
 I told my mother about our dining room table and she wants to ask you a couple questions. Sure, Kathleen

00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:56.580
 I'd be glad to answer anything.

00:11:56.580 --> 00:11:57.580
 Hello Henry.

00:11:57.580 --> 00:11:59.580
 Oh, hello Mrs. Anderson.

00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:02.580
 Now tell me dear, just how did you plan to use our table?

00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:07.580
 Well, look Mrs. Anderson, this phone that's going to eat off it, his father helped settle the West.

00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:08.580
 See? The West.

00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:10.580
 The West. The West.

00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:11.580
 Yeah?

00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:13.580
 And his portrait hangs right over Homer's sideboard.

00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:16.580
 I got the sideboard all right from Mrs. Lawson and...

00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:18.580
 Oh boy, it completely slipped my list.

00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:19.580
 What's the matter Henry?

00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:21.580
 Do you have a mirror with Cupids?

00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:22.580
 What's that?

00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:25.180
 A mirror with Cupids aren't the hangover a mantle.

00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:27.480
 No, no I don't, Henry.

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:29.180
 Wouldn't just a plain mirror do.

00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:32.780
 Oh no, Jimmy Bartlett has to stand in front of it and kiss Kathleen.

00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:33.980
 Kathleen?

00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:35.880
 Every boss that kisses Kathleen?

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:36.980
 Yes ma'am.

00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:40.080
 Frankly I'm not any too much in favor of that part myself.

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:42.880
 But a play calls for a mirror with Cupids to be kissed under.

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:45.180
 And what can I do? My hands are tied.

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:47.380
 Henry, I just happened to remember.

00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:49.580
 Would a mirror with a deer head help?

00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:50.880
 With a wad?

00:12:50.880 --> 00:13:02.180
 We have one with a heel, deer headcogs at the top, but no cupids. She the only thing is, "Tell me frankly, Mrs. Anderson. When you stand off at a distance, could you mistake the deer for a cupid?"

00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:07.880
 What's that? It has horns, Peasant. Yes. Well, don't the horns spread out a little like wings?

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:20.880
 [Music]

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:21.880
 Sam!

00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:23.880
 Yeah? Well, hello there Alice.

00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:27.880
 Sam, I'm sorry to bother you down here at the office, but I simply got to have your help.

00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:29.880
 That's alright, I'm glad you dropped in.

00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:32.880
 Alice, I think I have an idea that's going to solve the whole business.

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:33.880
 Well, what is it, dear?

00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:37.600
 I rent a safe that has to be hauled all the way up to the high school auditorium

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:40.120
 when they have steel lockers right in their own gymnasium.

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:41.120
 Steel lockers.

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:44.200
 All they have to do is move one of them on stage and have somebody in the art department

00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:45.840
 paint a combination dial on it.

00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:47.960
 Now Sam, a gymnasium locker.

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:50.440
 Why when the students see it they'll simply howl?

00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:53.040
 But Alice, you realize I haven't touched one bit of work all day.

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:55.400
 The only thing I've done is call people about sapes.

00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:58.040
 Dear, that isn't any more than Henry's done.

00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:02.200
 And Sam, where am I going to find a gold-plated chandelier with old-fashioned gas lights on

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:03.200
 it?

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:06.300
 Here we must know someone in this town who owns a thing like that.

00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:11.200
 Alice, I'll do what I can to find a safe, but I put my foot down on a go-fated gas-like chandelier.

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:27.100
 Now listen, Henry, for the last time and listen to eat them.

00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:30.100
 Homer, don't you realize that this is for the junior class play?

00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:31.000
 What if it is?

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.900
 I'm not asking to eat the oysters for me.

00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:36.900
 I'm asking you to eat them for the junior class and I'm still not gonna eat them.

00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:41.900
 If I knew the thing like this was gonna happen in a fruit a couple of courses and popped into the sophomore class.

00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:48.900
 Homer, you don't have to eat the whole dozen oysters. Not even a half a dozen oysters. You just nibble at two or three.

00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:50.900
 You're rich, you can afford to throw some away.

00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:54.900
 Well, nobody will ever know I'm rich. Not if they see the dining room table you got me.

00:14:54.900 --> 00:15:00.900
 Homer, nobody's going to see it's made of saw horses. I got a tablecloth purposely that comes right down to the floor.

00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:05.180
 sure sure and it looks like a bed now tell you one more thing in the I'm not

00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:09.100
 going to wear a Prussian land it isn't pushing land or red Persian land and

00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:12.260
 that's a beautiful coat my aunt hurt paid a lot of money for what's the

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:15.780
 difference I come under the stage wearing a woman's Persian land coat and a

00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:17.820
 muff for a half

00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:22.620
 it's just out of the sawhorse and start to eat oysters that I can't stand what kind

00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:26.580
 of a millionaire do you think I am all right Homer all right I know what I'm

00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:30.620
 gonna do I'm gonna sit down right a lot of resignation to the junior class and

00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:34.880
 you're gonna quit before you even get me some catch-up for my oysters or a save

00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:39.020
 for me to keep my thousand dollars in all right Homer so far as I'm concerned

00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:44.400
 you can keep your money in your pocket I got it all fixed for you what's that

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:50.420
 Mary is that a rose bush of course it is now listen Mary those are nothing but

00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:53.540
 ordinary sweet peas sure they are sure they are

00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:58.420
 I'm gonna notice from the last row from the last row who's gonna sit there I am

00:15:58.420 --> 00:16:02.420
 Oh, I can say it, Marie. That's the last row. That's the last row.

00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:06.420
 So, Henry, I'm not going to tear apart my very best hat with roses on it.

00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:09.420
 Would you be any more pleased if I got out that old hat with cherries on it?

00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:13.420
 Cherries. Are they canned? What's that? I like canned cherries.

00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:17.420
 Homer, will you please tell me what place there is in the play where you eat cherries?

00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:19.420
 I could eat them instead of oysters.

00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:23.420
 Off my hat? What's that? You've got a hat with oysters on this?

00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:26.420
 Well, so far, guys, I'm concerned. I'm not even interested.

00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:28.420
 I hope nobody thinks I'm interested.

00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:30.420
 I'm going to resign.

00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:33.420
 Well, isn't anybody going to answer the phone?

00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:35.420
 Why should I answer the phone?

00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:38.420
 As far as I'm concerned, a junior class can...

00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:41.420
 Well, gee, what kind of a house is this?

00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:42.420
 Hello?

00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:44.420
 Is this Mr. Olrich's residence?

00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:46.420
 Yes, sir, Mr. Olrich is in here right now.

00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:49.420
 Well, about that safety inquired about just what kind is it he wants.

00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:50.420
 That's safe?

00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:53.420
 Wait, just a nice, good size.

00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:56.020
 Well, you know, what kind of you got?

00:16:56.020 --> 00:16:58.220
 You want a single or a double door?

00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:00.060
 She wish you got one with a double door?

00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:01.180
 That would be good.

00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:02.220
 How big is it?

00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:04.260
 And so big, five feet high, maybe?

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:05.740
 Gee, that's saying swell.

00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:07.380
 It's got to be hauled up there, you know?

00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:08.620
 Sure, but we've got to have it.

00:17:08.620 --> 00:17:10.380
 It's for a very rich man.

00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:12.860
 Yeah, well, then I guess he won't mind the carnage, will he?

00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:13.660
 Oh, no.

00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:15.980
 She wish he's got $1,000 in this pocket.

00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:17.500
 He's got to do something with it.

00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:19.500
 OK, I'll get a crew on it right away.

00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:22.940
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:29.940
 [Music]

00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:33.940
 Sam, I think the least you can do is go up to the high school and see that play tonight.

00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:36.940
 Alice, do you realize in six weeks my income tax will be due?

00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:39.940
 And this is one of the few evenings I'm going to have free to get it straightened out.

00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:44.940
 Just the same year it seems to be needed when your own son is practically putting on a play single-handed.

00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:48.940
 Alice, where's the inkwell that's supposed to be on this desk?

00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:53.140
 The inkwell, Henry took it over to the auditorium home I had to find a check.

00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:54.740
 Well that's a fine thing.

00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:55.740
 Just when I...

00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:56.740
 Mother?

00:17:56.740 --> 00:17:59.340
 Oh, Mary, did you get the rose bush finish before Henry left?

00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:00.340
 Yes, Mother.

00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:03.140
 I made a lot of little rose buds and tied them on with pitcher wire.

00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:04.140
 Really?

00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:05.140
 You took them off your hair?

00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:06.140
 Oh, no, Mother.

00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:07.140
 I just wired on radishes.

00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:08.140
 They look beautiful.

00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:11.540
 Alice, did you notice what I did with my income tax papers?

00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:12.540
 Your tax papers?

00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:13.540
 Where'd you put them?

00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:15.540
 I thought I put them out here on this desk.

00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:16.540
 At least I started you.

00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:18.540
 Did you take them out of your briefcase, Father?

00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:20.540
 No, as a matter of fact, I didn't.

00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:22.540
 Oh, my goodness. Sam Henry took your briefcase.

00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:24.540
 He took it. My briefcase.

00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:26.540
 Dear, you told him the other day he could borrow it.

00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:30.540
 Don't you remember? There's a place in the play where Homer has to take a will out and read it.

00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:32.540
 And he's gonna read my income tax right after the audio?

00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:35.540
 Well, Sam, if you hurry, you may be able to catch him over to Anderson.

00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:37.540
 He's gonna stop there and pick up a mirror with a deer.

00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:39.540
 Oh, what? What? Alice, you phone the Anderson.

00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:42.540
 And if Henry's there, tell him to hold him. I'll be right over.

00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:43.540
 [barking]

00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:47.540
 [music playing]

00:18:47.540 --> 00:19:03.020
 Or can't you just see Mr. Aldrich taking it literally on the run to recover those income

00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:04.020
 tax papers?

00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:08.540
 What I'd like to see though is some of you making fast tracks to your groceries tomorrow

00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:10.660
 morning for a post-em.

00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:15.980
 Because that grand mealtime drink is really something special, the aroma alone would make

00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:22.060
 that evident, it's such a grand aroma. It says so plainly, "Come and get a swell drink,

00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:27.900
 folks." And when you taste post-em, you find it actually exceeds your expectations and delicious

00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:33.540
 goodness. It's not only lusty and rich and full-bodied, but definitely distinctive as

00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:38.660
 well. That means you mustn't expect post-em to taste like coffee, any more than you'd expect

00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:44.700
 coffee to taste like tea. Post-em is an entirely different drink that will quickly have all

00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:50.020
 those numerous taste buds of yours fairly jumping with delight. So if you're not already

00:19:50.020 --> 00:20:02.900
 acquainted, get acquainted with Postam.

00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:08.020
 Now getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldrich. Mr. Aldrich has just discovered that

00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:14.020
 Henry, without realizing it, has taken his briefcase containing income tax papers for

00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:16.540
 The Homer deals in the school play.

00:20:16.540 --> 00:20:21.020
 As the scene opens, Mr. Alrich is ringing the Anderson front doorbell.

00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:29.020
 Hello there, Mr. Alrich.

00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:30.020
 Good evening, Mr. Anderson.

00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:31.020
 Is Henry here?

00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:32.020
 I want to speak to him.

00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:33.020
 No, I'm awfully sorry.

00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:35.020
 Henry left here nearly ten minutes ago.

00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:39.020
 He picked up a mirror and he was going over to pick up something at the Lawson.

00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:40.020
 At the Lawson's?

00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:41.020
 Thank you very much.

00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:42.020
 Is there anything I can do for you?

00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:43.020
 No thanks.

00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:46.020
 - Who was it, Mother? - Just Mr. Albridge, dear.

00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:48.020
 - Really? What was it he wanted? - He didn't say.

00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:52.020
 Everything he's trying to catch up with Henry so he can help him carry some of those things.

00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:54.020
 - Shall I tell Father we're almost ready to start?

00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:57.020
 The play begins at 8.30, and I have to be there early.

00:20:57.020 --> 00:21:00.020
 I'm sorry, Kathleen, but your father isn't going to the play.

00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:03.020
 - He isn't? - In fact, your father isn't even speaking to me, dear.

00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:05.020
 - Why not? - He must know the truth, Kathleen.

00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:07.020
 He presents. I was giving up his deer head.

00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:10.020
 - His why? - That's near what Henry took with the deer head on us.

00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:13.260
 on it. Oh that awful thing he gave you on your 10th anniversary.

00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:15.660
 Mrs. Anderson, something are here.

00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:17.020
 Yes, honey, what's the matter?

00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:18.220
 I need a briefcase here.

00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:19.820
 Briefcase? Oh my goodness.

00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:21.860
 Oh here it is, right at the hall table, Henry.

00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:23.220
 She was out of close shape.

00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:25.860
 I was just leaving the lawsuit when I discovered I had lost it.

00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:27.700
 Oh, thank you very much, Mrs. Anderson.

00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:30.700
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:38.220
 Ladies and gentlemen.

00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:41.220
 [Applause]

00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:47.220
 Ladies and gentlemen, we regret very much that there will be a slight delay in starting the play tonight.

00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:55.220
 But through the fact that a safe has gotten stuck between the second and third four windows, there will be a slight delay.

00:21:55.220 --> 00:22:03.220
 And I've been asked to assure you by Ms. Eggleston, our faculty advisor, that we'll begin as soon as the men have figured out what the matter is. Thank you.

00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:07.220
 [Applause]

00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:09.220
 I saw the whole thing.

00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:12.220
 Homer, will you please step back and let me get into the wings here.

00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:16.220
 I saw the whole thing in you way. You way. You saw what a whole thing.

00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:19.220
 What you had printed on the program. Look right here.

00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:24.220
 The oysters that are eaten by Homer Brown and that too are by courtesy of the Cinnaville Fish Market.

00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:26.220
 Homer, we had to give them some credit, didn't we?

00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:29.220
 Well Cinnaville Fish Market and no Cinnaville Fish Market. I'm not gonna eat them.

00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:32.220
 Homer, will you please stand back? Your audience can see your costume.

00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:35.220
 And that's another thing. The Star and Buffalo Road.

00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:37.820
 I'm fine, Buffalo, old robe, that you found your attic.

00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:40.820
 You're going to wear your father's wink coat over it, aren't you?

00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:42.980
 That Buffalo just looks like a very good one.

00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:45.520
 Can I suppose you think I didn't notice the roses?

00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:47.020
 Radishes.

00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:50.520
 Here I am, a millionaire and I'm ashamed to walk into my own dining room.

00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:52.120
 Okay, I'm all okay.

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:54.420
 Then you go ahead and run the show yourself from here off.

00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:55.920
 You mean you're gonna resign again?

00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:56.420
 I might.

00:22:56.420 --> 00:22:57.020
 I might.

00:22:57.020 --> 00:22:58.320
 I might very easily resign.

00:22:58.320 --> 00:22:59.120
 But Henry...

00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:00.520
 Oh my, what's the matter with Henry?

00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:03.420
 Kathleen, I was just standing here talking to him about...

00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:06.300
 about he's so darn sensitive.

00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:09.020
 And listen Kathleen, is my mustache on straight?

00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:10.660
 - It's on straight, but couldn't have gotten

00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:11.740
 a better one, Homer.

00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:12.580
 - What's the matter with it?

00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:13.820
 I paid a dime for it.

00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:16.460
 - My goodness, they had the knife ones for 15 cents.

00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:18.980
 - 15 cents, do you think I'm a millionaire?

00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:21.380
 What's that you've got in your hand?

00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:22.460
 - My egg beater.

00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:24.100
 - Oh boy, where's my briefcase?

00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:25.580
 Where's my briefcase?

00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:26.420
 Oh, here it is.

00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:27.740
 - You have to use that?

00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:29.580
 - Sure, don't you know where I take my will out

00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:31.500
 and stand there looking at it for a minute

00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:33.260
 Then get mad and tear it up.

00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:34.460
 Oh yeah.

00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:36.300
 And that reminds me, where's my will?

00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:37.300
 Where's my will?

00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:38.940
 Is there anything in the briefcase?

00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:41.260
 Oh sure, here's some papers.

00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:43.660
 Well, I've got to give Henry credit for that.

00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:46.060
 Remember to get one thing right for me.

00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:49.060
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:59.340
 Hello?

00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:00.620
 Hello, is this Harriet Breyer?

00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:01.140
 Yeah.

00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:03.140
 Harriet, this is Sam Olrich. Is Henry there?

00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:06.340
 Henry? Oh, why what here happened an hour ago?

00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:08.260
 He barred 12 oyster forks.

00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:10.020
 Where was he going from there to the school?

00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:12.740
 No, to the center-built fish market and then to the school.

00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:14.340
 That's all I wanted to know. Goodbye.

00:24:14.340 --> 00:24:29.300
 How's it going, Henry? How's it going?

00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:32.700
 You were fine tackling, but boy, Homer. Homer.

00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:34.060
 But the audience is liking.

00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:35.500
 That isn't Homer's fault though.

00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:37.540
 He's forgotten his lines four times.

00:24:37.540 --> 00:24:40.060
 And when he took his coat off, he forgot the buffalo robe

00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:41.700
 and it stayed pin around his neck.

00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:43.460
 My goodness, look at him out there.

00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:44.620
 He looks like a bear.

00:24:44.620 --> 00:24:46.860
 Henry. Henry.

00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:49.140
 She was father. Are you allowed to come backstage?

00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:50.140
 It was my briefcase.

00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:52.100
 I haven't forgotten it, father. And boy,

00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:54.500
 if you notice while I miss Homer's making up things,

00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:56.460
 he keeps calling it a ratty, boy.

00:24:56.460 --> 00:24:57.980
 Henry, where is the briefcase?

00:24:57.980 --> 00:24:58.740
 We've got it, father.

00:24:58.740 --> 00:25:02.900
 There's nothing to worry about and you know what Homer did with the oysters instead of eating them

00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:04.900
 He slipped them in his pocket

00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:10.020
 And Ray where's the briefcase right out there on the stage Homer's got it with my income tax papers

00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:12.060
 Oh, gee whiz is that your income?

00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:14.900
 Pass he's reading Henry when does he bring them off bring them off?

00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:20.520
 He doesn't he tears them up throws them in the fireplace and we walk out there on the stage and get those papers

00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:25.580
 Why oh no, Bob in front of all those people and we for the last time I have to have those papers

00:25:25.580 --> 00:25:28.140
 Well, look, Father, I'll thread a whistle to him.

00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:30.220
 - The ring part is a thing.

00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:32.460
 - Oh, gee, I'm so excited I can't even whistle.

00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:33.300
 - Look out.

00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:34.140
 - Father, where are you going?

00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:35.940
 - The idea's time going, I'm gonna get them.

00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:39.060
 - And now I am going to destroy this will

00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:41.580
 and cut my daughter off for life.

00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:42.580
 - Oh, my God.

00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:43.980
 - She was Mr. Oldman.

00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:45.620
 (audience laughs)

00:25:45.620 --> 00:25:46.620
 - Oh, but give me no paper.

00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:49.420
 - Show me, I've got a tear then there my will.

00:25:49.420 --> 00:25:50.820
 (audience laughs)

00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:51.660
 - Give him some--

00:25:51.660 --> 00:25:53.220
 - But Mr. Oldman, this is my big queen.

00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:54.060
 - Let's go on this.

00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:56.060
 I think it's wrong, it's wait a minute.

00:25:56.060 --> 00:26:01.060
 I think we're there for the giant DM era.

00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:20.060
 Will you have some bacon Sam?

00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:21.060
 No thank you.

00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:23.060
 You certainly haven't eaten much breakfast do you?

00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:25.660
 I've eaten all the breakfast I care to, thank you.

00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:29.860
 Now Sam, you can't go through life being upset over a little thing like last night.

00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:31.060
 I am not upset.

00:26:31.060 --> 00:26:37.060
 I'm just wondering how it would be if I gave up my practice here in town and opened an office in Abbott City.

00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:39.460
 Now Sam, I'm sure nobody even noticed you.

00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:40.460
 No!

00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:41.460
 Yes, Mary?

00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:43.460
 Mother, I've been thinking.

00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:48.060
 And don't you suppose we could move to Abbott City or someplace where people don't know Father?

00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:49.060
 Mary!

00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:51.460
 You go out in the kitchen and make me some more toast.

00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:52.460
 Oh, excuse me.

00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:53.460
 Yes, it's good.

00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:57.140
 Father Henry, I don't think your father wants to talk to you right now.

00:26:57.140 --> 00:27:01.100
 Mother, the man at Hall of the Safer Father just called and said that due to the fact it

00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:04.740
 was easier to get it down and up, the return trip will only be $22.

00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:05.740
 What's that?

00:27:05.740 --> 00:27:06.740
 I'll answer the phone.

00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:07.740
 Sam, here's a review.

00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:08.740
 A review?

00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:11.060
 Of the play in the morning paper.

00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:15.740
 Listen, one of the most hilarious evenings this town has ever enjoyed took place in the

00:27:15.740 --> 00:27:18.860
 Centerville High School Auditorium last evening.

00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:23.900
 The highlight was the guest performance of Samuel Olrich's prominent local attorney,

00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:29.180
 who made his entrance in what was erroneously listed on the program as a wealthy gentleman's

00:27:29.180 --> 00:27:30.700
 signing room.

00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:36.940
 The scene was actually on the western plains, and when Mr. Olrich caught the buffalo single-handed,

00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:41.740
 wrestled with it and threw it into the cave with the double doors the audience went wild.

00:27:41.740 --> 00:27:43.740
 Watch that. Now wait a minute.

00:27:43.740 --> 00:28:05.140
 Remember friends, Postam comes in two forms.

00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:09.140
 For those of you who like your drink made instantly, there's instant Postam,

00:28:09.140 --> 00:28:12.540
 which you make right in your cup by just adding boiling water.

00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:15.900
 And for those who like to use pot percolator or drip maker,

00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:17.300
 there's post-em.

00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:20.900
 Both forms have the same enticing post-em flavor.

00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:24.300
 So no matter which you choose, you'll enjoy one of America's

00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:26.460
 great mealtime drinks.

00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:27.460
 Post-em.

00:28:30.460 --> 00:28:36.580
 Homer, do you think this letter is clear enough?

00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:37.460
 What letter, Henry?

00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:38.220
 What letter?

00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:41.680
 I'm sending a copy to each one of the seven people that loaned us one other table leave.

00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:42.180
 Oh.

00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:47.520
 It says, "Dear Mrs. So-and-so, this is to thank you for loaning us your leaf.

00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:52.240
 But due to a slight mix-up, will you please have your husband come to the school auditorium

00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:57.560
 Monday morning with either a leaf that matches or some part of your dining room table so that

00:28:57.560 --> 00:28:59.560
 we can eliminate this little confusion?"

00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:34.100
 And Postam is one of America's great mealtime drinks.

00:29:34.100 --> 00:29:36.600
 It's good drinking. Good night.
