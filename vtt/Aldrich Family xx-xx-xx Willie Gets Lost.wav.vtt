00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
 And real over it! Coming, Mother!

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:29.000
 The Aldrich family! A special rebroadcast for you soldiers, sailors, and Marines of the United Nations.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:45.000

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
 A world filled only with teenage boys is something for bidding to imagine.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
 But a world without any teenage boys is just as for bidding.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.780
 For youngster like Henry older dad that's to everyone's everyday experiences

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.560
 But he opens in the older living room the time is Saturday morning

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.880
 But Mary haven't I made it clear? I'm not any good at that sort of thing

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.360
 I mean what's different says it may you don't have to entertain or anything?

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.820
 Oh, you have to do it keep your eye on him. Mary. Let me ask you something

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.780
 How old is this child you want Homer me to take care of Henry? He's not a child

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.400
 He's nine years old well

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.920
 I'm not gonna spend the only day of rest I have in the week keeping my eye on my hero

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.920
 But Mother Thomas is Mother that you would.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:25.920
 But I take care of it.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:26.920
 Is that one of us would?

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.920
 And Henry, I thought you asked me to help you with your kind first weekend.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:31.920
 I did.

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:32.920
 Sure, I'd be glad to have you help.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.920
 And I would either go to the great enough of your room for you.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:35.920
 Including my closet?

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:36.920
 Yes, Henry.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.920
 I've had just one thought in my mind all morning and that's to make the weekend happy.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.920
 It's perfect for you, it's possible.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.920
 And now somehow you've disappointed me.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:45.920
 I have.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.920
 Well, look, let me step out on the porch and speak to Homer for a second.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.920
 for a second. And maybe I can...

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:52.920
 Will you wait here?

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.920
 Alright, I'll be answering the phone.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:17.920
 And Henry, I think we should also know about even trying to clean out your lunch

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.440
 minutes to bus leaves for Abbott City and Gwen and Ada over there expecting us to

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.240
 come on it. Well that's what I want to ask you Homer. If we text the 10 o'clock

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.080
 flush over there I don't suppose we could keep our date and get back here by 12

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.000
 couldn't we? By 12 tonight? No we can't keep Willie out that way. Who's Willie? Oh

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.280
 well that's something I'd rather not go in to. Yes Mary Henry I thought you

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.120
 wanted to make that flop. Henry I just got this job Graham and you certainly

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.420
 appreciated your being so good about it about why you forgot taking care of

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.280
 Willie Mary what did I say I do anything like that I thought you were going out to

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.480
 arrange it with homeless she was I just went out to just be doing what mother

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.920
 guy to say when she finds out you've walked out on Willie mother where is she

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.040
 I'm gonna ask you say right here but Mary where you going he's out in the kitchen

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:10.920
 Henry mother are you satisfied with the way Henry's getting along and friends

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.920
 You know, I have time to worry about Henry's friends right now.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:14.920
 What have you done with Willie?

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.920
 Well, that's what I was anxious to tell you about.

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.920
 Don't you think that since Henry is a boy and Willie has a better time with him than with me?

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:21.920
 Yes, I suppose so.

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.920
 That's what I've been trying to tell Henry and motherly won't even listen to me.

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.920
 Mary, I have time to worry about that now.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.920
 One of you is to take care of and then you'll have to decide it between yourself.

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.920
 And whatever we decide will be all right with you, that's all I wanted to know.

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.920
 Henry! Henry! Henry!

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.420
 Henry Olgrip!

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:40.420
 What, Mary?

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.420
 May I ask what you're going down the front wall for?

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.420
 Mary Holman, I've got a catch-up, but...

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:47.420
 And Henry, don't you realize how upset we all are over your French?

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:48.420
 My friends?

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:49.420
 Your French and Willie!

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.420
 Or don't you ever want to get to Princeton?

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:52.420
 What mother say?

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:57.420
 He said Willie would be much happier if he were with you because you're a boy, and I'm a seller for you myself.

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:58.420
 She did.

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.420
 Hey, Henry, why would Princeton care with you?

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:01.420
 I'm a mother.

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:02.420
 I'm a mother.

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:03.420
 And just a second home.

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.420
 I'm going to leave it up to you, Henry.

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:06.420
 I've got to go in and change.

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.920
 But, Mary, why must I be the one to decide?

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.420
 You realize we have five minutes left?

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.420
 Homer, I'm stuck with Willie Jenkins.

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.420
 And how about Gwen and Aida?

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.420
 You mean you'd rather play with Willie than with Gwen?

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:18.420
 No, Homer.

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:20.420
 But my mother's worried about Gwen.

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:25.420
 I mean, Henry, if I get over there and tell Aida, you couldn't come, she'll take my head off.

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:28.420
 She went to a lot of trouble to get Gwen lined up for you.

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:30.920
 I told you were very particular who you went out with.

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.920
 But how about Willie? I've got to keep an eye on him.

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.920
 Where is he? He's out in the garden.

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.920
 I have to say, I'm sure he's all right.

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:38.920
 Okay, okay.

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:41.920
 Why don't we tie him safely to a tree and beat him?

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.920
 Hi, uh-oh, I don't want to tighten, right?

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:46.920
 We'll put him on the end of a long clothes line,

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:49.920
 and leave a glass of water for him in case he gets thirsty.

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.920
 Oh, no, we can't do that.

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:53.920
 Alright, then why don't we take him with us?

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:54.920
 On the bus.

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:55.920
 Way over to Abbott City.

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:59.920
 Listen, all you and mother want you to do is take care of him, doesn't she?

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.920
 What given to them make whether you take care of him here or in Abbott City?

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:04.920
 That's true.

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:05.920
 And, gee, there he is.

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:06.920
 Hey, Lily!

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:07.920
 You want?

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:08.920
 Come here!

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:10.920
 What are you doing with that rose boy?

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:11.920
 I said it up.

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:12.920
 I saw an oldie for you.

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:14.920
 Well, where's the holly you got it out of?

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:15.920
 I want to know.

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:16.920
 Now listen, Lily.

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:18.920
 You gotta put that back and come on with us.

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.920
 I'm not going anywhere.

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:21.920
 Oh, yes you are.

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:22.920
 Now, come on.

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:23.920
 And listen, Lily.

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:24.920
 That's my father's favorite rose boy.

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:26.920
 And he doesn't want to take it all the way to Abbott's Finney.

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:27.420
 Fanny!

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:37.520
 Hello there, Alice oldie.

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:38.920
 Isn't that you up there on the farm?

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:40.420
 Oh, good morning, Mrs. Smith.

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:42.920
 I just thought I'd get the little sweeping done out here.

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:44.920
 My, isn't this a nice morning?

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:45.420
 Isn't it?

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:47.920
 And Alice, I want to tell you what a nice boy I think you have.

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:48.920
 Oh, Henry!

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:51.920
 I guess so. I'm going down Maple Street with Homer Brown.

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:54.420
 It's the funniest thing the way I happen to see them, really.

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:57.820
 I was about a block away and I heard a small boy screamin'

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:59.820
 "Creamy at the top of this lungs, Alice."

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:01.820
 "And it's this, I thought he must be fine."

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:02.820
 "Well, they heard him."

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:03.820
 "Oh, no."

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:04.820
 "It's Nandi, we're just laughing."

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:08.420
 Henry was running on one side of him and home over to the other side of him

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:10.920
 and they were holding him right up in the air.

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:11.920
 "Really?"

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:15.420
 "Yes, and the little boy was waving a great big bush."

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:17.420
 "He must have been having the best time."

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:19.420
 "Oh, that must be Willie Jenkins."

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:21.920
 Apparently, Mary decided she'd let Henry take care of him.

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:23.920
 "Well, from the weird look."

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:26.800
 Henry certainly has a way with young people.

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.800
 And that's why I stopped by Mrs. Orgick.

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:29.960
 I wanted to ask her something.

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:32.440
 Yes, Mrs. Smith, I had to go to Red Cross

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:33.760
 for afternoon to week.

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:37.760
 And my little girl is a real problem, but she's very sweet.

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:40.240
 And I wondered when I saw Henry just now,

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:43.000
 whether he wouldn't like to earn a little money now and then.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.440
 Taking care of your little girl?

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:46.040
 Would be a great week for her.

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:48.800
 Oh, I agree with you, and it would be a wonderful experience

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:49.640
 for Henry.

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:52.220
 (upbeat music)

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:54.480
 (laughing)

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:57.820
 - Hello?

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:00.280
 Hello, was this Obisity 441?

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:01.900
 - How's your 20 cents, please?

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:03.500
 - 20 cents as much as that.

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:08.800
 - Hello?

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:10.700
 - Oh, hello, is this?

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:12.580
 Is this just a minute?

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:13.580
 - What did you say?

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:15.480
 - Hey Homer, what did you say, her name is?

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:18.640
 - Ada, Ada, she wants you right at there.

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:19.820
 - Write it down.

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:21.900
 Listen, Homer, you wanna mix me up?

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:22.900
 Hello?

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:23.900
 Hello?

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:24.900
 May I speak with Ada Ashley please?

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:26.900
 I'm late again to come to the phone right now.

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:28.900
 She's going down to the bus terminal to meet someone.

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:29.900
 She has?

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:32.900
 Yes, we're having two visitors from Vanderbilt.

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:34.900
 Oh, well look we missed the bus.

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:35.900
 Who is?

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:36.900
 All of us.

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:37.900
 Oh is this Homer?

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:38.900
 No it's Henry.

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:39.900
 Oh you're mine.

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:40.900
 What's that?

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:41.900
 Henry, aren't you coming?

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:42.900
 It's yours, you're coming.

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:44.900
 Only we had a little trouble.

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:46.900
 And there isn't another bus for an hour and a half.

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:47.900
 There isn't.

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:49.900
 No but don't worry, we're gonna hitchhike over.

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:50.900
 Alright.

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:51.900
 And listen.

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:54.900
 Do either of you or Ada have a kid sister?

00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:55.900
 A kid sister?

00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:56.900
 Yes.

00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:00.900
 Well, my mother was a little worried about friends, but now I mean...

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:04.900
 Well, you suppose she could sort of entertain someone we're bringing over with us?

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:05.900
 Well, I'll find out.

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:07.900
 And we'll be awfully glad to see you, Henry.

00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:08.900
 I understand you're very nice.

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:10.900
 Well, Gee, I understand the same thing.

00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:11.900
 Hey, Henry.

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:13.900
 What do you think happened?

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:16.900
 Listen, when I think Homer's fidgeted up so we can get a ride.

00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:17.900
 Goodbye!

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:18.900
 Goodbye!

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:48.780

Hello Mrs. Olga to his residence. Hello Mrs. Olga this is Mrs. Emily Jones. Oh yes Mrs. Jones Mrs. Olga I was just talking with a couple of the ladies from the red.

00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:53.580
 cross and I understand your son is marvelous with little children. Well I

00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:57.580
 wouldn't go so far as to say that but of course I'm his mother and I'm afraid it

00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:00.980
 wouldn't sound right if it came from me. Well just the same that's what I hear

00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:04.740
 Mrs. Aldrich and I understand he's taking care of one or two children in

00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:09.140

00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:14.660
 care of your little boy too? Oh I have two little boys. One five and one seven and

00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:17.780

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:20.080
 And my worries would all be over!

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:23.080
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:31.680
 Winston, first, lay a minute.

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:33.980
 Willie, will you please walk a little faster?

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:36.580
 Don't you realize we're only two miles out of town?

00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:38.380
 And just because we've got you along with us,

00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:39.680
 nobody will give us a walk.

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:41.680
 I'm not stopping, I know, but you certainly

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:43.280
 discouraged them.

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:45.580
 Why don't you throw that darn rose push away?

00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:46.580
 No.

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:48.980
 Willie, will you stop living every time you take a step?

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:50.180
 You make me nervous.

00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:52.080
 Well, I've got a nail in my suit.

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:54.080
 And I'm going to sit down here and take it over.

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:55.380
 There we go, Henry.

00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:56.180
 There we go.

00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:57.780
 He's sitting down again.

00:09:57.780 --> 00:10:00.580
 Willie, won't you please listen to the reason?

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:02.680
 You took your coat off and left it someplace

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:04.580
 and we lost half an hour, never found it.

00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:05.780
 But I was hot.

00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:07.280
 Here, poor I sure was.

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:08.980
 Is any car coming, Henry?

00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:09.980
 No.

00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:12.280
 Help me get the darn thing off and fix it for him.

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:13.280
 Where's his stone?

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:14.380
 Where's his stone?

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:16.380
 Are you going to hit me?

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:18.380
 I don't put ideas in my head.

00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:20.380
 Look, moment.

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:21.380
 Well, I take a shoe off.

00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:23.380
 You shorten half or you can sew that rose foot.

00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:25.380
 I don't know, fellas. I don't know.

00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:26.380
 Let's go.

00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:27.380
 Oh, stop switching me.

00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:29.380
 There is many nails in your shoe.

00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:30.380
 It's just your imagination.

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:31.380
 Well, look at my foot.

00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:32.380
 It's your saw.

00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:34.380
 Whoever dressed you didn't get all the wrinkles out.

00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:36.380
 I bled myself.

00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:37.380
 Hey, Henry, here comes a truck.

00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:40.380
 Oh, Mr. Yes or Yes or I?

00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:41.380
 Mr.

00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:43.380
 He was going to stop.

00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:45.380
 Come on, my friend.

00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:47.780
 Sure, five feathers so much.

00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:49.380
 Boy, I'll say.

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:50.380
 Come on, Lily.

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:51.380
 No.

00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:52.780
 Now listen, Lily.

00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:56.380
 Do you remember what I had to do to your wrist last time you wouldn't mind me?

00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:57.380
 No.

00:10:57.380 --> 00:10:58.880
 Let's just lift him, Henry.

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:00.180
 Don't hurt him, Homer.

00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:01.880
 Just let him know we mean business.

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:02.880
 I'm good.

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:03.880
 Yes, sir.

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:04.880
 We're in.

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:11.380
 You boys are in the heart, Dad, I'm in the right.

00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:13.880
 I'll say, can we certainly appreciate it?

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:15.880
 I'm really isn't this pretty nice?

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:18.880
 Aren't you glad you're going over to Abbott City and see some girls?

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:19.880
 No.

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:21.880
 Now listen, Lily, don't be so smart.

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:23.880
 Will you guys aren't so smart?

00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:24.880
 You know what you just did?

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:25.880
 What?

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:27.880
 You left my shoe back there when we got on.

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:38.880
 Hello, Samuel Otis speaking.

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:41.880
 Is this the order to take care of war workers' children?

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:42.880

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:47.360

00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:14.580
 (Music)

00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:15.580
 Hello?

00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:16.580
 Hello?

00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:17.080
 Hello?

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:18.280
 Is this Gwen?

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:19.280
 This is Homer.

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:20.880
 My gracious, Homer, where are you?

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:23.080
 That's what I'm calling to tell you about.

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:24.280
 We're getting there.

00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:25.480
 How far are you?

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:26.680
 We don't know.

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:30.720
 We got a ride part way and then Willie Drozewish got in the guy's eye.

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:31.920
 What did you say?

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:35.760
 He almost ran up a telephone pole and the guy made us get out.

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:39.560
 What, Henry's right outside where I'm phoning you, trying to stop another car.

00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:41.560
 I certainly hope you get here soon, Homer.

00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:43.260
 I've got my sister all lined up.

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:44.960
 Your sister, to me?

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:47.260
 I thought you were bringing someone by the name of Willie.

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:48.260
 We are.

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:51.360
 I'm not sure because my sister broke his aces with a soldier, that's how she can see him.

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:53.660
 Ah, this is all here.

00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:56.260
 And he hopes Willie's a mighty most person boy.

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:57.260
 And why?

00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:59.260
 Well, he's nice.

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:00.760
 But he's lost his shoes.

00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:01.760
 He did.

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:03.760
 And it's happened as cold.

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:07.460
 And we hung his shirt back on a bush to dry after his soda slips.

00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:08.460
 That's the best!

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:10.460
 A bouquet you're such a nut to worry.

00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:12.460
 But once we get him there, he won't be any trouble.

00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:13.460
 Hey, Homer!

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:14.960
 Hey, Homer! I'm coming, Henry!

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:15.960
 So goodbye, Granny!

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:16.960
 Bye!

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:18.560
 Henry, you stop the car?

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:20.560
 No, everybody just goes right by.

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:22.160
 You know what the trouble is, Homer?

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:23.160
 There are three of us.

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:24.160
 Sure there are.

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:26.160
 I've been telling you all the time, Henry.

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:30.560
 The thing for us to do is get behind a tree and I'm gonna try to flag the cars.

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:33.360
 Because these little trees, and then when they stop,

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:37.060
 We can step out and say, "Mr. How would you like to take a couple more?"

00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:38.060
 Sure.

00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:39.060
 Do it.

00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:40.060
 Now then, will we be understanding?

00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:41.060
 No.

00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:45.060
 Well, do you see that delivery truck that's coming up the road?

00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:46.060
 Yes.

00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:49.540
 Well, you'll be right behind this entryway, and all you have to do is stand there, work

00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:51.860
 perfectly safe and go like this with your thumb.

00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:52.860
 Like this?

00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:54.860
 Not for some that's holding the rosewood.

00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:57.460
 Come on, can we get behind the tree?

00:13:57.460 --> 00:13:58.460
 I'm coming.

00:13:58.460 --> 00:13:59.460
 Quick, get behind here.

00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:00.460
 Is your wife writing them all right?

00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:01.460
 I can't see.

00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:02.720
 Why didn't them all write?

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:03.920
 I can't see him.

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:05.120
 He just came off.

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:07.960
 But listen, listen, sound to go that car's flowing up.

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:09.320
 You think of your told me?

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:10.400
 I think so.

00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:12.620
 We'll wait a second to really try to catch an awesome

00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:13.560
 for a ride.

00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:16.320
 You, and then we'll step out and you'll--

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:18.960
 Hey, you need to drive this one right off.

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:20.800
 You need to make some trouble.

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:23.200
 Willie, what are you saying to him?

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:24.040
 Willie?

00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:25.240
 Hey, Willie, where are you?

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:26.240
 Willie!

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:28.480
 She where's Homie Tom McCarle and Lester?

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:30.320
 Well, that's gratitude for you.

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:46.320
 We'll be back with the Alders family in just a moment.

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:47.320
 Right now it's intermission.

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:49.320
 Time for our intermission guests.

00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:51.320

 Now getting back to the troubles of Henry Olgrich.

00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:14.140
 In their anxiety to keep a date over in Abbott City, Henry and Homer have started off to see their girls.

00:20:14.140 --> 00:20:19.140
 Taking along a nine-year-old boy, Henry has promised to take care of for the day.

00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:25.140
 Unfortunately, on the way, Henry and Homer have become separated from their ward.

00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:28.140
 The scene opens in Mr. Olgrich's office.

00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:34.820
 Sam, I'm sorry to bother you here at the office and I promise you I'm gonna take just one minute of your time

00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:36.320
 Hello, that's what can I do for you?

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:41.080
 Sam, the grandest thing has just happened, you won't believe it when I tell you because frankly I couldn't believe it myself

 No, what is it?

00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:45.320
 I'm not gonna tell you right now, they are I'd rather wait till you can be surprised

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:49.400
 Oh no, let me ask you one thing, how much do you think Henry's worth an hour?

00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:51.260
 Henry, how much is he worth?

00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:54.860
 Sam, all I want to know is where I can buy a sort of an engagement pad for him

 Father, I don't know.

00:24:54.540 --> 00:24:56.540
 All he kept saying was that I said my love real.

00:24:56.540 --> 00:24:59.540
 He hasn't got any clothes left on at all.

00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:01.540
 I know what I'm going to do.

00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:02.540
 What are you going on?

00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:05.540
 I'm going to lie down and put a knife bag on my head.

00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:07.540
 Boys, do you realize what you've done today?

00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:08.540

 You.

00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:11.540
 You've given Mrs. Hall that you're hitting.

00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:15.440
 You two boys decided to take Willie and go all the way over to Abbott's

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:17.340
 and adjust to see two girls, didn't you?

00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:17.840
 Yes, sir.

00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:20.540
 And your country has asked you not to do any unnecessary traveling,

00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:21.040
 ask it.

00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:23.040
 But we were throwing in a bus, Mr. Old,

00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:25.040
 and the bus was going anywhere.

00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:27.040
 That isn't the point.

00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:31.040
 All unnecessary traveling on buses means unnecessary wear on tires.

00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:31.540
 It does.

00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:33.040
 And extra passengers mean extra buses,

00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:35.540
 and every extra bus means still more extra tires.

00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:36.540
 Yes, father.

00:25:36.540 --> 00:25:40.040
 And that was all just because you two boys wanted to see a couple of girls.

00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:42.640
 You mean you gotta give up girls during the war?

00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:45.940
 You can give up average sea girls, can't you?

00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:48.240
 Unless you're prepared to walk over and see them, of course.

00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:49.440
 13 miles?

00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:51.340
 What's the matter with the girls right here in this town?

00:25:51.340 --> 00:25:53.540
 She and me and I were wondering the same thing.

00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:55.240
 We don't know what's the matter with them.

00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:57.740
 And everything.

00:25:57.740 --> 00:26:01.540
 Do you realize how many miles I had to drive my car today just to call the view?

00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:02.140
 Yes, Father.

00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:03.340
 Do you realize what that means?

00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:04.140
 Yes, sir.

00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:05.540
 More wear on your tire.

00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:08.840
 Exactly. And your father, whom I had to get his car out and try to find Willie.

00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:12.960
 He did my new tires. He did. And the police are out trying to find Willie.

00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:17.120
 Do you realize how much rubber has been wasted this afternoon just because of your thoughtlessness?

00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:20.520
 Four. The whole little thing like this happened every day in every town in this country.

00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:22.680
 Do you realize how many towns there are? Yes.

00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:27.600
 And do you realize how many boys there are? But they all don't want to see Grenonata Mr. Aldrich.

00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:32.800
 They all want to see some Grenonata. And you guys will have to choose life this minute.

00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:36.920
 Which one you have? Your girls are victory. You mean we can't have both?

00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:38.380
 not at the same time

00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:41.180
 now go on out and take it over yes father

00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:42.720
 I'll answer the phone out of the

00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:43.720
 he and my

00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:45.220
 a change of life

00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:46.520
 Alice

00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:48.260
 is that the phone of the front door

00:26:48.260 --> 00:26:51.260
 it's both here you ask for the phone and I'll answer the door

00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:53.420
 hello hello is this Mr. Aldrich

00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:54.740
 it is is this police headquarters

00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:56.380
 this is nip tonson down at your office

00:26:56.380 --> 00:26:58.740
 oh yes mr. Aldrich I'm sorry to bother you

00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:01.540
 but some woman is just like three children here

00:27:01.540 --> 00:27:02.380
 pretty what?

00:27:02.380 --> 00:27:03.880
 she's just gone on to the night shift

00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:05.620
 and mr. Aldrich he's afraid your office

00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:07.620
 This isn't going to be big enough for her children to play.

00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:10.620
 Miss Thompson tell her we are not running in her scene where she please leave.

00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:12.620
 He's already left and what all I do with the children?

00:27:12.620 --> 00:27:15.620
 I don't care, do anything, take them home with you, goodbye.

00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:16.620
 Yes, Alice?

00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:18.620
 Sam's here, he's here.

00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:19.620
 Who is?

00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:20.620
 Willie, he came back with the laundry.

00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:21.620
 He did what?

00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:23.620
 The laundry charts the niggity.

00:27:23.620 --> 00:27:25.620
 He's out in the kitchen eating a piece of pie.

00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:28.620
 And Sam, I don't know where he got it, but he brought me a rose voice.

00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:31.620
 Hello, very thoughtful, I'm sure.

00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:35.100
 I'm sure later on the end you can take it out and plant it with your other

00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:37.100
 bushes what letter you have in your head

00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:41.340
 before you open it my office

00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:43.740
 some woman is left three children down there

00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:47.460
 I'm going to take care of that be wonderful you can go right on the word

00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:48.340
 and not

00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:52.420
 now it's a bit early to the nursery I put up some of the money for it but Henry

00:27:52.420 --> 00:27:56.740
 isn't going to run it we haven't got enough time but here how can we ever

00:27:56.740 --> 00:27:59.580
 develop his character how about my piece of mind

00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:01.980
 Hey, look at this nose. It's from Henry.

00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:02.780
 A man race?

00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:03.980
 From Henry and Homer.

00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:05.280
 Why would they be riding to us?

00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:08.380
 Dear mother and father, and Mr. and Mrs. Olga.

00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:09.580
 Mr. Mrs. Who?

00:28:09.580 --> 00:28:12.380
 We are certainly sorry we were so soughtless,

00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:14.880
 and hope the country will not suffer too much.

00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:18.780
 We have taken an oath not to ride on another tire for the duration,

00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:21.980
 unless it is for a sense of need, not girls.

00:28:21.980 --> 00:28:24.780
 Well, I'm glad to see my talk here some good.

00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:28.780
 So we're taking your advice and walking to Abbott's city to see the girls.

00:28:28.780 --> 00:28:33.340
 They're walking all the way. But don't worry about our wasting shoe leather.

00:28:33.340 --> 00:28:35.580
 Is we are wearing our rubber so steeped?

00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:40.780
 Yes, that's fine. Mother! Mother, what do we do with your phone?

00:28:40.780 --> 00:28:44.380
 Oh, Mary. Hand me at home when they were running down the street just as fast as I could go.

00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:46.980
 Yes, dear. We know all about it. They're going to Abbott City.

00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:48.380
 But, Mother, don't you understand?

00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:49.980
 We're always chasing light after them.

00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:52.180
 Is what? Oh, that's no way a minute.

00:28:52.180 --> 00:29:13.680
