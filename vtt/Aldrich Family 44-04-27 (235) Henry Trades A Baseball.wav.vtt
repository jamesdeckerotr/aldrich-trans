 [Music]

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
 Coming, Mother!

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.000
 The Oldrich family.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
 A special rebroadcast for you soldiers, sailors and Marines of the United Nations.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 [Music]

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 A typical teenage boy like Henry Aldrich, lives in a world on his own.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 A world of impulses, hectic activity and honest enthusiasm.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 And grown-ups always welcome the opportunity of re-entering that wonderful world.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 The scene opens in the older living room.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 The time is Saturday afternoon.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 But Henry, don't you see my point of view?

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 You have no life to do a thing like that.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 But Mary, Charlie, talk to my son.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
 He's really a slow guy. He's really very good.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 Look, he's helping you tell. His hair's always falling down over the front of his face.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.000
 Not when he goes out.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 No, it isn't. Yes, it's a stuffy point of our habit.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 Boy, it makes a step of the board.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 Well, let me warn you, Henry, if Charlie Clark comes over here tonight, I won't even see him.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 Why not?

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 Because Henry, you had no right making any such thing for me.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
 Mary, isn't this a very, but you and Henry, the car price allowed?

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 I'm not talking about it.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 But you know what Henry did to me.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 You know what he did to me.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 What did he do?

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 He told me to Charlie Clark is a baseball.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.000
 [laughter]

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 Come, lover.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 I assure you, the baseball had nothing to do with it.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 And besides, Mary, do you realize how hard a thing like that is to get these days?

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 Mary, I always thought Charlie Clark was a very nice ball.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000
 Oh, Charlie Clark?

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 How did he search the draw?

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 I was a little playmate for Henry, but to send an evening with him.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 Mary, may I ask whatever gave you the conception of Charlie Clark is my little playmate?

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 I am in the ring.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 Hi, how are you?

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 Oh, my God.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 I need help to wait for her.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 Let's see.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 Oh, my God.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 I have to wait until I get married right now.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 See, I don't want to hear any more about this.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 Now, please go outside with Homer and play ball.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 Yes, Mother.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 I'll go.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 Only Charlie Clark thinks you have a play for tonight.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 You're made of heaven, Heather.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 You're the one who'll have to keep it with us.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 I am.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 Let's see that boy here, Charlie.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 It's right here.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000
 No more flossing Homer.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
 Boy, are you lucky you haven't got a sister.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 You're crazy, Henry.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 Don't you realize I'm the only person that I have?

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
 My family can pick on.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 Where's the ball?

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.520
 It's up on the shelf, I think.

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.520
 Can we run to have some light in this car?

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:19.800
 We don't need any light.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:20.840
 She was ever long ago,

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.000
 and knows exactly where everything is.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.360
 How would you win?

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.600
 Hey, Henry, what was that?

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:26.800
 You just knocked off the chow.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.200
 Oh boy, you're a boy.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.200
 You're a good man.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.400
 I'd like to try to find out.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.800
 Here, I can't make it out.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.000
 Sort of a box.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.600
 And there are a lot of little things that came out of it.

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.000
 Oh, she was like a step on, well, whatever it is.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.400
 Her sort of soft and squashing.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.800
 Henry, I imagine I should have a white smell chocolate.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:44.800
 Chocolate?

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.300
 Oh, it couldn't be chocolate.

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:47.300
 No, it couldn't be, huh?

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:48.600
 It's chocolate, all right?

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:49.600
 And boy.

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:50.800
 Oh, boy.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.600
 Don't you imagine that.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.000
 And no good, two-one-says.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.800
 Look out, Henry.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.300
 Let me get down here on the floor with you.

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:57.300
 Now, wait a minute, Homer.

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.600
 Rush night, the whole works.

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.600
 Don't you realize this box must belong to someone?

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.100
 I'm not necessarily.

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.300
 Maybe somebody put it up there and put that in.

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:05.500
 Ten years ago.

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:06.800
 You think so?

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.000
 Well, but don't taste as though they were.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 Ten years old?

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000
 Maybe they ain't any other.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.500
 Homer, come on, help me.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:13.500
 They're all over the floor.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:14.500
 Well, where's the box?

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.000
 You'll find it. You'll find it.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.500
 I've got the lid right here in my hand.

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:18.500
 And it's looking for me.

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:19.500
 Save all the little papers.

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:20.500
 Some little papers?

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.000
 Sure. Don't you feel this?

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
 There's a little paper cup for her for each piece.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000
 Oh, yes.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.500
 That's what I just swallowed.

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.500
 Oh, boy.

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:29.500
 Rob, Mary.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:30.500
 Don't let me tell you something.

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.000
 Oh, well, don't bother looking for me, Mary.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.500
 I'm on my way into you.

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.000
 Oh, I can't admit you.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.500
 I mean, may I ask what it is you're eating?

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:38.500
 Why?

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:39.500
 Eating?

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.500
 Well, I'm just running my tongue over my teeth, Mary.

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.500
 What I started to say was, one reason I don't watch Charlie Clock around tonight is because Joe Graham is coming over.

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:47.500
 Joe Graham?

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.500
 You'd rather see Joe Graham than a kind, generous guy like Charlie.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.500
 You realize Joe Graham is just as generous as he can be?

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.500
 He even sent me a beautiful box of candy yesterday, a beautiful two pound box.

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:58.500
 He did, Joe Graham gave you...

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.500
 Oh, listen, that's mine.

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:01.500
 Where is it?

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.500
 That happens to be not a few business, can we all?

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.500
 I put it away very carefully in a place where you can't possibly go across it.

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.500
 Oh, well, I'm certainly sorry.

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:09.500
 Goodbye.

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:10.500
 Why?

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:11.500
 Why are you going?

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:12.500
 I have no place in the ticket.

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:13.500
 I just have a little cleaning up.

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:14.500
 I mean a few things.

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.500
 I'm sorry I said what I said about you.

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:37.500
 We're here in the

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:38.500
 Oh boy.

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.500
 Now listen, why'd you close the door, kid?

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.500
 Why do you think so? You thought I wouldn't see it.

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.500
 With Homer, there's no knob on this side.

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.500
 You know, we can't get out.

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:47.500
 She was. We may be in here.

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.500
 Oh boy, nobody knows how long we may be in here.

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.500
 Oh, at least, Harry, we will start.

00:04:52.500 --> 00:05:02.500
 Hello? Hello?

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:03.500
 Hello?

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:04.500
 Hello?

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:05.500
 Hello, is Mary Alberts there?

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:06.500
 Oh, Joe, is that you?

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.000
 No, this is Charlie.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.300
 Oh, Charlie Clark.

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:10.700
 Mary, did you hear me?

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:12.300
 This is your friend, Charlie Clark.

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.100
 Yes, well, just gonna go ahead and make it.

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:15.600
 But I don't want to speak to Henry, Mary.

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:16.500
 I want to speak to you.

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:17.700
 This is Charlie Clark.

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:20.000
 Hello?

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.000
 Hello?

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:21.700
 Hello?

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:23.300
 Oh, gee, Mary, I thought you pitched me.

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:24.700
 This isn't an always Charlie.

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:26.400
 We don't seem to be able to find Henry.

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.400
 But Mrs. Olvers, I gave Henry a baseball.

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.300
 I mean, it's your daughter, Mary, I want.

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:30.900
 Mary?

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:31.700
 Oh, why Mary?

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:33.000
 Is looking for Henry, Charlie?

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000
 She is?

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.300
 Well, look, maybe you could tell me

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:36.980
 What time I'm supposed to come over tonight.

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:40.940
 Oh, so I'm not sure that I just married Milly tonight.

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:41.900
 Sure with me.

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:42.660
 Really?

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:43.980
 Well, sure, didn't Henry tell her?

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:45.620
 Well, Charlie, I think they say the same thing

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:47.020
 for us to do with the Henry phone.

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:48.020
 You later in the day.

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:48.780
 Henry?

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:49.460
 Not Mary?

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:50.980
 I'll tell Henry you call me.

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:52.780
 Oh, well, thanks very much.

00:05:52.780 --> 00:06:03.020
 Homer?

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:04.580
 Homer, you aren't even going to sleep now.

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:06.780
 No, of course I have a friend that's weak.

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:09.280
 I just feel sort of funny.

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:12.580
 Have you found all the chocolate's over on your part of the floor and some of them?

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:14.780
 I'm stepping right in the box over here.

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:16.880
 But, Homer, I've got the box over here.

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:17.880
 You have?

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:19.880
 But what's this I've been putting in?

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:21.780
 Now listen, what's the matter?

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:22.680
 It's somebody's shoe.

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:23.680
 Now listen, Homer.

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:25.180
 How's it going, Mom?

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:27.280
 You know what we ought to have a flashlight?

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:27.980
 Sure.

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:30.480
 I even found a couple of chocolate's inside this umbrella.

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:31.980
 Homer, keep going.

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:32.780
 Keep going.

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:33.980
 I have put somebody coming.

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:34.980
 What's the matter?

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:36.480
 We can work this, my father.

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:37.980
 Let's put the box up on the shelf.

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:38.980
 Okay.

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:39.980
 You put it up.

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:41.980
 I think I better move quick.

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:42.980
 There.

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:44.980
 And wait back in the closet.

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:45.980
 It's my father.

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:46.980
 He may not notice us.

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:47.980
 She was.

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:48.980
 Just don't move.

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:50.980
 Oh, get your foot off me.

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:51.980
 So McPey's your bed enough.

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:52.980
 Why?

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:53.980
 Yes.

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:54.980
 Yeah, Todd.

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:56.980
 I heard you were putting on just something.

00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:59.980
 Henry, what are you at home doing here in this closet?

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:00.980
 Oh, my father.

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:02.980
 I want to show all of it.

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:05.920
 Why are you sitting there doing absolutely nothing?

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:06.920
 White.

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:09.860
 Oh, we were just trying to see how long we could hold our breath.

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:10.860
 Mr. Allrich.

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:11.860
 Well, get up.

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:14.060
 You both entirely ought to be wasting your time doing that.

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:15.060
 Yes, Father.

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:16.060
 And please get out of the way.

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:17.560
 I want to find an old pair of shoes, if I am.

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:18.560
 Yes, Mr. Allrich.

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:19.560
 Come on, Henley.

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:20.560
 Oh, boy.

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:21.560
 I'm coming.

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:23.100
 Oh, is there anything to matter with you?

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:25.100
 No, Mr. Allrich.

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:27.100
 I'll be all right, I think.

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:30.340
 Hey, look, as soon as you get by, don't we got to go back and pick up a rest?

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:31.180
 - Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:33.020
 - I asked where you've been to the last half hour.

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:36.300
 - Oh, wait, we're just, we're out there on Mrs. Old.

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:38.060
 - We're looking for a flashlight.

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:40.060
 - Yes, we need a flashlight, mother.

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:41.620
 - I'm Mary, have you seen one?

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:43.540
 - I mean, I'm not even speaking to you.

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:44.380
 - Do I, Mary?

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:46.180
 - And I just wanna tell you, if you hadn't done what you did,

00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:47.900
 I would have let you and Homer have some of the candy,

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:48.940
 your grand business.

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:50.820
 But as it is, you're not even gonna say it.

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:53.460
 - Oh, we're not? - Oh, gee, with Henry.

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:55.660
 You wanna see what I just found in the cup of my pan.

00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:57.500
 - What is it, Homer? - Nothing.

00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:58.700
 Nothing. - It's--

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:01.300
 Oh, Mo, is it in pretty good condition?

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:04.700
 Well, to be frank, Henry, we better just leave it where it is.

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:07.700
 Henry, have you cleaned up that mess yet?

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:08.700
 Is that mess?

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:09.700
 Oh, boy.

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:11.700
 You know very well that I'm talking about.

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:14.700
 That model airplane you left all over the floor of your room.

00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:15.700
 Oh, is that all?

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:16.700
 Is that all?

00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:17.700
 Henry, what's gotten into you?

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:18.700
 Oh, nothing, Mother.

00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:19.700
 Nothing.

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:22.700
 This is all the challenge you're wearing ideas to where we plan to flashlight.

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:24.700
 Oh, my Henry does not need any flashlight.

00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:25.700
 It's straight and things up.

00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:26.700
 He does, and...

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:29.700
 - Hey, which mess you want me to work? - You step up me, all right.

00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:32.700
 - Mother, would you like to have me go get two pieces of that candy joke about me?

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:35.700
 - I certainly hope you haven't opened it. - Oh, no, Mother.

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:38.700
 - How did you be careful to hide it out in the whole closet? - In the whole closet!

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:43.700
 Your father is always poking around in that closet, and you know how he is when he gets over the box of candy.

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:47.700
 - Well, my goodness, I'll get it out right away. - You can find a place in the dining room to hide it.

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:52.700
 - All right. - Mary, look. There it is. Right out on the top shelf where everyone can see it.

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:55.700
 - This is a strange. - I thought I'd put it right back in there.

00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:57.700
 I'm not going to let go of me.

00:08:57.700 --> 00:08:58.700
 Take one seat.

00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:00.700
 Now, dear, don't even take the cover off that box.

00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:03.700
 Why not hide it in the dining room and open it until William comes to see.

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:05.700
 All right, let me out of here.

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:07.700
 Then you can see how much it looks.

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:17.700
 Oh, there, Mr. Aldrich.

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:19.700
 Well, that's all right, darling. How are you?

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:21.700
 That's fine. Can I see him, Mary, please?

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:22.700
 You want, Mary?

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:23.700
 Mary!

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:24.700
 - Hey, Miss. - Yes, Father.

00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:26.700
 Charlie Clark, here to see you.

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:29.700
 Mary. Mary.

00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:31.700
 Is she getting you, Mr. Aldrich?

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:33.700
 I thought she asked her when I first called.

00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:35.700
 Step inside, we're trying to locate her.

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:36.700
 Okay. Mary.

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:38.700
 Can I hear her then, Mr. Aldrich?

00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:40.700
 I don't believe you did.

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:41.700
 I would like to see Henry.

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:42.700
 Hey, Mrs. Aldrich.

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:44.700
 I don't want to see him, Mr. Aldrich.

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:45.700
 What, Father?

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:47.700
 Charlie Clark, it's asking to see you.

00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:49.700
 No, I guess you didn't understand me, Mr. Aldrich.

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:51.700
 I don't give a dine about seeing him.

00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:53.700
 Oh, sorry, are you here?

00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:54.700
 Yeah.

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:57.700
 Who did it in the... Oh, Jean, hello, Charlie.

00:09:57.700 --> 00:09:58.700
 Oh.

00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:00.700
 Hey, how did you see Mary? He went to the other side.

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:03.700
 Now, Father, before I hear me, I want to ask her what time I'm to come over tonight.

00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:06.700
 And every time I call, I give me your mother and start looking for you.

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:08.700
 Well, listen, Charlie.

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:11.700
 Like this man, home and I are very busy trying to find a flashlight.

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:13.700
 Oh, you want a flashlight? Well, why didn't you tell me?

00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:15.700
 You mean, you've got one, sure. I hear on my key ring.

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:17.700
 Sort of small, though.

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:19.700
 What is this happening? A flashlight? A flashlight?

00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:21.260
 Let me have a beer.

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.500
 Come on, let's see what we can dig up on the closet.

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:25.060
 We're gonna dig something up, fellas.

00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:26.580
 Can I watch him? Wait a second.

00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:28.100
 Charlie, how do you work this?

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:29.900
 He can't. The battery's dead.

00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:32.740
 Listen, Charlie. Are you trying to be funny?

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:34.260
 I'll locate a battery someday.

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.100
 The water isn't gonna last forever.

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:37.900
 What are you gonna do with that table, Anne Henry?

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:40.060
 I'll just go take it for a front-hole closet for something.

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:41.460
 But how about Mary?

00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:43.900
 Ken, you hear me, Henry? How about Mary?

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:45.580
 Here, Henry. Here's a floor, Claude.

00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:47.540
 Right near the closet door.

00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:49.300
 Look, it lights up the whole clock.

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:52.340
 Henry, would I be bothering you now if I asked a simple statement?

00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:54.140
 Gee, I'm gonna look at them.

00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:56.540
 - No, I'm gonna pull them off, please. - Oh, no.

00:10:56.540 --> 00:10:58.300
 We didn't get even half of them.

00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:00.940
 What are those little black things you're picking up, fellas?

00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:03.020
 Listen, Henry. I'll hold you in my hand,

00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:04.300
 and you do the picking up.

00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:06.740
 Well, hold your hand, big fellas.

00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:09.300
 - Father, I saw you, Lord, come on, yes! - Oh, boy.

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:11.020
 No, Mary, I'm still here. Wait a minute.

00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:13.140
 - Well, I am! - Oh, please, wait a minute.

00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:15.540
 Now, listen, Troy, you want to take that lamp for?

00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:17.540
 I'm all right. Now wait a minute.

00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:18.540
 Now you put on.

00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:21.540
 Listen, Henry, what am I gonna do with these two handfuls of charters?

00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:24.540
 Let me see that in the box. I'm gonna pick up this lamp first.

00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:26.540
 Alice, is that your gun wrong?

00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:27.540
 Oh boy.

00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:29.540
 Was that my aunt, Harry, at the just team in the front door?

00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:31.540
 Where are you, Alice? In the business room?

00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:34.540
 Come on. What's the end of the dining room before she gets me at the school?

00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:36.540
 Henry, what am I gonna do with these charters?

00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:38.540
 Oh, put them in your box. They're crazy.

00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:40.540
 Isn't that additional, darling?

00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:42.540
 Oh, dear. Put them in the next.

00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:44.540
 Oh, my glad to get rid of those.

00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:46.540
 Now Homer, don't wipe your hands on the table floor.

00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:47.540
 I'm not.

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:48.540
 I was just feeling it.

00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:50.540
 See what kind of material it is.

00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:53.540
 Look out while I shut the dishes of chocolate behind the fruit bowl.

00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:55.540
 You feel any more freedom?

00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:56.540
 No, how can you?

00:11:56.540 --> 00:11:57.540
 Can I try?

00:11:57.540 --> 00:11:58.540
 Can I try?

00:11:58.540 --> 00:11:59.540
 No, Mary.

00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:00.540
 Are you looking for?

00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:01.540
 I know.

00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:02.540
 I'm trying to get away from you.

00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:03.540
 Keep on me after the kitchen.

00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:04.540
 I went out for that too.

00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:05.540
 And now I just came in the classroom.

00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:07.540
 Mary, is that you in the dining room?

00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:08.540
 Yes, but I'm not so low.

00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:09.540
 Sorry, quiet.

00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:10.540
 Was looking for you.

00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:11.540
 Did he find you?

00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:12.380
 for you.

00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:13.220
 Did he find you?

00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:14.220
 I don't think so.

00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:15.780
 Homer, what do you have on your hand?

00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:18.740
 White, a man, boy.

00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:19.780
 Say, look, look, look, look.

00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:21.620
 I've got him in my puddle now, son.

00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:22.740
 You better go up and watch him.

00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:24.540
 Yes, Mr. Hall, make you mind, Henry.

00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:25.220
 OK.

00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:27.380
 And if you see your mother off back out of your Aunt Harry,

00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:28.940
 that's waiting to see her in the living room.

00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:30.420
 Father, what are you looking for?

00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:32.420
 Lamping, oh, let's think to be something wrong with one

00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:33.180
 of my shoes.

00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:34.900
 Give me my hat, huh?

00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:37.300
 I have a pair of shoes in the hall closet, and maybe

00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:38.580
 my imagination, but I think there's

00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:40.180
 something down in the door of one.

00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:43.700

 - Yes, out of it. How did it wait until you were in the living room?

 - Yes. How are you? I'll be right in there.

 - Great. - Where did this come from?

00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:58.220
 - How does it matter? - There's two people standing behind the pool.

 Now, dear, you didn't go and open that box your way, I'm glad you did.

00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:03.700
 - No, no, because remember, I can't pass you on to the pool.

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:06.020
 - Mary, I didn't put this here. - Mm-hmm.

00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:10.140
 - Who thinks she liked it? - Why, of course, he did.

 He's always carrying little paper bags of candy around there.

 - What do you have a thing? - A mary.

00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:16.540
 - I've been to my return on clothing in our home.

00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:18.140
 - Mary, you can't keep coming away from her.

00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:20.340
 - I'm not going to say here. - No, Mary.

00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:23.540
 - Come over to you, Queen Mary. - Have I been married, darling?

00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:25.340
 - I'll have a different ring you want to see.

00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:28.140
 - Isn't it funny I can't make that clear to anyone?

00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:29.940
 - It's Mary I want. - Here, dear.

00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:32.340
 - Will you have a topic? - Thanks. I don't mind if I do.

 - Henry, what are you looking at a sideboard for?

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:28.960
 - Somewhere in this household, there's a flashlight.

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:30.360
 - Oh, boy. - Let's see, Henry.

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:31.520

00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:13.040
 Oh, Mr. Behaven, do you have any hair oil that smells nice?

00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:15.040
 And say fellas, does Mary like candy?

00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:16.240
 What's that, Charlie?

00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:18.120
 Would you like to buy Mary about the candy?

00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:18.960
 Sure.

00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:20.920
 Sure, Charlie.

00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:23.200
 And how would you like to have us deliver it, Troy?

00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:24.080
 Oh, no.

00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:24.880
 We can't do that.

00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:27.280
 Look, Mr. Behaven, how much are those boxes over there?

00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:28.080
 Is it done here?

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:29.840
 Charlie, that is in the kind she likes.

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:31.680
 You know, listen, hold on. I'm not going to have any part of this.

00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:33.360
 Hey, don't you want to save your own life?

00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:34.240
 Charlie, come here.

00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:35.160
 They'll win. They'll win. They'll win.

00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:35.760
 Don't listen.

00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:37.760
 Let go of him, Henry. You had gold in your shop.

00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:38.680
 Wait a minute, fella.

00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:39.480
 Wait a minute.

00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:48.800
 What is that? You want me to argue?

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:50.000
 Do you want me to have a come-up?

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:51.760
 No, I haven't decided.

00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:53.360
 - Have you got her? - Yes, dear.

00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:54.360
 - She just left. - What?

00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:56.280
 Do you think she might have taken my box of chocolate?

00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:56.960
 No.

00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:59.260
 Your Aunt Harry is not in the habit of taking candies.

00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:00.460
 It doesn't belong to us.

00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:02.760
 Well, I guess these just three people that might have taken it.

00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:03.760
 And who are they?

00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:06.460
 Your Harry or her or Charlie Clark are possibly all three.

00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:08.660
 Now, Mary, that isn't exactly fair.

00:23:08.660 --> 00:23:11.260
 You probably intended to put the box of candy in the sideboard

00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:13.160
 and add some mind and let's put it some other place.

00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:15.360
 Oh, that's why he's learning his soap upstairs.

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:16.360
 And his soap pan?

00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:17.860
 Yes, Alex, I'd like to wash my hands.

00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:19.960
 I couldn't ignore the rules that you have all over your home.

00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:20.960
 Well, nothing there.

00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:22.960
 It just seems to be chocolate.

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:23.960
 Chocolate?

00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:25.260
 I think it's chocolate.

00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:27.660
 - Sam, how did you get chocolate on you? - I have no idea.

00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:30.260
 I have to look at my hand a little while ago and it was all chocolate.

00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:33.860
 After all, is that important? Where will I find a piece of soap?

00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:36.460
 - Feel, I don't think I've ever been so mad at you in my life.

00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:38.060
 - Mad at me? - What about us?

00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:40.660
 - Sam, you know what you've done. You know very well what you've done.

00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:43.660
 - What do you think he did? - That's all I wanted to think was told.

00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:47.020
 - Oh, I can't believe it. - I should have known Mary that your father couldn't be

00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:49.660
 cut into the box of candy in the house. He never could be.

00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:52.860
 Let him have one piece and he loses all control and all character.

00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:55.860
 - Oh, that's Harriet. I thought you'd go. - Oh, don't bother.

00:23:55.860 --> 00:23:57.860
 I'll just sit back into the hall, talk to your loved ones,

00:23:57.860 --> 00:23:58.860
 and I'll ask you to last week.

00:23:58.860 --> 00:24:01.860
 - Oh, did you almost forget it again? - No, I was going to come out on the porch with me.

00:24:01.860 --> 00:24:05.860
 - Oh, just start and read. - And Harriet, you want me to hold your pocket before you put it out?

00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:09.860
 - No, thank you. I can put it out. - Oh, it's my good enough for falling on me.

00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:11.860
 - Oh, there you go. - Chocolate.

00:24:11.860 --> 00:24:14.860
 - Hey, Harriet, where did you get those? - Oh, where are they coming from?

00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:23.860
 [Music]

00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:25.860
 Mother, is here almost ready?

00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:27.860
 It won't be ready for another ten minutes, Mary at least.

00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:30.860
 Well, Mother, I don't like the scene, no rush, you, but Joe's in the living room,

00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:33.860
 and he keeps asking whether I got the box of candy and whether I like it.

00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:36.860
 Mother, if we can only tell you, maybe he gets my office up there.

00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:39.860
 Mary, all I can say is I'll get it just as soon as I can.

00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:41.860
 Now, go back into the living room and visit me.

00:24:41.860 --> 00:24:42.860
 Yes, Mother.

00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:43.860
 Oh, Rosie.

00:24:43.860 --> 00:24:45.860
 Mother, who Henry, is that you?

00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:46.860
 Yes, Mother.

00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:47.860
 I am Homer.

00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:50.860
 Henry, have you seen about the candy anywhere around here?

00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:52.860
 I've seen it.

00:24:52.860 --> 00:24:55.860
 Do you please run up there and get washed to dinner right away?

00:24:55.860 --> 00:24:57.860
 And Homer, you better go home so you won't be late for your dinner.

00:24:57.860 --> 00:24:59.860
 But Mrs. O, the candy won't be fast.

00:24:59.860 --> 00:25:00.860
 You're some sort of mother.

00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:03.860
 Can I go over to Homer to dinner so I won't be here to feed him?

00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:05.860
 I mean, now Henry, go play him here.

00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:06.860
 You want to visit, Betty.

00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:07.860
 Please go up and get washed.

00:25:07.860 --> 00:25:10.860
 But Mother, Henry, you should have let Charlie get her that far.

00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:11.860
 Get out of that box.

00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:13.160
 Let's hold on. I couldn't.

00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:14.260
 We're a bit of dirty trick.

00:25:14.260 --> 00:25:15.460
 Then be at the dope.

00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:16.360
 Who's that?

00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:18.660
 I don't know. Somebody at the door here.

00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:20.360
 Hi, Henry. It's Mary here.

00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:21.060
 Listen, Troy.

00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:22.560
 Where you going about Box of Canden?

00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:23.860
 None of your business. Let me in.

00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:24.860
 But, Troy, let me in.

00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:26.960
 Mary, are you here?

00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:28.460
 Listen, Troy. I'm advising you.

00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:29.560
 I'm begging you.

00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:31.260
 Don't give Mary that Box of Canden.

00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:33.060
 I'm not taking any advice from you, Henry.

00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:36.360
 I gave you a baseball and you don't even want to fix me up with your sister.

00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:38.060
 Hey, Mary. Mary!

00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:39.660
 Yes, he's not going to call me.

00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:40.660
 I'm here.

00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:41.660
 Here, here.

00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:42.660
 I see.

00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:43.660
 It's a box of candy.

00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:44.660
 Show me, cross.

00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:46.660
 I should have known all the time you've looked at the fly.

00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:47.660
 Now, you didn't take it.

00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:48.660
 What do you mean you didn't take it?

00:25:48.660 --> 00:25:49.660
 You're already fly from here.

00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:50.660
 Thank you, Charlie.

00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:51.660
 Thank you very much.

00:25:51.660 --> 00:25:52.660
 Now, please go.

00:25:52.660 --> 00:25:53.660
 Can you hear me?

00:25:53.660 --> 00:25:54.660
 Not at you.

00:25:54.660 --> 00:25:55.660
 I could kill you.

00:25:55.660 --> 00:25:56.660
 Please leave this house.

00:25:56.660 --> 00:25:57.660
 Where do you live?

00:25:57.660 --> 00:25:58.660
 Sorry, you hear me go.

00:25:58.660 --> 00:25:59.660
 I'm going.

00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:00.660
 I'm going.

00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:01.660
 I'm only at a minute, Charlie.

00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:02.660
 There you're faithful.

00:26:02.660 --> 00:26:03.660
 I feel it's the least I can do for you.
