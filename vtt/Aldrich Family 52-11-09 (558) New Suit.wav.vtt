 It's Bob Hope weekdays over most of these stations. Now it's the Aldrich family on NBC.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:17.000
 Henry Henry-O-Rich!

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.000
 Coming Mother!

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:26.000
 Rest of the Aldrich family is transcribed, written by Clifford Goh Smith.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 As every grown-up knows, a typical teenage boy never has to go looking for interesting problems to solve.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 The problems come looking for the boy, and you can be sure that a new and startling one pops up every day, especially for Henry Aldridge.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 The scene opens in the Aldridge living room. The time is evening.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 Mother, could you look at it this way?

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 I'm sorry, Henry, but I don't want to discuss it anymore.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
 Mother, don't misunderstand me. I'm not trying to discuss it.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 I just want to ask you.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 Henry, Mrs. Brown came over here to visit with me, not to listen to us argue about whether you should have a new suit.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 Oh, excuse me, Mrs. Brown.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
 That's all right, Henry. It's nice to see you take an interest in clothes.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 Sure. Mother, have you thought of it this way?

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.340
 You've gotta buy me a new suit sometime.

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.880
 Why not get one tomorrow and let me get a little wear out of it?

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.620
 Henry, I think it's time for you to go to bed.

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:32.200
 Without a... without a...

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.300
 Henry?

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:34.800
 Yes, mother. Good night.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:35.600
 Good night, dear.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:36.380
 Good night, Mrs. Brown.

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:37.440
 Good night, Henry.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.100
 I hope you'll pardon the way my bathrobe hangs in the back.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.100
 Yes, dear.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.500
 Well, Alice, I didn't want to say anything about it while Henry was here.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.100
 But would you mind if I suggest something?

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.100
 No, not at all.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.260
 But it's only because I know you don't want to buy anything that isn't absolutely necessary,

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.760
 but Homer has a new suit I think would fit Henry.

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:57.260
 Really?

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.260
 He put it on just once, and Alice, believe it or not,

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.340
 it's been hanging in the closet ever since.

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.700
 My goodness, Elizabeth!

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.580
 And it's a good shoe-dalless!

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.540
 Homer's uncle said it to him all the other day.

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:08.420
 You don't say!

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.820
 Yes, and he's an awfully good dresser.

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.540
 He sells things all over the country.

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.060
 And the shoe-dalless, well, when you first see it, you might say,

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.100
 Well, yes.

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.560
 But when you stand off at a distance, dear, the chicks,

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.960
 they're brown with a sort of orange stripe in the background.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.800
 Well, the chicks all seem to blend right in.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.560
 And Homer refused to wear it?

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.960
 Yes, but he doesn't care a thing about clothes.

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.760
 You know how Homer is.

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.160
 Oh, sometimes I think he doesn't care about anything.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.660
 No, I wouldn't say that.

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.860
 Oh, Alice, you just don't know.

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:46.260
 Well, I said to him, I said, "Homer, that suit will make people stop and look at you."

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.600
 And Alice, he acted just the way he does about broccoli and salad.

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.260
 Mother!

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:52.340
 Yes, Henry!

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.460
 Did you know that the government expects a wool shortage before spring?

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:59.160
 There I want you to get right into bed.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.160
 Yes, Mother.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.060
 Only don't you think we should take advice from our own government?

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.160
 Good night there!

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.060
 Elizabeth, are you positive you wouldn't mind Henry having that suit?

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.660
 Alice, I think it will teach Homer a lesson.

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.960
 And if you aren't doing anything, now, why don't we walk over to my house and get the suit?

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:16.960
 That's a wonderful idea.

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:21.100
 I'll put it on the chair beside Henry's bed in the morning and surprise him.

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:33.340
 Good breakfast, Alice. Good breakfast.

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.940
 Hem, you're not leaving for the office. This early, are you?

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.780
 Sorry, goodbye. Goodbye, dear.

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.980
 Tell Henry I'm sorry I didn't see him before he came down.

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:40.860
 I will.

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:41.980
 Mother!

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:43.020
 Yes, Mary.

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.660
 Hey, Henry.

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.820
 He'll be down in just a few minutes, dear. He's in the bathroom washing.

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:47.320
 Oh.

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:53.000
 And Mary, while he's in there, I want you to take this up to his room so he doesn't see you and lay it on his chair.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.720
 This mother?

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.740
 Yes, Mary. I just finished pressing it.

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:58.640
 Oh. What are you going to do? Cover his chair with it?

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.640
 What do you mean, cover his chair?

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.560
 Well, it isn't as a slip cover or something.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.440
 Now, Mary, that's a perfectly good suit.

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.320
 Mother, you mean, Henry has to wear that?

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:11.740
 Where did you share that?

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:17.340
 Dear Mrs. Brown gave it to Henry, and the only reason you don't care for it is because it's folded,

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.840
 and you're standing too close to it.

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.540
 But, Mother, you can see these checks a block away!

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.640
 Now, dear, please take it upstairs.

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:29.640
 Yes, Mother. I just hope Henry doesn't find out that I had anything to do with it.

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:30.740
 And now, Mary?

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.040
 Fine, Mrs. Aldridge, is Henry ready for school?

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.340
 But, good morning, Homer. Aren't you just a bit early?

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.540
 Boy, I'll say. I wanted to get out of the house before...

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.980
 I was afraid my mother might make me wear a good morning.

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:47.780
 Well, Homer, I'm afraid it's going to be sometime before Henry gets down and,

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:49.880
 dear, you don't want to be late, do you?

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:50.940
 Well, I don't mind waiting.

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:51.580
 Oh.

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:52.940
 Has he had his breakfast yet?

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:54.140
 No, Homer.

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:55.580
 Are you having hotcakes?

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:57.080
 Mother!

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.480
 Hey, yes, Henry!

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.180
 What's this thing up here?

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.180
 What thing?

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:03.940
 This thing on my chair.

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:05.980
 Why, Henry, that's for you.

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:07.500
 For me?

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:08.660
 This?

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:11.060
 Yes, you asked for one, didn't you?

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.860
 I... I asked for a rug.

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:16.060
 [audience laughter]

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:19.660
 Henry, if you'll unfold it, you'll see it is not a rug.

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:21.360
 But what is it, Mrs. Aldrich?

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:22.660
 Well, Gee, when?

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:24.160
 Just put it on there.

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.260
 What's she got, Mrs. Aldrich? What's she got?

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:27.460
 What's bad, Homer?

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:29.660
 Mother, I don't mean to criticize, but...

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:31.660
 Where did you get this?

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:34.060
 Well, what is it, Mrs. Aldrich? What is it?

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.860
 Oh, my... I'm sorry to be inhospitable, but...

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:39.860
 Henry may have a lot on his mind when he comes down.

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:42.860
 I mean, Homer, you better be going now.

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:43.860
 Goodbye.

 Hello?

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:55.860
 Hello?

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:56.860
 Hello, mother.

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:58.860
 Henry, aren't you in school yet?

00:05:58.860 --> 00:05:59.860
 I've got time, mother.

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:01.860
 I just had a phone and asked you something.

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:02.860
 Where are you?

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:05.860
 One, just three blocks down the street.

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:08.860
 And mother, here's what I want to ask you.

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:09.860
 Well...

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:11.860
 It's about this darn suit I'm wearing.

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:15.860
 Now Henry, I don't want to hear you speak that way about that suit again.

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:17.860
 Well, I didn't mean to be disrespectful about it.

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:19.860
 Mother, don't misunderstand me only.

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:21.860
 You think this is...

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:23.860
 This is really a school suit?

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:26.860
 Henry, if you didn't wear it to school, where would you wear it?

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:28.860
 Well, that's true.

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:30.860
 Now, dear, just think back a minute.

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:34.860
 Remember how we both agreed it made you look much bigger and older?

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:37.860
 Well, and didn't even marry tell you all my shoe lookin' in it?

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:38.860
 Yes.

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:39.860
 And there you are, dear.

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:43.860
 But I remember only last week we ought to tell Mary we liked her dress and boy.

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:45.860
 Just a minute, Henry.

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:46.860
 Mary, please go away from him.

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:47.860
 You want Henry?

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:48.860
 What's that?

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:49.860
 Nothing, Henry.

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:54.860

 Well, I'll be done.

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:08.720
 What?

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:09.780
 Sure.

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:11.860

 Well sure it is.

00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:17.220
 I could tell that suit a mile away.

 You're a crazy Homer.

00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:20.260

 Well, you're crazy yourself.

 Well, my doctor, glasses.

00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:28.180
 The golden patch, all one piece.

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:29.060
 Listen, fellas.

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:31.060
 I want you to meet my uncle Oscar.

00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:32.060
 Hi, Oscar.

00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:33.060
 Hi, hi.

00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:35.060
 Oh, Oliver, you're killing me.

00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:38.060
 Homer, I'm warning you. I'm warning you. I've got just so much patience.

00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:41.060
 I suppose you think I'm making it up about my uncle Oscar.

00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:42.060
 Sure you are.

00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:45.060
 All right, Henry, I'll prove it to you. Let me see the label.

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:46.060
 Now, wait, Homer, keep your hands off me.

00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:49.060
 Go ahead, Homer. You want me to hold them for you?

00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:52.060
 Sure. Now, Homer, I warn you, keep your hands off this.

00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:54.060
 Henry, that you...

00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:55.060
 Hello, Eleanor.

00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:57.060
 Well, aren't you going to be late to history?

00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:59.060
 What are you getting right about Oscar?

00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:02.060
 For the last time fellas, let's cut this out and just...

00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:04.060
 Just all go to history.

00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:06.060
 You got me checkers with you fellas?

00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:08.060
 Light on, Oscar, quick and flaky.

00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:10.060
 [laughter]

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:11.060
 Okay, that's so, Willie.

00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:14.060
 Well, I'll have you understand the suit never belonged to Homer's uncle.

00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:16.060
 What does it say on the label, Homer?

00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:17.060
 Here, I'll show you.

00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:19.060
 Stand back, Homer, stand back.

00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:21.060
 Why should I sure go ahead, Homer?

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:24.060
 That's your uncle's suit, and you can do anything you want.

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:25.060
 Sure, I can't.

00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:27.060
 sure I can sure I can.

00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:29.060
 The last time Homer remember what I said.

00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:31.060
 Go ahead Oscar Sock, I'm sure I will.

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:33.060
 And stop calling me Oscar.

00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:35.060
 Let me fight Gregory school.

00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:38.060
 I'm not fighting Eleanor, I'm just protecting myself.

00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:40.060
 Go ahead Homer, pile into him.

00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:42.060
 I suppose you think I'm afraid to take another step.

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:43.060
 Well why not, Jenna?

00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:45.060
 Now listen, Willie, quit pushing me.

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:46.060
 He took another step, Henry.

00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:47.060
 He took another step.

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:49.060
 Well that one doesn't count.

00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:52.060
 But Homer, if you take another, boy will you?

00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:53.060
 Will you?

00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:53.900
 Will you?

00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:56.160
 Stand back fellas, stand back and give them room.

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:58.340
 Boys, I think you're both just dawgles.

00:09:58.340 --> 00:09:59.600
 Are you really gonna fight?

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:01.640
 Lucy, I hope you don't think...

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:03.100
 I hope you don't...

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:04.500
 Does anybody got the time?

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:06.140
 Yes, it's time for history.

00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:07.440
 It is?

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:10.240
 Well, listen Homer, it's a very good thing for you it is.

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:12.620
 And it's a very good thing for you, Joe Henry.

00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:13.880
 You mean you're gonna quit?

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:16.320
 Hey, Tobby, let's get the two of them together at three o'clock.

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:19.120
 Hey, that's an idea right after the last period.

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:20.260
 Today?

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.020
 I mean, I gotta fight Homer at three o'clock?

00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:24.020
 That's right, what's for?

00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:26.020
 I mean, I've got to fight Henry.

00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:27.020
 Sure!

00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:29.020
 Well, that's fine.

00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:31.020
 Sure, that's fine.

00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:33.020
 (SIREN WAILING)

00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:45.020
 Elizabeth?

00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:46.020
 Yes, Will.

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:47.020
 Was that Homer on the phone?

00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:48.020
 Yes, dear.

00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:51.020
 He wanted me to get him out of school early this afternoon.

00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:53.320
 What for? I hope you didn't tell him you would.

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:55.320
 Oh no, well of course I didn't.

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:59.020
 But he literally begged me to make an appointment for him after dentist.

00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:00.020
 Oh, Mergent?

00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:02.420
 Before the last period this afternoon.

00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:05.220
 That's the problem with you, Elizabeth. You're just spoiling him.

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:06.820
 Let him have you go and wait about everything.

00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:09.820
 Well, I told him definitely he could not leave early.

00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:12.020
 Even if he does need some dental work done.

00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:14.220
 Oh good. And what's more, Elizabeth?

00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:18.220
 I think it's time we put our foot down and made him wear that suit that Oscar sent him.

00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:20.520
 Yes, dear, I agree with you.

00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:24.520
 Only first, I think maybe I ought to tell you something.

00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:25.520
 Well?

00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:28.520
 Now, don't fly off the handle, Will, and don't hit the ceiling.

00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:29.520
 Only, uh...

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:30.520
 Only what?

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:33.520
 I gave it to Henry Orridge.

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:34.520
 You did?

00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:35.520
 Now, you're brown.

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:38.520
 Homer is your son, and he has your stubbornness,

00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:41.520
 and I just couldn't go through life fighting both of you over one too.

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:45.520
 I know, Elizabeth, but suppose Oscar arrives and wants to see how it looks on Homer.

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:49.520
 But, dear, we can't go over and ask Henry to return, as you can, will you?

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:55.520
 Why not? Which is more important, Henry or my brother Oscar, who makes $11,000 a year.

00:11:55.520 --> 00:12:11.520
 Look, Lucy. Look at what somebody put up on the bulletin board.

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:13.520
 Where, Eleanor? Right in front of you.

00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:19.240
 That big poster today at three o'clock the fight of the century. Oh my goodness

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:22.280
 Homer Brown versus off to the flash

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:28.480
 Come on Lucy. We'll be late for English. All right. Where's the fight gonna be Eleanor? I don't know I

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:33.720
 Certainly hope you aren't going well. I just hate right, but I haven't anything else to do

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:37.880
 Hi Lucy. Have you seen Homer anyplace? No, I haven't told you know what I told him I do for him

00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:39.880
 What Toby be a second this afternoon

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:43.640
 His wife? His second, his second. And Willie's gonna be Henry's second.

00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:47.320
 You mean when Henry and Homer get tired of fighting you and Willie are gonna fight?

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:51.320
 No, we tell them what to do and then we get him water to drink.

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:53.320
 My goodness, they're even gonna drink water?

00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:59.960
 Hey Toby, hi Charlie. The football team's getting up a petition for the coach to cancel practice this afternoon so they can all go see the fight.

00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:03.000
 Oh, goodness, you think I'll be making a mistake if I didn't see it?

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.440
 No, see, it's a grudge fight. Why, it's been building up for three years.

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:08.280
 Oh, let's go into English.

00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:13.660
 Quietly! Quiet! That's good gummy water.

00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:14.920
 Hello, Henry.

00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:15.920
 Hi, Eleanor.

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:18.120
 Hey, what are you fitting way back here?

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:21.560
 Oh, I just decided to change my seat.

00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:22.720
 Quietly!

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:26.840
 Now, please turn to page 103.

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:32.640
 By the way, Henry Aldrich, may I ask why you're sitting way back there in the last row?

00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:34.040
 Why, uh...

00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:35.320
 Why just...

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:37.000
 Howton to sit down here?

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
 Could you mind standing up when you speak please?

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
 No, Ms. Eggleston.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
 Oh, my goodness.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
 Quietly, quiet.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
 I don't see anything funny to laugh at.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000
 And Henry, as long as you do not like your regular seat,

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
 suppose you come right down here and take the seat in the front row by me.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.000
 No?

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
 Yes, please.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:06.000
 Quiet, quiet.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:11.380
 It seems to me, Henry, you should have plenty to do without deliberately upsetting this entire class.

00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:13.580
 Yes, Ms. Eigleston. You want me to sit here?

00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:16.120
 Well, as long as you're standing, I'll call on you first.

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:17.080
 To read?

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:21.460
 Please start for the first paragraph at the top of page 103.

00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:22.860
 Yes, Ms. Eigleston.

00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:24.360
 [clears throat]

00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:27.960
 During the mold decade at the end of the 19th century,

00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:33.700
 there passed across the English literary scene a figure whose prominence derived not only from his writing,

00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:42.500
 But from his elaborate taste and clothes, this man was Oscar Oscar Oscar the flash.

00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:46.500
 She wins Oscar Wilde.

00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:59.620
 Alice Alice I want you to come into the living room and meet a business friend of mine.

00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:01.620
 - Then you mean you brought him home for lunch?

00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:03.420
 - How does he doesn't expect much?

00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:04.700
 Just have something real nice.

00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:05.540
 - That's all he got.

00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:06.540
 - But say it, mother!

00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:08.620
 - Yes, Mary, I'm in the dining room.

00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:10.260
 - Mother, I was just downtown,

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:12.020
 and what do you think somebody told me?

00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:14.700
 - I've got to go back to the kitchen and take off this apron.

00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:17.180
 - Father, would you like to hear what I heard about Homer Brown?

00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:18.700
 - Mary, there's a gentleman in the living room

00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:21.380
 who comes to town, a rather important...

00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:24.140
 Mary, even where that dress for lunch?

00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:26.100
 - Why, I plan to, Father.

00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:27.220
 - Yeah?

00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:29.520
 I suppose you run upstairs and see whether you can't, uh...

00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:30.720
 what do you can't do?

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:32.820
 You mean you want me to put on something a little nicer?

00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:33.520
 Yes, ma'am.

00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:34.420
 Mother!

00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:35.520
 Henry, come here, please.

00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:37.320
 I'll ask Mother what I should put on.

00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:38.220
 Henry, where are you?

00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:39.420
 Right here in the hall.

00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:40.620
 Is there something you want?

00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:42.520
 Yeah, I want you to come in and meet...

00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:43.520
 Henry.

00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:46.220
 You know what, Father?

00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:48.620
 I can't help it. Mother made me wear it.

00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:50.020
 That thing? Where did she...

00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:52.020
 That's what I'd like to know.

00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:53.820
 Turn around.

00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:55.720
 Father, who is it you want me to meet?

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:56.720
 No one.

00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:58.120
 (audience laughing)

00:15:58.120 --> 00:15:59.520
 Hey, Mary.

00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:01.680
 - Mary, what are you doing home for lunch?

00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:04.120
 - Well, Mother, I just thought I'd rather eat here.

00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:05.080
 - Here, dear.

00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:08.000
 Isn't this hot dog day in the school cafeteria?

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.840
 - Well, yes, Mother, and I like hot dogs,

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:12.400
 but frankly, I don't enjoy eating them in a place

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:14.720
 where everyone's there and sees...

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:15.560
 and sees...

00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:17.160
 - Oh, my goodness.

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:18.440
 - Now listen, Mary.

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:19.880
 - I'm Henry.

00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:21.400
 - Mary, I thought you were going upstairs

00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:22.240
 and change your dress.

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:24.240
 - I am, only you mean I have to change

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:25.240
 and you're going to let Henry--

00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:26.080
 - No, Mary.

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:30.840

00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:46.680
 the whole time talking about it Henry I think if Homer's going to turn out to

00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:51.160
 be that kind of a boy the less you have to do within the better they're sure

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:54.640
 mother I don't like any of that crowded school that's why I thought I come home

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:38.600
 Well, Mr.. Alberts is this your family here in the hall? Yes, Mr.. Thomas. This is Mrs.

00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:47.980
 Was that Henry I see right behind you? Yes, this is Henry

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:53.240
 He just came home to put on a costume for a school play.

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:56.440
 Now he's got the rush right back.

00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:57.440
 What's up, Otter?

00:17:57.440 --> 00:17:59.240
 Goodbye, Henry. Goodbye. Good luck.

00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:16.040

00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:12.040
 Now getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldrich.

00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:16.760
 Because Henry has had to wear a suit that formally belonged to Homer Brown's on Colosca,

00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:20.040
 he suffered more than his share from the gang of school.

00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:26.040
 As a result, the students have scheduled an open fight at three o'clock this afternoon between Henry and Homer.

00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:28.140
 The scene opens in the principal's office.

00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:30.240
 Come in.

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:34.040
 Did you want to see me here in your office, Mr. Bradley?

00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:35.340
 Yes, Ms. Eggleston.

00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:37.040
 Sit down.

00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:39.840
 I hope I didn't call you from any class.

00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:40.940
 No, Mr. Bradley.

00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:45.540
 Miss Eggleston, I happened to pass by your English past this morning,

00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:49.540
 and frankly, it seemed to me I heard more disturbance than was really necessary.

00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:51.040
 Mr. Bradley, may I say something?

00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:54.040
 Yes, Miss Eggleston, just as soon as I am finished.

00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:57.540
 A reasonable amount of laughter is quite an order in any class,

00:19:57.540 --> 00:20:01.540
 but when the students' sound as though they were rolling on the floor,

00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:04.540
 I can only conclude that the teacher has lost all control.

00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:06.540
 Now, may I say something, Mr. Bradley?

00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:09.540
 Yes, Miss Eggleston, as soon as I have finished.

00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:16.540
 As I passed by your partly open door, it seemed to me that in the midst of all this commotion I saw you laughing.

00:20:16.540 --> 00:20:18.540
 But, Mr. Peddley, I'm only human.

00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:19.540
 Er, did they go part?

00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:23.540
 I'm sorry, but it would be impossible for me to describe what happened.

00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:27.540
 Now, come, Ms. Eggleston, I can appreciate a joke just as much as anyone.

00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:30.540
 Oh, but, Mr. Peddley, I didn't mean to insinuate that you couldn't. I just met...

00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:33.540
 Regardless of what you meant, that's certainly the way it sounded.

00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:37.540
 And to be frank, I think it would be very wise if I visited your class tomorrow.

00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:39.340
 Come in.

00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:41.340
 You sent for me, Mr. Bradley?

00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:42.640
 Yes, Willie. Come in.

00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:44.640
 That will be all, Mr. Bradley.

00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:45.740
 That will be all.

00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:48.640
 And tomorrow we'll all have a good laugh together.

00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:50.140
 Very well.

00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:51.340
 Now then, Willie?

00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:52.340
 Yes, Mr. Bradley.

00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:53.340
 Close the door, please.

00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:54.940
 Oh, yes, Mr. Bradley.

00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:59.240
 Well, I had a talk with him, Mr. Bradley.

00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:01.740
 I told him just exactly what you said.

00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:03.840
 So there won't be a public fight on the school grounds

00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:04.640
 this afternoon.

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:06.140
 Are you made it quite clear, Willie?

00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:13.180

00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:17.980

00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:38.340
 I hate to see it's two guys in a good fight.

00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:40.260
 (audience laughing)

00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:43.860
 - Well, I suppose if they've got to get it out of their system,

00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:47.500
 understand, Willy, I am emphatically against boys fighting.

00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:49.340
 But if it's off the school grounds,

00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:51.900
 I don't see how I can in any way interfere.

00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:52.940
 - Yes, Mr. Bradley.

00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:54.020
 - That will be all?

00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:55.620
 - Yes, Mr. Bradley.

00:21:55.620 --> 00:21:57.660
 - Oh, Willy, just one moment.

00:21:57.660 --> 00:21:58.820
 - Yes, Mr. Bradley.

00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:01.300
 - Where did you say this fight is going to be held?

00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:03.140
 (audience laughing)

00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:07.500
 I didn't say yes that would be all

00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:24.500
 He fellas look what I've got for Homer a pale on the spot wall

00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:29.140

00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:34.900
 Oh, they'll be along. Henry said he'd get here as fast as he could.

00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:36.980
 Boy, was he actors to get another this.

00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:39.620
 Well, Homer was anxious too. He said he wouldn't be late.

00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:43.400
 My goodness, Eleanor, isn't this exciting? I think it's terrible.

00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:47.500
 That's what I mean. That's what I mean. I can hardly wait.

00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:57.500
 [Music]

00:22:57.500 --> 00:23:01.500
 What time is it, Homer?

00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:02.500
 It's, um...

00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:05.500
 Exactly, 25 minutes after three.

00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:06.500
 Is that right?

00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:08.500
 [Growling]

00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:10.500
 Mmm, it's a pretty good soda, isn't it, Henry?

00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:12.500
 Boy, I'll say.

00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:14.500
 And don't misunderstand me.

00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:17.500
 I'd be perfectly willing to go over that lot and fight you, Henry.

00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:20.500
 Only...only sure. I know what you mean.

00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:23.500
 But I hope you don't think I wouldn't be willing to fight you, Homer.

00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:26.500
 She was. I'd be willing to knock your block off for you.

00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:30.500
 But as the fella disorder fountain just told you, your father's been looking all over town for you.

00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:34.500
 Sure. And if he wants me to keep an appointment at the dentist or something,

00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:36.500
 naturally, I can't disobey him.

00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:41.500
 Naturally. You know, we don't look toward the door now, but I think some of the gangs just went by.

00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:42.500
 You think they're still looking for us?

00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:43.860
 - Looking for her? - Sure.

00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:45.500
 Let's have another soda.

00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:46.740
 (audience laughs)

00:23:46.740 --> 00:23:47.860
 - I'll pay for this one.

00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:49.380
 - Oh no, Henry, you let me.

00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:50.220
 - Are you crazy?

00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:51.220
 Who am I gonna get a quarter right here?

00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:53.020
 - Now wait a minute.

00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:54.780
 - Oh, Chiwiz, did I knock it out of your hand?

00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:55.620
 - Well, that's all right, Homer.

00:23:55.620 --> 00:23:56.780
 It's right down here in the floor someplace.

00:23:56.780 --> 00:23:57.620
 - Oh, wait a second, Henry.

00:23:57.620 --> 00:23:58.860
 You let me get it for you.

00:23:58.860 --> 00:24:00.300
 - Well, I'm already into the table, Homer.

00:24:00.300 --> 00:24:01.140
 - So am I.

00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:02.060
 - Hey, fellas, here they are.

00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:02.940
 - Where, Charlie?

00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:04.980
 - They're wrestling, under the table.

00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:06.700

00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:43.180
 Homer, what do you keep circling around him for?

00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:44.220
 I'm measuring him.

00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:46.060
 Come on, let's have some ice.

00:24:46.060 --> 00:24:47.500

 How can I hit him? Look at him keep backing away.

00:24:52.380 --> 00:24:54.460
 You are crazy. You're backing away yourself.

 Hey, who tripped me?

 Hey, help Henry out somebody.

 'Cause I'm all right.

 Now listen, Homer, stop running all around me like that.

 Oh, he's running! Oh, he's running!

00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:06.460
 Oh, that's talking to him, Homer.

00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:07.800
 That's telling him when to get off.

00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:10.100
 Homer, tell him what you think of his soap.

00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:11.600
 Oh, sure!

 Some soap! Some soap!

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:16.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.800
 Now listen, Homer, do call me that once more.

00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:20.160
 Oh, Henry, go back for him.

 Do I have to go to the dentist?

00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:29.200

 Am I ashamed? Am I ashamed?

00:25:55.700 --> 00:25:59.240
 Well listen Homer, here we are all the way out in the edge of town.

00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:01.240
 She was untired walking.

00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:03.540
 Boy, am I ashamed.

00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:07.240
 Oh, it doesn't look so bad on your home or not. The sun's going down.

00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:12.240
 All the checks are sort of blended together.

00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:13.240
 Yeah, I know.

00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:16.540
 But my father said, "I've got to wear this suit to school tomorrow."

00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:22.240
 Listen, Henry, you've already broken it in. Wouldn't you like to wear it?

00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:25.240
 Well, wouldn't your father tell you I couldn't keep it?

00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:27.340
 But he wanted you to have the pleasure of wearing it?

00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:29.140
 Yeah, sure.

00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:31.640
 What do you think I want everyone in town to call me?

00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:34.640
 Ask her this and ask her that for as long as I live here?

00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:36.940
 I wonder...

00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:40.340
 I wonder... you wonder what?

00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:42.840
 I don't suppose we could burn the suit, could we?

00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:43.840
 Right on me?

00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:50.840
 Well, the only thing is, Henry, my father wouldn't believe it was an accident.

00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:52.140
 You know what I mean.

00:26:52.140 --> 00:26:55.040
 Well, listen, let's go back into town then.

00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:56.940
 Oh, no, not until it's pitch black.

00:26:56.940 --> 00:26:57.840
 Hey, Homer, look out.

00:26:57.840 --> 00:27:02.640
 What's the matter? You see what I see crawling across the road? Henry, what is that?

00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:10.080
 She wears it. It's a skunk, isn't it? Henry, is that a skunk? Are you sure it's a skunk?

00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:12.440
 Sure it is.

00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:22.480
 Here, kitty, kitty, kitty. Here, kitty, kitty. Come to Homer. Homer, hurry. He's getting away from you.

00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:29.480

00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:36.480
 Right now, even in November, many sections of the country are unusually dry.

00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:39.480
 This increases the danger of forest fires.

00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:42.480
 So every time you're out in the fields of forest,

00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:43.480
 follow these rules.

00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:46.480
 Crush out cigarette, cigar, and pipe ashes.

00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:49.480
 Break matches in two after using them.

00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:53.480
 Brown all campfires, then stir and drown them again.

00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:57.480
 Learn and respect the law before starting any fire.

00:27:57.480 --> 00:28:02.480
 Forest rangers can fight forest fires, but only you can prevent them.

00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:09.480
 - Thank you, Oliver? - Yes, Father.

00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:13.480
 - Are you back already? - Well, Father, it's like this.

00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:16.480
 Homer didn't I tell you to go down to the dentist?

00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:23.480
 I did. Only he said he'd rather wait a week or two before he works on me.

00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:32.720
 The Aldrich family is transcribed as written by Clifford Goldsmith.

00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:36.240
 Henry is played by Bobby Ellis and Homer by Jack Grimes.

00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:39.520
 Mr. and Mrs. Aldrich are house Jameson and Catherine Roth.

00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:45.400
 Your now sir is ticked up.

00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:51.900
 Listen again next week, same time, same station for another sparkling half hour with the Aldrich family.

00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:52.900
 Good night, everybody.

00:28:52.900 --> 00:29:00.900
 Tonight it's the Phil Harris Alice Fay Show on NBC.

00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:06.900
