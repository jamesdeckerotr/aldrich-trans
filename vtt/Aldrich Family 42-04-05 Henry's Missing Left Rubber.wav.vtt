00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
 Bridge family based on characters originated by Clifford Goldsmith and starring Ezra Stone as Henry with Jackie Kelle Casthomer

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
 Henry Henry Oliver!

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
 Come in, Southern!

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.240
 Tom Sawyer, Uxpin, Ken Rock, Scofield, they're more than characters in fiction

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:39.440
 for the things they do and say are the things real boys do and say.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.880
 And now Henry Alrich joins the ranks of typical teenage American life.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.880
 He's a boy in your block perhaps in your own home.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.640
 Now it's just after breakfast on Saturday.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.880
 The scene is in the Alrich sitting room.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.680
 Well, Henry, have you any ideas to where it is?

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.080
 No mother, that's the parts of the castle's man.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.420
 But where did you leave it, Les?

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.980
 I thought I left it in the whole closet right beside my right one.

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.420
 Well, do you cancel out, Les, I did only one rubber.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.620
 But, Mother, there's some shining. It's a beautiful day.

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.420
 I know, but it's terribly muddy.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.820
 Now, just sit down here and try to remember where you wore your rubber, Les.

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.300
 I'm trying to remember.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.360
 I'm actually another thing that puzzles me.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.260
 Will you sit down, please? Yes.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.640
 Hey, hey, hey, hey.

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:20.640
 Oh, look at you, Hey, hey, hey.

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.340
 Oh, look at you, look at you.

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.540
 Hey, look, listen, Mother.

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.080
 Don't you think I ought to go out?

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.320
 At least three toes and I do not.

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.740
 There's no reason why I don't learn.

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.580
 Well, they can't wait for you.

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.080
 But Mother, it's cold out there on the front porch.

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.080
 [SINGING]

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.080

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:40.080
 [SIREN WAILING]

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.720
 And there's someone calling you.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.580
 He has father-only mother feels.

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:44.580
 But she feels--

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.080
 What are you doing with one rubber house?

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.080
 70 says the other one disappeared.

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.080
 Right off his foot.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.080
 She's father.

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.080
 I've looked at every place.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.580
 And it just isn't here.

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.580
 Couldn't I just be careful with this when I do have a book?

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.180
 How would you do a thing like that?

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.180
 Well, I could put most of my weight on just my right foot.

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.580
 [LAUGHTER]

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.380
 Or if necessary, I could just hop.

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.380
 Yeah.

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:06.380
 [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.380
 And we go out and tell those boys to reach you.

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.880
 Why?

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:09.380
 Yes, Bob.

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:10.380
 And Henry, is this--

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:11.880
 You told them you'd come back here?

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:12.880
 Yes, Bob.

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.780
 About how much longer shall I tell them I'll be tied up?

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:16.780
 We don't know.

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:17.780
 [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.280
 I think I might wish you had a toast with you.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.780
 What about it?

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:20.780
 It's Taylor.

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.280
 I think it's getting worse.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.780
 Very well, I'll have a chocolate in tomorrow.

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.280
 Why don't you do it now?

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.280
 Well, the fact here is that I planned to do something else.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.280
 It's Saturday morning, actually.

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.280
 Don't you think you should follow this up right now, so the next time you remember?

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.280
 No.

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:42.280
 Yes. I was reading an article in the Sunday paper, and they said that most parents let so much time go by that the child forgets what it's being punished for.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.280
 And that, really, leaves a very bad mood.

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.280
 On whom, the parents?

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.280
 Team Mother, do you harm and will we have a great idea?

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.280
 Henry, I think your father would like to have a talk with you with me.

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.040
 He'll tell me what it's about.

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.040
 Yes, Mother.

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.440
 Hey, hey.

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.880
 Do you realize how serious this rubber business is?

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.320
 I think so, Father.

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.720
 You bet three pairs of rubber is this winter, have you?

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:05.720
 Yes, Father.

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.120
 And I just don't see how they could have gone that fast.

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.120
 Yes, I think so.

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.440
 Now suppose I lost everything I own.

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:13.840
 What would you think?

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.400
 Well, I love, Father.

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.880
 You wouldn't think I had a great deal of character, would you?

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.880
 Well, it would all depend on what your reasons were

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.040
 from losing them. Now let's not start reasoning. You and I have been through

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.640
 reasoning before. Yes. Do you realize all the rest of this winter and all through

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.840
 this coming spring you're going to have only one rubber to your name. What are we

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.720
 going to do about it? Can we buy another pair? Another pair. Do you realize how much

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.920
 another pair costs? And that is a matter of fact there probably isn't even another

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.040
 pair for sale in this entire town. I saw some in the Emporium window yesterday.

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:53.640
 father. It is nothing to do with it. Don't you know that this country is facing a

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.340
 shortage of rubber. Yes. Think of it at a time when our army and our navy both

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.040
 need all they can get. You come home without the left rubber and ask me to buy

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.760
 a new pair. Well I guess I just didn't think. Let me tell you something you're

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.360
 going to find that rubber if it takes you all day. Yes. You will start looking

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.240
 for it and you'll keep on looking for it until you find it. That's clear. Yes.

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:18.240
 - Hey, what are you doing? - I thought you told those boys to go home.

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:22.240
 Well, I'll go tell them to come back and I know I guess it's late.

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.240
 - Yes, fellas? - I even know.

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.240
 I am.

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.240
 Here. I couldn't help hearing you guess now, and I wonder.

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:30.240
 You wonder what?

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.240
 Well, frankly, I think you were a little hard on Henry.

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.240
 - And you want me to be? - It's fair, not nearly. I have to give him a talking.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.240
 And I did.

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.240
 I told you that to find the rubber in the uncertain terms.

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:48.240
 Let's say I'm not the point. Don't you realize that this is Saturday, the first night's day we had in weeks, and now Henry has to say, "And just to find a rubber."

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.240
 Well, should we get you my last?

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.240
 Hmm, what's the more he has to do?

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.240
 Naturally.

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.240
 Do you think I was a bit hard on him?

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.240
 Frankly, I do.

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.240
 Well, I can't very well turn around now and tell him he doesn't have to look for it.

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.240
 That would be worse than if I just let the whole thing go.

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.240
 And I agree with you. I'm just sorry that you made an issue with.

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:11.240
 Well, well, how is I getting ready to care about it, Robert?

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:15.240
 I just happened to walk into the room here, and the first thing I knew, you would ask me to speak to it.

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.240
 No, sir, let's not try to shift the blame onto me.

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.240
 But what do you want me to do?

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:24.240
 I don't know. This is your problem. But I do hope this doesn't leave a mark on Henry.

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:30.240
 Oh, Henry!

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.240
 -How's it going? -I'm going to be in the area right now.

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.240
 -What are you doing here? -It's in place.

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.240
 -And it's inside, Omar. -Oh.

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.240
 -Mr. Orr? -Is it anything in size?

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.240
 -I'm afraid he is. -Oh.

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:44.240
 -Well, Mr. Orr, we went here.

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.240
 You said he'd be ready in about an hour. -You did?

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:49.240
 -Yes, sir. That was about an hour ago.

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.240
 -I see how he's getting along. I'm going right in.

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.240
 -Homer? -Yes, Mr. Orr.

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:56.240
 -Did your father know you're out today without any rubber?

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.240
 -No, I'm sorry. I don't think he does.

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:59.240
 No parents worry about it.

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:00.240
 It's pretty muddy.

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:03.240
 I've got my rubber Thomas for all of us.

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.240
 Yes, well that's fine.

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.240
 That's fine.

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.240
 You keep them on.

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.240
 We all look longer.

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:10.240
 Here is going to be.

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.240
 Stay in.

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:12.240
 Yes, that is.

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.240
 We've been swimming out there on the back floor.

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:15.240
 Oh, nothing much.

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:16.240
 Just poking around.

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:17.240
 Head around.

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:18.240
 Yes, Father.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:19.240
 Have you found that, Robert?

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:23.240
 We haven't found that one exactly, but I found an old goliath, though.

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.240
 That is not yours, it's me.

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:27.240
 Mary says her foot is big and bare.

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:29.240
 Oh, dear.

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:33.240
 Oh, I'm never going to go out and tell them you're still looking for your rubber.

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:35.240
 Father, couldn't I just try this a lot, huh?

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.240
 Henry, you're not going out through the streets of Ixanway.

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:39.240
 One rubber and one made it over to you.

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:41.240
 Put 'em over here.

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.240
 You can actually go out there and speak to them.

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:47.240
 Yes, Father. The only thing is, what can I tell them?

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:48.240
 Hi, Father.

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:50.240
 Well, because you already did start.

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:53.240
 Well, here's the situation, Homer.

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:54.240
 I know.

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:56.240
 Please I can get away right now.

00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:00.240
 Now listen, ever if you fall as early this morning and say, "Boy, it looks like a slow

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:03.240
 baby let's talk unless you can take us up on our bikes and go, "Yeah, it's just sure,

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:07.240
 Willie, but I didn't mean we should start off as soon as I hung up the sister of the receiver."

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:08.240
 I didn't give him just a hand.

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:10.240
 This is a fair time leaving here.

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:12.240
 But Homer, I didn't even know yet.

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:14.240
 You want to go up on a trip now.

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:15.240
 She whizzes.

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:17.240
 It's only a fish can.

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:19.240
 Why don't you come back, Sam?

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:24.040
 Hand-masked 11, and that'll give us just a 9/10 hour to get out some places.

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:26.540
 He was our lunches, okay? So a lot better.

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:29.140
 Why? Because, Willy.

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:31.640
 And what is there to do until hand-masked 11?

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:34.140
 Um, there are a lot of things.

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:37.040
 Have you seen the new factory they're putting up on the other side of town?

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:38.440
 I know, but pretty sure.

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:42.740
 And over at the railroad station, they're building a whole new place platform on the, uh, sure.

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:45.740
 And how about the Shinling job? They're doing it on the courthouse.

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:47.540
 Oh, yeah, I forgot about that.

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:50.900
 You are there all kinds of things to see around this town.

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:54.100
 And here you are, you're spinning around, waiting for me.

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:55.100
 Now go on.

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:56.100
 How are you?

00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:57.100
 We'll be back in a no.

00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:58.100
 Okay.

00:07:58.100 --> 00:07:59.100
 Goodroom.

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:00.100
 Yes, Father.

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:02.100
 You're not under the fella's tears?

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:03.100
 Yes, sir.

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:05.300
 Do you remember where you might have worn your rubber last?

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:06.740
 Well, I'll tell you.

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:10.740
 I think it was just a week ago today, and it's been raining all night.

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:15.420
 And I remember waking up and looking out the window and thinking, "Gee, mother's gonna

00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:16.740
 make me wear my rubber."

00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:18.740
 Where did you go?

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:22.740
 Well, I got dressed and after you left the house.

00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:27.740
 Well, I left the house and went over to watch the enforcement men.

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:28.740
 Where?

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:30.740
 Very terrible, I've reached that spot.

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:35.740
 And then I remember going over to the railroad station and watching men force them cement.

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:37.740
 Then where did you go?

00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:40.740
 Well, directly from there I...

00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:42.740
 I don't remember.

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:45.740
 But I was a little tired, I remember that.

00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:49.420
 For your be hot yes father that I can say well

00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:54.780
 Suppose son you go in the living room where you'll be alone and just sit down and try to remember

00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:59.580
 But will you please go in there?

00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:10.060
 Just got into think the why can't I get in to forget the whole thing

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:15.020
 One rubber

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:19.180
 Of course the thing I'm really sorry about is he's missing a piggy.

00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:19.680
 I think you're...

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:25.680
 Stand the boys were going on a picnic on their bicycles and I told him that he couldn't possibly go and I can first clean up the back yard.

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:27.680
 Alright, gotta make him skip cleaning up the yard.

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:32.180
 Now, you're a justice impotence of me to uphold my position as it is for you to uphold yours.

00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:33.180
 I see.

00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:34.180
 Where you going?

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:35.180
 No, please.

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:36.680
 That's not the thing.

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:38.180
 Mother, yes?

00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:41.180
 I just don't remember where I went into the railroad station.

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:46.140
 Where down on the street to watch the steam shovel but then my mind goes blank again

00:09:46.140 --> 00:10:02.000
 Now getting back to the troubles of Henry Alfred

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:10.260
 I don't remember.

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:11.260
 Great view quick.

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:14.260
 If you didn't spend all your time stepping out and seeking to home by the mother, I only

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:17.260
 step out about once an hour and that's reasonable.

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.260
 Well, how do you have to say yes, mother?

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:23.260
 And mother, in case I don't find my rubber and time to go with them, you wouldn't want

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.260
 them to stay here for lunch, would you?

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:26.260
 I certainly would not.

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.260
 That's what I thought, so I won't invite them.

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:29.260
 Great.

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:32.260
 Listen, Homer, how would you and Willie like to do this?

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.260
 We are going to do anything.

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:35.260
 We need to start.

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:36.260
 Are you interested in going?

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:37.260
 Of course, Homer.

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:40.260
 Naturally, I wouldn't be coming out here on the porch every day limit.

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:44.260
 But, oh, my God, you think we all enjoy our lunch if we waited until we got even hungrier?

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.260
 No, I'm so hungry, I think.

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.260
 Now, all right, why don't we eat right here?

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:51.260
 Wait, I hear in my backyard on the back tree.

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:52.260
 What's the name?

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.260
 You mean you being a friend of each other sounds like a punishment?

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.260
 No, no, what do you mean, punish?

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:59.260
 Do you wish I just want to find my left rubber first?

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.260
 Oh, so that's it, you can't go out with that, you're a rabbit.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.260
 I can too, it's just a...

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:08.840
 What you was not even I care anything about even my country your country

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:15.140
 Yeah, that shows how much you know Homer don't you realize there's a shortage of rubber and my father's very upset?

00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:17.140
 Why I think I care?

00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:23.500
 Shuri has but I'm going to the whole house trying to find mine. Don't you think I want to do my share now?

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:29.300
 What she was rubber's are practically priceless today. How do you know my father said so well?

00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:36.820
 I need you to tell me, I'll go tell Willie. Where is he? He's gonna go home and change his trousers. He's just too intimate to when they announce the time.

00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:48.820
 Well, Gee, would the V's gonna do things like that? We're never going to get started. Henry, the telephone rings out in the basement. Yes, Marvin. Doing what? Tracing up your phone and work face!

00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:53.820
 (music)

00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:58.820
 (music)

00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:01.820
 Homer, for the last time I can't come right this minute!

00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:04.820
 Why not? You being tiny? No, I'm not!

00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:08.820
 The only reason I can't come now is my mother says I've gotta find my Fortaloy band first!

00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:10.820
 Oh, gee, isn't it?

00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:12.820
 Well, wait, it's been this Saturday!

00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:14.820
 What have you got those three robbers in your hand for?

00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:15.820
 I'm checking it over.

00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:17.820
 You can join with I left you.

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:19.820
 All of everything I tell you are for the last place.

00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:20.820
 How much have you been talking about?

00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:21.820
 How did he pay for this?

00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:22.820
 He paid.

00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:23.820
 What do you mean, he paid?

00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:26.820
 Why, he said Mr. Rogers said that what he loved was practically priceless.

00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:27.820
 It is.

00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:28.820
 Well, let's turn home.

00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:33.820
 I know if you realize that every time we collect in them for a father, he's paying good money for them.

00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:34.820
 Sure.

00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:35.820
 Boy, am I young.

00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:39.820
 You certainly don't think Henry would throw away a whole enemy before he could keep one foot dry, do you?

00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:42.820
 Well, you know, really, I wanted him out there myself.

00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:43.820
 Sure.

00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:48.320
 Oh, she was yes mother

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:59.940
 Hello hello is this Dr. Bennington a doctor you two made it a drop in sometime this afternoon

00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:04.260
 For no nothing serious. This is always called her hand in my vice

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.580
 in my fight

00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:12.020
 For some reason she decided to clean up my workbench in her hand caught in the vice and she got panicky and turned it the wrong way

00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:18.400
 No, I'm sure it's perfectly all right, but I feel better if you could take a look at her hand. Thank you doctor. Goodbye

00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:27.060
 No idea broiling as quickly as you can in service to a clock and I'm hungry

00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:33.180
 Operator I won't tell them 4 4 6

00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:46.640
 Hello, is this the economy repair shop? Listen to all rich. I wonder whether you could come over and pick up our sewing machine and vacuum cleaner on electric fans

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:54.680
 Well, they were stored in a closet and my daughter accidentally pulled the fan down off the shelf and it fell onto the sewing machine and then bounced onto the vacuum cleaner

00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:58.480
 No, she's all right. But thank you. Goodbye

00:13:58.480 --> 00:13:59.480
 Yes, Alex.

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:02.480
 He's going to hang me in the room and see whether he's wet

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:03.480
 and comfortably.

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:05.480
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:06.480
 He wins, will we?

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:07.480
 You come out?

00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:08.480
 I told you ten times.

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:09.480
 Oh, we might.

00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:10.480
 Their cupboard was summoned.

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:11.480
 Oh!

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:13.480
 Here, can you text these rubbers when I throw them out the window?

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:14.480
 Sure!

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:16.480
 How much do you say Mr. Long, which is paying for?

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:19.480
 Well, from the way Homer talks, we'll pay at least 50 cents a piece.

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:20.480
 I think.

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:21.480
 It's all right.

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:22.480
 Just move.

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:23.480
 I'm going to get a little bit of money.

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:24.480
 I'm going to get a little bit of money.

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:25.480
 I'm going to get a little bit of money.

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:26.480
 I think.

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:27.480
 It's all right.

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:28.480
 Just the whole rubbing?

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:29.480
 Sure.

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:30.480
 It's the chance of a life chart.

00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:33.480
 Well, we'll be right if you only find the one cigarette.

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:34.480
 Sure, that's it, Toby.

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:36.480
 Always asking questions.

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:38.480
 You know there's a man for tin foil, don't you?

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:39.480
 Yes.

00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:40.480
 He ever asked what they used him for?

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:41.480
 No.

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:43.480
 He ever asked why they rather have the tin foil flat and rolled up?

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:44.480
 No.

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:46.480
 And only it's why they want his left rubber.

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:47.480
 [Laughter]

00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:49.480
 And maybe a military safety.

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:50.480
 Oh!

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:54.480
 And Toby, when you see Homer count up the start on the stick, it without me.

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:57.480
 I think I'll farm my hands for the next day of power.

00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:59.480
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:05.480
 - Bobby.

00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:06.480
 - Yes, Mary.

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:07.480
 - You're fine, in fact.

00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:08.480
 You never know anything that happened.

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:09.480
 - Oh.

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:10.480
 - How's lunch coming?

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:12.480
 - It'll be waiting just a few minutes, Father.

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:14.480
 I had to get a double nose, two cans of beans.

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:15.480
 - Beans.

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:16.480
 - Yes, Father.

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:17.480
 When I told Mother what happened to the chop,

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:19.480
 she told me where she had to be and put away.

00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:21.480
 What was the matter with him, Lee?

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:22.480
 - Nothing but an attack of haypaper.

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:25.080
 He got it rummaging through something in the attic.

00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:27.980
 - Oh, do I have anything when you're being spotted?

00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:29.880
 - But just what? - Oh, when you're spotted.

00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:31.880
 We got the raw cat.

00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:35.380
 - Thank you, very good for you. - Yeah, man, if you were having just heard.

00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:38.580
 - Yes, on it. - Yes?

00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:41.880
 - We're going to go to the attic. - Real carefully, and don't stir up any dust.

00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:43.880
 Don't you think I can fit one more look?

00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:46.480
 - Hey, I have a little surprise for you. - For me?

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:49.480
 - There is your rubber. - Oh, he wouldn't.

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:51.480
 Where did you find it?

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:52.480
 In the back of the car.

00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:54.480
 Oh, Jim, now you can go right along on your picnic.

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:55.980
 Well, thanks very much.

00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:57.480
 Boy, am I in...

00:15:57.480 --> 00:15:59.480
 Oh, gee, Liz, what's the matter?

00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:01.480
 Well, this isn't my rubber.

00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:02.480
 But what difference does it make?

00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:03.480
 Where is it?

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:05.480
 The farmer, if this isn't my rubber, I really do.

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:07.480
 Why not?

00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:09.480
 Father, I didn't even find it.

00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:10.480
 And they put it back on and where?

00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:11.480
 Oh, no, Father.

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:12.480
 That wouldn't be right.

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:13.480
 Then they put some other...

00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:16.480
 Mother, do you think it would be honorable for me to wear this?

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:17.320
 Where this?

00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:19.540
 And where I put father to hold the trouble of finding it

00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:20.880
 when I enter the founder.

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:24.000
 There is that bit, put it on and please get out.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.220
 I'm so sick of this whole thing.

00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:26.720
 I never wanna see another pair of lovers

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:28.520
 as long as I live, yes, mother.

00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:31.360
 And go tell the homing of me right now.

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:32.520
 Yes, mother.

00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:34.360
 How are all of you right now?

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:35.960
 You wait and see what happens to me.

00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:38.200
 Okay, just as soon as I get my things done.

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:39.760
 You're gonna be a man.

00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:41.720
 She whizz if you got back lunch.

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:43.440
 Boy, if they got a lot to eat out there.

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:44.440
 There.

00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:46.200
 They said I should even bring a bag.

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:48.200
 But if they have it, they can spare and bring it in.

00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:50.200
 [INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:51.960
 We're just singing right in.

00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:52.960
 You're a big one, yes.

00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:53.460
 The roberts.

00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:53.960
 The roberts.

00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:55.960
 You are a lot.

00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:58.720
 17 and all for the left place.

00:16:58.720 --> 00:16:59.720
 What's that?

00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:01.280
 Oh, and we have got 11.

00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:01.780
 It's three.

00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:02.780
 Oh, gee, go.

00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:04.440
 Yeah, and they're all for the left foot.

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:05.280
 This is all it's--

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:06.880
 No, but don't put those on the floor.

00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:08.880
 What do you want from the living room?

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:10.680
 I'm in one of the castle.

00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:11.680
 I'll be right there.

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:14.280
 Boys, take every one of those rubbish right back out the door.

00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:16.280
 Hello.

00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:17.280
 Hello.

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:18.280
 Hello, is this Captain Olrich?

00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:19.280
 Captain Olrich?

00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:20.280
 There's an after Olrich.

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:21.280
 Mr. Samuel Olrich.

00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:24.280
 Well, I was wondering who Captain Olrich would be.

00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:27.280
 Now I'll tell you Mr. Olrich, this is the manager of the reality of the museum.

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:28.280
 Yeah.

00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:32.280
 We've got a lost e-founder, he's out here, but he's been accumulating stuff for the last two years.

00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:35.280
 So we'll take a few hours and separate the rights from the left.

00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:37.280
 But we can send you probably 200.

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:38.280
 I beg your pardon?

00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:41.280
 I say we can supply you with 200 less preppers.

00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:43.280
 Now how much do they break me?

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:45.520
 May I ask who told you I was in the market for rubber?

00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:46.180
 Fire.

00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:47.080
 It's a good resource.

00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:48.880
 Well, whoever it was told you was wrong.

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:49.380
 Yes?

00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:51.780
 Yes, and I'm a fabulous victim of a factory for Joe.

00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:52.680
 I am?

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:55.080
 Well, I certainly apologize for your outreach.

00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:57.380
 I wonder how I think I'm such a good start.

00:17:57.380 --> 00:17:58.280
 I have no idea.

00:17:58.280 --> 00:17:59.080
 Goodbye.

00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:00.080
 Goodbye.

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:01.880
 Edra, may I speak with you?

00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:03.880
 Do you want to speak with me, Father?

00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:05.680
 I can't wait to sound like fans.

00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:08.180
 Now wait a minute, but anyway, I'm not in the market for fans.

00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:09.280
 For fans?

00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:10.780
 Oh, oh, I've grown with these robbers.

00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:11.980
 I found such more.

00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:16.940
 I just told you boys to take those brothers outside and tell me this is all a driving home day my parents

00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:22.860
 Then go out in the kitchen and help Mary open those cans of bean pies to this phone. He doesn't have them over here. He cut herself

00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:25.940
 Hello

00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:27.940
 Yes

00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:32.940
 Yes. I just called a kid with the knowledge but it's a good thing we think it is you're doing.

00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:33.940
 What?

00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:35.940
 Yes, everybody's talking about it.

00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:36.940
 Come on, bud.

00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:38.940
 Well, I just had the most love of the idea.

00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:40.940
 Literally, we all like that you've been in hell.

00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:43.940
 And I know that next week I might give a hobo lunch.

00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:44.940
 A what?

00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:45.940
 A hobo lunch.

00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:47.940
 But you can't tell the money you bring once.

00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:50.940
 Well, that's lovely. I'd be glad to come.

00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:52.940
 What is it I have to bring again?

00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:53.940
 You don't have to bring a thing.

00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:56.940
 You've already done more than your share.

00:18:56.940 --> 00:18:57.780
 What do they want?

00:18:57.780 --> 00:18:58.600
 Only thanks.

00:18:58.600 --> 00:18:59.440
 - Come there.

00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:00.280
 - What do you do?

00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:01.800
 Call the runner later?

00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:02.800
 - What's that?

00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:04.800
 - I suppose it's one of those military matters

00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:06.400
 that I wouldn't understand.

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:07.400
 - What do you mean, "Loss it on?"

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:09.200
 I'm afraid I don't understand myself.

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:11.160
 - Well, look, will you be with us on this wing, Nate?

00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:12.560
 - Yes, I guess so.

00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:13.440
 - Where'd they are, guys?

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:15.240
 - All right, and we'll have an open door here.

00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:16.280
 - Where'd you say, "Goodbye."

00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:17.360
 - Good-bye.

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:18.800
 - Stand alive, baby.

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:20.280
 - Oh, man, mom, man.

00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:21.120
 - Why is it?

00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:23.920
 - There's a junk man out in front of a whole wagon load of robbers,

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:26.320
 but he said you'll have to sort from yourself.

00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:29.060
 (dramatic music)

00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:31.800
 (crowd cheering)
