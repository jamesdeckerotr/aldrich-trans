00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.760
 [Music]

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.160
 Great much, and great much place.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.160
 Is that...

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.400
 [Music]

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.240
 Can you see all this coming out of here?

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.360
 [Applause]

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.620
 They all look thunder.

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.060
 They say, "Don't tell me if you're here to let me go."

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.060
 I'm sorry, nothing's wrong with him.

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.060
 They say, "Don't tell me, don't tell me, don't tell me."

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.560
 I'm walking in my face, and I'm a great black person.

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.660
 All around there, he's going to want to take him

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.660
 play when he hits the lake, not.

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.660
 And great, not play.

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.660
 You're now the favorite black flute studio.

00:00:50.660 --> 00:01:10.660
 [Music]

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:13.660
 And now for the Audrey family.

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:19.660
 Henry Aldrich is a typical American boy that revolves all the sometimes somewhere.

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:25.660
 Yes, Henry is a familiar to all of us. I please show this baseball and I'm the most patient able.

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:29.660
 The scene opens in the Aldrich living room.

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:33.660
 Gee, you ladies, how am I having you any ideas at all?

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.660
 I told you, no, I'm learning to say.

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:36.660
 Why not?

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:42.660
 Because the last time I went to a mad monastery I was giving a board for a social activity for a week.

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:47.360
 is going to have a prize for the best costume and hot dog to best them all pie

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.100
 this little time they are here

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.660
 I think they have to go to the free part of the horse

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:59.060
 they are a lot worried me as a cat named mother is making her a costume just

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.700
 especially for this masquerade and I can't think of a single thing I can go at

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.980
 it would be free to go and buckle a bill but I want to wear a costume that'll

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:09.980
 I'm kind of mad to Kathleen.

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:11.980
 I thought we could go into Buffalo.

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.980
 I don't know how much be sensible.

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.980
 We haven't much time.

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.980
 Well, wait, wait, wait, we can fully calculate and find out where I calculate.

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.980
 That's a very good idea, Homer.

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.980
 I can't phone her right now.

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.980
 Oh, K-2-7.

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.980
 Oh, do you suppose we're going to kill you and you can kill me to stay in the creek?

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.980
 Homer, please try to control yourself, especially when I'm finding Kathleen.

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:34.980
 Hello?

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.260
 I'm glad you're getting me.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.060
 You're kidding, but I'm very busy right now.

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:39.220
 I'm having a feeling.

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:40.060
 A what?

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.900
 A feeling.

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.900
 You know, from my last year I passed now.

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.700
 You have been this woman I wanted to talk to you about.

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:46.580
 My feeling?

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:47.080
 Sure.

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.740
 I was just wondering what it is you were having fitted.

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.900
 You know, I'm telling you, I'm going into any of your friends there.

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.100
 I'm in the internship?

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.180
 Can I help you go now?

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:56.740
 I mean, my mother's calling me.

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:59.100
 She's got her mouth off of a can.

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.060
 Well, that's fine.

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.820
 I mean, thank you very much, Kathleen.

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:03.820
 Goodbye!

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:04.820
 Homer!

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:05.820
 Homer, what do you know?

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.820
 Pass me his going as an Indian princess.

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.820
 He's the only one who can't even decide to go as a lord.

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.820
 I wonder where I can get an Indian costume.

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.820
 So, what I look good is a...

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:18.820
 You can't do that, Homer.

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:19.820
 You can't go as an Indian.

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:20.820
 Why not?

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.820
 Well, he was because I'm going to be an Indian.

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.820
 He thought that's what you weren't interested in after a ride.

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:28.820
 That was the largest point of view, Henry.

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.820
 Well, if I'm Mrs. Out of town, who's going to go with you?

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:37.820
 I just said I do. A paper could be more likely to have two of you and do it in a normal movie.

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:39.820
 Listen Homer, Kathleen's mind girl.

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:43.820
 Thank you, Anthony. I wasn't suggesting for one minute if he wasn't.

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:47.820
 And I realized I was saying that I had not anything to do with it.

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.820
 Hey, Anthony, do you like being a holler?

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:51.820
 Are you calling on, Mother?

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:53.820
 He's coming to the dining room for a moment.

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:57.860
 You said you're a m

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:00.820
 I'll be right back.

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:04.120
 Did I get a new in-home or are you able to count me in-depth now?

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:04.820
 No, Mother.

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:09.320
 Homer just wants to help me take Kathleen to this mass grade we're going to and I said no.

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.620
 Now, I don't think that's a bit nice.

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.420
 Mother, you mean I said let Homer go every place with Kathleen and me?

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:18.820
 I think it's because we said all I said I think we can live whenever we can.

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.520
 And if you can do a plan, a good plan,

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:22.320
 I think you think,

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.320
 we're going to consider it a good time to get scared with Homer Brown.

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.620
 So, little, no more boy than you can be.

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.620
 and I want you to go right back and say you saved your mind.

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.620
 You mean right now?

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:37.620
 So how many of you did you like it to have in go along to this dance or whatever it is?

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:38.620
 You and Kathy?

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:42.620
 But you and my mother, you know, I've been on that and someday you'll want to call

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.620
 but to do the same for you.

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.620
 What do you do with me and Kathy?

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:47.620
 I said I go home.

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:48.620
 I'm a caller.

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.620
 You can help me take Kathleen to the master.

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.620
 I can, I really can.

00:04:54.620 --> 00:05:07.300
 Provided I escorted home afterwards and provided you don't think you're always in the end right here. I said you have you? Hey, hey, hey, oh boy. See how we can both go with anyone.

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:17.300
 [Music]

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:19.300
 Hi, I'm Iris.

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:20.300
 Is that you, Dad?

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:21.300
 Iris, are you in the kitchen?

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.300
 I'm in the room, Ty, but you're ready.

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.300
 Oh, your breakfast is ready.

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.300
 What's it doing in the room, Logan?

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:28.300
 It's a good thing you're in the room, Ty.

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.300
 It's sad, I don't like it for something.

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:33.300
 Go on, my, you can see my new brown hat in the glaze.

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.300
 My goodness, you know, didn't the horse even get mob yesterday?

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:36.900
 Yes, no, I can't find it.

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:38.600
 Well, they are in the toilet, doesn't they?

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.000
 I find myself a desk.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
 Alex, my hat is a good year more important than I've ever done to her.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.200
 I didn't even tell the doctor before breakfast.

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:49.200
 I don't mean it, Sam. I just have to notice it isn't where the whole way is.

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:52.400
 Sam, all this big hat right there in the dining room.

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:52.900
 Where?

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:54.100
 On the chair.

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:56.200
 Now, will you please let me look for my doctor?

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:59.300
 I saw that hat on the chair, Alex, and it's not my hat.

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:02.400
 Alex, what's the girl hat? Very good, the brown hat you bought yesterday.

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.200
 Yes, Alex. That is a brown hat.

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:09.700
 But that hat I bought yesterday has a bright all-in feather in the band. That hat has nothing. Not even a band.

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:14.200
 I don't think I know if it's gonna be this far. My hat? I've never done so.

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:18.200
 Mother, that's Mother! I'm here to get in there. Oh, I'm just here to explain it.

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.200
 So they carry me, I've got to. What's happened to Henry now?

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:23.200
 It's in the Henry's water. It's my biddly.

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:25.200
 You know what? It's my biddly. Oh.

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:29.200
 Yep, Mother, this is the one that needs to have that lovely old red-seddy tail in it.

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:31.200
 And I'm a dirty-sail dog.

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:38.200
 No, it was not the fair detail. Alex, what am I going to do about my hat? I'm sure I don't know, Sam. You don't have to wear that brown hat to do my dining thing.

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:43.200
 Without my orange hair, Alex will... Oh, the girl is going to do about my shiny tail.

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:48.200
 Let's see, look at that, Anna game. Yeah, you think my feather does, Sam? You don't know the dress, Sam?

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:54.200
 I don't know, Sam. I don't know the dress, Sam. I'm sure I shouldn't say the call to you, Alex.

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:57.200
 What's happening up here, Sam? My feather is a feather.

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:59.200
 I'm going to have breakfast on top.

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:01.200
 Dad, I'm going to have breakfast on top.

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:03.200
 Dad, I'm going to have breakfast on top.

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:05.200
 Dad, I'm going to have breakfast on top.

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:07.200
 Dad, I'm going to have breakfast on top.

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:09.200
 Dad, I'm going to have breakfast on top.

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:11.200
 Dad, I'm going to have breakfast on top.

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:13.200
 Dad, I'm going to have breakfast on top.

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:15.200
 Dad, I'm going to have breakfast on top.

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:17.200
 Dad, I'm going to have breakfast on top.

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:19.200
 Dad, I'm going to have breakfast on top.

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:21.200
 Dad, I'm going to have breakfast on top.

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:23.200
 Dad, I'm going to have breakfast on top.

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:25.200
 Dad, I'm going to have breakfast on top.

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:26.200
 Dad, I'm going to have breakfast on top.

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:43.000
 I'll be up in a second. I'll be right back.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
 I did, guys. It's better not having home a lot.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000
 Homer, how do you feel about scrambled eggs?

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.000
 What's that?

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.000
 Granny eggs!

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
 Are you my own?

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
 No, I'm getting a sign of this.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.000
 Look what I found.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000
 It took a look at this.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
 It took seven inches to go up at the side of it.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
 Oh boy, where did you find it?

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
 Oh, my name is Father's Poel.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.000
 It was supposed to be old, didn't I?

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
 Pulled it all away.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
 These are the vineyards and the men that went out of their tracks.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.260
 They will call a permanent before them.

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:16.620
 And our using of, yeah, my house think we better.

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:21.180
 Or, literally, we can make sure we can pass things out of a setting here,

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:25.620
 a little orange, so they're not in it, but we don't actually have to be patient,

00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:28.500
 so it's only pieces that wear a big, better head record.

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:29.780
 Now, with some hair,

00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:32.900
 top names that are being only in princess, they're going to be doing.

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:35.540
 Or, what a princess go out with CGI.

00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:38.100
 If it's a black, it's really, I guess not.

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:40.900
 You know what I'm not saying? I just want to tell.

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:43.400
 You can even get married back in a family table.

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:45.100
 You have to do that anyway, how much?

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:48.800
 You'll have to keep track of every one of these letters and get more back.

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:50.100
 Sure you will, really.

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:52.800
 Look, I'll just flip open your little corner.

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:54.300
 Be careful, Homer.

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:55.800
 You can get it started.

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:56.800
 All right, time.

00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:30.020
 You'll be ready to start catching.

00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:31.020
 Oh, I like you.

00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:34.020
 There, that's taking a move.

00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:36.460
 Alice, get those coming down with a little help.

00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:38.460
 Party there, going back up again.

00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:39.460
 Welcome, Welcome.

00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:40.460
 I'm coming up.

00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:41.460
 You're laughing at us.

00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:44.460
 I'm not doing this for entertainment.

00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:46.460
 I want to talk to you.

00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:47.460
 Hello?

00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:49.460
 Hello, is this your daughter?

00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:50.460
 Yes.

00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:52.460
 This is your daughter's meeting.

00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:53.460
 What is your mother's meeting?

00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:54.460
 Well, Mrs. Anderson.

00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:56.460
 Well, Mrs. Anderson, we're talking about the life of the big two bars.

00:16:56.460 --> 00:17:00.460
 It's really unimportant, but the big thing means so much to children.

00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:02.460
 Well, yes, of course Mrs. Anderson.

00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:03.460
 I think it's a little bit of a constant,

00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:06.460
 but Henry has a normal plan on letting you evacuate next Friday.

00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:10.460
 Yes, so I'm afraid I don't know anything about their constant here, Mrs. Anderson.

00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:12.460
 They are a young girl and giving in to this.

00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:13.460
 And what?

00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:14.460
 An awesome Indian.

00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:16.460
 Her name is the bulldog that's speaking in.

00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:19.460
 And they were carrying around logs that's a better thing.

00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:22.460
 They did say, "They said it's a better thing to do."

00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:24.460
 They said, "They're collecting that one Indian, who's there?"

00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:26.460
 They said, "Come here."

00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:27.460
 They thought it was a long way to go.

00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:29.460
 Oh, no, Indian is a better thing.

00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:30.460
 Just one moment, too.

00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:31.460
 You call me Alex?

00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:32.460
 Oh, still a minute, Alex?

00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:33.460
 Don't move.

00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:35.460
 I said, "It is a nice idea."

00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:36.460
 I was going to do one.

00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:37.460
 [laughter]

00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:39.460
 I was going to go ahead.

00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:40.460
 Oh, there you go.

00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:41.460
 Under that minute.

00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:43.460
 Are you all right, Mr. Vollig?

00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:45.460
 Oh, yes, I'm sorry, Mr. Vollig.

00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:48.460
 I thought the boy was in the top of his drawing.

00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:54.480
 It really isn't terribly important, but I thought he was trouble making a copy of the

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:55.480
 cat's room.

00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:56.480
 He's going at the Pinterest or media.

00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:57.480
 So where is the guy in the game?

00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:58.480
 In the app.

00:17:58.480 --> 00:17:59.480
 That's how it is.

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:00.480
 It's coming over.

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:01.480
 It's crazy.

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:04.480
 When you see the dog taking that feather, what did you say about talking to Mr. Vollig?

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:08.480
 about talking to them. I'm going to go ahead and do well. The boys have a strong making

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:12.480
 marriage in costume here. I'm going to like to play the window and go with my dog.

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:14.480
 You see? Y'all are going to do it!

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:16.480
 Look! Then look out in the net!

00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:24.480

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:28.480
 [Music]

00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:31.480
 And I'll let you and Mary, I'm just gonna die.

00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:33.480
 You do have to be looking all over time

00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:35.480
 and Indian costume and I'll tell you what it is.

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:38.480
 And Indian costume? What's wrong with you?

00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:42.480
 I'm going to draw the princess in India, but I've changed my mind.

00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:45.480
 I've decided to draw in American Indian and still.

00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:47.480
 My goodness, and American Indian!

00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:49.480
 You're a princess, and you're going to go to the North Indian.

00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:52.480
 And if I was going one day, then I'd ask you another girl.

00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:53.480
 Or she'd go, "Where are you?"

00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:55.480
 In my Mary, it's dead.

00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:59.480
 I'm sorry, I only decided I need to go to the place next to India.

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:00.480
 You don't talk to me?

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:01.480
 Why not?

00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:05.480
 My goodness, if I have to wear a bow over the long time, I say to the last over my eyes,

00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:07.480
 I might take a grower a false phrase.

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:17.480
 [MUSIC]

00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:20.480
 So I just ate a few out of the way that started.

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:23.480
 They have a little tail of feathers that goes right near our back.

00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:28.760
 That's your other head raise. Yes father. Come in here in a minute. You have one.

00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:31.480
 That would be tight. You know you have anything you think.

00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:33.400
 Anyway, we're gonna do an open all day.

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:34.600
 So why father?

00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:36.600
 Without Henry. You do, Homer.

00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:37.400
 Yes, father.

00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:38.600
 Yes, he's too old.

00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:40.040
 And put down those bags.

00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:41.960
 Yes, father. Yes, he's too old.

00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:46.440
 Anyway, how did all these studies get down here?

00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:48.600
 I was about to ask you the same question.

00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:51.400
 When you kindly explain what happened to my fellow.

00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:54.400
 Well, they learn if I got a glass of water.

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:56.400
 Get it on over.

00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:59.400
 Now, yeah, maybe I'll begin with the orange feather that belongs in my hat.

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:03.400
 That feather is perfectly safe, Father. I haven't had an envelope up stairs.

00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:04.400
 I see.

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:06.400
 Would you like to have me into the phone, Father?

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:07.400
 No, I would not.

00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:08.400
 I like to, Father.

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:11.680
 Every new and whole world that's started in life six minutes and collects every single

00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:14.400
 sanitary feather that's floating around his house.

00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:16.400
 But through a scallory, we can only meet, Father.

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:18.400
 You can't have the space tomorrow.

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:25.400
 to collect my grandfather or couldn't use an act. You make me whatever you wish. And when you have him collect he's gonna throw them away.

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:32.400
 Oh, then father? Yes, along with those takers that is. Yes, he's doing it again. Yes? Yeah, that's what you're saying.

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:34.400
 That's what you're saying is going to be the costume, right? What are you going to do, Bob?

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:37.400
 He thinks he can find the eye dark costume for him in his helmet.

00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:41.400
 You have no eye dark costume, he's going to be the eye dark costume for him in his helmet.

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:46.560
 I told him that the scene is both over the masquerade as Roger, so there's no costume in the match I didn't even...

00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:49.740
 Your mother, your brother looks like her as Roger anyway.

00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:51.780
 Mother, you don't understand.

00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:53.280
 Well, what's another henry?

00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:56.400
 You bought dinner by Kathleen's the masquerade, baby, too?

00:20:56.400 --> 00:21:04.240
 [Singing]

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:06.900
 Now listen, don't be just for one minute.

00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:08.100
 Hey, let me talk to you.

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:10.120
 I don't want to listen to you, don't want to do it.

00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:12.120
 In a way, Homer, but you!

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:17.120
 I'm going to be listening to you. I've got my heart got you all ready and I'm going to wait until the next time.

00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:23.120
 You think, Toby? You're going to be thinking I know somebody who will. I don't think you can hear me all the time.

00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:32.120
 But Kathleen, you are getting wise, our costumes. I definitely wish you made them go live.

00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:36.120
 But your mother said... My mother must remember you sure yet.

00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:37.620
 I'm going to get you right in the middle of that

00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:39.620
 you need a bag of onion and a top.

00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:42.420
 - The Kathleen and school are feathers and what?

00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:43.700
 - That's too bad, honey.

00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:45.100
 And I'll just have to find somebody

00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:46.900
 who's going in the bathroom and in the bathroom.

00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:47.740
 - Oh, no!

00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:51.220
 Never mind, no more.

00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:52.060
 I'll answer it.

00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:52.900
 It's probably good.

00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:55.900
 And you're going to say you can try.

00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:56.740
 Hello?

00:21:56.740 --> 00:21:57.740
 - Hello, is that your head rate?

00:21:57.740 --> 00:21:58.580
 - Yes, Elle.

00:21:58.580 --> 00:21:59.900
 I need Charlie.

00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:02.500
 Oh, I might go with a phone that's only Charlie Clark.

00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:04.340
 - You have a little bit of kind of pain

00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:06.340
 There's a lot of pain in the feather.

00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:07.340
 That is done.

00:22:07.340 --> 00:22:08.340
 Did you say so too?

00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:09.340
 Can they please?

00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:10.340
 Yeah, late March,

00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:11.340
 on high-ended ourselves,

00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:12.340
 to England,

00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:13.340
 talking for the last three.

00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:15.340
 Didn't you tell us to leave?

00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:17.340
 Sure, we found a couple of bags of feathers

00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:18.340
 out on your street last time.

00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:19.340
 Well, you win.

00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:20.340
 Yeah, I'm late now,

00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:23.340
 trying to find two girls who will be willing to know it's flaws.

00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:24.340
 Listen, guys,

00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:25.340
 those are mine feathers.

00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:26.340
 You're a crazy.

00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:28.340
 Everything's on the right on the street.

00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:30.340
 Hey, you know they kind of pay their notes.

00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:32.340

 You and Kathleen wanna come.

00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:48.100

00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:49.100

00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:41.100
 Oh, I feel like I'm going to be here.

00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:48.100
 Sorry, baby, baby. Please, please, please, please, please, please. I feel like I'm asking you.

 Hi, fellas, having a good time?

00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:03.100
 Hi, Ellen.

00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:06.100
 Well, I guess we better get going up on the flat one.

00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:08.100
 I don't hear it on the moon.

00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:10.100
 That's it. I don't think so.

00:24:10.100 --> 00:24:11.100
 I don't think so.

00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:13.100
 Don't do that. I'm not going to be here.

00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:21.100
 [Laughter]

00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:22.100
 Come on, Ellen.

00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:24.100
 You're really your time and good.

00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:26.020
 That's the fire of the museum.

00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:29.020
 It's something that the young lady hoped.

00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:31.020
 (audience laughing)

00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:32.020
 - There it is.

00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:34.100
 (laughs)

00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:35.940
 Thank you very much.

00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:37.860
 So, listen, I'm waiting for you.

00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:38.860
 (audience laughing)

00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:41.700
 But that's my girlfriend, your voice is changing.

00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:43.420
 All I know is that you'll hear it.

00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:45.140
 Come on, hear my lights dance.

00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:48.140

00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:51.140

00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:54.140
 [applause]

00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:55.140
 Hey, fella.

00:24:55.140 --> 00:24:58.140
 Is this a silly talk about the tailpawn?

00:24:58.140 --> 00:24:59.140
 -What? -Gracie snow.

00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:00.140
 Don't worry for me.

00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:02.140
 But listen, I've got a strong idea for you.

00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:05.140
 Now, I like emptying toasty brown grape nuts, like fine trees,

00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:07.140
 but maybe some folks don't.

00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:09.140
 Well, it's not like grape nuts, right?

00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:10.140
 What, everybody?

00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:12.140
 Well, I'm in fortunate a crime scene,

00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:14.140
 because I never leave a press machine,

00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:16.140
 so here's my big idea.

00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:17.140
 The tailpawn.

00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:18.140
 What's that got there?

00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:20.140
 -You look great, not great. -Yeah, I see.

00:25:20.140 --> 00:25:24.540
 The kale, the pecan, is great nut plate spelled backwards,

00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:26.900
 for folks who are fat with the body and flexors.

00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:27.740
 You can't get on?

00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:29.220
 Ha, ha, ha, ha.

00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:31.460
 Well done, I'm not a better idea.

00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:31.960
 [LAUGHTER]

00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:35.100
 That's a great nut plate, living with late-cruity milk

00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:36.340
 before anybody.

00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:39.020
 And he will be backwards very long about eating breakfast.

00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:41.620
 Because great nuts plates have a twice as good flavor,

00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:43.620
 sunlight with wheat and molten barley,

00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:45.820
 a delicious and different flavor blend.

00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:48.560
 And how fast your work goes after that delicious breakfast

00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:53.560
 It's great, my plate's all whole green, so you'll climb full of all around whole grain nourishment.

00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:57.560
 Try 'em, folks. You'll see. You'll say those great nuts, plate.

00:25:57.560 --> 00:25:59.560
 They've got what it takes.

00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:05.560
 It's time to go to sleep, Stan.

00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:07.560
 Alex, I can't sleep without my pillow.

00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:10.560
 I'll never be able to sleep to stay without that pillow.

00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:13.560
 But, dear, I believe you want to be kept at the increasing.

00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:15.560
 Yes, it feels like horse hair.

00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:17.960
 The father is a new silhouette.

00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:19.760
 Ted, let's go away.

00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:21.240
 Yes, all the time that's been cut,

00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:22.360
 they've got a new one.

00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:25.360
 Well, when you decided we should give you this, Father.

00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:26.360
 What is it?

00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:29.160
 It's a pair of new science fatty pillows.

00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:31.560
 Pumped Homer won them from a Coke-Tet.

00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:33.560

00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:32.820
 No wonder it's America's most popular maple blended spirit.

00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:35.920
 Ask for a large cabin spirit tomorrow.

00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:38.920
 No party in New Orleans!

00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:49.520
