 Well, now it's not to have somebody tell you about it, because words just can't give you the full idea.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 And then I think you'll agree that a spoon in the hand is worth a hundred adjectives.

 So try jello butter scotch pudding for yourself.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 One taste is all you need to tell you why jello butter scotch pudding is the dessert that thousands call the best of all.

 The Aldrich family who live in the comfortable house at 117 Elm Street in Centerville, USA

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 are friends and neighbors of yours.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.600
 All rich and his wife Alice are real parents and there never was a more typical American boy than their teenage son Henry

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.120
 Well now it is evening and as we join the Aldrich's in their living room

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.120
 Just see if you don't recognize Henry Aldrich as a boy from your bluff

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.640
 Then yes, Alice

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.280
 How steam chilly to you and ran

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.120
 and ran

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.880
 Yes, father. Have you put any coal on the furnace and

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.840
 In just a minute, Father.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.840
 You were pleased to put it on now.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.540
 Perhaps he isn't through looking at the funny paper, Sam.

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.540
 Henry never does anything until he's told three times.

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.540
 But, dear, he's in school all day.

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.440
 When I was a boy, I had a few responsibilities.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.340
 In fact, I had a great many responsibilities.

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.340
 Yes, dear. But remember, you grew up in another generation.

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:57.140
 Henry!

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.640
 Yes, Father, I'm coming right now.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.840
 Do you realize your mother is cold?

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.640
 Mother, which would you rather I do?

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.640
 put some coal on or bring you your sweater.

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.640
 Henry, why can't you do what your father asked you to?

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.640
 I'm perfectly willing to. I just like to save all the coal I can.

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.640
 Henry, I'm starting right now, Father.

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:17.640
 Just one moment, please.

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.640
 You want to speak to I, Father?

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.640
 No, sir. I want to speak to you.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.640
 Yes, sir. That's what I'm referring to.

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:25.640
 Sit down a minute.

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:26.640
 Yes, Father.

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.640
 Do you know what I used to do when I was your age?

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:30.640
 No, sir.

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.440
 Believe it or not, I used to get up at six o'clock every morning.

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.320
 And after helping my father milk the cows,

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.760
 I walked three miles to school, sometimes

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.640
 through four feet of snow.

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:42.480
 - How's that for?

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:43.960
 - Now Sam.

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:46.880
 - Well, we had four feet one morning, Alice.

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.400
 And when I came home from school, Henry,

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.200
 I went down to the village and did odd jobs.

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.680
 - Yes, father, but didn't your folks give you any money?

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.720
 - Not a cent.

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.760
 And at the end of my four years in high school,

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.880
 do you know how much I had in the bank?

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.520
 Thirty-five dollars.

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.160
 Is that all?

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.680
 What do you mean is that all?

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.200
 It was drawing six percent interest.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.880
 Yes, Father, but nowadays a bank doesn't pay six percent.

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.360
 The great reward for saving my boys.

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:12.400
 Alice, where are you going?

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.160
 Out in the hall to get a sweater.

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.840
 Yes.

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.640
 And Henry, right there is a very good example of what I'm driving at.

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.920
 Yes, Father, I'll go right down and fix the furnace.

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:23.080
 And in the future will you try to do things without having to be told?

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.360
 Oh, yes, Father.

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.120
 This talk has done me a great deal of good already.

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.380
 Well, I'm pleased to hear that.

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:33.780
 As a matter of fact, I think I have an idea that'll please you very much.

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:34.980
 What is the idea?

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:36.980
 Oh, you'll see.

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:40.940
 From now on, you're gonna find a big change in me.

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:41.980
 What's that noise?

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:44.460
 See, I guess that must be Mother's shoveling coal.

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.860
 Wait, Mother! I'm coming right down!

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.860
 [Horn]

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:56.860
 [Horn]

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:03.860
 [Horn]

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:05.860
 Toby, do you know what time it is?

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.860
 We've got lots of time, Henry. We're only two blocks from school.

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:10.860
 Did I tell you about my idea, Toby?

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:11.860
 What idea?

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:13.860
 I'm taking care of furnaces.

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:14.860
 Who's, Henry?

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:15.860
 Everybody's.

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:20.860
 I think that when a person reaches our age, they ought to begin to assume a few responsibilities.

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:22.860
 Don't you, Toby?

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.860
 How much money is there in it?

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:26.860
 Oh boy, I hate to think of it.

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.860
 I've been calling up customers all morning.

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:29.860
 How many do you have?

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:32.860
 Well, so far I don't actually have any.

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:34.860
 But that's just a coincidence.

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:40.860
 It just happened that most of the people I've called so far don't need to have anyone assume their responsibilities.

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:41.860
 Yeah?

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:45.820
 Well, I understand Willie Marshall makes a lot of money taking care of furnaces.

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:46.500
 He does.

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:47.340
 Sure.

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:49.140
 Could I go into business with you, Henry?

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:50.540
 Oh, no, Toby.

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:53.860
 You assume your responsibilities, and I'll assume mine.

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.540
 But, Henry, we could make twice as much.

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:57.460
 You think so?

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:00.940
 If we could get a few families like the Vance Givers and the Peckin Paws.

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:01.620
 Sure.

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:03.020
 They've got money.

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:06.140
 The only thing is, I think Willie Marshall already takes care of them.

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:06.900
 He does.

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:07.620
 Sure.

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:11.180
 And I heard that every time there's a holiday, he gets a little extra from them.

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:14.440
 Is that right? You know, I'd like to take care of the peck and pause.

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:17.740
 Gee, my father takes care of all of Mr. Peck and pause legal matters.

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:19.740
 It'd be nice if I could take care of his heating.

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:21.740
 [audience laughter]

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:25.340
 Sure. Sure, then it would be a complete all-round service.

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:29.540
 Henry, don't look now. But isn't that willy across the street?

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:33.020
 Where? Hey, you've powered, wait a second. Come on over, Willy.

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:35.640
 Am I tired? What's the matter with you?

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:38.660
 I got up at half past five this morning to ten my furnaces.

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:40.220
 What are you eating, Willie?

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:42.000
 Fudge and peanuts.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.700
 Fudge and peanuts?

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:46.060
 It's my breakfast.

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:47.440
 That's all you're gonna eat?

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:49.340
 Candy and peanuts are all by ever eat.

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:50.180
 For any meal?

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:54.620
 Sure. Fudge for breakfast, peanut for lunch, chocolate for dinner.

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:56.820
 Gee, Toby, do you hear that?

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:59.660
 He makes so much money, all he ever eats is candy.

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:01.360
 Hold this bag a minute, Henry.

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:02.060
 What for?

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:04.060
 I won't open a piece of bubble gum.

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:06.060
 [LAUGHTER]

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:11.260
 Willie, you wouldn't like to get rid of one or two of your customers, would you?

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:12.220
 Why should I?

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:13.900
 Didn't you just say you were tired?

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:15.340
 Not that tired.

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:17.180
 Willie, take some of your customers.

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:20.700
 Sooner or later they'll be putting in oil burners and then where will you be?

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:21.980
 How about it, Willie?

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:24.460
 Well, where will our vector scum started?

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:27.820
 Willie, while you're starting your gum, let me suggest something.

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:32.620
 How would you like to have me give you two dollars for a couple of your customers?

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:35.820
 I'll buy the peck and paws and the van skivers from you.

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:36.900
 Three dollars, Henry.

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:37.580
 Two, Willie.

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:38.080
 Three.

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:39.820
 But Willie, all I've got is two dollars.

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:42.140
 My mother gave me to buy lunches with for next month.

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:43.100
 I don't want it.

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:45.060
 But Willie, with two dollars, you still

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:47.540
 wouldn't have to go back on to regular food right away.

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:48.940
 Oh, I tell you no.

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:51.100
 Willie, I don't like to say this,

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:52.980
 but if you don't want to sell, I

00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:56.380
 happen to be in a very unfortunate position for you.

00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:57.340
 Oh, Henry.

00:07:57.340 --> 00:08:01.540
 Well, my father happens by chance to be Mr. Peckinpaw's lawyer.

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:03.020
 And you know what that means.

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:04.380
 Yeah, sure.

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:08.380
 And Henry, isn't your father Mr. Vance Skyver's lawyer too?

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:10.880
 Yeah, come to think of it, I think he is.

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:12.880
 Willie, what chance have you got?

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:14.680
 Let's see the two dollars.

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:15.680
 Here you are.

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:18.680
 Okay, you want to buy my shovel for 50 cents extra?

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:20.380
 Well, we need it, you think?

00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:22.180
 Sure. You can pay me any time.

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:23.180
 That's fair enough.

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:25.180
 How about my overall for 25 cents?

00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:26.380
 You're overall?

00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:29.180
 Henry, you can't buy overalls for any less than that.

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:29.880
 Okay.

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:31.580
 And is there anything else you fellas need?

00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:32.080
 No.

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:33.580
 I got a necktie at home, I tell you.

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:36.940
 No, Willie. Willie, what's the necktie like?

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:38.380
 It's red, so...

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:40.620
 Hey fellas, wait for me!

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:41.740
 Hello, Agnes.

00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:42.780
 Wait, where you are?

00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:45.180
 Toby and I've got a hurry on so long, Willie.

00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:48.300
 Henry, let's go over to the candy store and open a chart.

00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:50.300
 Hey, what's been going on, Willie?

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:54.220
 I just sold them the peck and paws of the van Skyver's furnaces to take care of.

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:54.860
 Yeah?

00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:57.500
 Yeah. I wonder if they'll be mad.

00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:58.140
 Why?

00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:00.860
 Well, the van Skyver just had an oil burner put in.

00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:01.900
 Oh.

00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:03.260
 Would that make a difference?

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:04.620
 In a way, it would.

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:07.260
 Yesterday, the peckenpaw left for Florida.

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:10.260
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:27.100
 Toby, are you sure this is where the peckenpaws live?

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:28.140
 Sure, Henry.

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:31.340
 Do you suppose we're going to have to get up this early every morning?

00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:32.940
 Gee, but it's dark.

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:37.780
 Wouldn't you think somebody would be willing to get up and let us in?

00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:40.640
 I wonder whether we really ought to wake up the peckin' paws.

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:42.740
 You mean we've gotta wait until they get up?

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:45.340
 Well, they certainly expect us to be quiet, don't they?

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:47.640
 Let's go around and try the cellar door.

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:49.340
 Okay, come on, Toby.

00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:50.140
 Can you see?

00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:50.940
 Sure.

00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:53.940
 Have a piece of candy, Toby?

00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:55.340
 I don't mind if I do.

00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:58.040
 Which bag do you want some out of?

00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:00.840
 Well, let's try the one that's in your left pocket.

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:02.840
 Toby, isn't this the cellar door?

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:05.300
 Can you open it?

00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:06.400
 No.

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:07.800
 Push you little Henry.

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:08.800
 What are you doing?

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:09.800
 Think I'm doing.

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:12.040
 Well, Gee, Henry, we've got to get into that furnace.

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:16.980
 Since what I say we can't shirk our responsibility the first day we begin here, I'll push with you.

00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:17.480
 Come on.

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:23.620
 Oh, Gee, what is it?

00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:25.520
 Imagine, Henry.

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:27.520
 The whole lot came right off.

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:29.920
 I guess the door was rotten.

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:34.920
 Boy is it dark down here.

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:35.920
 Wait a minute.

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:36.920
 What's the matter?

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:39.920
 I walked into a cobweb.

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:42.920
 You've got to get used to going into cellars like this, Toby.

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:43.920
 Oh sure.

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:46.920
 What's the matter?

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:50.920
 I found the boiler.

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:51.920
 Yeah?

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:52.920
 Where?

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:53.920
 Right over my head.

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:56.920
 Well at least we know where it is.

00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:57.920
 Ouch!

00:10:57.920 --> 00:10:58.920
 What's that?

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:00.920
 Well, gee whiz Toby, I just...

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:02.920
 (screams)

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:05.920
 Listen, Henry, do you want to wake everyone up?

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:07.920
 Here's the furnace.

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:10.920
 Toby, there isn't any fire in it.

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:12.920
 You mean they let it go out?

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:15.920
 Imagine, boy, it's a good thing we got in here before they woke up.

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:17.920
 Do you suppose there's any kindling?

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:19.920
 If you find a light, turn it on.

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:20.920
 Same to you.

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:23.920
 Here's a box, Henry. Good, can you break it up?

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:25.920
 I guess so. There are a lot of papers in it.

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:26.920
 We've got everything.

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:32.680
 You know, Toby, it won't be any time until we have it so hot upstairs, Mr. and Mrs. Peck

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:34.920
 and Paul be hanging out the window.

00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:35.920
 Sure.

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:40.320
 When they hear about all this extra trouble we've been to, they'll make us take something

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:41.320
 extra.

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:42.320
 Here we go, Toby.

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:45.920
 I'm going to touch the match to it.

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:50.920
 Oh boy, look at that.

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:55.120
 Imagine, we may get as much as a dollar just for striking that one match.

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:57.120
 Ever have an easier job Henry?

00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:58.320
 I'll say I have a...

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:01.120
 Oh gee, there goes the candy all to the floor.

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:04.120
 Why worry about 10 or 15 cents worth of candy?

00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:05.620
 That's what I say.

00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:07.620
 Here I'll throw it in the fire.

00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:10.620
 Boy, look at it.

00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:16.120
 I never thought I'd be in a position where I could just stand back and watch Candy burn.

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:17.120
 Hi there!

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:18.620
 See who's that in the doorway?

00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:19.620
 Me.

00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:20.620
 Is it Mr. Packenpaw?

00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:22.620
 No, it's the milkman.

00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:25.740
 I was just going by and I seen smoke starting out of the chimney.

00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:27.260
 Are the pecking paws back?

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.740
 Back? They're upstairs in bed.

00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:32.380
 They are? I thought they went to Florida.

00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:35.620
 Oh, Gee, now we've been engaged to take care of their furnace.

00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:38.620
 Well, look, how much milk do you suppose I ought to leave?

00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:40.260
 Toby, how much would you think?

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:44.420
 I don't know. Why not they a regular amount? That's what I would say.

00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:47.620
 Okay, I'll leave six ports of milk and one a cream.

00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:48.420
 Yes, sir.

00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:51.220
 I better tell the Fred man in the newsboy if I see him.

00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:52.220
 Yes, sir.

00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:55.220
 Henry, let's start shoveling.

00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:57.220
 You know, Toby, my father was right.

00:12:57.220 --> 00:13:02.220
 If you have a job to do when you do it, it makes you feel swell.

00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:06.220
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:26.220
 And now folks, let's leave Henry and Toby for a moment and turn our attention to one

00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:29.220
 of the big topics of the day, football.

00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:33.300
 Each year you know football experts select the country's outstanding players and honor

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:35.340
 them as the All-American football team.

00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:40.260
 Well, with this All-American idea in mind, we recently decided to do the same thing in

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:42.020
 the field of desserts.

00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:46.540
 So we ask a number of football fans what they would give as their choice for the All-American

00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:48.020
 dessert.

00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:50.220
 And here is the way these football fans reply.

00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:52.220
 Pomerac, Pomerac, Pomerac, Pomerac, row!

00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:54.220
 Wiggle wiggle wiggle wiggle wag, a zigga zagga zow!

00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:56.220
 Pomerac, a wiggle wagga zigga zagga zow!

00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:57.220
 Jell-a-dell, put it!

00:13:57.220 --> 00:13:58.220
 R-rah, r-rah, r-rah!

00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:03.220
 Uh, the English translation, "We like Jell-o the milliputting."

00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:09.220
 And that, ladies and gentlemen, is a sentiment that's being echoed around more and more family dinner tables every day.

00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:15.220
 Yes, sir, Jell-o the milliputting is winning new friends by the thousands for its tempting appearance,

00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:19.220
 for its tender, creamy goodness, and for its rich, satisfying taste.

00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:25.780
 taste. So why not let your family enjoy it too? Serve this easy, ready prepared pudding tomorrow night

00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:30.420
 with sliced bananas or whatever fruits or nuts you may have handy. Take it from me folks,

00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:33.860
 Delo Vanilla Pudding is a treat you'll soon repeat.

00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:53.060
 Now getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldrich, Henry and Toby bought a furnace route from Willie Marshall.

00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:57.060
 Without realizing that the first customer he sold them at John de Florida,

00:14:57.060 --> 00:15:01.060
 the boys managed to get him to the basement and build a fire in the furnace.

00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:05.060
 The scene opens the same morning in the Aldrich dining room.

00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:07.060
 Sam!

00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:08.060
 Yes, Alice?

00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:09.060
 Come in here and eat your breakfast.

00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:10.060
 Henry, how'd he is?

00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:12.060
 He's upstairs washing.

00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:15.060
 You know Alice, it seems to me there's already been a great change in Henry.

00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:19.900
 in Henry. There has do you. He came in so covered with ashes that I didn't even know him.

00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:25.900
 Mother. Yes, Henry. I'll sweep out the bathroom just as soon as I finish breakfast.

00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:30.100
 What's happened to the bathroom? Nothing, Father. I just changed my clothes in it.

00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:35.540
 Here's the morning mail for you. Oh, thank you. Henry, what in the world

00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:39.420
 happened to you this morning? Mother, I bought out a furnace tending business from

00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:44.540
 a guy yesterday. See, are you listening, Father? Alice, who do you suppose sent this

00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:46.460
 - A letter from Florida. - From Florida?

00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:48.100
 - Father, now may I proceed.

00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:51.940
 - Well, the pecan paws seem to be having a wonderful time.

00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:53.460
 - Well, that's nice, dear.

00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:55.260
 I envy them, poise.

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:57.780
 - The pecan paws, I have a letter from them.

00:15:57.780 --> 00:15:59.220
 - A letter from the pecan paws?

00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:00.900
 (audience laughing)

00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:02.900
 Saying they're having a wonderful time?

00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:04.780
 - What's so strange about that?

00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:06.540
 - Why didn't they just follow and tell you?

00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:08.700
 - They're neither in Florida.

00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:09.780
 - They're in Florida?

00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:10.620
 - Yeah.

00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:11.900
 (audience laughing)

00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:14.020
 - Well, what'd they go down there for?

00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:16.220
 I suppose because it's nice and warm.

00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:20.020
 Yes, they always did find their house in Centerville hard to heat.

00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:24.220
 Well, if you'll excuse me, I don't think I'll eat anymore.

00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:24.820
 Henry?

00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:25.620
 Where are you going?

00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:29.820
 Oh, just over an attempt to something I think would be a good idea to attend to.

00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:34.420
 Sam, I hope Henry isn't going to work as hard as this every day.

00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:37.220
 Best thing in the world for him to work on Saturday.

00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:40.020
 If that can pause, let her goes on to say,

00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:44.820
 Due to our haste in getting away, we overlooked a rather important item.

00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:48.940
 At the foot of our cellar stairs, we left a box of manuscripts which we would like to

00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:51.740
 have covered and shipped by express at once.

00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:53.180
 What else does he say?

00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:57.580
 Please ask whoever does the job not to litter the basement, as Mrs. Peckinford just had it

00:16:57.580 --> 00:16:59.860
 thoroughly clean.

00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:04.860
 I'll drive around and get the box on my way to the office.

00:17:04.860 --> 00:17:17.860
 [Music]

00:17:17.860 --> 00:17:19.860
 Now let me try to shake it Toby.

00:17:19.860 --> 00:17:21.860
 Henry don't you think I can shake a furnace?

00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:24.860
 [Coughing]

00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:26.860
 No.

00:17:26.860 --> 00:17:29.860
 The whole trouble is there's a clinker stuck.

00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:32.860
 Of course Toby, but you're just filling the basement up with smoke.

00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:33.860
 Here.

00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:39.580
 Well, what do you know about that?

00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:41.980
 Henry, I still don't understand it.

00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:44.140
 Are you sure the pecking paws aren't here?

00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:47.380
 Didn't I tell you I saw Mr. pecking paws' letter?

00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:50.220
 Stand back while I show up with this long poker ring.

00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:52.700
 Imagine that.

00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:53.700
 What's the matter?

00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:57.860
 Toby, can you hold up this piece of furnace pipe right over your head?

00:17:57.860 --> 00:17:58.860
 Why, Henry?

00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:01.060
 It seemed to come apart when I just hit it.

00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:02.660
 Well, that pipe's hot, Henry.

00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:04.660
 I'll hold it up with this stick here.

00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:07.660
 Hey, look at the smoke leak out.

00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:10.660
 I'll take care of the smoke. You get to work on the clinker.

00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:13.660
 I am, Toby. I am.

00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:19.660
 Wouldn't you have thought that the pecking paws would at least put up a sign saying go on to Florida? No fires, please?

00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:22.660
 Imagine Willie selling them to you.

00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:24.660
 You wait until we get Willie.

00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:29.660
 Henry, do you realize I'm holding this pipe while you just stand there and call?

00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:32.260
 Now the poker's stuck in the grate.

00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:35.460
 Well look Henry, I don't think we're getting anyplace.

00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:37.660
 So we take that pipe down for a minute.

00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:38.660
 All the way?

00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:43.260
 Sure, let's fix one thing at a time here.

00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:46.160
 Now look at the smoke come out.

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:47.660
 That's only until we get it fixed.

00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:50.160
 I'll pull on the poker while you shake.

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:52.660
 When I say three, yank Henry.

00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:55.660
 One, two, three, yank.

00:18:55.660 --> 00:18:57.660
 [coughing]

00:18:57.660 --> 00:19:02.660
 Did we get it out, Toby?

00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:04.660
 I think we got the whole grade out.

00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:09.660
 Oh, is that what dropped down?

00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:14.660
 We've got to do something about these hot coals that have rolled out on the floor, Henry.

00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:17.660
 Well, at least the smoke has stopped coming out of the pipe.

00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:20.660
 And nobody can say we aren't responsible.

00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:23.660
 Listen, Toby, what's that?

00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:24.660
 What, Henry?

00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:27.260
 She was at somebody walking upstairs.

00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:29.260
 Do you suppose the peck and paws are home?

00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:30.260
 They couldn't be.

00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:31.660
 Do you know what I think, Henry?

00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:32.660
 What?

00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:35.160
 Only Mr. Peck and paws away in the rest are here.

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:37.660
 She was. This is a nice time to find that out.

00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:39.660
 Henry, we've got to get the fire back in.

00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:41.660
 How?

00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:45.660
 How at where part of the great is still hanging?

00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:46.660
 Okay.

00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:49.660
 We'll shovel real quietly.

00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:53.660
 Quiet, Henry.

00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:54.660
 Henry.

00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:59.500
 You think he can match too loud?

00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:02.540
 Well I can hear it, but then I'm right here.

00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:08.700
 Sure, and you know what I'm doing.

00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:10.260
 What do you suppose that can be?

00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:12.740
 There must be a fire someplace.

00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:14.420
 I wonder where they're going.

00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:17.220
 Come on Toby, let's go out in front and see which way they're headed.

00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:18.220
 That's what I say.

00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:20.220
 Here hold the door open.

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:23.020
 There's one thing I like, it's a good fire.

00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:24.020
 Toby!

00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:26.520
 Toby, look, the engines are stopping right out in front!

00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:28.220
 And they are unloading their hulls!

00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:30.020
 Toby, I think we better be leaving!

00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:33.020
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:49.220
 Toby, about what time do you think it is?

00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:51.860
 Must be darn near time for dinner.

00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:54.100
 Will your folks give you the juice when you get home?

00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:57.140
 I'm gonna perfectly good excuse, Toby.

00:20:57.140 --> 00:20:59.020
 If they ask where I was today,

00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:01.740
 I can say I was way out in the country.

00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:04.100
 Sure, that's because that's where we are.

00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:05.860
 Sure, that's what I mean.

00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:09.900
 Here, have a piece of candy.

00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:11.420
 No, thanks.

00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:13.420
 I'm not hungry either.

00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:15.740
 I told you when you made Willie give back your money,

00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:18.060
 you shouldn't spend the whole business on candy.

00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:21.060
 She was, you bought enough to nearly fill this barn.

00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:23.900
 Well, first few pounds tasted good, didn't they?

00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:27.020
 What's that, Henry?

00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:29.380
 That's just Willy's trying to get out again.

00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:32.900
 Hey, shut up, Willy!

00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:34.060
 Let me off here!

00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:35.540
 Go chase yourself, Willy.

00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:37.860
 We aren't gonna let you out until you promise.

00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:38.780
 Promise what?

00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:40.060
 Are you gonna tell our folks

00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:42.740
 that we were the cause of those fire engines coming out?

00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:44.420
 Are you gonna give me back my $2?

00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:46.260
 Back along to Henry, Willy.

00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:48.660
 And besides, we've eaten your $2.

00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:49.580
 (laughing)

00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:52.040
 Well, you're not gonna make me promise not to squeal.

00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:54.200
 All right, then you can stay in there.

00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:55.640
 That's what I say.

00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:57.020
 Come on, Toby.

00:21:57.020 --> 00:21:59.480
 I guess we'll go back to Centerville.

00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:00.680
 Do you mean that, Henry?

00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:02.380
 No, we'll just let him think it.

00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:05.080
 But Henry's supposing we have to keep him here all night.

00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:08.120
 Toby, don't you realize what'll happen if he tells?

00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:10.120
 They carried every piece of furniture

00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:11.400
 out of Peck and Paws House

00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:13.560
 and then had to carry it all back in again.

00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:14.840
 (audience laughing)

00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:17.520
 Do you want your father to know you were mixed up in it?

00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:19.920
 Well, let's go back and force Willie to promise.

00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:22.520
 Okay, but let me do the talking.

00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:24.800
 Oh, Willie.

00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:28.880
 Willie, we've got a little proposition to put up to you.

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:33.080
 All right, Willie, if you don't want any of this candy.

00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:34.280
 Listen, Willie.

00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:37.280
 Willie, stop sulking.

00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:39.440
 Henry, look through the crock here.

00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:40.280
 What do you say?

00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:42.520
 Gee whiz, open the door.

00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:44.320
 Toby, Toby, he's gone.

00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:45.360
 You mean he's escaped?

00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:47.560
 He's probably on his way to my house right now.

00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:48.520
 Oh boy.

00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:49.040
 Yeah?

00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:50.400
 Maybe he's on his way to mine.

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:51.960
 Come on, we've got to beat him back home.

00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:54.440
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:22:54.440 --> 00:23:08.680
 Well, Sam, do you still think you were right?

00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:09.520
 About what?

00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:12.800
 You said that from now on, we'd see a big change in Henry.

00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:14.000
 Well, he didn't come home for lunch,

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.280
 and here it is, time for dinner.

00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:18.080
 All in all, Alice, this has been a very pleasant day.

00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:19.920
 I still can't get over it.

00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:21.920
 And when do you suppose I will?

00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:24.600
 To make the thing doubly embarrassing, Alice.

00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:26.520
 When I saw smoke pouring out of the house,

00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:29.000
 I had to be the one who turned in the alarm.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:30.440
 But there wasn't any fire at all?

00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:32.160
 Only in the furnace.

00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:33.760
 But it took nearly all the rest of the day

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:35.920
 getting the place straightened up again.

00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:38.400
 And those two tramps the firemen saw running away

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:40.320
 from the house had been living in the basement.

00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:42.000
 Not really, Sam.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:43.480
 That's what they'd been doing.

00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:45.080
 That's why they built a fire in the furnace

00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:49.420
 to keep warm. Why, Alice, they were even having their milk and bread delivered there.

00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:51.420
 Oh, my goodness!

00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:56.260
 We even found today's paper there. And what was left of a bag of marshmallows?

00:23:56.260 --> 00:23:59.060
 What on earth have they been doing with marshmallows?

00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:05.860
 Probably toasting them. And the box, Alice. The box of manuscripts that Peck and Paul wanted me to express to.

00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:06.660
 Were they gone?

00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:11.140
 Probably they had been burned. Burn, mind you. And nobody knows how valuable they were.

00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:12.180
 Well, what are you going to do?

00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:16.180
 I don't know. I wired Peckinpaw. Who's that?

00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:18.180
 Is everybody all right?

00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:20.180
 Is that you, Henry?

00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:23.180
 Yes, Mother. I hope I haven't kept your dinner waiting.

00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:25.180
 And will you please come in here?

00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:27.180
 Has anything happened while I was away?

00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:28.180
 Happened?

00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:32.180
 I mean, there hasn't been anybody here at the house to see you, has there?

00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:35.180
 Oh, for instance. Well, anybody.

00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:38.180
 You know, I just wondered whether any one of the fellas I know had dropped in.

00:24:38.180 --> 00:24:39.180
 No, Henry.

00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:42.180
 - Oh, well, I'm glad I didn't miss anyone then.

00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:44.180
 - Henry, where have you been all day?

00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:48.180
 - Oh, well, tell me and I just took a walk outside town

00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:50.180
 to look at the countryside.

00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:51.180
 - Did you?

00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:53.180
 - Yeah, we explored an old barn.

00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:56.180
 Would you like to take a walk out that way sometime, Father?

00:24:56.180 --> 00:24:58.180
 - I've had all the exercise I need.

00:24:58.180 --> 00:24:59.180
 Thank you.

00:24:59.180 --> 00:25:00.180
 - Oh.

00:25:00.180 --> 00:25:03.180
 - Your father has been carrying furniture all day, Henry.

00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:04.180
 (audience laughing)

00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:05.180
 - He has?

00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:07.180
 He's been changing the house around?

00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:12.420
 been changing the house around yes but not this house I'll answer the phone

00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:18.140

 Mrs. Alders, I just assume tell you.

00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:37.640
 Listen, Willie, my mother's very busy.

00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:38.900
 Oh, no, she isn't, Henry.

00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:40.140
 What is it you walk, Willie?

00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:42.540
 Mother, don't I smell something burning out in the kitchen?

00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:43.300
 Bernie?

00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:45.140
 Oh, dear, it's probably the same thing.

00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:46.380
 Listen, Willie, you beat it.

00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:47.100
 Do you hear me?

00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:47.780
 You make me.

00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:49.060
 Get your foot out of the door.

00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:50.420
 I don't want to tell your fault.

00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:51.100
 He was, Willie.

00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:52.140
 Looking back of you.

00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:52.580
 Where?

00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:53.340
 Right there.

00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:53.980
 Hey, you!

00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:56.340
 Goodbye, Willie.

00:25:56.340 --> 00:25:57.220
 Mother.

00:25:57.220 --> 00:25:57.740
 Mother.

00:25:57.740 --> 00:25:58.460
 What is it there?

00:25:58.460 --> 00:25:59.540
 Are you out here in the kitchen?

00:25:59.540 --> 00:26:00.020
 Yes.

00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:00.980
 That's all I wanted to know.

00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:02.700
 Do you feel a draft here?

00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:04.700
 I think I'll lock this back door.

00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:10.300
 Well, Alice, I just had an answer to my wire.

00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:11.300
 What does it say?

00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:13.460
 Box of manuscripts were only Mrs. Peck

00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:15.300
 and Paul's minutes of the woman's club.

00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:16.300
 Don't worry.

00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:17.400
 What's that, Father?

00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:19.600
 Oh, nothing to concern, you son.

00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:21.800
 He also says returning Monday.

00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:23.000
 He's coming back?

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:24.500
 Why shouldn't he?

00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:27.100
 He also says, please engage Willie Marshall

00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:30.000
 to clean up basement and start furnace.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.100
 Could you read that again, Father?

00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:35.780
 I understand exactly what he means. Do you know where Willie Marshall is?

00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:36.660
 Yes sir, but...

00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:37.260
 He was just here.

00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:40.860
 Henry, I want you to run over and tell him to straighten that basement out and get a fire started.

00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:43.900
 But, but Father, why should Willie do it when I'm right here?

00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:45.460
 He asks to have Willie do it.

00:26:45.460 --> 00:26:47.420
 But, Mother, I won't charge.

00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:48.420
 Why not?

00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:52.380
 Well, I'd like to give Mr. Peck and Paul an introductory offer.

00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:55.380
 Henry, I'm sorry, but you're not going to do any more work tonight.

00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:57.900
 But, Mother, I feel sorry for Mr. Peck and Paul.

00:26:57.900 --> 00:26:58.420
 Why?

00:26:58.420 --> 00:26:59.820
 Well, he's a friend of fathers.

00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:06.820
 Well, all I can say, son, is that I'm certainly glad to see you shoulder some responsibility.

00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:08.820
 Now, what's that?

00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:12.820
 Oh, I guess that's just something banging against the cellar door.

00:27:12.820 --> 00:27:14.820
 Well, I better go fix it.

00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:16.820
 Father, you stay where you are. I'll fix it.

00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:17.820
 Well, thank you, son.

00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:20.820
 I'll just get my baseball bat and attend to it right away.

00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:22.820

 or you're going to take care of your furnace yourself

00:28:36.460 --> 00:28:42.460
 Well, might I suggest Mr. Peckinport if you do take care of it, I wouldn't shake it until spring.

00:28:42.460 --> 00:28:59.460
