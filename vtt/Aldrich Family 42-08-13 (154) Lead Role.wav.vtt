00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.300
 [Music]

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.200
 And now the Jell-O family presents...

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.760
 Henry Henry Oldrich!

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:16.860
 Coming, mother!

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:22.200
 [Applause]

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:27.200
 Yes, it's the Oldrich family based on characters originated by Clifford Goldsmith

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:32.200
 and starring Ezra Stone and Henry, the Jackie Celka's home.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.200
 And yes, it's the Jell-O family with its three famous desserts.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.200
 Jell-O in those six delicious flavors,

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.200
 regular Jell-O puddings, with that old fashioned homemade flavor,

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:49.200
 and Jell-O tapioca puddings, a miracle of goodness, a marvel of speed.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:55.200
 Oh, the big red letters stand for the Jell-O family.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.200
 ♪ All the big red letters stand for the Jallow Family ♪

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:04.200
 ♪ And yell, "Yum, yum, yum, Jallow, yum, yum, Jallow, yum, yum!" ♪

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.200
 ♪ The Jallow Family ♪

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.200
 ♪ Yes, Ernie! ♪

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.200
 And now for the Aldridge Family.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:23.200
 ♪♪

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:28.200
 Every typical teenage boy is a little like a bird.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:35.200
 No man can follow Henry Aldrich very long, for instance, without seeing a reflection of the boy he used to be.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:41.200
 The scene opens in the cafeteria at Central High School. It is right after school.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.200
 G-Homer, do I feel great? I haven't had a soda in two whole weeks.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.200
 You sure am making up for it now?

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:55.200
 Boy, when I think of giving up ice cream just so I wouldn't catch cold in my vocal cords.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.200
 Boy, what a waste of time.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.200
 Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.200
 I beg your pardon?

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.200
 Nothing.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.200
 Only speaking of vocal cords, I'm just keeping mine limbered up.

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.200
 Homer, are you sure you don't want to sew them?

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.200
 No thanks.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.200
 I'm not taking any chances with my voice.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.200
 Me, me, me, me, me.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.560
 Boy am I glad I'm not in the cast. Once the rehearsals for that opera ready start

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:28.000
 you'll be tied down every darn afternoon you poor kid. I don't learn. While I'll be as free as a bird

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:35.740
 I can go skating. I can go on hikes. Gee I can do all kinds of things. All by yourself, him. There's Willy, isn't there?

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:42.040
 Willy. He's in the chorus with me. He is? Along with Toby and Charlie? Sure.

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.040
 Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.040
 Homer. Yeah?

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.040
 All of a sudden I'm kind of bored sitting here.

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:58.040
 Look, what do you say we go upstairs and just have a look at the bulletin board?

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.040
 I thought you said you were positive, your name wouldn't be there.

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.040
 Sure I'm positive, it just couldn't be there.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.040
 Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.040
 Homer, are you sure you didn't see my name anywhere on the list?

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.040
 And I told you all I saw was my own name.

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.040
 Gee, that's a relief.

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.040
 I don't know why I ever tried out for the darn thing in the first place.

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.040
 Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me.

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.040
 And besides Homer,

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.040
 besides do you really think Gilbert and Sullivan is any good anymore?

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.040
 Sure, don't you?

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.040
 Especially the Maccato.

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.040
 See, the way they'll have to make you up, nobody will ever recognize you.

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.040
 Not even your own family.

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.040
 Me, me, me, me, me, me.

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:51.040
 Homer, I don't like to be rude, but if all you're going to say from now on is me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me.

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.040
 Frankly, the conversation's bound to get a little dull.

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.040
 Henry, Henry, it's Geraldine Love. I wonder if she's in the camp.

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.040
 Forget it, Homer. There are other people interested in other things other than operatic.

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.600
 Why? Because I drank four chocolate sundies in a row.

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.560
 Henry, I saw your name, you modest thing, you.

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.400
 Who me? You saw his name, where?

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.520
 I'm the bottom part, my goodness.

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:13.640
 What? But I didn't make the operator. It's impossible.

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.280
 You certainly did. Your name's up there. As large as large.

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:17.400
 Why? Sure.

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.640
 There must be some mistake, Gerald. You must have seen Hank Oderdice's name.

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.400
 Henry, where are you going?

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:29.000
 No place exactly. I just thought I'd casually go up and see who is...

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
 Well whose name is like mine?

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:41.220
 But Mr. Cooper...

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.000
 Mildred, how on earth did his name ever get on that list?

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.300
 I'm almost positive you dictated it to...

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:47.860
 Why would I do a thing like that?

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.440
 Henry Aldridge and the leading role of the Macabre?

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:51.100
 I know!

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:55.100
 Mildred, you'll just have to hunt him up immediately and tell him a whole thing was a mistake.

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:57.100
 You mean I have to tell him?

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:58.600
 Mr. Cooper?

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.600
 May I have a word with you please?

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.600
 Oh certainly Mr. Bradley, on your way, Milvie.

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:04.600
 Milvie?

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:09.600
 No Mr. Cooper, my calendar tells me we're nearing a Poretta time again.

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.600
 Yes sir, yes indeed.

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:13.600
 Yes.

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:18.600
 Now there's nothing that takes me happy, Mr. Cooper, then to see you put on your little show once a year.

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:19.600
 Thank you sir.

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:24.600
 And when the time comes I'll buy my ticket and I'll attend the performance as a total stranger. I hope...

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:27.600
 That's fine Mr. Bradley.

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:33.200
 I mean by that, Mr. Cooper, I'd appreciate it if I could be completely excluded from all plans and preparations.

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:34.200
 Oh, certainly, sir.

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:38.000
 And I trust you'll keep the auditorium doors tightly closed during rehearsal.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:38.920
 Oh, yes, sir. Yes, sir.

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:39.520
 Tightly.

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:40.520
 Yes.

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:45.800
 And you'll also do everything in your power to see that the entire school isn't disrupted by your little show.

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:49.160
 I give you my word, Mr. Bradley. Nothing will go wrong this year.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.400
 And let's not borrow quite so much furniture this time.

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:53.300
 Sir?

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:56.000
 We were still returning last year's in June.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.600
 Excuse me, Mr. Cooper.

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.000
 - Henry, how are you? - How are you?

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.560
 - And how are you feeling, Mr. Brad? - Just fine, Henry.

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:05.200
 How are you? - Me, boy.

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:06.800
 I'm on top of the world.

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.320
 - Henry, if you'll step back into the hall,

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:10.600
 Mildred has something to say to you.

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.880
 - She wants to give me my part? - She'll tell you about it.

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:15.960
 - Okay. And thank you for everything, sir.

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:19.000
 - Mr. Cooper, don't you think it'll be more official

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.440
 like you told him? - Mildred, it was your mistake.

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:23.920
 - Upper-resid trouble, Mr. Cooper. So, so...

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:27.160
 It's nothing for you to worry about, Mr. Bradley. I assure you.

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:28.720
 Goodbye, Mildred.

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:30.160
 Oh, dear.

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.920
 Mildred, did you hear the good news about me?

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:34.120
 Listen, Henry.

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:38.920
 Boy, this is the first decent break I've had since the Princess and the Woodcutter.

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:40.920
 Henry, there's something I have to carry me.

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:42.520
 It was in kindergarten, see?

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:45.520
 And I could swing in the axis as well as the next fella.

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:47.520
 But the whole trouble was my hair.

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:48.520
 Henry!

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:50.920
 A little kid with curly hair got the part.

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:52.920
 But I didn't mind.

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:54.600
 see my life was just starting.

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:57.120
 Henry, please listen to me.

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:57.960
 What's the matter, Milgrid?

00:06:57.960 --> 00:06:59.960
 Didn't you get apart in the opera, Ren?

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:02.160
 Because if you didn't, I'd be glad to ask Mr. Cooper

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:03.880
 to give you another chance.

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:06.800
 Henry, you're only making things worse.

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.400
 What's going on here?

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:09.400
 Well, nothing, Mr. Bradley.

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:10.400
 I was just telling you--

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:13.160
 I can't do it, that's all.

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:15.880
 Only one of you said to Milgrid to upset her like that.

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:16.880
 What?

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:17.880
 Nothing.

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:18.640
 Nothing.

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:20.160
 What did you say to her?

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:21.640
 Well, do you all we were talking about

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:23.640
 That was the opera-retta, Mr. Bradley.

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:27.240
 Opera-retta? So it's starting to accept the entire school already.

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:31.640
 Mr. Bradley, I hope you don't feel that getting the leading part is going to my head.

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:34.640
 What's that? The leading part? You?

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:36.640
 You mean you're bold over, too?

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:48.640
 I'm very glad you followed Mr. Cooper.

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:54.020
 considering writing him a letter Mrs. Aldrich, but then it occurred to me that his mother might be the best one to tell him.

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:56.980
 No, I'm sure I won't have any difficulty, Mr. Cooper.

00:07:56.980 --> 00:07:59.520
 I can't tell you how sorry I am the whole thing happened.

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:04.140
 Oh, well, I'm sure Henry doesn't really believe he's playing the lead in your operata.

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:04.940
 He doesn't?

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:08.300
 There's one thing about us Aldrich is we know our failing.

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:09.140
 Yes, but...

00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:12.980
 And just between you and me, Mr. Cooper, Henry can't sing a note.

00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:17.300
 Oh, I wouldn't say that, Mrs. Aldrich. It's just that he can't sing them in the right order.

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:20.300
 I think I hear him coming in now.

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:23.300
 Oh, I'm sure I won't have any trouble.

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:24.300
 Goodbye.

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:28.300
 Then screw eye a thing of reds and hatches.

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:30.300
 About its songs and hello mother.

00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:31.300
 Hello, Henry.

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:33.300
 Three guesses what I'm seeing.

00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:34.300
 I'm outta here.

00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:35.300
 Yes, dear.

00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:36.300
 And guess what else?

00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:38.900
 I'm the play the lead in the operator.

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:39.900
 Yes, dear.

00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:40.900
 Sit down.

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:41.900
 Sit down?

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:43.540
 Gee, I can't take time to sit down for the next month.

00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:45.500
 I've got to get started on my homework.

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:46.500
 Your homework?

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:47.500
 Sure.

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:49.500
 I'm going to get some decent marks so I don't get thrown out of the cast.

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:52.140
 Henry, you can sit down for a minute.

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:54.100
 You and I have to have a little talk.

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:55.100
 We do?

00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:56.100
 Okay.

00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:57.100
 And now then.

00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:58.100
 Mmm, me, me, me, me, me, me.

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:00.700
 Hey, do you think that's nice?

00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:02.500
 You go ahead and talk, mother.

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:09.500
 I'll just be rehearsing in between me me me me me me me me me.

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:19.340
 Henry. Yes Father.

00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:21.300
 Uh. What Father.

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:26.820
 Yeah that is uh your mother wanted me to explain something to you so uh

00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:31.660
 did you enjoy your dinner son. I'll say boy who wouldn't enjoy a dinner like

00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:32.660
 Yes.

00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:36.460
 Why do you suppose mother had all my favorite things tonight?

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:38.620
 Even strawberry shortcake, allum mode.

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:43.100
 Oh, that's because, well, we're all extremely fond of you, son.

00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:44.100
 You are?

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:45.100
 Extremely.

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:46.100
 Gee, thanks.

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:48.100
 Sit down, Henry.

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:49.100
 Sure.

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:51.100
 And anyway, I think I know.

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:52.100
 Know what?

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:55.140
 Why everybody in the family suddenly being so nice to me?

00:09:55.140 --> 00:10:00.140
 Because for the first time in my natural life, you can be proud of me.

00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:04.720
 Henry, some people might be proud to cause their children can play a leading role in an operator, but

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:07.920
 Personally, you know how I judge my children. How?

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:14.400
 By the way, they can take a disappointment. Oh boy. I've certainly taken plenty of them in my time

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:24.600
 Well now and you know father when I used to come home from school year after year and you'd say did you make the football team or

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:26.080
 Are you in the orchestra?

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:27.580
 And I'd say no.

00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:29.520
 - The Henry... - And you used to say to me,

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:32.220
 "Gee whiz, Henry, why let them get you down?"

00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:34.020
 So you didn't make it this year.

00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:36.580
 Okay, keep trying. You'll make it next year.

00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:39.920
 - The Henry... - Well, now I'll let you in on a secret, father.

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:43.520
 Frankly, I always thought you were kind of talking through your hat.

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:46.420
 - Oh, you did? - But now...

00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:49.860
 Boy, now I realize that's all a person has to do.

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:51.160
 Just keep trying.

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:53.700
 And sooner or later, you're bound to get a break.

00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:54.740
 - That's true.

00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:56.160
 But on the other hand...

00:10:56.160 --> 00:11:01.160
 And G-Father, as long as I live, I'll never forget that lesson you taught me.

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:02.660
 Yeah.

00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:05.120
 Uh, would you excuse me a minute?

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:06.120
 Alice!

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:08.120
 Father, what is it you wanted to tell us?

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:10.120
 Alice, where are you?

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:11.120
 Out here in the hall.

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:13.120
 What did you tell him, Sam?

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:14.120
 Well, we...

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:15.120
 We've been discussing it.

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:17.120
 You mean you haven't told us?

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:20.720
 Alice, it isn't just the fact that he thinks he's playing the lead, it's...

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:21.720
 It's what, Sam.

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:24.720
 Look, why can't we phone the school and have someone there tell him?

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:28.720
 There are thoughts you were impatient with me because I was afraid to tell him.

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:31.720
 Alice, I don't think you realize how important this is to the boy.

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:33.720
 Hey, Henry!

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:35.720
 Hello, everybody, isn't it wonderful?

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:36.720
 Well, what's wonderful, Homa?

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:41.720
 She either way Henry's overcome all his handicaps and landed on top of the pile.

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:42.720
 What's that?

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:43.720
 Hey, Hannah, you in the living room?

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:46.720
 Sam, what does he mean by Henry's handicap?

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:48.720
 Hi, Homer, you're just in time.

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:49.720
 I am for why?

00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:53.720
 I'm just going to do a little rehearsing. You can tell me if I hit a bum note here and there.

00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:55.720
 You? A bum note?

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:57.720
 I hit them Homer, I hit them.

00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:04.720
 Oh, don't worry. You're just being modest. Didn't Mr. Cooper pick you for the lead out of the whole school?

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:08.720
 Yeah, and the more I think about it, the more I'm more surprised than anybody.

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:10.720
 Come on, you want me to play the piano for you?

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:11.720
 Sure, here's the music.

00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:13.720
 Okay. Let her rip.

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:14.720
 Mmm.

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:15.720
 Mmm.

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:16.720
 [guitar]

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:17.720
 Now Henry.

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:32.720
 Now Henry, the flowers that bloom in the spring, tah-ah-ah. What happened to the tah-ah? You must have hit a wrong note. I guess so. Well, let's start again.

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:45.720
 The flowers that bloom in the spring. Yes, Father? You come into the dining room for the moment. Sure. Homer, you'll be practicing that part meanwhile. What is it, Father?

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:52.720
 And I've just been having a discussion with about something with your mother, and I wanted your opinion.

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:54.720
 Sure. Is it regarding music?

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:59.720
 Well, not exactly. In a few weeks, Henry, I'm making a trip to Washington, non-business,

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:02.720
 and your mother and I wondered if you wouldn't like to go along.

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:04.720
 To Washington? No!

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:05.720
 Yes.

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:09.720
 See, there's nothing in this world I'd rather do. Boy!

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:14.720
 Of course it would mean resigning from the operator, but after all, a trip to Washington.

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:16.520
 Father, when would you be going?

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:17.520
 What is the operator?

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:18.920
 The week of the 27th.

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:20.220
 That's when we're going.

00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:23.720
 [LAUGHTER]

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:25.520
 You mean I'd have to give up my part?

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:26.720
 I'm afraid so.

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:28.520
 But father, what would Mr. Cooper say?

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:30.520
 Everybody think I was walking out on them.

00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:32.320
 Henry, I'm sure you could explain it to them.

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:34.120
 I couldn't explain it to Geraldine Berry

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:35.520
 while she's playing opposite me.

00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:36.120
 Oh, yes.

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:37.920
 She might even take it personally.

00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:40.520
 What, Henry, you've never been to Washington, DC.

00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:42.520
 It's the capital of your country.

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:43.520
 Sure, Father.

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:45.840
 And I appreciate your offering me the trip.

00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:46.680
 But the headway.

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:48.440
 But duty comes first.

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:50.720
 Come on Homer, let's get back to work.

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:54.080
 Okay, and I think I know where I was making my mistake.

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:55.080
 Let's go.

00:13:55.080 --> 00:14:00.320
 The flowers that bloom in the spring.

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:05.320
 Trola, breathe promise of Mary, sunshine.

00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:08.880
 As we merrily dance and we sing.

00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:11.680
 Trola, hey Homer.

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:12.360
 Yeah?

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:16.360
 You got a little closer that time, but you're still kind of flat.

00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:17.360
 [audience laughter]

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:18.860
 I'm very sorry, him.

00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:19.860
 Oh, that's okay.

00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:22.360
 Some people just don't have any ears for music.

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:23.660
 It isn't there for.

00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:26.360
 She, I could have sworn I was sticking to the music.

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:27.360
 The Henry?

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:28.360
 Yes, mother.

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:31.360
 Dear, have you looked at it this way?

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:32.360
 Look at what?

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:34.360
 There really isn't any money in singing.

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:35.360
 There isn't?

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:37.360
 I'm afraid not, dear.

00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:41.860
 You see, organizations that hire singers usually can't afford to pay very much.

00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:44.860
 Well, I know. For instance, you take our church group.

00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:48.860
 While we'd love to be able to afford a singer, our budget just won't permit it.

00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:53.860
 Gee, whiz, mother, if that's all you're worried about, I'd be glad to sing at your church.

00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:56.860
 And I wouldn't think of charging.

00:14:56.860 --> 00:14:58.860
 Oh, dear.

00:14:58.860 --> 00:14:59.860
 Sam!

00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:21.860
 Henry isn't the only one who's anxious to say it.

00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:27.860
 Here are a few notes from Meredith Wilson and his talking people.

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:29.380
 Intermission!

00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:31.020
 Intermission!

00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:33.660
 Jello is the grandest dessert in the world.

00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:35.300
 And now back to the office.

00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:37.020
 Hey, wait just a minute here.

00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:40.900
 How can you interrupt the office family in such a crucial situation?

00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:45.220
 Well, you can always interrupt with anything as tempting as Jello's six delicious flavors.

00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:47.220
 Starting with strawberry, we we we we

00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:49.220
 Raspberry, we we we

00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:51.220
 Orange, lemon, you

00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:58.220
 And every one of those rich fruit-like flavors reminds you of the real right fruit itself.

00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:03.220
 Flavor that's locked right into Jell-O locked in so that it can't possibly get out until your first

00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:04.220
 Electible spoonful.

00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:05.220
 That's fine.

00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:06.220
 You can listen over.

00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:09.220
 Curtain, curtain, curtain going on.

00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:10.220
 Hey, hold it there.

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:11.220
 Intermission is not over.

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:15.220
 I haven't even begun to tell the people half of the wonderful things about Jell-O.

00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:21.220
 All the variety of salads and desserts that you can make so easily with any one of Jell-O six delicious flavors.

00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:23.220
 Take, for instance, strawberry.

 And now, back to the Aldrich family.

00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:49.580
 Yes, getting back to the troubles of Henry Olives. You know, mistake, Henry has got me

00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:54.180
 impression that he has to play the lead in the school's production of the Maccada.

00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:59.580
 The task of informing Henry of the error has been passed from one to the other with

00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:05.260
 the result that no one has told him. The scene opens in Geraldine Love's house. It is the

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:06.260
 next day.

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:09.660
 Mother, he's so unreasonable about the whole thing.

00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:11.060
 Who's unreasonable, Geraldine?

00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:14.060
 Charlie Clark, mother, haven't you been listening?

00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:15.060
 Well, you just--

00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:17.060
 But he didn't get the leading part in the operator.

00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:18.660
 And Henry Aldrich did.

00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:21.660
 He says he has a far better voice than all Henry got the part on.

00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:22.460
 Was his good luck?

00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:23.460
 He got it on walk.

00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:25.760
 His good luck, mother, is good luck.

00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:28.060
 Haven't you noticed Henry in the right light recently?

00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:29.660
 No, I can't bear him.

00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:31.860
 Well, anyhow, Charlie Clark's son,

00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:34.060
 Maddie, says he's through with the dramatic society,

00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:35.660
 the debating society, and the promotional

00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:39.380
 international goodwill society and that he says he's going to leave school who

00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:45.380
 is Charlie Clark mother my goodness haven't you been listening

00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:57.660
 come right in please thank you see professor Everett I guess you hardly

00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:02.700
 remember me huh Henry Aldrich you said yes I used to take piano lessons from

00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:03.700
 You did?

00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:05.700
 Sure, for two years.

00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:08.700
 And then you had to go away on a long vacation.

00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:10.700
 Yes, I remember now.

00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:12.700
 I'll never forget it.

00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:14.700
 Well, how nice of you to drop in, Henry.

00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:15.700
 Thank you.

00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:17.700
 Uh, social call, I hope?

00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:19.700
 Uh, not exactly.

00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:23.700
 You see, up until recently, I didn't have any voice to speak of.

00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:26.700
 But all of a sudden, it seems to have turned into something.

00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:27.700
 Is that so?

00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:34.700
 And while I'm not sure I ought to take on more studies, I just be interested in learning what you charge.

00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:35.700
 For singing lessons?

00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:36.700
 Yes, sir.

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:43.700
 And since my folks have poured so much money into you in the past, I thought I'd try to swing this myself.

00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:44.700
 I see.

00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:47.700
 Well, suppose you sing something for me.

00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:51.700
 Sure. Do you happen to be familiar enough with Tit-Willow to accompany me?

00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:52.700
 I'll do my best.

00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:53.700
 Okay.

00:18:53.700 --> 00:19:13.700
 Mmm, me, me, me, me, me, me, me. Mmm. On a tree by a river, a little Tom Jett sang, "Well, oh, Jett, well, oh, Jett, well, oh."

00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:20.700
 And I said to him, Dicky Bird, why do you sit singing "Willow"?

00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:24.700
 "Hit, Willow"? "Hit, Willow"?

00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:27.700
 Is it weakness of it?

00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:28.700
 Huh?

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:29.700
 That's fine, have you?

00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:31.700
 But I learned all three verses.

00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:35.700
 Yes, but frankly, Henry, I'm inclined to agree with you.

00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:36.700
 About my voice?

00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:40.700
 No. You really shouldn't take on any more study.

00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:53.880
 [Music]

00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:56.740
 Will the orchestra please come to order?

00:19:56.740 --> 00:19:58.200
 Thank you.

00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:01.780
 Toby Smith, did you hit George over the head with your violin?

00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:03.520
 No, sir, he just stood up.

00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:06.460
 Order! Order, order.

00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:08.380
 Now, I just want to say one thing.

00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:11.080
 We start rehearsals with a cast in two more days,

00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:13.980
 and they're going to need some recognizable music.

00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:16.880
 So let's go through a wandering minstrel once again.

00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:19.480
 And please don't play anything you haven't got.

00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:21.580
 There's enough missing already.

00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:24.380
 A one, two, three.

00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:27.380
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:39.380
 [Music]

00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:41.380
 Oh Mr. Cooper!

00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:45.380
 Stop the music! Stop the music!

00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:48.380
 Mr. Bradley, you mean the auditorium doors weren't closed?

00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:51.380
 They were, Mr. Cooper, but may I have a word with you out here in the hall?

00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:56.380
 Well, I certainly, certainly, Mr. Bradley, certainly. Will the orchestra please stay put?

00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:58.380
 After you, Mr. Cooper.

00:20:58.380 --> 00:21:00.380
 Oh, no, no, sir. After you, Mr. Babbis, sir.

00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:06.380
 First of all, I've just had a very interesting telephone conversation with Mrs. Aldrich.

00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:07.380
 - Henry's mother? - Yes.

00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:11.380
 It seems that Henry still thinks he's going to play the lead in your opera.

00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:14.380
 Oh, no, Mr. Babbis, I phoned his mother yesterday myself. She told him.

00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:17.380
 But the fact remains, she hasn't told him, nor has anyone else told him.

00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:18.380
 Why not?

00:21:18.380 --> 00:21:23.380
 She says that isn't the question. She wants to know why you allowed Henry to believe he was playing the lead in the first place.

00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:25.380
 - Oh, may I explain that? - When I have finished...

00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:31.980
 I have here a petition signed by some 30 students headed by the name of Charlie

00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:36.180
 Clark stating that unless Charlie is given the leading role they will drop out

00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:40.780
 of all school activities including the drive to raise funds for new trades in

00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:47.340
 the cafeteria. And now Mr. Bradley in the ISL. When I have finished I also have a

00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:50.900
 letter here from the mother of a student named no good Carter you know her

00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:54.140
 call as she's the girl who posted Henry's name on the bulletin board. The child is

00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:56.740
 in bed as the result of a nervous collapse.

00:21:56.740 --> 00:21:57.540
 Well, I-- I--

00:21:57.540 --> 00:22:00.860
 Once more, Mr. Cooper, you are putting on an operator.

00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:04.060
 And once more, the operator is upsetting the entire school.

00:22:04.060 --> 00:22:05.060
 Very well, Mr. Bradley.

00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:06.900
 I'll tell Henry myself that he is not

00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:08.020
 playing the lead in the macabre.

00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:09.740
 About that, Mr. Cooper.

00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:13.540
 I have here a report from no less than six of Henry's teachers

00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:15.940
 who say that overnight he's showing more industry

00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:18.540
 and application than anyone else in his classes.

00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:19.420
 Who, Henry Orbex?

00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:21.500
 The boy has apparently taken a new lease on life.

00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:22.580
 Why, that's a sound.

00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:26.580
 And in view of the fact that Scholastic Standing is always a fine important.

00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:27.220
 Yes, sir.

00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:31.280
 How can you now take Henry Aldrich out of the leading part in your operator?

00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:32.740
 But...

00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:34.380
 But Mr. Bradley, what am I going to do?

00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:40.380
 The question is, Mr. Cooper, what am I going to do now that your little operator has turned the entire school upside down?

00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:54.300
 Sam, I don't see how you can possibly go through with it.

00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:59.060
 Alice, I just attended a two-hour meeting of the entire high school faculty.

00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:00.620
 The entire faculty?

00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:02.300
 And this is what was decided.

00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:04.620
 And there is nothing to do now but let Henry know.

00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:05.940
 I wouldn't have the courage.

00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:08.780
 Tardis, you're not. It's my fault things have gone as far as they have.

00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:09.540
 Henry!

00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:10.500
 Yes, Father!

00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:12.260
 Will you step into the living room, please?

00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:16.380
 Sam, I've known people who were scarred for life because of a thing like this.

00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:18.740
 Were you calling my father?

00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:20.180
 Yes, Henry.

00:23:20.180 --> 00:23:22.380
 Uh, Alex, I think you better leave.

00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:23.880
 I think so too.

00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:27.580
 Henry, I'll be out in the kitchen making you a chocolate cake.

00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:30.180
 Father, is there something wrong with mother?

00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:31.180
 No, Henry.

00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:32.380
 Just sit down.

00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:33.380
 Okay.

00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:37.380
 Henry, can you take some bad news?

00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:38.380
 Yes, sir.

00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:40.380
 It's about the author letter.

00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:44.780
 You mean because you're going to Washington, you won't be able to hear me sing?

00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:49.780
 Henry, I'm going to let you have it straight from the shoulder.

00:23:49.780 --> 00:24:17.140

 Oh you are all good, you are all good.

 You're good, my Jeremy, it's over.

00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:31.140
 Oh Henry, you were wonderful, simply wonderful.

00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:34.140
 What was it for this, Geraldine? You were pretty swell yourself.

00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:36.140
 What, I'm like, I really?

00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:38.140
 Was that a swell show?

00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:39.140
 Thanks, our energy.

00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:41.140
 You were swell too.

00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:42.140
 Oh, you were good, you were good.

00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:44.140
 You guys look who's coming next day.

00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:45.140
 That's right.

00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:46.140
 Hey, Ray.

00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:47.140
 Come on Alice.

00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:51.540
 Henry, we just heard someone say this was the best operator the school has ever put on.

00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:52.540
 You did, Mother.

00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:54.140
 And Gee, it wasn't that good.

00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:56.340
 It certainly was, Son, and we're proud of it.

00:24:56.340 --> 00:24:58.940
 Well, thanks, and listen, I have a couple of things to take care of.

00:24:58.940 --> 00:25:00.340
 I'll be right back.

00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:02.540
 Alice, let's work our way over there.

00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:03.540
 What a point.

00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:04.540
 I'm going to do it.

00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:06.540
 Look at the way he's crushing around.

00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:07.540
 No!

00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:10.540
 I never thought it would be right about it.

00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:13.740
 Alice, when you get down to it, isn't you, it's amazing.

00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:14.740
 It certainly is.

00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:20.680
 And to think I dreaded telling Henry that instead of playing the lead he was to the head stage manager

00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:27.760
 The best stage manager central high ever hey, yeah nobody but a boy could take it on the chin like that and bounce right back again

00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:31.180
 Henry, what are you doing with that suitcase?

00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:35.800
 She was a whole pack what time does our train leave my train for Washington for watching

00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:39.600
 What sure father isn't it the night you said you were taking me

00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:45.500
 - Alle, Sam. - Henry, your mother has something to tell you.

00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:47.500
 - Sam, how did you come back here?

00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:49.500
 - Oh, you mean?

00:25:49.500 --> 00:26:05.500
 - Boy, Geraldine, you were swelling tonight's operation.

00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:08.500
 - Oh, thanks, Henry. You were a wonderful business manager, too.

00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:13.260
 You know, you could make singing your whole future career.

00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:15.460
 Oh no, I've got another career.

00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:16.460
 I'll kick down.

00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:17.460
 You have?

00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:18.460
 My goodness, yes.

00:26:18.460 --> 00:26:20.460
 I want to marry a famous businessman.

00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:23.460
 Don't you mean a business manager?

00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:30.140

 All things rich with that famous, locked-in goodness.

00:26:43.540 --> 00:26:47.020
 Tomorrow, try Jell-O Peach and Banana Mole.

00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:50.300
 Just prepare one package of lime, Jell-O as usual.

00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:53.900
 Then pour your Jell-O over one half cup of drained can,

00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:56.980
 sliced cling peaches, arranged in a mole.

00:26:56.980 --> 00:26:59.900
 Add one sliced banana and chill until firm.

00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:01.860
 It's a quick and easy dessert to make,

00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:04.860
 and it's so gay to look at, so tempting to eat.

 Let's do something about it.

00:27:38.180 --> 00:27:44.180
 Send a donation to your local Heart Association campaign, or to the American Heart Association,
