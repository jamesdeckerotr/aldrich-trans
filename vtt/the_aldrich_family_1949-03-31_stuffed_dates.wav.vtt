00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.840
 [Music]

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.700
 And now the Jell-O family presents...

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.360
 Henry Henry O'Brien!

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.560
 Coming, mother!

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.280
 [Applause]

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:27.520
 Yes, it's the O'Brien family based on characters originated by Clifford Goldsmiths

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:32.380
 and starring Ezra Stone as Henry with Jackie Kelt as Homer.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.220
 Brought to you by the Jell-O family.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.220
 Yes, the Jell-O family.

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:42.320
 Oh, the Big Red Letter stand for the Jell-O family.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.220
 Oh, the Big Red Letter stand for the Jell-O family.

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:47.520
 That's Jell-O.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.120
 Yum, yum, yum.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.120
 Jell-O puddings.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.120
 Yum, yum, yum.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.120
 Jell-O tack.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.420
 Be oke, puddings.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.920
 Yes, hooray.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.920
 And now for the Aldrich family.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:14.920
 The most exciting thing about 117 Elm Street

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.920
 is the fact that a typical teenage boy lives there.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.920
 And when the boy is Henry Aldrich,

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.920
 he does many more things than just live there.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.920
 The scene opens in the oldridge front hall. It is early morning.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.920
 Well, good morning, Father Old Timer.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.920
 I beg your pardon, Henry.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.920
 I said good morning, Father Old Timer. Is there anything I can do for you?

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:36.920
 For me?

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:37.920
 Yes, sir.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.920
 Henry, what is it you're after?

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.920
 I'm not after anything, Father. I'm just being cheerful.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.920
 Before I've had my coffee?

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.920
 I was looking for my left sock under the bed this morning, see? And what do you suppose I've found?

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:51.920
 Your right sock.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:57.920
 No, my New Year's resolutions. They must have fallen under there when I was wrapping my Christmas presents.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.920
 And you know what was right on top of the list?

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:01.920
 Always be cheerful.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.920
 Gee whiz, how did you know?

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:04.920
 I'm psychic.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.920
 Sure. And right after that comes always be helpful. So is there anything I can do for you?

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.920
 You can let me go in and have my breakfast. I'd like to finish putting up my rose arbor this morning.

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.920
 Gee whiz father, why not let me do it?

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.920
 I prefer to do it myself, thank you. Now let's go into the dining room.

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:19.920
 Good morning, Sam.

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:20.920
 Good morning.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.200
 - Great, aren't you?

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.040
 - Thank you, Alice.

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.520
 - Mother, is there anything you'd like me to do for you?

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.560
 - Yes, dear, you can drink your juice.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.120
 - That's all?

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.480
 Well, gee, where's Mary?

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:31.520
 - In the living room.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:32.360
 - She is?

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.720
 Would you excuse me while I go in

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.760
 and give her a cheerful good morning?

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.600
 - Dear, if I were you, I wouldn't.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.440
 - But mother, I haven't seen good old Mary

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.440
 since the last night.

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.160
 - Sam, let's come over, Henry.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.240
 - It's nothing, Alice.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:45.240
 - Nothing.

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.240
 Dear, do you realize he got up this morning

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:50.240
 and put coal in the furnace without being told?

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.140
 You don't suppose he's coming down with something.

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.380
 Nothing that won't wear off in 24 hours.

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:55.480
 Mother!

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:56.780
 Mary, what did I say?

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.940
 Henry, if you don't leave me alone, I'm gonna throw a pillow at you.

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:00.540
 Mary!

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.340
 Can't I be miserable and peace?

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:03.740
 Well, she was who's stopping him.

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:05.900
 Mary, do you sit down and have your breakfast?

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.940
 Breakfast, Mother, the way I feel?

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.640
 Henry, what did you say to your sister?

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:10.860
 Another thing, Father.

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.280
 All I did was mention what a nice day it was,

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.980
 cheerfully, as though we weren't even brother and sister.

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.220
 And boys, you went all to pieces.

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:24.220
 Henry, it so happens Mary has had a little disagreement with Kermit, and she's very much upset.

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.720
 Aww.

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.220
 What sort of a disagreement, Alice?

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.220
 Well, it seems Mary waited in front of the movies the other night for more than an hour,

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:31.720
 and Kermit never showed up.

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:32.720
 You don't say.

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.720
 Now, Mary will even talk to him.

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:35.720
 Poor old Kermit.

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.720
 I always kind of liked him.

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.220
 Henry, he hasn't passed away.

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.220
 [audience laughter]

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:43.720
 Well, sure, Father, sure.

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.220
 Mother, you can tell Mary to stop worrying.

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.220
 Things are always darkest before the dawn.

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.220
 I've got an idea, excuse me.

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.220
 Henry, you're not to go near your sister.

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.220
 Sam, what are you supposed to do about Mary?

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:58.220
 She's just miserable.

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:01.220
 Misalable? I thought she went dancing with Joe Graham last night.

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:05.220
 Yes, dear, and that's a very good example of how heartbroken she is.

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.220
 Alice, that doesn't mean a thing.

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:08.220
 It does.

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.220
 You remember that spat? We had that Fourth of July just before we were married.

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:16.620
 I dated Beaches Kilroy three nights in a row just to get even.

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.420
 Sam Aldrich, you told me you just sat in your room and read Keats and Shelley.

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:23.420
 I did?

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:25.420
 Pass the cream, please.

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:29.020
 You can reach it and excuse me.

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:30.020
 Where are you going?

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.220
 To bring Mary some orange juice and try to cheer her up.

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.220
 Peaches Kilroy indeed.

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:36.220
 Mary!

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.220
 I'm just going upstairs.

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.620
 Dear, I'm glad to see you eating that roll.

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.820
 I'm just keeping body and sewn together.

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:45.920
 That's very wise and how about a soft boy of egg?

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:47.320
 On top of my waffles?

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:48.420
 Miri!

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:50.620
 I'll make you a cup of hot cocoa.

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.620
 Miri, you're lying on the phone!

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:53.920
 I am by who?

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:56.420
 Why, I'm not sure, but the voice sounded very familiar.

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.920
 Here.

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:58.920
 My goodness, I didn't even hear it ring!

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:59.420
 Hello!

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:00.420
 Hello?

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:01.420
 Who...

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:02.420
 Who is this?

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:03.420
 Me, Kermit.

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:03.920
 What?

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.120
 Kermit, Henry said you wanted to talk to me.

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.120
 Well, look!

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.620
 Oh, look!

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:08.620
 Henry, you're old rich!

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:10.220
 Mary, what do you hang up for?

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.620
 In the future, I'll thank you to mind your own business.

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:16.120
 Well, how can I marry without breaking my new year's resolution?

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.620
 Main Henry, where am I?

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:21.120
 I'm in here, Normard.

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.120
 Wait, can we give a scene such a terrible morning?

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.620
 Whose role is this?

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:26.120
 What?

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:27.120
 Whose role is this?

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.120
 Oh, you can have it.

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:29.120
 Thanks.

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.620
 I've never met a more unreasonable woman than Agri-Slawson.

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:34.120
 You have any butter on you?

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:34.620
 No.

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:35.120
 Oh.

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:39.460
 Something's happened between you and I also

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:45.700
 She won't well gee whiz sit down and tell me all about it

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:50.780
 It's nothing to tell just because she saw me having a soda with Geraldine love she flies off the handle

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:56.740
 Oh, and I explained that Geraldine just happened to be sitting on the next two and she didn't believe you know

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:59.980
 She insists she saw us drinking out of the same glass

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:05.860
 Were you Henry Geraldine politely asked me to see if her soda wasn't too sweet?

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:10.860
 Gee, Lushin' over, my folks have been trying to get me to be a gentleman.

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:12.860
 Homer, don't worry about a thing.

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:15.860
 Just as soon as I see who's at the door, I'm gonna start helping you out.

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:17.860
 Helping me out of what?

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:20.860
 The puppies from very old rich from the candy kitchen.

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:21.860
 No kidding.

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:26.860
 Well, that's certainly very thoughtful of you to deliver this just at this time.

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:27.860
 What's that?

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:28.860
 I'm thanking you.

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:29.860
 Oh, well.

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:30.860
 You're welcome.

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:31.860
 So long.

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:34.860
 So long to you too, and I hope someday somebody does as much for you.

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:37.260
 I'm sending Mary presents Henry.

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.660
 Homer, this is all a part of something you don't know about.

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:40.660
 Mary!

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:42.660
 Henry, please, don't come near me.

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:44.560
 But Kermit sent you a present!

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:46.560
 It looks like a box of stuffed dates!

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:48.060
 It's fine, that's wonderful!

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:51.060
 You can throw them in the trash can for all I care!

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:53.060
 Throw them in the trash can?

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:55.060
 When Homer's here?

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:56.060
 [Laughter]

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:59.060
 Here at Homer all the time, her have won.

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:01.260
 No thanks, I don't like stuffed dates.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.260
 But she was your hurt Kermit's feelings.

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:06.640
 Why should I make myself sick so Kermit's feelings will be hurt?

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:07.740
 You'll eat them.

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:09.180
 When I feel so good?

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:11.820
 Look, Homer, how would you like to be hell?

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:12.820
 Well...

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:13.820
 Or...

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:16.820
 Are you gonna be just like Mary and say I'm just buddy-

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:18.380
 Kim, you let go of me!

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:20.780
 Boys, you're not fighting, are you?

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:22.260
 Fighting Mother Gee was no.

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.900
 I'm just offering Homer a helping hand.

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:27.380
 And so far he has a very nice attitude about it.

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:28.380
 Well, that's fine.

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:29.380
 Mary!

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:30.380
 Yes, Mother!

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:31.820
 I'd like to see you for a moment.

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:36.060
 Listen Homer, the first thing you've got to realize is it's always darkest before the

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:39.100
 Henry, what's the weather got to do with me and Egg?

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:42.660
 Mother, it's about that box of stuffed dates. I'm not interested.

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:45.460
 Mary, did you hang up on Kermit a while ago?

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:47.060
 Yes, Mother, I certainly did.

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:51.260
 Well, there I'm ashamed of you. He just called back and you know what he told me.

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.900
 I'm not even interested. What?

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:58.180
 He wasn't supposed to meet you in front of the movies at all.

00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:02.020
 He wasn't. No, you were demeated the library under the gargoyle.

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:04.180
 Oh my goodness, the gargoyle, that's right.

00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:06.180
 Mother, he'll never speak to me again.

00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:08.980
 Yes, he will. There he's on his way up here.

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:10.580
 Now? Mother, he can't be.

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:11.380
 But Mary!

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:12.980
 Look at my hair, I'm not even dressed.

00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:14.180
 Now Mary just calmed down.

00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:16.580
 And the dates, Mother. What did Henry do with the dates?

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:17.780
 Fear I don't know.

00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:20.180
 Mother, I couldn't face Kermit without his stuffed eggs.

00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:31.180
 [music]

00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:33.180
 Well, here we are, Homer.

00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:34.180
 I don't think it'll work.

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:35.180
 Sure it will.

00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:37.180
 Once you hand-agnes these stuffed dates,

00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:39.180
 you'll forget all about Geraldine.

00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:40.180
 Now, smile.

00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:41.180
 What's for?

00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:42.180
 She was home.

00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:45.180
 Don't you know everyone likes a cheerful person?

00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:46.180
 Smile.

00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:48.180
 Okay, there.

00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:49.180
 More.

00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:51.180
 How's that?

00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:53.500
 Forget it Homer

00:08:53.500 --> 00:09:00.740
 Just fix your bowtie and let's go in look can me maybe we ought to think about this for a minute about what suppose the dates don't work

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:05.740
 I mean whenever Agnes loses her tempo. She forgets. She's well bred look Homer

00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:11.100
 There's only one way to face life, and that's to face it. I'd rather face life than Agnes

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:16.620
 Can't you at least do this can't you go in and see if she's in the good mood?

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:21.100
 Well, all right well, and I'll be hiding behind this book. Okay

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:25.940
 When you see me pull down the living room shade it means everything's okay

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:30.980
 Then you walk in smiling as if you were a very careful person sure

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:34.020
 Yeah, yeah

00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:37.940
 Left foot what for?

00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:42.700
 Agnesol was steps on it then pretends it was an accident. Oh my duck. I hear someone

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:46.220
 Well, gee whiz hi Ag

00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:47.220
 Hi!

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:48.220
 Hi!

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:49.220
 What do you want?

00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:50.220
 Just playing a friendly call?

00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:51.220
 Yeah?

00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:52.220
 Hi!

00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:53.220
 Is anyone with you?

00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:54.220
 What anyone?

00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:57.220
 You know what anyone, you know what anyone is with you?

00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:59.220
 Well, do you want to see anyone?

00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:01.220
 No, come on in.

00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:03.220
 Well, what's up, kid?

00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:04.220
 Agnes.

00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:07.220
 Agnes, have you ever looked at it this way?

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:10.220
 Things are always darkest before the dawn.

00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:11.220
 What?

00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:14.220
 I mean, on the outside it may look bad, but from the inside,

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:16.420
 Dizzy was from the inside, everything looks different.

00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:18.060
 The inside of what?

00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:19.060
 Homer.

00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:20.140
 Homer!

00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:22.260
 Don't ever mention that chazanovia.

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:22.700
 What?

00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:25.100
 Chazanovia chazanovia!

00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:27.780
 Imagine making sodas out of the same glass.

00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:30.980
 Doesn't he know that's a perfect way to get germs?

00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:33.420
 Anna's Geraldine doesn't mean a thing to Homer.

00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:34.780
 Sure, sure.

00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:39.020
 Honest, if she did, wouldn't he have sent her this box of candy?

00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:40.300
 Instead of you?

00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:40.860
 Candy?

00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:41.780
 Sure.

00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:42.500
 For me?

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:43.420
 Sure.

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:46.780
 Candy! Oh, boy!

00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:48.180
 You mean you're pleased?

00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:51.620
 Why, how can I ever get me candy in my life? Let me open it.

00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:53.520
 Go ahead, Agnes.

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:55.820
 Oh, and isn't the sun in your eyes?

00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:56.820
 No!

00:10:56.820 --> 00:10:58.820
 Honey, now let me pull down this shade.

00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:00.820
 I'll be darned!

00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:02.020
 Is there something wrong?

00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:04.020
 Dates! These are stuffed dates!

00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:05.020
 Well, sure.

00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:07.020
 Whoever said stuffed dates were candy.

00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:08.020
 Where did he get them?

00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:10.020
 At a clearance sale?

00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:12.020
 Well, I'll answer the door.

00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:13.020
 Never mind, I'm practically there.

00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:14.780
 It's probably the wrong number.

00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:15.980
 I mean the wrong house.

00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:18.620
 Henry, that must be the new kid that moved in next door.

00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:19.120
 No.

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:21.120
 He saw me chaining myself on the back porch

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:23.620
 and I've been expecting him to drop in all day.

00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:25.620
 Agnes, I'm sure that isn't--

00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:26.620
 Henry, step aside.

00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:27.620
 Oh, she's pregnant.

00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:31.020
 Agnes, you realize you stepped on my toe?

00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:32.420
 Well, it's about time.

00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:34.420
 Father, you mean it's just you?

00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:35.420
 I'm afraid it is.

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:36.020
 Oh, boy.

00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:37.220
 I forgot my key.

00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:39.220
 Agnes, let's put it up to your father

00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:41.820
 and see if you're not being unreasonable about Homer.

00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:43.580
 Henry, I've had a very hard day.

00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:44.240
 You have?

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:44.740
 Yes.

00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:49.580
 Well, Mr. Lawson, just remember, things are always darkest before the dawn.

00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:50.080
 What?

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:50.980
 Have a stuffed date?

00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:51.780
 No, thanks.

00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:53.260
 I don't want to spoil my dinner.

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:54.460
 I don't blame you.

00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:57.180
 Although Mrs. Lawson's very fond of dates.

00:11:57.180 --> 00:11:58.220
 Let me have them, Henry.

00:11:58.220 --> 00:11:59.580
 Sure, Mr. Lawson.

00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:02.980
 And would you tell her Homer sent them over for the entire family

00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:04.220
 to enjoy?

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:05.420
 Including Agnes.

00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:07.420
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:14.420
 Mother, did you call Charlie Clark?

00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:15.420
 Yes.

00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:16.420
 And Willie Marshall?

00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:17.420
 Yes, dear.

00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:18.420
 Goodness Henry must be somewhere.

00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:21.420
 I suppose I start calling the girls Henry no.

00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:23.420
 Mother, that'll take all day and Kermit's do any minute.

00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:25.420
 Henry, is that you?

00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:27.420
 No, Mary, it's your father.

00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:31.420
 I've been to every candy shop in town and there isn't another box of stuffed dates to be bought.

00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:32.420
 Mother?

00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:35.420
 The box the candy kitchen sold Kermit was the last one they had.

00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:36.420
 Oh dear.

00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:39.020
 They seem quite relieved and sold it.

00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:40.620
 What am I going to do?

00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:42.420
 An airy thing's not that bad.

00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:45.420
 I love that you don't understand what those stuff dates mean.

00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:48.420
 The very first time Permit took me out we ate some.

00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:50.420
 Can't you see the sentiment that's attached?

00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:53.420
 In that case, there's just one thing we can do.

00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:55.420
 What? Make some stuff dates of our own.

00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:58.420
 An airy opened the cupboard and handed me that box of dried prunes.

00:12:58.420 --> 00:12:59.420
 Prunes?

00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:00.420
 Prunes?

00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:03.420
 When they're stuffed and have sugar on them, Permit will never know the difference.

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:04.260
 - What is he?

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.020
 - He's here, come here, I'll die.

00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:07.460
 - Don't worry, control yourself.

00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:08.660
 Sam, let him in.

00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:09.500
 - I?

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:10.740
 - Yes, dear, and keep him occupied

00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:12.500
 until we've got the prunes all stuck.

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:14.460
 - What Alice, my rose arbor.

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:15.620
 - Sam, what's more important?

00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:17.300
 Your arbor, your daughter?

00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:20.020
 - All right, Alice, I'll keep him occupied, but hurry.

00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:21.600
 - Tell him she's dressing.

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:23.860
 Now let me see what can be used for stuffing.

00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:24.700
 - Mother.

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:26.100
 - Oh, I know peanut butter.

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:28.300
 - Mother, I beg of you, don't embarrass me.

00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:30.860
 - Mary, calm down and start stuffing.

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:41.860
 [Music]

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:45.860
 Agnes, won't you be reasonable and say you'll forgive Homer?

00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:46.860
 You want a direct answer?

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:47.860
 Yeah.

00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:48.860
 No.

00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:54.860
 Okay Agnes, okay. But just remember, you're taking full responsibility for whatever happens to poor old Homer.

00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:56.860
 What's going to happen to him?

00:13:56.860 --> 00:13:57.860
 Who knows?

00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:00.420
 JP's in pretty soon, he won't be able to sleep.

00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:00.920
 Yeah?

00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:01.860
 Or eat.

00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:02.860
 Who, Hollner?

00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:04.020
 Sure.

00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:06.020
 They'll start going down in his studies.

00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:07.080
 Further down?

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:08.820
 And it'll all be your fault.

00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:10.020
 Gee.

00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:12.180
 Gee, the poor kid.

00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:13.980
 Why am I a heel?

00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:15.180
 You are.

00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:17.380
 You know that sun shining right in again.

00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:19.380
 Maybe I ought to pull this other shade down.

00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:20.580
 What for?

00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:21.580
 Whoops.

00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:22.940
 [CLAPPING]

00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:24.820
 No reason.

00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:26.300
 Did I just hear the doorbell ring?

00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:27.140
 No.

00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:29.260
 Maybe I want to pull down the shades in the hall.

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:31.520
 Wait, Henry, enough's enough.

00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:33.520
 I thought you were our friend of Homer.

00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:34.640
 Agnes, what do you mean?

00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:36.560
 That's okay, kid. That's okay.

00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:38.520
 But just let's get one thing straight.

00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:40.520
 You can pull those shades down all you like,

00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:42.760
 but it won't do you a bit of good.

00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:43.800
 Well, Agnes, you don't think I'm--

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:45.720
 So pull 'em up, Henry.

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:46.720
 Pull 'em up.

 Oh, boy.

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:56.800
 No wonder you pulled down all the shades.

00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:58.240
 Is that your old being loved out there?

00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:00.400
 Look at her falling all over Homer!

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:03.600
 But Agnes, why don't I lay my hands on that cazenovial?

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:05.680
 She's just tying his bow tie!

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:07.680
 With her head so close together?

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:08.480
 I think.

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:09.680
 Henry!

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:10.880
 Yes Mrs. Lawson?

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:12.560
 You've missed him, every once and a once on the phone!

00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:15.520
 And thanks Mrs. Lawson, Agnes don't do anything rash until I get back.

00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:18.000
 Look, how'd I look? How'd I know she's standing his head?

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.920
 But he's doing it just for you!

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:20.560
 Hello?

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:22.800
 Henry, I've been calling all over town for you.

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:25.280
 We're our comments, dates! He's here already!

00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:26.880
 Kermit? You mean you've made up?

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:28.940
 Oh Henry, stop asking foolish questions.

00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:32.500
 Mother and I have been working for a half an hour and we've only stopped three prunes

00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:34.380
 and we can't get the wrinkles out of those!

00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:37.100
 Mary, what are you talking about?

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:38.920
 Henry, where are my dates?

00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:39.760
 They're here!

00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:41.120
 We'll bring them right home!

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:43.960
 Sure, Mary. They're not doing Homer any good anyway.

00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:44.600
 Goodbye!

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:45.240
 And hurry!

00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:48.500
 Listen, Henry, all which where are you?

00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:49.680
 In here, Homer!

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:52.080
 Why are you trying to fix her up or you are?

00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:53.740
 Homer, what happened to you?

00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:59.600
 What I'd like to know I noticed the shade was down so I started to come in and you know what Agnes did to me

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:03.000
 What hit me with a bag of water from our bedroom window

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:08.900
 Don't worry. I'll straighten you and Agnes out just as soon as I take care of Mary. Mrs. Lawson

00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:12.760
 Where is it raining out in a way?

00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:18.720
 Mrs. Lawson about that box of stuff. Yes, I certainly want to thank you boys for bringing those

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:21.820
 Well, Mrs. Lawson. It's been years since I've baked date bread. Yeah

00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:26.140
 Daybreak yes, I just put it in the oven Henry. What's wrong?

00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:31.520
 Mrs. Lawson now why don't you both stop by later and I'll give you a slice from Mrs. Lawson

00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:35.260
 boy

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:49.620

 I'm now getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldrich.

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:07.240
 Henry arose this morning with a deep resolve to be helpful to his fellow humans, including

00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:08.240
 Homer.

00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:15.240
 Through his earnest efforts, the stuff dates which Mary received as a gift have now wound up in Mrs. Lawson's date bread.

00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:20.240
 The scene opens on the Lawson's back porch. It is later the same afternoon.

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:21.240
 Quiet, Henry.

00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:24.240
 Homer, are you sure there's no one in the Lawson's kitchen?

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:29.240
 Positive. I look through the window. Now, easy while I try the door knob.

00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:35.240
 Homer, I'm pretty sure what we're doing is against the law.

00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:37.240
 Aren't they your date?

00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:40.240
 Sure, but they're in Mrs. Lawson's date, Brad.

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:42.240
 That's just a technicality.

00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:45.240
 Besides, you have to hit me with a bag of water.

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:47.240
 Agnes forfeit it all right to them.

00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:48.240
 Look out.

00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:49.240
 What are you doing?

00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:51.240
 I think I smell something in the oven.

00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:52.240
 Ow!

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:53.240
 Oh, tumor!

00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:55.240
 Boy, is that hot? Is that hot?

00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:56.240
 Tumor, look!

00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:57.240
 There it is, in that pan!

00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:58.240
 Get it out!

00:18:58.240 --> 00:18:59.240
 I am!

00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:00.240
 Tum-ouch!

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:02.240
 Here's a paper bag, put it in.

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:03.240
 Ouch! Ouch!

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:04.240
 Ouch!

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:05.240
 You got it?

00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:07.240
 Sure

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:11.240
 Boy we're close the oven door

00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:18.120
 There I didn't realize you boys were still here

00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:22.400
 Yeah, goodbye missus loss and come on. Oh, oh my dear

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:30.980
 Yes, missus lost. I hope you've forgiven Agnes for throwing that water. She's very impulsive. Yes, ma'am. I found that out

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:35.000
 Lucille!

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:36.500
 I'm in the kitchen, Frank!

00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:39.800
 Lucille? This is the most delicious date, Greg. I've ever eaten.

00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:40.800
 You tasted it?

00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:44.700
 It looks so delicious sitting there on the dining room table. I just couldn't resist it.

00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:46.600
 Thank you, Deb. Please don't take any more.

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:50.700
 I have a wonderful salmon loaf in the oven for dinner and you'll have to drink it.

00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:07.140
 Won't, you know, won't you have another piece of fruit?

00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:09.500
 - Crime it. - Uh huh.

00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:12.700
 - Fruit? - Oh, no, no, thank you, Mr. Aldrich.

00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:16.700
 I've already had two pairs, an apple, and a sizable bunch of grapes.

00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:18.780
 - And a banana. - That's right.

00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:21.300
 - I lost track, I guess. - Yes.

00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:22.060
 Yes.

00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:27.740
 - Did you suppose Mary'll be finished dressing soon? - Oh, pretty soon.

00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:31.660
 That's what being married is. - But I'm not married.

00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:34.300
 Oh, of course, what I meant was, well that is...

00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:38.140
 We've been having an awful lot of rain, don't you think?

00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:39.340
 Yes, quite a bit!

00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:40.580
 Yes.

00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:44.220
 You, uh...

00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:47.980
 You might even call it unusually rainy.

00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:49.900
 I guess you could.

00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:51.980
 Good for the farmers though.

00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:52.940
 Now that's true.

00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:57.980
 But you take resort owners, I wouldn't say it was too good for them.

00:20:57.980 --> 00:20:59.420
 No, no.

00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:02.060
 But it's good for taxi drivers.

00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:02.560
 Yes.

00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:05.660
 How is it for lawyers?

00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:09.020
 Why?

00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:10.380
 It's just about to say.

00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:12.620
 Yeah, it's very good for the newspaper business.

00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:14.780
 Oh, people read more papers when it rains?

00:21:14.780 --> 00:21:16.540
 No, they hold them over their heads.

00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:20.460
 That's a trade joke.

00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:22.060
 I see.

00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:24.300
 Mary must be dressed by now.

00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:25.020
 Mary!

00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:26.300
 Yes, Father, did Henry come?

00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:28.060
 Hello, Kermit.

00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:29.260
 Hello, Mary.

00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:30.140
 Where's Henry?

00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:47.140
 He hasn't come. What? Why not sit down and talk to Kermit anyway? Before I get... before I get... I goodness not the fruit bowl is almost empty. I've got to feel it again. But Mary Mary, I've already had two pairs of apple and a sizable bunch of grapes. And a banana. Mary Mary!

00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:54.140
 Listen, Kitty, go away.

00:21:54.140 --> 00:22:01.140
 She was him.

00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:05.140
 Why do you suppose those cats are following us?

00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:07.140
 Oh, I told you.

00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:11.140
 When you're a cheerful person, everybody likes your company.

00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:14.140
 Listen, cats.

00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:18.140
 Listen, V did you catch her, I'll throw this tin can at you.

00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:19.140
 There!

00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:22.140
 Homer, quit fooling around in a hurry.

00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:25.140
 Henry, let's take a look at that date grid.

00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:26.140
 Oh no.

00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:27.140
 She was what's wrong with looking.

00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:33.140
 I know you, Homer. You just innocently look at something, and the next thing you know, there's only half left.

00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:35.140
 And I would marry explain it to Kermit.

00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:37.140
 How's she gonna explain it anyway?

00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:38.140
 What do you mean?

00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:43.140
 Well, if I gave a girl a box of dates and they turned up in date grid, I'd ask a few questions.

00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:44.140
 Why, you're...

00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:48.140
 Well, she can tell them she was so crazy about them she wanted to preserve them.

00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:50.140
 And Greg.

00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:52.140
 Well, she was.

00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:55.140
 I thought I told you cats to be there.

00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:58.140
 Homer, they're not the same cats.

00:22:58.140 --> 00:22:59.140
 Yeah.

00:22:59.140 --> 00:23:03.140
 She was, I never knew cats were so interested in date, Greg.

00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:05.140
 And we hear some more.

00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:06.140
 Hey, get down.

00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:07.140
 Get down.

00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:09.140
 [screaming]

00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:19.260
 Alice, I've discussed the weather about as much as I'm going through.

00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:21.620
 Sam, someone has to keep Kermit diverted?

00:23:21.620 --> 00:23:22.540
 Let Mary do it.

00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:23.340
 Now, Sam.

00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:25.160
 Alice, she's got to learn how to handle Kermit.

00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:27.260
 After all, she's the one who's marrying him, not me.

00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:27.860
 Oh, you're all right.

00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:28.980
 Sam, quiet.

00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:30.060
 Coming, Kermit?

00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:32.460
 Well, I guess I'd better be running along.

00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:33.340
 So soon?

00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:36.780
 And Ms. Lautage, I guess it's pretty obvious Mary's still mad at me.

00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:37.780
 Oh, now Kermit.

00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:41.020
 Do you have any willikers? I stood under the guard oil for nearly two hours.

00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:44.020
 Well, yes, I didn't even have my art supporters on.

00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:45.500
 We're here, Rie!

00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:47.020
 Henry, is that you?

00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:49.020
 Yes, Father, it's mine.

00:23:49.020 --> 00:23:51.460
 Kermit, Mary will be here to speak to you in five minutes.

00:23:51.460 --> 00:23:55.500
 She will? I guarantee it. Alice, take Kermit into the living room and make him comfortable.

00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:58.540
 Yes, Sam, come along. Kermit, I'll fill up the fruit bowl, lady.

00:23:58.540 --> 00:24:03.140
 But Mrs. Olbridge, I've already had two pairs, an apple and a sizable bunch of gurus.

00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:04.500
 Henry, come in here.

00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:07.660
 Father, before you say anything won't you listen to my son?

00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:09.140
 Father, is that Henry?

00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:10.140
 Sure, and Mary.

00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:11.660
 Hey, all that's where we've viewed them.

00:24:11.660 --> 00:24:12.260
 Well, I'll tell you.

00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:12.940
 Never mind.

00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:13.980
 Where are my stuffed dates?

00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:17.700
 Well, first Mr. Lawson used them to patch up Mrs. Lawson.

00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:18.260
 What?

00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:19.020
 Yes, sir.

00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:21.580
 Then she used them to bake date bread.

00:24:21.580 --> 00:24:25.420
 Only somehow it turned into salmon loaves.

00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:25.980
 Henry.

00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:28.180
 Father, I'm just as confused as you long.

00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:30.500
 Father, what am I going to do?

00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:32.260
 Henry, you'll just have to go in and tell Kermit

00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:33.380
 this was all your fault.

00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:35.940
 with Mary think how he'll feel toward me.

00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:37.460
 Think of how he'll feel toward me.

00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:38.500
 I know, but you is.

00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:40.140
 Kermit was going to get me passes

00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:42.380
 for all the baseball games this summer.

00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:45.660
 Henry, just remember things are always darkest

00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:46.580
 before the dog.

00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:47.660
 (audience laughing)

00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:48.660
 What?

00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:51.460
 Henry, if you don't, I'll never speak to you again.

00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:53.260
 Henry, I'm afraid there's no other way up.

00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:54.260
 Yes, Father.

00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:56.780
 But there's one thing I've learned today.

00:24:56.780 --> 00:24:57.620
 Yes.

00:24:57.620 --> 00:25:00.500
 I'll never look under my bed again.

00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:03.460
 - Criminal timer, are you in the living room?

00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:06.020
 - Father, do you think criminal listen to Henry?

00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:08.180
 - As long as he doesn't talk about the weather.

00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:09.660
 - Sam, come quick!

00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:10.500
 - What's wrong?

00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:12.260
 - Not back yard, it's full of cats!

00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:13.580
 (laughing)

00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:14.420
 - What?

00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:15.260
 - That's saying you shouldn't see,

00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:16.940
 but they're doing where I rose, Oliver!

00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:17.780
 - What?

00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:18.980
 Where did they come from?

00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:20.220
 - I'll get the phone!

00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:22.020
 - Hello!

00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:23.500
 - Hello, Mary, this is Joe.

00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:24.340
 - Joe?

00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:25.420
 - Joe Graham.

00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:28.060
 I just called to say what a swell time I had last night.

00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:30.020
 - Oh, well that's fine, Joe.

00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:31.020
 Can I see you tonight?

00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:32.520
 Oh, well, I'll tell you.

00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:34.020
 I don't think so.

00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:35.520
 Something wrong, Mary?

00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:36.520
 Wrong.

00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:38.020
 Didn't you like them or something?

00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:39.020
 Like what?

00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:41.020
 Were those stuffed dates I sent you?

00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:42.020
 They!

00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:43.020
 You said them?

00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:44.020
 Sure.

00:25:44.020 --> 00:25:45.020
 Oh, my goodness.

00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:46.020
 What's wrong?

00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:47.020
 Oh, my goodness.

00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:50.020

 And just remember, you're a lady.

00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:16.020
 It's about that sound love you snitched at our house.

00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:17.020
 Oh boy.

00:26:17.020 --> 00:26:19.020
 And it's just this, homeroal kid.

00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:21.460
 Kid, I'll ask for Givin'!

00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:23.660
 It is, well, Gee, would.

00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:25.900
 Sure, it's the least I can do.

00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:28.700
 On account of if there ever was a dull dish

00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:31.500
 at Sam and Lo, bye!

00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:34.260
 Well, here's something that isn't a dull dish,

00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:35.940
 and that's jello puddings.

00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:39.140
 Yes, jello, chocolate, butter, scotch, and vanilla puddings.

00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:41.900
 Chock full of old-fashioned homemade goodness.

00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:44.300
 Tomorrow, try creamy strawberry pudding,

00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:46.100
 a springtime delight.

00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:48.420
 Just prepare a package of jello vanilla pudding

00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:54.340
 as usual, and chill. Line sherbet glasses with luscious fresh frozen strawberries, and

00:26:54.340 --> 00:26:59.540
 pour your creamy-rich jello vanilla pudding over them. Plenty of excitement in this delicious

00:26:59.540 --> 00:27:04.260
 dessert. All three jello puddings are made with milk and nourishing, and they cook to

00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:10.660
 velvety perfection in just about five minutes. No wonder more people buy jello puddings than

00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:13.260
 any other prepared puddings in the world.
