00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
 Henry Henry, coming mother!

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 [Applause]

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
 Yes, it's the Army family, transcribed, written by Crippa Goldsmith.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 [Music]

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
 Men who work with figures say that the average American family consists of 4.2 persons

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 and that certainly is true of the Aldrich family.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
 For Sam and Alice, Mary and Henry always add up to 4.2.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:54.000
 The extra two tenths contributed by Henry because he's a typical teenage boy plus a little something extra.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 The scene opens in the all-rich hallway. The time is evening.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 Hey Henry, what are you doing?

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 Looking for the phone book Homer.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 Are you folks going to be there tomorrow?

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.000
 Be well Homer.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 At school. You've forgotten Henry the mile was parents' day.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 Oh, we're not so loud. Hey folks are right there in the living room.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 Are they going, Henry?

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 No. Boy am I lucky they've forgotten all about it.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.720
 about it. Well how do you know? Well the notice came two weeks ago and my mother

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.320
 put it on the table. Then about three days later somebody threw it out. I

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.440
 forget who. Boy I sure hope my folks forget. It's the one thing I hate it's

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:33.360
 parents day. Same here. If you go on a piece of tour on that day. Hey. Yes mother.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.240
 Why don't you at home I come into the living room. Well I've got to put in a

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.200
 call mother. Who are you gonna call? I go to a foreign's word. But you told me to

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.480
 get a date for tomorrow night. Well sure, but what do you want to take by all of

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.440
 for? Listen Homer, she's a darn good looking girl.

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:49.420
 Never seen.

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.720
 L273. L273. Yes please.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.840
 Henry, didn't you ask why I was a go to something a week ago? Sure.

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.960
 And she turned you down, didn't she? Homeward or reason. She turned me down

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:59.720
 was because

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.960
 when you please stop reading down my neck.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.400
 Henry, she'll only turn you down again. Why embarrass yourself?

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.920
 Homer, do you hear me? Catch your mother in the room and read the National Geographic.

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.920
 Okay, but don't say I didn't want you.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:13.920
 Hello?

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.920
 Hello? This is Hen.

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:16.920
 Hello?

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:17.920
 Hen, don't you remember?

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:18.920
 Henry.

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:19.920
 Hello.

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:20.920
 Hi, Viola.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:21.920
 Hi.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.920
 Henry who?

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.920
 He was Henry Aldridge.

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.920
 Oh, hello.

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.920
 Are you studying hard for tomorrow?

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:31.920
 You mean for parenting?

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:32.920
 Yes.

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:33.920
 Yes.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.920
 Well, would you like to go to a dance tomorrow night?

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:37.920
 Would you?

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:38.920
 Sure.

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.920
 No thank you.

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:41.920
 Well...

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.420
 You mean you can?

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:44.420
 Yes.

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.420
 Would you like to do anything Saturday night?

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:47.420
 No thank you.

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.420
 I'm going to be busy Saturday night.

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.420
 How about a week from Saturday night?

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.420
 Well I can't very well tell what I'll be doing that for a head.

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:55.420
 Oh.

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.420
 Well I guess I'll see you at school tomorrow.

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:59.420
 You will.

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:00.420
 Bye.

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:01.420
 Bye.

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:02.420
 Bye.

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.420
 Hey Henry, don't bother me Homer.

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.420
 Didn't I tell you you shouldn't ask her?

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.420
 You know what she said to me.

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.420
 Alright, Henry, I wasn't going to tell you because I was afraid that it hurt your feelings,

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:14.420
 but...

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.420
 Well, I happen to know Viola doesn't want to go out with you.

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:18.420
 How do you know that?

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.420
 She told Agnes Lawson.

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:21.420
 She did?

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:22.420
 Sure.

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.420
 You know what she said her folks said?

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:25.420
 What?

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.420
 That you wanted the right kind of company for her, and they didn't want her to be seen with you.

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.420
 Mr. and Mrs. Barnes were and said that about me?

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.420
 Why should you care what they say, Henry?

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.420
 You've got lots worse things to worry about than that.

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:38.420
 What?

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.420
 Well, I'm not sure, but when I was in the living room just now,

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.420
 I think I heard your father say something about coming to school a mile.

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.420
 You couldn't have.

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.420
 All I know had me is what I thought I heard.

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:49.420
 She whiz.

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:50.420
 Where's my coat?

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.420
 Right there on the floor.

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:55.420
 You want me to get a date for you tomorrow night?

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:56.420
 No, I don't.

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:58.420
 Well, so long.

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:59.420
 So long.

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.420
 And Homer, when you see Agnes, will you please tell me to stop spreading stories about Viola?

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:08.060
 What you say against my over you know what you just told me oh

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:17.700
 Father yes, and father could I ask you something what's on your mind? Well house

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.700
 house business

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:27.740
 Quite good. Thank you Henry. Have you done all your studying for this evening? I'm getting my book out right now, mother. I just

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.220
 Father are you gonna be busy tomorrow?

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.920
 My I expect to be where

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:36.500
 What do you mean where well?

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:43.360
 At the office or all around town. I'm going to my office in the morning if that's what you mean you are

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.860
 And we'd be quite busy down there. I hope so

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:52.400
 Well, I'm I'm glad to hear the business is so good and I'm glad you feel that way

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:58.140
 I'm can I get you something no thanks? I'm going upstairs a moment any please get over your homework. I am father

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:03.140
 Mother? Mother? Mother, do you mind if I ask you something?

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:08.140
 It hasn't anything to do with your algebra. She hasn't anything to do with anything.

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:10.140
 You know by all this mother and father.

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:13.140
 Mr. and Mrs. Fonsworth? I know them slightly.

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:18.140
 Oh. Mother, did father say it was going to be busy all day?

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:22.140
 Henry, I thought you were going to study. They am studying my lot. Look, I'm on page 18.

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:25.140
 Well, suppose you keep right on then.

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:30.140
 All nays, artes, qui, ad, humani.

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:33.140
 Do you know what Agnes said somebody said about me?

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:34.140
 What?

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:36.140
 Never mind, nothing.

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:39.140
 But gee, I don't see all our folks congeum to conclusions

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:41.140
 when they don't even know me.

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:43.140
 Who's folks don't even know you?

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:45.140
 Anybody's, anybody's.

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:47.140
 She was, what's so terrible about me?

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:50.140
 Henry, are you translating Latin?

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:53.140
 Who me? Sure.

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:56.140
 Mother, do you think Viola Farnsworth is so good looking?

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:57.140
 What's that?

00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:00.140
 I mean, what ride is Homer, God?

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:04.140
 Homer, dear, is there something in that book that confuses you?

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:06.140
 No, she whiz.

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:11.140
 Mother, would you mind asking Mr. Mrs. Farnsworth over here for dinner some time?

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:14.140
 Dear, we don't even know Mr. and Mrs. Farnsworth.

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:17.140
 That isn't the point, Mother. You're just looking at things backwards.

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:19.140
 Have you ever met the Farnsworth?

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:23.740
 Yes, but only under what you might call unfavorable circumstances.

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:25.940
 So why couldn't you have them over here sometime?

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:27.940
 Let them see what father is really like.

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:28.940
 What is what?

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:30.340
 - Henry getting his work done?

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:31.340
 - What's that father?

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:33.740
 - Henry, I think you'd get a great deal more work done

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:35.940
 if you'd take your book and go up to your room.

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:36.740
 - Now?

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:37.340
 - Now.

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:38.740
 - People on Mother answers my question.

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:39.540
 - Henry?

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:41.540
 - Yes, Father, I'll go.

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:43.140
 - I'll only first...

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:44.740
 Mother, may I ask one thing?

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:46.540
 Well...

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:48.340
 Well, if you should meet me on the street,

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:52.420
 out of a clear sky, see, and you never met me before.

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:54.100
 What would you say?

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:59.860
 Why, I think I'd say, here comes a very fine looking young man.

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:01.420
 You what?

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:03.060
 Well, good night.

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:03.820
 Good night.

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:05.780
 Good night.

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:06.420
 How was it?

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:07.580
 Yes, Sam.

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:09.660
 Why in the world did he ask Sam?

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:13.140
 Now, dear, didn't you ever wonder the same thing about yourself?

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:16.980
 Yes, but I never went around asking people.

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:21.380
 Sam, how would you like to have Mr. and Mrs. Farnsworth over for dinner some evening?

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:22.580
 What on earth for?

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:28.580
 Well, if I read between the lines, Henry wants them to see that his family is at least civilized.

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:30.180
 Oh, what are the Farnsworth's like?

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:32.180
 No, I'd like to know too, dear.

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:34.980
 Why couldn't we at least ask them to join us tomorrow?

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:36.180
 You mean when we go to the school?

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:37.180
 Yes.

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:37.180
 Why?

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:39.380
 Well, they've never been to parents' day.

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:40.980
 Well, give them a ring.

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:45.180
 Only, Alison, you're quite sure we shouldn't tell Henry that we're going to be there.

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:48.680
 Don't you know how nervous Henry got when we went last year?

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:52.180
 I think it would be much nicer just as surprising.

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:55.180
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:07:55.180 --> 00:08:04.180
 I'll bring your bacon in in just a moment.

00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:05.460
 Did you reach the farms where?

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:05.960
 No, there.

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:07.540
 I just tried them again.

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:09.020
 They must be pretty social.

00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:11.420
 Out last night, line busy this morning,

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:12.860
 I guess they're all in our class.

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:14.020
 Will you call Henry, please?

00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:14.860
 Henry!

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:17.200
 - Hey, my grandfather, I'm coming right now.

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:20.060
 Could you sort of tighten this tie for me, please?

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:22.280
 - What are you wearing a bow tie for?

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:23.440
 - Well, I don't know, I just thought

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:25.440
 maybe it would make me look different.

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:26.760
 - From what?

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:27.680
 - Hmm.

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:29.240
 - Please sit down and eat your cereal.

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:30.160
 - Yes, father.

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:31.600
 - And don't spill anything.

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:33.440
 I've never seen you look so neat

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:35.600
 and I'd like to save the memory.

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:38.400
 (audience laughing)

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:40.040
 - Yes, sir.

00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:41.560
 Would you mind asking me some of the questions

00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:42.920
 in this history book while I'm eating?

00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:44.280
 - Yeah, well, this is something

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:49.280
 going to have in school today? Yes, sir. Well, in any way it is. When did the Civil War

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:56.720
 start? April 12, 1861. Did the move to see seed have general acquiescence among the southern

00:08:56.720 --> 00:09:03.200
 states? What's that? Did the move to see seed have general acquiescence among the southern

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:13.640
 states? Acquiescence? Will you pass the cream, please? Here you are. How do you spell that

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:25.160
 words. A-C-Q-U-I-E-S-C-E-N-C-E. Oh, acquiesce, ensure, naturally. What does it mean? Well, that

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:29.720
 was when the war started. Things were sort of mixed up in there. And I suppose you go

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:33.640
 in the living room and look up the word in the dictionary. No? No. Yes, Father.

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:35.640
 Hack we have to say

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:42.580
 They're still busy who the funds were so I just tried to phone them again

00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:47.680
 So you sure we shouldn't tell Henry that we're trying to get them to go down to the high school with this

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:53.460
 Be it why not wait and make it a double surprise your father acquiescence means to accept

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:58.000
 That's fine. It can tuck he didn't do it and Missouri didn't know what to do

00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:00.520
 Henry, anybody wrong?

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:01.520
 She wasn't that you, Homer?

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:02.960
 You know what time it is?

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:04.680
 Oh boy, I've got to go, mother.

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:06.720
 I sure you don't want to be late on--

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:08.760
 on goodbye, mother.

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:10.400
 Take your banana, dear.

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:12.760
 I've got it.

00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:14.720
 Break your tie.

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:16.760
 She was in that crooked again.

00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:18.680
 And thanks very much for all your other help, father.

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:20.200
 Bye.

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:21.840
 Pea Henry, I'm I sick.

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:22.920
 It's a matter, Homer.

00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:25.240
 My darn folks are coming to school.

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:26.600
 Oh boy, that's tough.

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:27.840
 And you know what's going to happen?

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:31.840
 My teachers are all gonna call on me and make a fool of my whole family.

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:35.840
 Boy, I'm sure glad I'm not in your shoes, Homer.

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:46.840
 - Ms. Eggleston. - Ms. Eggleston, yes, darling.

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:49.840
 - I've got a wonderful idea. - Well, what is it, Homer?

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:56.840
 As long as this is parents day, don't you think it'll be a good idea if instead of my coming into English class I act as sort of a nasher?

00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:58.840
 - And ushers? - Sure.

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:00.840
 I'll stand right outside the classroom, see?

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:04.840
 And whenever I see a parent that doesn't look as though he knows where he's going, I'll say,

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:06.840
 "Wouldn't you like to step in your listen to English?"

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:08.840
 That's very thoughtful of your whole mother.

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:11.840
 We're going to need you in the spelling bee.

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:14.840
 [audience laughter]

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:17.840
 - In the spelling bee? - Of course.

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:19.840
 It's better be one of the main features of the day.

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:22.840
 Some of the boys are going to spell against some of the girls.

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:25.840
 I think the parents would enjoy that, don't you?

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:28.240
 The fine minute mine won't.

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:29.440
 You are in it.

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:30.440
 Oh boy.

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:35.440
 I know this sounds like an excuse, but frankly I've got a sore throat.

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:39.440
 Oh man, sorry that I'm busy and I should have to ask you to leave the room.

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:41.440
 Yes, Ms. Eggleston, I'll go.

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:44.240
 But my throat's getting worse every second.

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:45.240
 Hey Homer.

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:46.840
 Tell me your long Henry Wissian.

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:48.840
 How about delivering this note if I own a fine's worth?

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:49.340
 No.

00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:50.340
 Please Homer.

00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:52.640
 Henry, why are you wasting time writing her notes?

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:54.440
 I didn't write it, I didn't write a word of it.

00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:56.000
 I just cut it out of a book.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.000
 Let's say it.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.880
 It's just a little write up Homer.

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:01.960
 Here, it's about my father.

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:02.480
 She was.

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:03.800
 What was that printed in?

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:06.200
 Miss College Yearbook when he graduated.

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:08.240
 He was a big shot in his class.

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:11.360
 Boy, does he look different.

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:12.880
 What did they call it?

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:15.080
 Dapper Sam?

00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:15.580
 Sure.

00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:17.080
 Dapper Sam.

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:18.440
 Hey, read the whole thing.

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:22.080
 Dapper Sam Aldridge, perhaps a bit stuffy at times,

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:25.680
 but generous, brilliant, and most likely to succeed.

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:27.160
 Pretty good, huh?

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:29.360
 What do they mean by stuffy?

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:31.080
 Well, my mother got him over there.

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:34.800
 How about it?

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:36.680
 Would you please give it to Viola?

00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:38.480
 If I will, will you do something for me?

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:39.320
 Sure.

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:40.160
 Okay.

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:41.160
 Go on and tell Ms. Aglison,

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:43.520
 you'd like to take my place in the spelling bee.

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:46.520
 Hold on, wait a minute, Homer, what spelling bee?

00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:47.960
 Just a little spelling bee.

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:50.320
 It's gonna be a lot of fun.

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:51.440
 Fun for who?

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:53.940
 I can't remember. My folks are going to be there and yours aren't.

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:55.940
 Homer, I've got a sore throat.

00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:58.740
 Don't give me that. I thought you said you'd help me if I'd help you.

00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:00.940
 But Homer, you know what my spelling is like.

00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:02.840
 Do you want me to give this note to Viola?

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:04.640
 Well sure, but that's entirely different.

00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:08.240
 Do you? Oh, don't you want it to know your father used to be considered bright.

00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:22.540
 Good morning, students.

00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:23.940
 Good morning, Ms. Farmer.

00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:27.300
 Before we begin our history, I think it would be very nice

00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:29.180
 if we introduced our visitors.

00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:32.220
 Class, this is Homer Brown's mother and father,

00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:33.700
 Mr. Mrs. Brown.

00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:35.900
 Good morning, Mrs. Brown.

00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:39.220
 Now then, who would like to answer the first question?

00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:40.780
 Oh, I wouldn't have.

00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:43.140
 Well, that's fine.

00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:46.460
 But I think we should let Homer have the honor.

00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:48.580
 Homer, will you stand up, please?

00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:50.300
 Yes, Ms. Barkley.

00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:52.300
 Oh, it was my brother.

00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:59.300
 Now Homer, in what year did the civil war begin?

00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:00.800
 Why are you...

00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:02.800
 Well...

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:04.800
 In what year?

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:05.800
 In what year?

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:07.800
 The civil war?

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:10.800
 Was that in today's lesson, Miss Buckley?

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:12.300
 Yes, it was.

00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:13.300
 Oh.

00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:16.300
 Well, I guess I'm not thinking very fast.

00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:17.800
 Now, that's quite all right, Homer.

00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:21.560
 Suppose we let you sit down and give you another chance later on?

00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:22.840
 Yes, Ms. Barker.

00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:26.040
 Henry Aldrich, would you tell us the answer?

00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:27.040
 Who me?

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:30.640
 Well, it was in 1861.

00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:31.640
 That is correct.

00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:32.640
 It would be exact April 12th.

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:33.640
 Thank you, Henry.

00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:34.640
 You may sit down.

00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:35.640
 Yes, Ms. Buckley.

00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:38.560
 Well, I see we have some more visitors.

00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:39.560
 How are you?

00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:40.560
 How are you?

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:41.560
 Hi.

00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:45.480
 Glad you're glad to welcome Mr. Mrs. Aldrich and Mr. Mrs. Parnsworth.

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:46.480
 Good morning.

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:49.480
 I believe that Lady of Chaos right here in front.

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:50.480
 Thank you.

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:52.480
 No, then.

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:56.480
 Supposed me that Viola Farnsworth answered this next question.

00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:57.480
 Yes, Ms. Buckley.

00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:00.480
 What were the basic causes of the Civil War?

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:02.480
 Slavery and economic difference.

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:03.480
 No, that's fine.

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:10.480
 Now the next question, I think we should let Henry Aldrich have the next one in honor of his parents.

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:11.480
 Henry?

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:12.480
 Yes, Ms. Buckley.

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:17.480
 Did the move to secede have general acquiescence among the southern states?

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:23.480
 Well, I'll tell you Miss Fine. I mean my puppy.

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:26.480
 Take your time.

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:29.480
 Well, I guess I'm afraid.

00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:34.480
 Henry, you told me a breakfast Kentucky and Missouri were doubtful states.

00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:39.480
 Oh, yes. I'm sorry, Mr. Audrich, but I'm afraid we'll have to ask our visitors not to give any assistance.

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:40.480
 I beg your pardon.

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:41.480
 Homer?

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:42.920
 Yes, Miss Barkley?

00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:45.560
 That piece of paper that you just died to pass the viola.

00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:49.760
 Does that have anything to do with our civil war history?

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:53.480
 Well, it's from around that time.

00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:56.960
 [Laughter]

00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:58.280
 Yeah, that's fine.

00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:02.480
 I'm quite sure then all of this will be interested in hearing what it has to say.

00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:05.880
 You mean...

00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:07.480
 You mean you want to say this?

00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:09.680
 Will you stand up and read it, please?

00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:11.680
 The only thing is it's...

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:12.680
 Yes.

00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:15.680
 Now, let's forget that we have visitors.

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:18.680
 Just stand up and read it right out.

00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:19.680
 Right out?

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:23.680
 I think we should keep up on everything that anyway pertains to history.

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:25.680
 But it's my former.

00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:26.680
 Yes, ma'am.

00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:28.680
 It says...

00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:35.680
 "Dapper Sam Albridge, perhaps a bit stuff in your eyes, but you're a little bit taller."

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:37.180
 Homer!

00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:38.180
 Sam!

00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:39.180
 Henry!

00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:41.180
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:43.180
 [APPLAUSE]

00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:50.320
 When we turn to the oldest family in just a moment,

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:51.860
 his voice has thrilled millions.

00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:54.900
 His curly locks have been compared to spun gold.

00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:57.420
 His background makes him a man among men.

00:16:57.420 --> 00:16:58.340
 Who is he?

00:16:58.340 --> 00:17:00.060
 None other than Phil Harris.

00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:02.460
 And this evening, why not join Phil and his long-suffering

00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:05.660
 wife, Alice Faye, in another of the crony misadventures?

00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:10.940
 Then for another Theatre Guild on the Air presentation, listen to Madeline Carroll, Burgess Meredith

00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:14.780
 and Melville Cooper in the Broadway hit Hobson's Choice.

00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:19.580
 Each Sunday over most of these same NBC stations, Theatre Guild on the Air brings you stars

00:17:19.580 --> 00:17:21.860
 of Broadway and Hollywood.

00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:58.680
 Now getting back to the troubles of Henry Olmute.

00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:00.720
 Henry, not knowing his mother and father,

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:05.160
 planning to visit his school on parance day as agreed to take part in a spelling

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:10.440
 bee in place of home of brown seen opens in the school corridor a few minutes

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:14.920
 before the contest is scheduled to begin you wait Homer you just wait Henry could

00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:17.920
 I help it if she made me read it if you think I'm gonna go into that spelling

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:21.480
 before you you're crazy but Henry you got you all know I don't know what to

00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:25.240
 tell Miss Eggleston to put you back in listen Henry you gave me your word

00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:30.360
 you're in the spelling bee yes father may I speak with you please you know

00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:34.120
 what you're going to say. So long, Henry. I'm going into the arts and crafts exhibit.

00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:37.080
 I don't believe I've ever been quite so embarrassed in my life.

00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:40.440
 Father, I didn't know Homer was going to read that. The whole thing was out of my control.

00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:46.760
 That isn't what I'm referring to. And what is it? In history class, you're not remembering that it

00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:51.720
 was Kentucky. And father, my mind went blank. Didn't I send you into the living room during

00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:56.280
 breakfast to look up the key word acquiescence? And didn't you come back and tell me the correct

00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:59.960
 answer? Yes, father. Then why did you act as though you didn't have a tongue?

00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:02.960
 Because right at that minute I couldn't have told you my own name.

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:03.960
 Henry!

00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:04.960
 Yes, mother?

00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:06.960
 Where's the autumn craft exhibit?

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:10.960
 She, I don't think you and father would enjoy seeing that, mother.

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:12.960
 Don't you have anything in there?

00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:17.960
 Well, yes, but wouldn't you rather have me take you around the building and show you the gymnasium or something?

00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:20.960
 And what room is the exhibit?

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:22.960
 Well, I don't know the exact room.

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:25.960
 Well, will you please go down the hall and ask someone?

00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:27.960
 Yes, mother, I'll go.

00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:28.960
 Sam?

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:32.260
 I'm not sure, but I don't think I like the Fonzers.

00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:34.660
 Thankfully, I don't like them either.

00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:38.260
 Did you see Mr. Fonzers' face when Henry couldn't answer that question?

00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:39.260
 I saw it.

00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:41.660
 Your mother, the exhibit's right here in room 101.

00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:43.260
 Well, let's go in.

00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:45.060
 I want you all like it.

00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:46.460
 Oh, yes, we will.

00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:49.260
 My goodness, look at all the things.

00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:51.260
 Look at that card table.

00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:53.460
 Henry, did one of the students build that?

00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:54.460
 Yes, sir.

00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:56.460
 But without sort of an advanced chord.

00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:58.460
 Henry, look out, you're backing into someone.

00:19:58.460 --> 00:19:59.860
 Oh, well, she was. Excuse me.

00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:02.260
 That's all right. I hardly felt it.

00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:04.760
 Oh, is that you, Mr. Farnsworth?

00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:05.560
 It is.

00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:08.960
 Henry, your father and I go to walk over and look at the mechanical drawer.

00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:09.660
 All right.

00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:10.460
 Young man.

00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:11.460
 Yes, Mr. Farnsworth?

00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:14.460
 Do you happen to know who built this model airplane?

00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:17.460
 Well, that was built by five or six of the boys.

00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:19.560
 They all sort of got together on it.

00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:20.960
 Were you one of them?

00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:22.260
 No.

00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:23.260
 No, I wasn't.

00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:25.560
 You know, what did you build?

00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:30.060
 Well, I sort of... I built this thing right here.

00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:32.060
 What is it?

00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:35.060
 What is anything? It's just a paperweight.

00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:38.060
 Well, how did you happen to put your time in on a thing like that?

00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:41.060
 Well, it's nothing but a brass ball.

00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:44.060
 Well, I made it out of a square block, see, on a machine.

00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:47.060
 I'd probably be fun to see if I could make it perfectly round.

00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:48.060
 Father!

00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:49.060
 Yes, Viola?

00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:50.060
 Viola, Viola.

00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:53.060
 We were just looking at Henry's paperweight.

00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:56.540
 - Henry, did you make that? - Sure.

00:20:56.540 --> 00:20:58.740
 - Would you like me to show you some of these other things?

00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:01.360
 - Oh no, it's almost time for the spelling bee.

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:03.120
 - The spelling bee?

00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:04.560
 Are you in that tool?

00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:05.740
 - Of course.

00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:08.460
 - Do you mean to say, young man, that you were in it?

00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:11.460
 - Well, in a way I am.

00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:13.260
 - It ought to be quite a contest.

00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:14.260
 - Yes.

00:21:14.260 --> 00:21:17.460
 - I was just looking at this card here by your paperweight.

00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:19.060
 Did you letter this?

00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:20.060
 - Yes, sir.

00:21:20.060 --> 00:21:27.760
 It says "sphere" made by Henry Aldrich, and "sphere" is spelled S-P-E-R-E.

00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:32.560
 - Don't you happen to tell us that way? - Henry, you kill me!

00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:36.060
 Listen, Viola, anybody would think you never made any mistake?

00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:41.860
 - Henry, is that the bell for the spelling bee? - Yes, I think it is, Father.

00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:45.160
 This is something I don't want to miss, Mr. Aldrich.

00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:49.960
 - Your daughter pretty good at spelling? - Well, I'll certainly stake her against any boy.

00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:54.880
 Anytime yes well just to be a good sport I'll take Henry against any girl

00:21:54.880 --> 00:22:01.360
 Father you don't really want to go in there. Do you I'd like to see anyone keep me out? Come on father

00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:07.440
 We're going to be late Sam wait for me. Mother are you coming to? Of course I am well

00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:10.560
 Well look you're gonna use for this paperweight on your desk

00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:15.160
 Henry did you make that sure could you just put it in your pocketbook?

00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:18.720
 Well there I can't very well carry a brass ball like that around

00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:22.080
 Aren't you supposed to leave it here on exhibit?

00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:23.480
 She was no.

00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:25.480
 Don't know why I entered it here in the first place.

00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:26.480

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:26.980

00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:30.980
 Put this paper weight in your pocket and hurry up or we'll be late to the spelling bee.

00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:45.480
 Now then please, the boys will stand on this side of the room and the girls on the other side.

00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:46.980

00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:21.520
 Come on, Henry.

00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:22.360
 Quiet now, please.

00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:23.640
 Let's not confuse you.

00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:24.600
 Acquiescence.

00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:29.600
 That quiescence.

00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:36.600
 A-C-Q-I-E-S-C-E-N-C.

00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:38.600
 Right! The boys win!

00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:42.600
 (cheering)

00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:49.600
 (music playing)

00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:51.600
 Well, son, were you nervous?

00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:57.100
 I was at first father, but all of a sudden I forgot that you were in the room and mother and Mr. Mrs. Farnsworth.

00:26:57.100 --> 00:27:01.100
 And then I remembered breakfast and you sitting there with my book and your boiled egg.

00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:02.100
 And then...

00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:06.600
 An acquiescence came right back into my mind.

00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:10.600
 Then the Farnsworth left words that they were driving on home.

00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:11.100
 Alone?

00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:13.600
 I think they preferred going alone.

00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:15.100
 Well, the feeling is mutual.

00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:17.600
 Hey Henry, you're one of the main office.

00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:18.600
 Oh, gee whiz.

00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:20.100
 Mr. Bradley saw us the dude.

00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:20.600
 What about out?

00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:23.760
 Well, didn't you take that paperweight out of the arts and crafts exhibit?

00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:26.600
 Sure, but it's mine, Homer. That doesn't make any difference.

00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:30.600
 He says you're to take it right straight back and leave it there until you get your award.

00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:32.600
 Are you a war?

00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:35.600
 Well, that's what I'm trying to tell you. You got third prize.

00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:37.600
 Perform in precision.

00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:39.600
 No, kitty.

00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:43.600
 What do you know? And Viola wants an answer to a note she gave me to give to you.

00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:45.600
 Uh, an open Viola?

00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:47.600
 Where is it, Homer? I lost it.

00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:49.600
 You lost it.

00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:56.380
 I remember what she said though, but why did she say dear Henry would you please accept my humble apology?

00:27:56.380 --> 00:27:59.620
 Wilhomer tell her

00:27:59.620 --> 00:28:02.720
 Tell her I acquiesce

00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:17.400
 Under the symbol of the Red Feather more than 17,000 local agencies serve their communities for instance

00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:21.580
 The United Community Campaigns must raise money for all people who need

00:28:21.580 --> 00:28:25.660
 clinic care, nursing service, or a chance to learn a new skill in order to

00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:30.140
 support themselves, and for children to whom family life has been denied, and who

00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:35.460
 need institutional or foster home care. So when you make your October pledge to

00:28:35.460 --> 00:28:39.860
 the Red Feather Campaign, remember that it's a United Community Campaign and

00:28:39.860 --> 00:28:44.060
 pledge something extra this year. Give the United Way.
