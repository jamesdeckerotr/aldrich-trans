00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.560
 The special service to this and presents the redraw cast of...

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:19.320
 Henry Henry Moseley! Come on, Lenny!

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.280
 [Applause]

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:27.800
 While you men and women in the armed forces of the United Nations, here's the Aldrich family!

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:45.300
 [Music]

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.900
 One of the attractive things about teenage youngsters is that they manage to get a lot of fun out of things

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:55.760
 Which to their elders are absolutely pretty much a laboratory offered to their elders

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.300
 Build it that far instance

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.700
 This is living room

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.700
 See how Henry Alfred candles the problem of moving day for instance

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.100
 The scene opens in Kathleen Anderson's living room

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.800
 Now wait a second Homer

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.800
 Kathleen asked me to lift that box for

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.800
 Can we leave you take your hands off at your only making it heavier?

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.000
 I know Homer, but everything I've picked up you've tried to grab too

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.500
 Anybody think the Anderson's weren't able to move without your budding in?

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.500
 Alright, then, alright, then take it.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.500
 I hope you break your back.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.000
 Well, gee, Whiz, Homer, that's a nice thing to do.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 Right on Kathleen's motor's hardwood floor.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 They're moving out of here, aren't they?

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.500
 And someone's moving in, aren't they?

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.000
 I didn't hurt yourself.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
 No, I didn't hurt myself.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
 Homer, could you...

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 Could you give me a hand with this?

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
 I thought you wanted to lift it yourself.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 We have taken the on-up.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.500
 Put this other pile of book in.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.000
 Oh, you're going to put more in it.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 Henry, we have to get everything we own out of here by tonight.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 You do?

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 Well, see, where you going to have dinner?

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.800
 I don't know.

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.500
 Listen, Kathleen, why don't you come over to our house, Virginia?

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:55.500
 Over to your house?

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.500
 Really, Homer?

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.500
 Homer, over to your house?

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.500
 And now, wait a second.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.000
 Why should she want to come over to your house?

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 Why shouldn't she?

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 I'd be caused, Homer.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.500
 In the first place, your mother and father are both on a diet.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.000
 And you know what that means?

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000
 What does it mean?

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 Yes, Mrs. Anderson?

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.500
 Are you calling I?

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.000
 Could you come here and help me with this stiff leather?

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000
 Yes, you are.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
 Homer, move that box of books out on the port for Kathleen.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 Oh, I'll tell you. Listen, Kathleen.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 Why don't you all come over for dinner?

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 As long as your mother's gonna have all your dishes packed.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
 I don't think we should impose on your mother and father like our homeless.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
 Well, that's the beautiful part of it.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
 If you come over, my mother will have to cook something good for a change.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
 You know, Homer, I don't think we'd better.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
 Now, would you move that box, please?

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 Okay, Kathleen.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
 On the home, and ask my mother.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 Then I can explain the whole thing.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
 On a cheap day, she'd rather we wouldn't come.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 Will you be frank and tell us how?

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.500
 You'll be fine.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.260
 Can tell us now?

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:48.580
 Oh, she was, Kathleen.

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.680
 You don't have to worry about a thing like that.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.940
 Hey, Homer, how about coming down the basement?

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.840
 Give me a hand with a barrel of stuff.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.040
 I've got a beaded, Henry.

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.580
 As soon as you get the barrel up, move that box of books there.

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:00.340
 Listen, Kathleen.

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:01.240
 Where's he going?

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.620
 Oh, let me see whether his mother would

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.600
 mind having anyone extra for dinner.

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:05.780
 Give me your going.

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:06.780
 You're going?

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.260
 And so they're coming over to my house.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.660
 Oh, Henry, I haven't even mentioned your house, Kathleen.

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.100
 Don't you remember my saying--

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.220
 my saying, don't you want to eat with my family?

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:20.520
 I didn't say I didn't want to. I'm much rather only how about your mother my mother

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:24.160
 What would my mother have to do with your coming old for dinner? I mean

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.420
 All I have to do is phone and say you're coming

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:35.400
 Hello, I guess you might have better nature than my mother. Oh gee as soon as I said, please listen mother number P

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.180
 Oh, oh, L3 O3

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:39.440
 Down 303.

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:40.280
 Kathleen?

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:41.240
 Yes, Mother.

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:42.240
 Could you help me please?

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.980
 Mom.

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.220
 And I have something I could tell you.

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.880
 And Kathleen asked her dinner, maybe we can go to the movie.

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:49.780
 Hello?

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:50.280
 Hello?

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.080
 Listen, Mother.

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:52.480
 Henry, where are you?

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.380
 Wait, I'm just over helping.

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:55.480
 Ah, I'm sort of--

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.880
 So you won't be late getting home for dinner tonight with you, dear.

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:58.980
 We're good to eat early.

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.380
 Oh, y'all.

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.880
 Mother, I-- I want to tell you something.

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:03.680
 What is it?

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:04.880
 You know the Anderson.

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.480
 Have something happen to them?

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.720
 No, they're an awful predicament.

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.000
 They help you get out of their house by tonight, see?

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.620
 Really? Where are they going?

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:13.920
 Over on Center Street.

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:14.820
 That'll be nice.

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.320
 Well, don't be late, will you, dear?

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:17.360
 Wait a second, Mother.

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:19.020
 I'll have to finish with their predicament.

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:20.400
 Dear, I can't stand here and tell,

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:21.960
 but you aren't putting up Apple Sauce.

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:23.960
 You are? Well, that's good.

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.540
 But, uh-huh. How would you...

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.840
 Well, what would you think of sort of helping out

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.440
 and asking Kathleen to come and eat with us?

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.740
 Henry, this is no time to ask anyone for dinner.

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.180
 I've got Jaws and Apple Sauce all over the kitchen.

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.440
 Put mother, she's very fond of apple sauce.

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.520
 - Right, Grandma, I don't like it bringing home a guest

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.080
 when I'm working as hard as I am.

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.920
 But tonight.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:42.760
 - Mummy.

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.280
 - Look, let me explain something.

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.080
 - Grandma, there's nothing to explain.

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.000
 - Mother, miss him.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.840
 - My dear.

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:48.680
 - Mother.

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:49.680
 - Can we just get your mother?

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.280
 - Yes, and for now.

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:52.400
 - It's wonderful because Mother's gonna

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.080
 be glad to let me go.

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.280
 What's that?

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.200
 - Well, that's fine.

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.940
 (dramatic music)

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:06.940
 (music)

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:09.940
 In the first place Alice, Henry shouldn't have asked you.

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:12.940
 But Sam, I told him he could not have Kathleen tonight.

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:17.940
 Oh, well, I'm glad to hear that. Not that Kathleen isn't welcome here, but there's a chance that Ed Wilson will be in town.

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:19.940
 You mean you've asked him to have dinner here?

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:24.940
 No, Alice, but if he does arrive in town tonight, I'd like to feel free to ask him for dinner so we can talk business.

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:26.940
 Then I'm all the more glad Kathleen isn't coming.

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:28.940
 - Mother! - Henry, is that you?

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:30.940
 - Yes, where are you? - We're in the living room.

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:32.940
 We'd like very much to speak to you.

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:34.940
 - You mean, father's in there with you?

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:36.940
 - I am. - Oh, hello, father.

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:40.940
 - Hello. - Henry, I certainly hope Kathleen understood why I couldn't have it tonight.

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:43.940
 - Well, Mother, if you aren't awfully busy,

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:46.940
 could I speak you out in the dining room where we can be alone?

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:48.940
 I mean, there is no use here bringing the subject up.

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:51.940
 Your father agrees with me. We cannot have Kathleen tonight.

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:55.940
 - Oh, we can? - Henry, remember this for as long as you live.

00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:01.520
 live don't ever ask anyone to this house for dinner as a as a surprise to us yes

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:06.380
 father is that clear dear yes mother that doesn't go just for Kathleen it goes

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:10.460
 for home of Brown for Jimmy Bartlett yes father for everyone and anyone you

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:14.060
 happen to have an impulse to ask yes mother only only first there's just one

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:17.300
 thing I want to explain don't try to explain anything Kathleen is out of the

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.940
 picture as far as tonight is concerned where you going out of the garden mother

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:24.620
 would you be interested in listening to me and I have not hear anymore about it

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:26.620
 What mother, look out Mrs. Anderson gave me.

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:27.620
 What is it?

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:29.120
 Are those racing fans?

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:31.120
 Yes, sure, she felt bad about it.

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:33.620
 Well, my goodness, look, pretty stamp.

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:35.620
 That gives you some idea, mother of health.

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:39.120
 Oh, well, Henry, you certainly couldn't have been very cordial in your invitation.

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:40.120
 What's that?

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:42.520
 Henry, what did you say to Mrs. Anderson that made our theatre

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:43.520
 she had to give you those?

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:44.620
 That's the funny part of it.

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:46.620
 It came right out of a clear blue sky.

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:49.620
 Did you realize how embarrassed this made me feel?

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:54.120
 Apparently she felt the reason we couldn't have Kathleen was because we didn't have an operation stand.

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:58.200
 My mother dear when you're inviting anyone for dinner there are two ways to do it

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:03.440
 Either don't ask them at all or you ask them wholeheartedly and really make them feel as though they're wanted

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:04.440
 You do?

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:05.440
 Yes dear of course you do

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:07.440
 What's the Anderson's number?

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:08.440
 You're going to call them?

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:09.440
 Of course I am

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:10.440
 Why?

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:11.440
 It's it's album 344

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:12.440
 M344

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:15.680
 For gee mother is that a load off my mind?

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:16.680
 Number please

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:18.680
 Operator I want M344

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:19.680
 M344

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:22.640
 Henry do you see that list of groceries on the table?

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:23.640
 Yes mother

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:25.040
 If you take it and go right over to the store?

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:27.040
 Yes sure and thanks very much

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:28.720
 And don't even mention this to your father

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:30.480
 You let me explain things to him

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:31.480
 Yes mother

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:32.480
 Hello

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:33.480
 Hello is this Betty Anderson?

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:34.480
 Yeah

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:35.760
 This is Alice O'Rijt here

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:40.440
 I've just been talking with Henry and frankly Betty I've never been quite so embarrassed

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:42.200
 What about Alice?

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:46.280
 Anyone that has to move at a time like this and is in the position you're in for better

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:48.280
 we just love to help you all

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:49.280
 Oh really?

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:50.280
 Of course

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:51.280
 What's that?

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:52.280
 Of what's that?

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:53.280
 Oh

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:54.880
 You mean you can help?

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:56.880
 Will have fine, Betty.

00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:00.280
 I was afraid for a minute, and Henry had asked just Kathleen.

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:04.280
 No, Alice, are you sure you can have us all on this short notice?

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:10.280
 Why, why Betty, I give you my word. Nothing would give us more pleasure than making you feel that our home is your home.

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:12.780
 Really, Alice? Oh, that's awfully sweet of you.

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:14.280
 Not at all. Goodbye.

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:15.280
 Goodbye.

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:17.280
 So am.

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:19.280
 Sam, I've got to tell you something.

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:32.280
 [Music]

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:33.280
 Hello?

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:34.280
 Hello?

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:35.280
 Bob, this is Betty.

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:38.280
 What do you think the older kids have come to the rescue?

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:39.280
 They've asked us over to their house.

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:40.280
 Yes?

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:41.280
 For the next three days?

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:42.280
 Why no, Bob?

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:43.280
 No, of course not.

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:44.280
 Just for dinner.

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:48.280
 Well, that takes care of one meal, but, well, we're going to stay tonight and tomorrow night until the other place is ready.

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:52.660
 the other places ready well couldn't you get room for the man to know no no they're

00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:56.380
 all filled up you don't suppose the auditors would put us up for a few days

00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:59.740
 to you now Bob I'm even a little embarrassed about going over there for

00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:03.460
 dinner do they know we can't move into the other house yes well then I don't see

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:07.660
 why they don't ask us we do the same for them well Alice Otter it's this day she

00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:11.300
 wanted us to feel that their home was our home but I don't think she expects

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:15.500
 it to stay three days why don't you call it back and make sure now Bell I can't

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:19.880
 do that. Let's just wait and see what happens. And Bob, somebody let the door

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:22.500
 I just got to hang up and see who it is. Good bye.

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:28.760
 You can't hear me. Where are you? I'm not here in the first hall. It's Kathleen

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:33.540
 here. Hello, honey. What is it? Nothing Kathleen. Nothing. I was just on my way to

00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:38.500
 get some groceries for a first something and I just thought I'd drop in. Oh, all I

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:42.860
 want to know is I want to make sure. Yes, honey? Well, I want to be positive. See,

00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:46.860
 I just had a talk with my mother and she called you, didn't she?

00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:48.860
 Yes, and that was very sweet of us.

00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:50.860
 Boy, where she upset over the way I asked Kathleen.

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:53.860
 Your mother was sitting nice to car an afterthought.

00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:55.860
 Oh, all of you?

00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:56.860
 Yeah.

00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:58.860
 Oh, gee, that's the way my mother is.

00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:02.860
 Once she decides to do something, she'll even turn over her whole house to you.

00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:03.860
 Really?

00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:07.860
 As a matter of fact, Henry, she did say we were to feel your home without home.

00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:08.860
 Sure.

00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:10.860
 All she's got to know is you're in a jam and I'm fine.

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:14.980
 I am fine. Only Henry. Are you positive we won't be crowding you?

00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:17.820
 Crowning us. She was. How could you do a thing like that?

00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:18.860
 Are you sure, Henry?

00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:21.460
 Kathleen, you talked as though we'd never had caught me before.

00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:25.100
 She was there's plenty of room. And your mother told you to stay there?

00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:27.860
 Sure. She certainly said I was to be cargill.

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:28.940
 Well, goodbye.

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:31.460
 Goodbye. Thank you very much for turning over.

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:34.180
 Kathleen, go to the phone and call your father.

00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:37.660
 Yes, mother. Tell him it's all settled. We won't have to go to the hotel.

00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:39.980
 Hey Kathleen. Yes, holler, where are you?

00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:41.580
 I'm out here at the back door. Where are you?

00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:43.080
 I'm just going to put in a phone call.

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:46.180
 Well, look, I've got a sort of embarrassing message for you.

00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:49.680
 See, my mother said she likes to have you folks come for dinner.

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:52.380
 In fact, there's nothing she'd rather have you do.

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:56.380
 Only, don't you think as long as you folks are going to be so tired

00:10:56.380 --> 00:11:00.480
 from moving and everything, it would be better to wait and come some time afterwards

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:04.480
 when you feel fresher and then keep your mind on what you're eating.

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:07.080
 And as long as the matter of fact, we're all going over the hand-me.

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:07.980
 For dinner?

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:08.580
 Yeah.

00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:11.580
 Everybody? Oh, Gee whiz, that's a fine thing.

00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:13.580
 Could I use your telephone before you do?

00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:14.580
 I guess so.

00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:15.580
 Hello?

00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:17.580
 That is not Gee whiz.

00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:18.580
 Number three.

00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:19.580
 Elm two three two.

00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:20.580
 Elm two three two.

00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:24.580
 In horror, as soon as you get through, could you come in the living room and talk and move that box of books and books?

00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:26.580
 Didn't Henry take care of us?

00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:27.580
 Of all of them?

00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:28.580
 At all?

00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:30.580
 Home, Mother, I won't be home for dinner.

00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:33.580
 Find us! The old riches are throwing a party.

00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:42.580
 (music)

00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:45.580
 But, Mother, I didn't ask them all for dinner. You did.

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:49.580
 Well, incidentally, since you knew how many would be here, why didn't you get enough thing being?

00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:51.580
 I did. That's a beautiful part of it.

00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:54.580
 Then why didn't you tell me before I sent your father to the store?

00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:56.580
 You did? Well, I'll go right down and get him.

00:11:56.580 --> 00:11:59.580
 Now, don't do anything more. You've done enough as it is.

00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:00.580
 Where are you going?

00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:04.840
 over to Mrs. Kilmer's and try to borrow a large tablecloth and yeah I hope you'll

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:08.820
 let this be a lesson don't ever ever start inviting people in a wholesale way

00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:13.180
 like this again yes mother only I just asked Kat wait and please go answer

00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:18.060

00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:23.320
 and none of them can come except Kat Lee hello hello man I speak with Mr.

00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:27.340
 Orange please right mr. Orange is near right now if you tell me how am I

00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:31.340
 I don't think you can't. He's not trying to scrape up some string beans.

00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:34.340
 What's that? May I ask who that's there speaking?

00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:35.340
 This is your son.

00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:39.340
 Oh, yes. This is Mr. Wilson. I believe I met you when I was in town last week.

00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:41.340
 Oh, yes. Up on the road.

00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:47.340
 Henry, I'm in sort of a camp down here at the hotel. I've been trying to get a room and they tell me there isn't a chance.

00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:48.340
 There isn't?

00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:50.340
 No matter a fact, even the dining room is packed.

00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:52.340
 You mean you can't get in and get anything?

00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:56.340
 That's why I called. I was wondering whether you might have any suggestion to make.

00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:57.340
 Well, I tell you.

00:12:57.340 --> 00:12:58.340
 No.

00:12:58.340 --> 00:12:59.040
 What's that?

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:01.140
 I'm pretty sure I better not make that one.

00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:03.640
 Do you know any place to get a room or a meal?

00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:04.340
 Right.

00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:05.040
 No.

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:07.740
 No, my mother was just saying a little while ago.

00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:09.040
 No.

00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:10.640
 Everything's all tied up.

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:11.240
 I see.

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:12.440
 How about...

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:14.840
 How about my father fooling you when he comes in?

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:16.640
 I don't want to go any good. I can't wait here.

00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:18.340
 I have to find a place to eat and sleep.

00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:18.940
 Oh.

00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:20.140
 Just forget the whole thing.

00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:20.740
 Goodbye.

 Now getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldrich.

00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:04.140
 The Aldrichs are upset to think that Kathleen Anderson and her family are coming for dinner this evening.

00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:09.140
 Never dreaming that the Anderson's are really preparing to stay for three days.

00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:12.140
 The scene opens and the Aldrich's living room.

00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:14.140
 Miss Duong, will you speak?

00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:15.140
 Alice, where are you?

00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:21.140
 I've been out trying to find enough groceries.

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:24.140
 But he had realized it was hardly an hour left before the Anderson's were being here.

00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:28.340
 - He's a beanier. - I guess I couldn't help it if somebody had bought all the string beans in town.

00:17:28.340 --> 00:17:30.140
 The Anderson-Cocaffery-Deg plan.

00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:32.140
 I do hope they won't stay long after dinner.

00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:33.640
 Father, is that you?

00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:34.640
 It is.

00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:36.640
 Well, if you were my friend, wait for you.

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:38.140
 There was a phone call for you.

00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:38.640
 Yes?

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:39.640
 - Mr. Wilson? - Yes, sir.

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:43.140
 Oh, but he's in town. That's fine. I tried to phone him from the drug store.

00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:44.140
 Yes, Father.

00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:46.140
 Why are they jammed down at the hotel?

00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:47.140
 You mean he can't get a room?

00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:48.140
 No, sir.

00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:49.640
 Well, you told him to come up here, didn't you?

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:50.140
 Up here?

00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:51.140
 What phone?

00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:52.140
 Why's a dinner there?

00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:53.140
 And stay overnight.

00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:56.920
 Why no mr. Wilson he came to town to do business with me

00:17:56.920 --> 00:18:01.180
 I know father, but you gave me a lecture about asking people right out of a clear sky like that

00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:04.800
 There's nothing about it that's out of a clear sky. Where did he say I could reach you?

00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:09.700
 He said you couldn't he said he was going out to look for someplace to sleep Henry old rates

00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:16.840
 Mother you don't you see the position I was in Henry if we have antagonized Mr. Wilson and he goes back to Chicago without seeing me out

00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:19.540
 Now Sam, I'm sorry, Father.

00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:21.540
 But Alice, of all the people we know, Ed Wilson.

00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:23.540
 Ed Wilson, after all we do have a guest.

00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:25.540
 Now Sam, don't be upset.

00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:27.540
 That's proper goodness to go to this minute.

00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:28.540
 Yes?

00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:29.540
 Go, Sheila, let me go to the door.

00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:31.540
 I'd like to be the one who invites you.

00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:33.540
 Now wait a minute, Henry. Wait a minute.

00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:34.540
 What's the matter?

00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:35.540
 Alice, look out the window.

00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:36.540
 Sorry, Sam.

00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:37.540
 Look who's on the front porch.

00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:39.540
 Aren't you with this cappling and a mother?

00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:40.540
 Sam.

00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:42.540
 How did you tell him to come?

00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:44.540
 Well, I certainly didn't tell him to come this early.

00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:45.540
 I'm not even doing it.

00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:49.740
 father here's phone something happening and they can't come you mean they can't

00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:53.020

 kitchen yes father open the door wait a minute there here's a match I didn't

00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:05.580

00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:10.620
 well hello there hello Sam hello Alice any beer hello Mr. and Mrs.

00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:14.620
 - Hello, don't tell me you can't come in.

00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:16.620
 - I thought perhaps it would be too early for you,

00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:18.320
 but that horse is driving me crazy.

00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:19.620
 I just had to get out of it.

00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:21.500
 - Well, it's quite all right.

00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:23.060
 Tell me, where's Bob?

00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:24.300
 He's coming with the car, Alice.

00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:26.300
 - Oh, yes, mother and I walk over.

00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:27.140
 Really?

00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:27.980
 Well, that's just fine.

00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:29.980
 - Yes, that's fine.

00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:31.660
 Let's, let's all sit down.

00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:33.420
 Kathleen, hello.

00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:35.060
 - Henry.

00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:36.220
 - I guess he doesn't hear.

00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:37.300
 He'll be back in a minute though.

00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:38.820
 - Just suppose I go and get him.

00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:40.820
 I had that one or two little things to attend to.

00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:41.820
 And the kitchen, anyhow,

00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:42.820
 would you just excuse me?

00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:43.820
 Can you help me?

00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:44.820
 I have to go with you,

00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:46.820
 and you're the original thing to do.

00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:47.820
 So there's a go-dell.

00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:48.820
 I guess that's father.

00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:49.820
 Yes? Well, that's father.

00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:50.820
 Who's your average?

00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:51.820
 Who's your average?

00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:52.820
 Who's your average?

00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:53.820
 You could go out and help him bring in grandmothers.

00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:54.820
 What?

00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:55.820
 My dad?

00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:56.820
 Yes, Sam, Bob's mother.

00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:57.820
 You remember her, don't you?

00:19:57.820 --> 00:19:58.820
 Oh, yes.

00:19:58.820 --> 00:19:59.820
 Yes, that's fine.

00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:00.820
 Oh, Bob.

00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:01.820
 Hello, Bob.

00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:02.820
 And Mrs. Anderson.

00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:03.820
 How are you?

00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:05.820
 Just play for Roblomb's, man.

00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:06.820
 Yeah?

00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:07.820
 All right, sir.

00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:08.820
 Here we come.

00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:12.320
 You want to go out the car and get grandmother's cushion.

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:13.320
 All right.

00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:15.320
 Have you any idea what we're doing?

00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:16.320
 Henry!

00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:17.320
 Henry!

00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:18.820
 I hope we're not going to be clowning you Sam.

00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:20.320
 No, no not at all.

00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:21.320
 Everything's going to be fine.

00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:22.320
 Here we go grandmother.

00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:24.320
 Right down into the big chair.

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:26.320
 Ah, but you want me to do.

00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:27.320
 Just for sure, Miss.

00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:29.320
 And she does better if you let it drop in.

00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:30.320
 Yeah?

00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:31.320
 Ah, that's fine.

00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:32.320
 Here we are.

00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:36.320
 Sam, I can't begin to tell you how grateful we are for you pulling us out of this chair.

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:37.320
 That's all right.

00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:40.320
 Now Sam, I want to tell you one thing.

00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:44.320
 Better you and I decided before we came over we're going to make as little trouble for you as possible.

00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:46.320
 Bob, what are you talking about trouble for?

00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:48.320
 Well, let's work out a schedule for the bathroom.

00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:50.320
 You know what I mean? So we won't get in your way.

00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:51.320
 What's that?

00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:56.320
 And tell me frankly Sam, would you rather we eat with you or a little head of you?

00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:57.320
 What's that?

00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:59.320
 Why don't you let us do it again?

00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:03.320
 I was just thinking, really, sir, just clean up the kitchen and get out your way.

00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:04.320
 Get your stuff!

00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:05.320
 Yes, Alice, what is it?

00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:06.320
 Alice, what is this?

00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:08.320
 Would you please come here right away?

00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:09.320
 Yes, Alice.

00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:11.320
 If you folks will excuse me, I'd go see what you are.

00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:15.320
 The same as the person who'd be on the objections to grandmother eating upstairs.

00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:16.320
 Upstairs?

00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:18.320
 But no, that would be fine.

00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:20.320
 Sam, I want you to tell me something.

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:22.320
 Alice, there's something I want you to tell me.

00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:25.320
 Yes, can you cut these string beans while I go out and change my clothes?

00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:26.320
 Alice, what's going on here?

00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:27.320
 What do you mean?

00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:28.320
 The Anderson's don't want to eat with us.

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:29.320
 Do you mean they're leaving?

00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:32.320
 No, they want to eat in the kitchen before we do.

00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:34.320
 And grandmother's going to eat upstairs.

00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:36.320
 What's that? That grandmother.

00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:39.320
 Alice, what do they mean by wanting a schedule for the bathroom?

00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:41.320
 Well, do you show them where it is?

00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:44.320
 No, they want a schedule for it, a schedule.

00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:47.320
 What are you talking about? For my goodest duty for that is?

00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:49.320
 I don't know who it is, how would I know?

00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:52.320
 Well, don't just stand there, Dave. Go on to the front door.

00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:54.320
 Where's Henry? Why can't Henry take care of some of this?

00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:56.320
 I have no idea where Henry is.

00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:58.320
 Sorry, this is not all this. I answered the door.

00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:00.320
 Yes, it was. Now, Mr. Wilson was it?

00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:02.320
 No, it's just the expert man without bogies.

00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:05.320
 But I thought he didn't want to like it because he was so tall.

00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:06.320
 Oh, oh.

00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:07.820
 Now don't you let the fingers hang.

00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:09.820
 You let that fellow out there bring everything in.

00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:10.820
 Oh, yes.

00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:11.820
 Or all those...

00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:12.820
 All those...

00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:13.820
 Is that your baggage?

00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:18.320
 Yes, I told him to take them around and bring them in the backway so he won't scratch up the front hole.

00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:18.820
 Hey, I'm...

00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:19.820
 Yes, Betty?

00:22:19.820 --> 00:22:23.820
 I forgot to tell Alice we brought our own sheets and tell our cases in our own towels.

00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:24.320
 But, I...

00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:25.820
 Enough to laugh for three days.

00:22:25.820 --> 00:22:26.820
 Well, that's fine.

00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:27.820
 Sam, who was it?

00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:28.820
 Nothing Alice.

00:22:28.820 --> 00:22:31.820
 Just the man with the Anderson sheets and towels.

00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:35.340
 To the Anderson plot, but they say they can only be with us for three days

00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:38.340
 I mean, oh

00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:42.140
 Why we certainly thought you could be with us at least

00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:51.580
 I would have been here soon. I only my father couldn't come at the last minute. What's that?

00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:56.620
 Just my mother couldn't make it. Hello Sam. Oh, I do understand we're about being able to come along

00:22:56.620 --> 00:23:00.680
 Well, that's quite all right Elizabeth. We'll try to understand what we are this

00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:04.680
 Yes, well anyway Sam, happy birthday!

00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:05.680
 Happy birthday!

00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:08.180
 Yes, yes, isn't that what you're celebrating?

00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:10.680
 No Elizabeth, I wouldn't go so far as to say that!

00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:14.180
 Well anyway, I know you're celebrating something!

00:23:14.180 --> 00:23:16.680
 Oh isn't that Bambourter Endistice in there?

00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:18.680
 Why grandmother Endistice!

00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:20.680
 Boy am I looking forward to dinner!

00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:21.680
 Is it dinner dear?

00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:22.680
 Sure!

00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:25.180
 Just for dinner? You can't stay overnight?

00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:27.180
 Well, I guess I could.

00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:28.180
 Where's Henry?

00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:29.180
 I wish I knew!

00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:31.180
 I'm going to get out of here.

00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:34.180
 - What a cat, please. - Don't you can't make it out like a pixie.

00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:36.180
 Anyway, where have you been?

00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:38.180
 - Look, Father, look who I found. - Do you believe it?

00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:41.180
 Can't you see? It's Mr. Wilson and his wife and children.

00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:43.180
 I told them you wanted them to stay overnight.

00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:44.180
 What's that?

00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:57.180
 Alice, let me look at this list once more.

00:23:57.180 --> 00:24:00.180
 Quiet, Sam. You want to wake everyone in the house up?

00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:02.180
 No one can hear us here in the kitchen, Alice.

00:24:02.180 --> 00:24:05.180
 I just want to look at the list and see where everyone is sleeping.

00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:07.180
 Just a moment while I turn this other light on.

00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:11.180
 Now, let's see. Bob and Betty Anderson are in...

00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:13.180
 There in our room, dear.

00:24:13.180 --> 00:24:15.180
 Oh, yeah. Kathleen is in with Mary.

00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:16.180
 Where's grandmother?

00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:17.180
 She's in Henry's room.

00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:18.180
 Oh, yeah.

00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:20.180
 And Mr. and Mrs. Wilts are in the guest room.

00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:22.180
 And their daughter is on the sofa in the living room.

00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:24.180
 And their friends on that cart in the dining room.

00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:25.180
 Oh, yeah.

00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:29.180
 I'm going to sleep on that card I put up the side Mary and Kathleen.

00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:31.180
 And where is it grandmother sleeping?

00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:34.180
 I told you in Henry's room. I sent Henry over to stay with Homer.

00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:37.180
 I realized that, Alice. Well, it worked out very well.

00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:39.180
 I thought so too.

00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:43.180
 Now wait a minute. Wait a minute. Where am I?

00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:46.180
 You do, yes. Don't I have you on this list?

00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:48.180
 Let's go through it once more.

00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:50.180
 Then I guess I don't have you.

00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:51.180
 That's a fine thing.

00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:54.180
 Well, do you've got to lie down someplace you've had a hard day.

00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:56.180
 Why, uh, why...

00:24:56.180 --> 00:24:58.180
 What are you going to suggest?

00:24:58.180 --> 00:25:02.180
 No, I guess the Wilson boy couldn't possibly sleep with grandmother.

00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:06.180
 No dear, no. We all agreed that grandmother better sleep alone.

00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:09.180
 How about...how about...no?

00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:10.180
 Of course, yes.

00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:13.180
 There's that old blanket that Henry's goat used to sleep on.

00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:16.180
 But I frankly don't think you'd be comfortable on that.

00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:19.180
 No. But I might take a couple of leaves from the dining room table

00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:21.180
 and put them across the bathtub.

00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:22.180
 What?

00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:27.580
 And just lie there holding the bathroom schedule now Sam I'm doing the best I can I know Alice

00:25:27.580 --> 00:25:31.300
 But I've got to do some work tomorrow. I can't just stand up against the wall all night

00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:34.620
 Alice who said then it's Henry yes dear

00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:40.040
 Not so loud Henry did you forget something forget something?

00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:46.220
 What was it she doesn't know your mother's asking you why are you back? I can't sleep over Homer why not?

00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:50.940
 Homer's Uncle Joe showed up on a furlough and he brought two soldiers along with him

00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:51.780
 What's that?

00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:53.020
 So I had to come home.

00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:54.220
 Sam, what are we going to do?

00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:56.280
 I don't know what they're going to do.

00:25:56.280 --> 00:25:58.220
 It's grandmother that's messing up the whole work.

00:25:58.220 --> 00:26:00.140
 What are you walking out of the room like that, Paul?

00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:01.580
 I'm going to answer the telephone.

00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:03.500
 Would you like me, grandfather?

00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:04.020
 Hello.

00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:04.540
 Hello.

00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:06.420
 Do you have a Mr. Wilson there?

00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:07.120
 Yes.

00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:08.420
 Could I speak to him, please?

00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:09.220
 Why?

00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:11.580
 He can't come to the phone right this minute.

00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:12.500
 Did I take a message?

00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:13.860
 This is the mansion house.

00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:16.340
 Mr. Wilson had his name on our reservation list

00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:18.580
 and asked us to give him a call if anything turned out.

00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:19.220
 Yes.

00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:20.740
 We just found one bed.

00:26:20.740 --> 00:26:23.360
 If he doesn't mind, it's being in the room with another gentleman.

00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:25.120
 I missed the Wiggins from Battle Creek.

00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:27.260
 Yes? Good. Hold it.

00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:28.540
 - Henry! - Yes, Father?

00:26:28.540 --> 00:26:29.940
 - Come with me! - Where to?

00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:32.800
 We're gonna sleep with a man with a name of Wiggins from Battle Creek.

00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:41.240
 Father, can't we please turn on the light?

00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:42.640
 No, Henry.

00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:44.840
 I told her to be sure not to wake up Mr. Wiggins.

00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:48.140
 But she was like, can't see the button-like pajamas.

00:26:48.140 --> 00:26:49.360
 Get into bed.

00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:52.000
 I am in bed. I'm trying. I'm trying.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:53.840
 Papa, where are you?

00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:55.320
 I'm right over here.

00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:56.680
 You're not here with me?

00:26:56.680 --> 00:27:00.000
