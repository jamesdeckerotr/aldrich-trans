 [Music]

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 Come on, Zhi! Come in, mother!

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
 [Applause]

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:36.140
 The Aldrich family starring as Restone, written by Clifford Goldsmith, brought to you by the

00:00:36.140 --> 00:01:02.020
 The puddings that are tops entaste, jello pudding.

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.020
 They say the happiest years of your life are the teens.

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:11.020
 But I know one person who has his doubts about that, Henry Aldrich.

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.020
 Henry has all the troubles and growing pains that most boys go through under high school

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:16.020
 days.

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.020
 For Henry is a typical American boy.

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:25.020
 Tonight out in Centerville, the Aldrichs are just having dinner, and are seen open in the

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.020
 dining room of the Aldrich Hope.

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.020
 Have another lamb chop, Alan?

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.520
 No, thank you.

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.020
 You already think anything.

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.020
 Sam, I'm so tired of planning meals and cooking meals.

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.520
 I don't know what to do.

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.020
 Chops are awfully good, Mother.

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.020
 Yes, Mary.

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.020
 Say, say, who do you think I was just talking to on the phone?

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.020
 Oh, Henry.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.020
 Kathleen.

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.020
 The folks want me to come over for dinner Saturday night.

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.020
 Tomorrow night?

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.020
 Sure. Isn't that a break for you, Mother?

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.020
 Why for me?

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.020
 Well, if I'm not here, you can just have any old thing for dinner.

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.020
 What do you mean, she can't?

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.020
 I've got to go out in the kitchen and whip some cream.

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.660
 I'll be clearing the table mother boy can you imagine we're not here the rest of us

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:09.340
 invited Henry she didn't mention any of you couldn't tell the Anderson's been here

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:14.020
 off me no Mary is that very kind but father gets inviting Henry's hardly

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.740
 any way to pay off a social debt Henry would you be disappointed if you didn't

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:23.700
 go to Kathleen's not go have you forgotten what they Sunday is Sunday

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.100
 Mm-hmm.

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.300
 Sunday.

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.020
 It's Mother's Day.

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.380
 Oh, but Father, I'm just going for dinner Saturday night.

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.140
 Well, I'd plan to take your mother and you and Mary

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.900
 out to dinner Saturday as her Mother's Day celebration.

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:37.780
 You had, Father?

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.340
 No, it's up to you as to where you'd rather go.

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.740
 Oh, see, I don't want to offend Mother, but I--

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.300
 You'd rather go to Kathleen?

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.500
 Well, I don't know.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.500
 The hard thing to decide.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.420
 There's never a day that mothers have a day.

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.420
 You're coming this way when you bring your play?

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.420
 I'm not coming that way, Mary.

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.420
 What would you like to do?

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.420
 Well, I'm phone-cathling.

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.420
 Yeah, sure, I'd love to go with you.

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.420
 Well, I guess I ought to get Mother something nice, don't you think?

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:09.420
 Splendid.

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.420
 Would you care to contribute anything toward it?

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.420
 I'd say.

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.420
 I'd say you'd like.

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.420
 Let it be a present from the entire family.

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.420
 It seems to me, son, you should have saved up for this occasion.

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:28.220
 I have father. I have I've earned nearly five dollars only I hate to see it all go at once

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:34.540
 I'm not through with my plate Mary. I have your glass. I'm not through with that either

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.980
 You may take my plate Mary. Thank you father. I'm glad somebody in this house cooperate father

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:45.300
 Father, how do you think mother would like to have me get her a new dress address sure?

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.300
 I don't see what would be so difficult about it

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:52.380
 All I have to do is get mother down to the store and just happen to take her by the dress department.

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:53.380
 And what?

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:59.380
 And as we go by, I say, "Gee, mother, look!" and she'll say, "Oh, isn't that one swell?"

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:00.380
 And I've got it all picked out.

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:03.380
 But supposing she picks one of the more expensive dresses.

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:07.380
 Well, I wouldn't mind the sacrifice. I just assume spend the whole $5.

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:14.380
 I think I ought to do something for mother. She puts up with an awful lot from us.

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:15.380
 from us.

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.820
 Henry, mother wants to know what you drank and he milked this afternoon.

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:19.820
 Just one glass, Mary.

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.140
 Well, what you drank was cream.

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:23.140
 Cream?

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:24.140
 Cream?

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:27.340
 I thought that was awful rich when I drank it.

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.100
 There is more stuff out there to whip.

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.380
 She was, well, tell her on Sunday, I'll make up for everything.

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:35.820
 Excuse me while I take this.

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.340
 I'm not through with that plate.

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.020
 There isn't anything left on at Henry.

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.060
 I've got my chop in my hand.

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.060
 May I have your bread and butter plate?

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.060
 But you're not to come any closer than that.

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.060
 And Henry, will you please eat your choppers you should.

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.060
 But Father, I waste so much when I eat it politely.

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:57.060
 Mary, you wouldn't like to go in on something real nice for Mother's Day, would you?

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.060
 I'd plan to get Mother something alone, Henry.

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:01.060
 What?

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:02.060
 A blouse?

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:03.060
 A blouse, Mary?

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:04.060
 A blouse?

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:05.060
 Mm-hmm.

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:06.060
 No skirt?

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:10.060
 Oh my goodness, I'm going to pay nearly 395 for it as it is.

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:11.060
 What is it?

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.060
 Well, how much would one come to?

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:15.060
 The very cheapest would be $2.95.

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:16.060
 What?

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:17.060
 Yes.

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:20.060
 I wonder whether Mother wouldn't like to go to the movies instead.

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.060
 Mother, is it time coming Mother?

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:25.060
 Father, there's an awfully good movie this week.

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:26.060
 What is it?

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:28.060
 The cowboy returns.

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:29.060
 Yes.

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:31.060
 I'd even be willing to blow the whole family to her.

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:36.060
 First, don't you think you'd better make sure the cowboy returns is what your mother wants to see?

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.060
 Oh, I would have her choice.

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:42.980
 You know Father, if we didn't go to an expensive place, I could almost take the whole family to dinner too.

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:44.860
 I think the movies will be sufficient.

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:47.700
 Oh no Father, I know of a place where it's very reasonable.

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:49.720
 I'd be glad to take all of you. How about it?

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.700
 Hannah, can you make room for this dessert?

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:53.860
 Mary Mother can't hear me out there, can she?

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.040
 Mother's mean speaking to you.

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:57.440
 She isn't Mary?

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:58.900
 She will.

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.700
 How would you like to go to the movies Mother's Day Eve?

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:02.800
 What's that, Hannah?

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.160
 Saturday night. I mean it.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.920
 We're all going to the movies and to dinner as my guest.

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:07.600
 Really?

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.400
 - His father. - He's right, Mary.

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:13.360
 That's wonderful, because I was gonna take Mother down to get that blouse,

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.520
 and now we can meet you right afterwards.

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:18.200
 Boy, there isn't anything Mother likes more than a party.

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:19.720
 Here's your dessert, Sam.

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:22.080
 If you want any cream, as can we for it.

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.920
 When Mother back cream, I drank was in a picture.

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:27.760
 Look, of course it was in a picture.

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:31.080
 What do you mind if I change the subject of cream just a second?

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:32.240
 Mm, to what?

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.240
 What are you doing Saturday night?

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:37.280
 - Dear, I'm probably cooking dinner. - You are?

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:39.840
 We're all going to meet downtown for something.

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:40.640
 For what?

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:42.080
 Don't tell her Mary.

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.160
 Where should we meet?

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:47.120
 At the Employee and Department store at uh...

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:48.400
 $4.45.

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:50.160
 It's all set. $4.45.

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:53.440
 And that's going to make it terribly late for me to get home and cook dinner.

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:55.360
 Don't worry about cooking dinner, mother.

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:56.640
 But what are we going to do?

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:58.560
 Gee, was you wait. You're going to have one of the

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:00.560
 swillest times you ever had in your life.

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:18.560
 [Music]

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:20.560
 Oh, pardon me, sir.

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:21.560
 What is it, lady?

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:24.560
 Have you seen anyone waiting here at the entrance to the Emporium?

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:25.560
 No ma'am, not recently.

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:27.560
 Oh, thank you very much.

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:33.600
 Here it is 12 minutes after five. I don't mind waiting so much. I just keep wondering if they haven't been in an accident

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:34.600
 Yes, man.

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:35.600
 It's the perfect way it is.

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:36.600
 You might buy some flowers, ladies.

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:37.600
 No, thank you.

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:39.600
 Wouldn't you like to buy some carnations for mothers there?

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:40.600
 No, thank you.

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:56.880
 Well, you ought to remember your mother. That's what Lisa-

00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:58.520
 One foot seat is the family near.

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:00.340
 There's nobody in this town.

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:01.800
 Then I will need the paper.

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:03.200
 Next race face, sir.

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:04.200
 Next race.

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:05.200
 Alice.

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:07.000
 Alice, why have you been waiting here at this entrance?

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.760
 Sam, where on earth do you think I've waited?

00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:10.520
 Well, I've been standing around the corner.

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:12.240
 That's not the main entrance, Sam.

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:14.640
 Well, Alice, that is certainly the main entrance on that street.

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:16.960
 Well, at least you'll say that's something.

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:18.840
 The thing for us to worry about is my car.

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:19.840
 What's happened to that?

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:23.080
 I left it 30 minutes ago in a 15-minute parking space.

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:25.720
 But that still isn't as important as Henry and Mary.

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:28.720
 They're probably at the entrance all the way around on Market Street.

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:30.220
 Well go around and look for him.

00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:31.020
 Where will you be?

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:33.720
 I'll wait right here. I won't move one foot.

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:35.920
 Ready like to buy a box of candy from others, eh?

00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:36.720
 No thank you.

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:38.420
 Their hand-bipped and cherry filled.

00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:39.420
 No thank you.

00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:40.520
 Like some hazelnuts.

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:41.920
 No thank you.

00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:44.920
 Fresh chocolate with cherries for your mother.

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:47.220
 She wears your mother where have you been?

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:49.320
 Right here where I was supposed to be, Henry.

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:50.320
 Imagine that.

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:51.120
 Where have you been?

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:52.520
 Just inside the door.

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:54.520
 Why, dear, did you wait in there?

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:58.760
 But mother, I think the inside of a door would be the only logical place to wait for someone.

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:00.680
 Couldn't you have at least looked outside?

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:02.520
 I finally did marry a word.

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:04.360
 Where's Mary?

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:05.860
 I have no idea which.

00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:06.920
 Where's Father?

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:10.360
 Your father's gone down to the market street entrance to see where you are.

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:10.860
 I?

00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:12.200
 Why would he look for me there?

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:14.200
 Well, then you certainly weren't here were you?

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:15.600
 Mother, I was here.

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:18.800
 Oh, I don't mean to argue with you, but...

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:21.200
 But all that's been separating us is that door.

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:21.960
 Yes, Henry.

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:26.540
 Now, supposing you take this nickel and go inside and telephone and see where the meringue

00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:27.540
 left the house here.

00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:28.540
 Yes, mother.

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:30.540
 Tell her the store closes at five-thirty.

00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:31.540
 Yes.

00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:34.540
 Extra space for young guy, I'll fix the fear.

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:35.540
 Sorry, sorry.

00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:37.300
 What am I currently laying here?

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:38.300
 Have you been married?

00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:40.900
 You're gray and dropped in just as I was leading.

00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:42.900
 I thought he never was gone.

00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:44.540
 She'll go in and do our shopping.

00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:46.900
 Well, not until Henry and your father get back.

00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:47.900
 Where are they?

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:51.300
 Henry's phoning you and your father's waiting for you around the market street.

00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:53.300
 Isn't that ridiculous mother?

00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:54.300
 It certainly is.

00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:55.300
 What have we got to do now?

00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:57.300
 Wait for them until I get back?

00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:59.300
 I'm afraid we have, dear.

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:00.300
 Now at least one other's better.

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:04.300
 You stay right here while I go around and get your father.

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:05.300
 Can you find me?

00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:06.300
 Of course I can find him.

00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:08.300
 Now don't move until I get back.

00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:09.300
 No mother.

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:11.300
 Pardon me, sir.

00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:12.300
 What do you have, lady?

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:15.300
 On what? It would take me more than three minutes to run in and get one.

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:17.300
 That's a round I couldn't say.

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:19.300
 Dear, I wonder where...

00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:20.300
 Mary.

00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:21.660
 Mary, where is your mother?

00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:23.460
 Father, where did you come from?

00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:24.700
 Where do you think I came from?

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:26.780
 Well, Mother just went around after you.

00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:28.100
 Now, why did she do that for?

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:29.900
 So we wouldn't have to wait so long.

00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:30.600
 Where's Henry?

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:33.100
 He didn't start phoning me.

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:34.300
 What's that?

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:36.300
 Don't you think I ought to go in and tell him I'm here?

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:38.000
 You wait where you are. I'll go in.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.300
 He is, Father.

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:40.200
 Flowers.

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:42.000
 Flowers from Mother's Bay.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.800
 Fresh connish, son.

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:46.300
 Mother, I'm going to meet another n--

00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:47.300
 She, whiz Mary.

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:48.200
 Where's Mother?

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:49.700
 She's gone after Father.

00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:51.100
 Where's father?

00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:52.500
 She thought you were phone me!

00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:54.300
 Yeah, but Mary, I couldn't get you.

00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:56.100
 Course you couldn't!

00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:57.200
 How about get father?

00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:58.600
 How long will he be gone?

00:10:58.600 --> 00:10:59.900
 Two minutes.

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:02.200
 And, oh, Kathleen, phone you at the house!

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:03.700
 What did she want?

00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:06.100
 Henry, did you tell her you couldn't come to dinner?

00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:08.000
 Sure I did. I left the message with the maid.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.700
 Well, Kathleen, it's nothing new!

00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:11.100
 She wished she couldn't be...

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:13.500
 She's Harry, if they'll, Candice, or Mother's Day.

00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:15.900
 Listen, Mr. You're gonna be here for a few minutes.

00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:16.800
 Uh, yeah.

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:19.200
 Well, could you deliver a message for me?

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:25.180
 If you see a lady or a man or my sister looking for a phone, a brown suit like this,

00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:28.380
 could you tell him I just stopped into phone a second?

00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:48.260
 Well, now friends, while Henry is reflecting on his latest predicament,

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:53.360
 I'd like to bring you a news item about something that happened the other night in one of Pentaville's finest fans.

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:58.360
 They headline reads, "Permanent local man trapped in raid."

00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:07.060
 And the article goes on to read, "Last night, about 1130, one of Pentaville's leading citizens was surprised by his wife,

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:13.760
 just as he had tiptoeed to the kitchen, raided the refrigerator, and finished eating a dish of pudding.

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:17.160
 Jello butterscotch pudding that had been left over from dinner.

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:23.160
 His wife was desolated as she had been planning to eat the Jello butterscotch pudding today for lunch.

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:25.660
 But the culprit showed no remorse.

00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:27.960
 When questioned, he merely kept repeating.

00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:29.160
 I'm glad I did it.

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:30.760
 Yes, and I do it again.

00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:34.160
 I simply can't resist Jello butterscotch pudding.

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:44.060
 Well friends, seriously, that is just another way of saying that Jello butterscotch pudding is a dish that people won't be denied.

00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:48.980
 I probably it has something to do with the grand buttery brown sugar flavor of this

00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:53.300
 swelled dessert and the fact that Jello butter scotch pudding is as smooth as rich

00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:58.380
 golden cream undoubtedly plays a big part in its appeal. At any rate this

00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:01.940
 mellow treat is a mealtime favorite in thousands of homes the country over and

00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:07.220
 I'm sure you'll find it's your favorite too. So try some real soon. You've

00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:13.420
 honestly never tasted a more luscious dessert than Jello butter scotch pudding.

00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:25.420

00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:27.420
 Well now getting back to Henry Olbridge.

00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:33.420
 Henry has just learned that although he's going out with his family, Kathleen is expecting him for dinner.

00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:36.420
 This scene opens in Kathleen Madison's home.

00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:38.420

00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:39.420
 Hello?

00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:40.420
 Hello?

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:42.420
 Is that you, Kathleen?

00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:46.920
 Yes Henry, did Mary tell you we're having dinner at 7 and 7 at 6.30?

00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:50.720
 Yes, didn't your maid tell you? I'm going out for dinner with my mother.

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:51.720
 Henry!

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:54.420
 If you think you'll understand, Kathleen?

00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:56.420
 Do you have to go with your mother?

00:13:56.420 --> 00:13:58.920
 I'm taking her. I'm a host.

00:13:58.920 --> 00:13:59.920
 Oh.

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:05.920
 I'll tell you what I might try. Perhaps I could eat with her real fastly and then come up to your house.

00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:08.420
 Well, wouldn't that make you late?

00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:10.920
 What's the latest I could get there and still eat?

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:16.920
 Well, well, well, well, well, well, I guess when you stop to think of a Kathleen, maybe that would be time to do too much.

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:18.920
 Kathleen, who are you talking?

00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:24.920
 Mother, can we overline? Mother, can we can't come mix that a day night?

00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:28.920
 Oh, no. He's having dinner with his mother. Why don't you have photos of him come?

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:30.920
 Are you sure next Saturday night will be all alone?

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:31.920
 Yes, of course.

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:32.920
 Hello, Henry!

00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:33.920
 Yes.

00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:36.920
 Can we, my mother says to bring your mother too.

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:40.920
 Kathleen, what do I do with my father and Mary?

00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:43.920
 What? Well, who overlines it the second, Henry?

00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:46.920
 Mother, yes. Could we ask Mr. O'Rigin Mary to?

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:49.920
 Well, as a matter of fact, I think we should have them.

00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:50.920
 Hello, Henry!

00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:53.920
 Well, Mother thinks you bring the whole family.

00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:57.920
 Oh, Kathleen, I don't think you should go to all that trouble.

00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:00.920
 No, really, Henry. Mother, be very much offended if you didn't.

00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:05.920
 Well, they're awaiting at the department store for me, I think.

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:08.520
 If you don't hear from me, you'll know we're coming.

00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:09.520
 Alright.

00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:11.520
 You understand about the time, Henry?

00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:12.520
 Oh, sure.

00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:13.520
 Seven o'clock.

00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:14.520
 Goodbye, Kathleen.

 20 minutes past six.

00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:30.720
 To that man say how long it would be before Henry got back.

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:31.720
 No, dear.

00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:35.120
 And when Father go, your father went down the street to get the car.

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:37.200
 That was 35 minutes ago.

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:39.160
 Would you like to have me get down and find him?

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:39.760
 No, dear.

00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:42.560
 We're not going to beat this family up again.

00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:47.800
 Well, I'm also sorry to start close before I could get your blouse.

00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:49.480
 That's all right, dear.

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:52.000
 Just as long as we all finally get back together.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.160
 He's starting to rain.

00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:57.040
 Goodness.

00:15:57.040 --> 00:16:00.400
 Yes, it's a good thing we didn't buy any new clothes, Miss Dio.

00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:04.200
 Though, please remember, I still have on the best I own.

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:08.160
 - Come on, we'll step out into this entrance before you're down.

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:10.280
 Well, we said one consolation.

00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:12.160
 Well, I'm glad you can see one.

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:14.160
 The rest of it we're going to after the movie

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:15.600
 says, "Well, oh."

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:17.680
 (buzzer)

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:19.640
 Look, look, see him in here, you're a major father.

00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:21.360
 Let's run out and get in the car.

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:23.480
 - Are you okay, fellas?

00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:25.280
 - Open the door, Sam.

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:26.400
 Get in, mother.

00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:27.240
 - Now, wait, Henry.

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:28.240
 - We don't know, Sam.

00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:29.080
 - We'll get in and out.

00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:31.040
 - We can't go off and leave him.

00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:32.560
 - No, you're getting over there.

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:34.560
 Everybody can get something.

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:36.060
 - Turkey can't talk here, that is.

00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:37.020
 - Well, then what if you and Father

00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:38.760
 are heading off Bayview?

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:40.960
 - No, Mary, you get in and I'll say.

00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:42.640
 - Both of you get in.

00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:44.280
 - Father, can't you come up close

00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:45.240
 to the person outside?

00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:46.580
 Father, go on.

00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:47.840
 - This is a narrow street, Mary.

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:49.680
 The only way that Father can get around me

00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:50.880
 is to go up on the sidewalk.

00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:51.720
 - Oh, get in.

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:52.880
 Come on, Mary.

00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:53.720
 - Hold the door.

00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:55.040
 - Yes, Sam.

00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:56.520
 So what do we do now?

00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:58.020
 - We've got to get out of here.

00:16:58.020 --> 00:16:59.920
 (motor whirring)

00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:00.760
 Hey!

00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:02.080
 Get moving there!

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:04.080
 Oh, not at all.

00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:06.080
 What is the problem?

00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:09.080
 Mary, must you just sit and ask questions.

00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:11.080
 Mary, no chocolate, sir.

00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:14.080
 No, no, I do not want to make any chocolate.

00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:16.080
 Okay, okay.

00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:18.080
 You better call your father.

00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:21.080
 Is that all, Sam?

00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:23.080
 No, Sam, please.

00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:25.080
 Don't say I haven't been moving.

00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:27.080
 Oh, Sam, stop!

00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:29.080
 Now what's the matter?

00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:31.680
 - Mother, you said stop! - Now what's the matter?

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:32.880
 - Please, Henry! - Yeah!

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:34.880
 - Is this newspaper? - What?

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:36.580
 - For...

00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:39.380
 - Wait for me! - Stop, Sam!

00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:41.380
 - I can't stop here! - Come on!

00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:44.380
 - Come on! - Come on, Henry!

00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:47.380
 - Come on! - No, here's the place I can pull in.

00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:49.380
 - Henry! - Wait for me!

00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:50.380
 Wait for me!

00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:51.380
 I tell you the good news.

00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:53.380
 - No time for good news. Get in the car.

00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:55.380
 - Could you move over, Mary?

00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:58.380
 - Henry, why didn't you leave that wet newspaper outside?

00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:01.780
 I found two ways. Wait until I tell you the news.

00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:04.380
 Henry, older, you simply spoke to the skin.

00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:07.380
 Mother, this is gonna be a swell Mother's day yet.

00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:10.180
 We've all got an invitation to go to Kathleen's for dinner.

00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:11.080
 Really, Henry?

00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:11.580
 Sure.

00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:12.880
 You're living the older to be couldn't have.

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:15.380
 The Mother I just got through talking with Kathleen.

00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:17.680
 Trevor, you're drinking water all over me.

00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:20.380
 Well, I can't help where it runs, Mary.

00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:24.380
 The only thing I can do was sit still and let it go where it wants.

00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:25.880
 How about it, Mom?

00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:30.980
 They couldn't have asked us for tonight mother Kathleen stood there by the phone and begged us to come tonight

00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:36.280
 What do you think Sam? Don't leave it up to him mother. This is your party up to now

00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:39.980
 You haven't had a good time at all, but this way you can have a wonderful evening

00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:44.840
 What are you gonna do with all the money you save Henry? I'm not going to save a cent Mary

00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:48.680
 I've got it all figured out and getting mother addressed with my money

00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:53.880
 Well, Sam pull up some place and I'll tell a phone and make sure mother if you're phone or you'll only be wasting your

00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:56.320
 Well are we are aren't we going?

00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:57.920
 What do you think Sam?

00:18:57.920 --> 00:18:59.120
 It's up to you Alice.

00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:01.880
 My parents have awfully good food at the end.

00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:02.880
 Of course they do.

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:04.320
 They are love to go there.

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:05.320
 And there you are.

00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:06.560
 I'll make up your mind Alice.

00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:08.560
 Sam I don't like mother.

00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:10.720
 How many mothers days are there in a year?

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:11.720
 One.

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:12.720
 One.

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:13.720
 Yes Officer.

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:15.720
 We're just making up our minds.

00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:16.720
 No I'd like to tell Sam.

00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:18.720
 You will learn to go on.

00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:21.720
 And I guess off the third we are.

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:24.120
 Hello Father, we're going to the Aniston!

00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:26.020
 And boy am I hungry!

00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:28.020
 You're not any hungry as I am!

00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:45.520
 Mother!

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:47.020
 Mother!

00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:48.120
 Yes, Captain?

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:49.920
 Can I help you with the dishes?

00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:53.320
 Oh no, no, thank you. They're all wiped and put away.

00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:55.920
 Anybody seen the evening papers?

00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:57.920
 It's in a big chair, Father.

00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:01.920
 Ah, I've been looking forward to just sitting around the night.

00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:04.920
 Robert, do you want Kathleen to go out and get your slippers?

00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:06.920
 Oh dear, I got them on.

00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:08.920
 Where did I put my necktie?

00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:09.920
 Oh, in the land.

00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:11.920
 No, yes, yes.

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:14.920
 I always did like this chair.

00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:17.920
 Now, Kathleen, I want you to go out and do your homework.

00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:19.920
 Oh, my goodness.

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:24.920
 Oh, would you look at the dust on this keyboard?

00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:31.920
 You know, Robert, I'm glad we let that made go.

00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:37.920
 Oh, Robert?

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:38.920
 Hello?

00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:41.920
 I look here when the overtures come next Saturday.

00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:44.920
 Let's have everything just as nice as we know how.

00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:47.920
 - Yeah, do it up brown.

00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:49.920
 (sighs)

00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:52.920
 Isn't it nice that I've won a year of home?

00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:53.920
 - Mm-hmm.

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:54.920
 - Mm-hmm.

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:55.920
 - Mm-hmm.

00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:56.920
 - Mm-hmm.

00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:58.920
 - See, the Dodgers won today.

00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:00.920
 (laughing)

00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:02.920
 - Did I hear the doorbell ring?

00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:04.920
 - Now, who in the world is supposed to have it?

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:06.920
 - Well, it's probably Daniel.

00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:08.920
 - Well, I'm not gonna answer the doorbell.

00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:09.920
 - Well, I'm going to run up there.

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:10.920
 - Now listen, Harvey.

00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:13.920
 Daniel isn't going to notice those curlers.

00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:23.920
 Oh, all right, I'll go to the door. - I know, you stop him. - Well, now, where's my other slipper? - It's way there underneath your chair.

00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:32.920
 - Oh, come in. Come in, the door's unlocked. - Let him in and find you slipper later. - Oh, look at the ashes all over my face.

00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:42.920
 - Hello there, Mr. Anderson. - Hello, Bob. - Well, well, hello. - Is there a way for us to drop in?

00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:44.920
 No, no, no, not at all.

00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:46.920
 So where is it?

00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:48.920
 The Oracles.

00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:52.920
 Oh, well, why don't you welcome to come in?

00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:54.920
 They are in.

00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:56.920
 Oh, no, they're Dorothy.

00:21:56.920 --> 00:22:00.920
 Well, Alice and Sam and everyone.

00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:02.920
 How do you do, Mr. Anderson?

00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:07.920
 Oh, look, you might as well put your things down and let's all go into the living room.

00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:08.920
 Living room?

00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:11.920
 Goodness, Alice, I was just going upstairs to take these curlers.

00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:13.920
 Dorothy you look lovely.

00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:15.920
 No, here we are.

00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:16.920
 Thank you, Grandma.

00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:17.920
 We didn't go to the movie.

00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:19.920
 Yes indeed.

00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:22.920
 Sit down, everyone.

00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:24.920
 No mind if I do.

00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:26.920
 No luck.

00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:29.920
 How's business?

00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:32.920
 Oh, pretty good.

00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:34.920
 How's yours?

00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:36.920
 Fair.

00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:38.920
 Well, not fair.

00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:39.920
 I'm sorry.

00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:42.240
 Okay. Did I interrupt you Sam?

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:43.920
 No, no, no. I interrupted you.

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:45.160
 Oh, no. You didn't.

00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:46.920
 What were you going to say?

00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:50.320
 Well, the fact is that I don't remember what I was going to say.

00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:54.120
 Well, I was going to ask Alice what movie she was going to see.

00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:56.120
 "Stog for love."

00:22:56.120 --> 00:23:00.120
 Oh. Oh, my dear, they tell me that's the most beautiful picture.

00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:02.120
 Is that the view?

00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:04.120
 Yes.

00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:06.120
 [laughter]

00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:10.720
 Mr. Dan, is Kathleen out in the kitchen sort of helping you?

00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:13.520
 No, no, she's upstairs, studying.

00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:15.520
 - Oh, is that fine? - Yes.

00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:19.520
 - Uh, have a cigar, same? - Oh, no.

00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:22.520
 No, thank you. Not just before...

00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:27.520
 - No, dear. - No, dear.

00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:30.920
 It's eye-cathling. - Oh, the day, baby!

00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:32.120
 I'll be right back.

00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:35.120
 Robert, would you mind opening the window just in age or two?

00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:39.080
 You see we had steak and onions, but then I'm said the whole for little be the same

00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:42.440
 Steak and onions

00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:46.600
 Do you like some Henry oh boy do I

00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:50.200
 Mother's very fond of them too

00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:56.240
 Alice I want to show you something this box Kathleen gave me for mother's name. Isn't that lovely?

00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:58.840
 Why is it mrs. Handich? I have no idea, Maris

00:23:58.840 --> 00:24:01.440
 Looks like candy to me

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:06.040
 Well, if it is, I should never promise Kathleen I wouldn't open it till tomorrow.

00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:08.040
 You did promise her?

00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:11.640
 Mother, did you come upstairs and help me in the day?

00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:13.640
 Alice, would you excuse me, of course.

00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:20.440
 Well, if you pardon me, I'll go out to the kitchen and see whether we have any titties or any unfurled.

00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:23.440
 Oh, Bob, don't bother. We just had dinner.

00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:25.440
 Oh, sir, Mary, supposing I could hear you.

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:28.940
 Well, Henry, so we invited you up for dinner.

00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:31.940
 Some place there's been a very serious mistake.

00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:32.940
 [laughter]

00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:34.940
 That will be putting it mildly.

00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:37.940
 And this is the most embarrassing moment I've ever had.

00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:39.940
 Thank for us the terrific get out of here.

00:24:39.940 --> 00:24:41.940
 Well I think we should stay long enough to be polite.

00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:43.940
 Stay mother as hungry as I am.

00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:46.940
 You're not any hungrier than the rest of us, Henry.

00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:48.940
 Oh I had belonged to the cup of tea.

00:24:48.940 --> 00:24:50.940
 And I didn't have anything.

00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:53.940
 Supposing Alice we run on before they discover the mistake we've made.

00:24:53.940 --> 00:24:56.940
 Father, Father, do you mind if I make a suggestion?

00:24:56.940 --> 00:25:03.940
 I do. Alice will tell him this holiday but we're going to run on to the movies and as soon as we get away we'll go get some dinner.

00:25:03.940 --> 00:25:07.940
 And have a sort of apology to make you folks an afraid.

00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:08.940
 Oh, what's the trouble, Bond?

00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:12.940
 Well, here's the ginger ale. Everybody don't have any ice.

00:25:12.940 --> 00:25:17.940
 No, no, listen, Baba, I give you my word, not one of us could drink a thing.

00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:19.940
 And besides, we're going to have to know...

00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:20.940
 Great idea, indeed.

00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:29.300
 They thought there's a lot of fear. Tomorrow, the Mother's Day, we told Alice we were coming here, but we're really taking her to the movie.

00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:31.420
 Well, well, isn't that love?

00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:32.420
 Yeah.

00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:34.860
 Bob, why don't you and I get on, I think, go mother?

00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:36.420
 [LAUGHTER]

00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:37.260
 Good idea.

00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:39.180
 And then they get a new thing together.

00:25:39.180 --> 00:25:41.700
 But Mrs. Anderson, let me explain something.

00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:42.220
 Can't agree?

00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:44.020
 But Mother, it's Henry!

00:25:44.020 --> 00:25:45.740
 Yes, Mother.

00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:48.780
 Mrs. Anderson, we'd be very glad to have you come along.

 Yes, Dorothy, and it's been the best Mother's Day party I ever had in my life.

00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:15.280
 Would you like another hamburger, Mother?

00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:16.280
 No, thank you.

00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:18.280

00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:26.360
 Just to learn my idea of yours that we drop into this little hamburger thing

00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:33.080
 Thank you, mr. Anderson. I haven't been in one of these places in years. I love them Sam and I used to drop in all the time

00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:39.440
 Oh, mr. May I have the check please? Oh now Henry. I don't pay the check the movies were on you

00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:42.480
 But mr. Anderson this whole evening has been on me

00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:45.320
 Yes, and they it's certainly

 If there's the next time that you want to give a party, there's no need to send out invitations.

00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:13.320
 You just drop the word here and there that you're planning to make some jello pudding with.

00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:17.320
 And before you can say come in, you have a house full of smiling guests.

00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:20.320

00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:22.320

 You just take one package of jello, any flavor,

00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:32.320
 and one package of jello vanilla pudding,

00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:34.320
 and make them up as you usually do.

00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:38.320
 Then chill the jello, and whip it as directed on the box.

00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:40.320
 Next, you chill the jello vanilla pudding,

00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:45.360
 of vanilla pudding and add it to the fruit jello, beating constantly until it's blended.

00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:52.160
 Then mold. And there you have a grand, inexpensive treat, serving 10 to 12 people and simply ideal

00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:57.120
