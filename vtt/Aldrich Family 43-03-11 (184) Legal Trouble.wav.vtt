00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.600
 Henry! Henry Aldrich!

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:16.560
 Coming, mother!

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.840

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:28.320
 Postum. Postum presents the Aldrich family written by Clifford Goldsmith and starring Ezra Stone.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.320
 Entertainment for All the Family brought to you by Postam, attempting wholesome drink for All the Family.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:56.320
 Friends, before we join the Aldrich family, let's imagine that the little voice we all have within could actually speak to us out loud.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.720
 voice ever say anything like this. Why do you keep putting it off? You know you're

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:06.200
 nervous, so why don't you do something about it? Yes, if your nerves are on edge

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.240
 you should certainly do something about it. For instance, if it happens that coffee

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.120
 makes you nervous, you could easily correct matters by drinking post-em instead.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.520
 You see, even though many people can drink coffee without getting nervous, many

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.560
 others and you may be among them, cannot. So if you think coffee sets your nerves on

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.840
 Switch to post them as your regular mealtime drink.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.360
 Post them contains no stimulants, nothing that could cause nervousness.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.560
 Just drink fragrant flavor for post them instead of coffee.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.160
 And then after giving post them a fair trial,

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.760
 see if that nervous jittery feeling isn't gone.

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.960
 See if you don't feel so swell again that your inner voice says,

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.760
 "Be smart. Stay with Post them for good."

00:01:46.760 --> 00:02:05.760
 [Music]

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.760
 In the comfortable White House at 117 Elm Street, Centerville, USA,

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:14.760
 live friends and neighbors of yours, the Aldrich family.

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.620
 They live the same calm ordered existence that any family with a high school boy leaves

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.860
 And if you know Henry Aldrich or any teenage boy, you know what that means

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.080
 Our scene opens at the Aldrich breakfast table

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:32.540
 Henry if I were you I wouldn't eat quite so fast, but mother I'm late here. You have plenty of time

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.440
 It isn't ten minutes to age, but mother I have to attend to something on the way to school

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.480
 May I have a piece of toast please? Yes, then father

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.680
 Would you mind if I should ask you a sort of a technical question? What about well

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.680
 Well, do you find in your law practice that most people get convicted?

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:48.680
 Of what?

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.680
 Well, of anything.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.680
 Say you're arrested, seat, and you're...

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.680
 Well, what are your chances?

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.680
 Henry, what are you talking about?

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.680
 Nothing, mother. It isn't anything.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.680
 I guess I'll have a piece of toast, too.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:02.680
 Here you are.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.680
 Is there quite a market for bicycles these days, do you know?

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:06.680
 I don't know why.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.680
 I was just wondering if a used bicycle brings much money.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:10.680
 Why?

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:17.720
 Well, I'll tell you, Father, when a case comes up in court, I'm not speaking of anything specific.

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:18.640
 What about it?

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.880
 When a case does come up, Father, is it usually announced in the newspapers?

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.260
 Henry, why?

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.720
 Oh, no reason. No reason.

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.520
 Well, that was a very nice breakfast.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:29.280
 Where are you going?

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.840
 No place. I just had to decide I'd like to put in a telephone call.

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:33.400
 Sam?

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.940
 Well...

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:35.740
 You think Henry's studying too hard?

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:36.640
 I'll make your pardon?

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.380
 He isn't himself, dear. Something is definitely on his mind.

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:40.280
 That makes you say that.

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.280
 Well, when Henry comes down to breakfast and his mind isn't on his food,

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.780
 and look, he didn't even touch his banana.

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.080
 No, give it to me.

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.780
 Sam, I don't see how you can sit there and eat his banana and not even be worried.

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:51.780
 Pass me that toast.

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.380
 I'm going to stop worrying. It's short in your life.

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:57.780
 But why would he ask the questions he did about being tried in court or something?

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.980
 Alice, I get questions like that every day.

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.480
 Well, so long, everybody. I got to get started.

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.380
 Henry, you can't start for school this early.

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:05.780
 For mother, it's important.

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.380
 What's that you have in that package?

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.180
 Why, it's just something I have to...

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.480
 I'm going to... I bought it at the hardware store. Goodbye. Goodbye.

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.480
 Bye. Boy, have I got a hurry.

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.480
 - Sam. - Well...

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.480
 Why do you suppose he just put in that phone call?

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.480
 I have no idea. You have any more toast, Made?

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:26.480
 Who do you suppose that is? I don't know, but it certainly isn't anything to get upset about.

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.480
 Well, dear, I'm not upset. I'm simply wondering.

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.480
 Hello? Hello? Is Henry there? No, he isn't.

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.480
 Well, Mrs. Aldrich, this is Homer. Has Henry left already?

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.480
 Oh, well that's good.

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.480
 Homer, did Henry just call you?

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:41.480
 This morning?

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:42.480
 Yes, dear.

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:43.480
 No.

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.480
 No, did he put in a phone call?

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:46.480
 I don't know.

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:47.480
 Why did he leave so early?

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:48.480
 Why?

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.480
 I'd rather not say Mrs. Aldrich.

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.480
 There's no sense in y'all worrying too.

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:53.480
 What's that?

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:54.480
 Goodbye.

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:55.480
 Homer.

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:56.480
 Homer?

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:57.480
 Sam.

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.480
 Why did Homer want?

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:01.480
 He says I must worry.

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:04.060
 (upbeat music)

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:13.520
 - Sam, can you answer the door?

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.120
 - I'm getting ready to leave for the office.

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.220
 - Oh, very well.

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:20.200
 Good morning, Alice.

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.080
 - Why, Harriet, what are you doing over here?

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:22.920
 - Yes, I am here.

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:24.600
 I wanna have talk with both of you.

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:25.440
 - Sam?

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:26.280
 - Yes.

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:27.120
 - Can you come here?

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.320
 - I'm coming, but I can't stop.

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:30.520
 - Then I'll go and try to have a talk with you, Sam.

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:33.040
 What happened? Well, I don't know just where to begin.

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:34.480
 Are you having trouble with the bank again?

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.480
 It isn't the bank. It's your son.

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:39.440
 Henry? Sam, I knew all the time something had happened.

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.200
 Alice, he hasn't even told you what it is.

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:42.600
 How can I if you don't sit down?

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.000
 I can't possibly sit down, Harry. I'm late as it is.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.640
 Sam, sit down and stop taking this lightly.

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:49.360
 Very well. I'm down.

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:54.000
 Now, then, Henry told me a little while ago and asked whether he could come over and have a talk.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.600
 - Henry called you? - Yes.

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.400
 And when he got there, he kept saying,

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:01.280
 Now does anything to worry about, Anne-Harry? Nothing to worry about at all.

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.480
 So naturally, I started to worry.

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:04.280
 About what?

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:08.360
 You want to know whether he can have some mail sent to my house instead of over here at your house.

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:11.400
 And I said yes, never suspecting for a minute.

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:12.400
 Never suspecting what?

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:13.880
 I'm coming to that.

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:18.400
 And then he said, when it comes, Anne-Harry, it'll come in somebody else's name.

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:18.880
 Yes.

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:20.120
 And I said yes.

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:21.960
 And then I said, whose name?

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:25.560
 And he said, are Mr. W. Webbers.

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:26.400
 Who's Mr. Webbers?

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:28.200
 When do you let me tell this?

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:29.000
 I beg your pardon?

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.360
 And he said I'm as proud as not to say word to anybody.

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:34.000
 But who is this, Mr. Weber?

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
 That Sam, where are you going?

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.800
 I just wanted to make sure I have my briefcase.

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:39.200
 Sam, it's right here on this table.

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:39.840
 Oh, fine.

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:40.200
 Thanks.

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:41.200
 Now where was I?

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:43.200
 You just promised Henry you wouldn't tell anybody.

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:43.800
 Oh, yes.

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:46.000
 Well, Sam, you aren't leaving, are you?

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
 I'm sorry, Alice, but I have things to do.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.600
 You mean I came over here just for nothing?

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:51.000
 No, not at all.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.400
 What you said is very interesting.

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:52.900
 Really?

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:53.400
 Yes.

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:54.600
 Tell Alice some more.

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.000
 It'll take her mind off her troubles.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.000
 Goodbye.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.000
 Goodbye, dear.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:04.000
 Well, Alice, do you think Sam takes his family as seriously as he should?

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.000
 Bye, Harriet.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
 Well, would you mind if I'd use your phone?

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.000
 Oh, no, not at all.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.000
 Alice, you're pale.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
 Well, I felt fine when I got up this morning.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.000
 Number three.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.000
 Now, wait a minute.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
 I know you were going to jump at me that fast.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.000
 Number three.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
 I'm looking it up for you.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
 No, that's not it.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
 It's L661R2.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.580
 L-661-R-2.

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:29.180
 Operator, did you hear me?

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:30.480
 I'm ringing your number.

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:31.140
 Oh.

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:31.980
 Hello?

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:33.540
 Hello, is this Mrs. Brown?

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:33.980
 Yeah?

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:35.580
 Well, this is Harriet Bryan.

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:37.180
 I don't want to worry you, Mrs. Brown,

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:39.180
 but have Homer left for school?

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:40.180
 Yes, he has.

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:42.420
 Well, tell me, Homer and Henry

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:44.320
 see a great deal of each other, don't they?

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:44.780
 Yes.

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:45.780
 They do.

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:47.820
 Well, this Homer seemed to be worried lately

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:48.980
 about Henry, I mean.

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:50.520
 About Henry, what for?

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:51.920
 Well, how's he been about himself?

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:53.720
 Well, you know how boys always are.

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:55.480
 Yes, I know how boys are.

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:57.720
 And don't you worry, them as is brown.

00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:58.320
 What about?

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:01.320
 Not a thing, but if I hear of anything else, I'll call you back!

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:10.800
 Wait Henry, wait.

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:13.000
 Homer, do you want me to be late for school again?

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.160
 And Henry, if Mr. Bull sees us, you'll grab us.

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:18.200
 She whiz, why does he have to live right across from the school?

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:19.160
 I can't help it.

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:23.000
 All I know is we can't cross the street to go to school until after he leaves his house.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.920
 about what time does he start for his office?

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:27.040
 - Any minute now, we're only 10 minutes late.

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:28.560
 - Boy, if there's one man in this town

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:30.640
 that can lose his temper, it's Mr. Bull.

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:32.360
 - Well, Gee, did you find out how much

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:33.440
 it can get for the bicycle?

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:35.400
 - Oh yeah, all we can get is eight dollars.

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:37.080
 - Well, that's a nice thing Henry.

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:39.280
 Gee, whizzer, we in a fix.

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:41.860
 (upbeat music)

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:53.580
 Alice! Alice, where are you?

00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:54.980
 Is that you down there, Harriet?

00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:56.380
 It is. Come down.

00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:58.980
 Goodness, I didn't expect to see you over here again this morning.

00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:00.980
 It's come, Alice. It's come.

00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:02.880
 What has a letter? What are you supposed to do?

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:03.580
 Have you opened it?

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:05.980
 I have not. I decided you'd be the one to read it.

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:10.080
 Well, my gracious, I don't think that I should open a letter that isn't even addressed to me, Harriet.

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:11.280
 Why not? Here.

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:15.880
 W. Webber Esquire, care of Harriet Breyer, 11 Walnut.

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:17.880
 Harriet, let me sit down for a minute.

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:20.480
 Come think of it. Maybe I'd better open it and read it for you.

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:21.640
 Maybe I can ease the shock.

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:22.180
 The shock?

00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:25.040
 Harriet, I think we should wait until Sam gets home and let him open.

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:27.220
 Now, Alice, you know we added you, Sam, will take.

00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:29.820
 You just laughed the whole thing and probed with the fireplace.

00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:32.020
 I think we should have it open when he gets here.

00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:33.720
 We can tell him what's in it.

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:34.620
 Harriet, there's a phone.

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:35.620
 I'll answer it.

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:37.760
 You'll just sit here and get a hold of yourself.

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:38.420
 No, thank you.

00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:40.160
 I think it's much better that I answer it.

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:41.560
 It's better to more bad news.

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:43.100
 If it is, I might as well know it.

00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:44.860
 Well, do you mind if I listen?

00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:45.740
 Hello?

00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:47.200
 Hello, is this Mrs. Orridge?

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:47.800
 Yes?

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:50.000
 Well, Mrs. Orridge, this is Homer Brown's mother.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:50.680
 Yes?

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:53.120
 I've just been trying to get your sister in. She doesn't dance.

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:54.000
 Come on here.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.380
 Why, she's right here.

00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:59.060
 Well, I happen to think about something about Henry.

00:09:59.060 --> 00:09:59.940
 About Henry?

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:01.880
 Henry, see, Alice?

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:06.400
 Well, the school said to know home the other day, telling us that Homer's been arriving late every morning.

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:09.200
 And so we've been having him start earlier and earlier.

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:09.700
 Yes?

00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:11.260
 Alice, I'm going to get a chair.

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:14.300
 But the earlier Homer starts, the later he seems to get to school.

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:14.940
 Yes?

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:19.000
 And just a few minutes ago, the school phone and said that Homer was late again this morning.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.500
 You don't say so.

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:21.800
 Well, miss something.

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:23.600
 What time did Henry leave this morning?

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:25.200
 About ten minutes to eight.

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:26.800
 And so did Homer.

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:30.000
 And what I want to know is where those two boys go morning.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.500
 Well, Mrs. Brown, what's your theory?

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:35.100
 Alice, give me that phone while I tell her what mine is.

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:45.700
 Henry, where's the letter we started to write?

00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:47.400
 It's right here in my Latin book, Homer.

00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:48.900
 Well, let's see what you said so far.

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:50.100
 You know what I said.

00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:51.500
 Well, can't you let me see it?

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:52.500
 Here.

00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:57.400
 Dear sir, for several days my friend and I have been waiting for your legal advice,

00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:00.400
 which we requested in a letter describing our jam.

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:01.900
 Did you write jam, Henry?

00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:03.900
 You think I better change it to mess?

00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:04.900
 Yes.

00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:05.900
 Go on.

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:08.400
 Homer, wouldn't you think you'd answer the first one by now?

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:09.400
 Henry, go on.

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:09.900
 Where was I?

00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:10.900
 In a mess.

00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:11.900
 Oh.

00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:14.900
 Would you please advise us about fees?

00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:16.900
 A, if we win, B, if we lose.

00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:18.660
 if we lose. If we lose Henry.

00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:21.300
 Well, gee, Homer, Mr. Bowes an influential man.

00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:22.900
 You mean after going to all this trouble,

00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:24.900
 are folks still me find out?

00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:27.640
 (dramatic music)

00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:36.180
 - Any letters to be signed, Miss Thompson?

00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:37.180
 - No, Mr. Olbridge.

00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:38.940
 - Any phone calls? Well, I have a lot for lunch.

00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:41.180
 - Yes, Mrs. Olbridge. Mrs. Olbridge phoned once

00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:43.220
 and later her sister, Harriet Brier, phoned.

00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:44.580
 - Any message? - No, sir.

00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:47.020
 Mrs. Aldrich said she was just leaving the house.

00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:48.340
 It might have been my imagination,

00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:50.300
 but she seemed very much upset about something.

00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:51.580
 - Well, if her sister was still there,

00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:52.700
 she probably was upset.

00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:53.540
 - Yes?

00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:55.180
 - Harriet, Brian ought to do what I've decided to do.

00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:56.260
 Stop worrying.

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:59.060
 - And also, Mr. Bull phoned about 11.

00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:00.100
 - Bull?

00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:01.220
 Tracy Bull, what do you want?

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:02.540
 - He wanted to have a talk with you.

00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:03.380
 - What about it?

00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:04.220
 - I don't think he said.

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:05.700
 - Thank you.

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:07.660
 What's this law book doing on my desk?

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:10.260
 - Oh yes, Henry dropped in during lunch hour.

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:11.500
 - Henry, about his allowance?

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:13.220
 - No, sir, he didn't mention his allowance.

00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:14.900
 He said he came in to do some research.

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:15.820
 I see him.

00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:18.560
 He didn't seem to want to tell me what it was in regard to.

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:20.300
 He went over your shelves very carefully

00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:22.380
 and then picked out that book and sat down in a corner

00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:23.980
 and studied it for about 20 minutes.

00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:26.580
 I wonder what teacher would ask him to read a thing like this.

00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:27.500
 Which book is it?

00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:30.380
 Volume 12, Crimes and Offenses.

00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:32.580
 And where, whatever it is, it's a good thing his mother

00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:33.420
 doesn't know about it.

00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:33.920
 Why?

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:35.500
 You know, women, if they haven't anything,

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:37.660
 don't worry about they'll dig something up.

00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:39.860
 Sam, I'm sorry to bother you, but we've got to see you.

00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:40.300
 Alice.

00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:41.060
 Oh, Sam.

00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:43.020
 Harriet, what are you and Alice doing down here?

00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:45.420
 We're worrying, Sam, and you, should be.

00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:45.920
 Yes?

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:46.580
 Let's sit down.

00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:47.280
 What's on your mind?

00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:48.380
 It's Henry, Sam.

00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:48.720
 Yes?

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:50.700
 I had a phone call from the school a little while ago,

00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:50.960
 Sam.

00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:52.780
 Mr. Bradley wanted me to come up right away

00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:53.680
 and have a talk with him.

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:54.180
 Yes.

00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:56.580
 Sam, I don't like the way you keep saying yes.

00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:58.420
 You just wait until hours finish, hails.

00:12:58.420 --> 00:12:58.860
 Yes.

00:12:58.860 --> 00:12:59.580
 I mean, fine.

00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:01.620
 And Sam, when I went up there, they told me Henry had

00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:03.780
 been late to school almost every morning this week.

00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:04.260
 Yes?

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:04.940
 Yes.

00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:06.140
 Well, I'll have a talk with Henry

00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:07.300
 and tell him he must be more prompt.

00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:08.500
 Well, I like that.

00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:10.500
 Sam was sure it's more serious than that.

00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:12.020
 Now, Alice, you're worrying over something

00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:13.380
 It doesn't amount to a raw pin.

00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:14.480
 But dear, I can't help it.

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:15.480
 That's the way I see you.

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:17.060
 Can't imagine how I see you.

00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:17.720
 Why, honey?

00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:19.500
 I started all this, and if you don't believe it,

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:20.420
 take a look up there.

00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:20.900
 And what?

00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:23.060
 It's a letter that came in my mail this morning

00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:24.900
 to my house in care of me.

00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:26.860
 And I feel I had a perfect right to open it.

00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:27.340
 What is it?

00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:28.540
 Read it.

00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:30.060
 W Weber Esquire.

00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:30.500
 Who's he?

00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:32.140
 It's your own son.

00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:33.860
 And suppose he gets around town, Sam.

00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:37.380
 But there's a Mr. Weber getting mail at my house.

00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:37.940
 Yes, sir.

00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:39.300
 Yours of the 15s received.

00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:41.100
 I regret very much the pressure of other work

00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:45.180
 to them possible for me to consider your case. However, if it is as serious as

00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:48.340
 your letter would indicate, I would suggest that you get in touch with some

00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:52.360
 responsible lawyer at once. Why not, while in your own community, such as Mr.

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:56.500
 Samuel Orridge, who will I feel sure treats your trouble confidentially, your

00:13:56.500 --> 00:14:02.140
 truly Norton Adams of Henry Law. Sam. Yes. But what has Henry done? I thought you

00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:07.900
 weren't worried. I am not. I'm not. It's probably. It's just naturally. You prove

00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:10.600
 with that volume on crimes and offenses Henry was reading.

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:11.440
 Sam, what's there?

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:12.620
 Miss Thompson, what time is it?

00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:13.900
 15 minutes after three.

00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:15.900
 Please call the high school and see what Henry has left.

00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:33.620
 Well, things certainly don't look too good for Henry and Homer.

00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:36.020
 But since there's no real proof they've done anything wrong,

00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:37.580
 let's reserve judgment.

00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:44.340
 And if you will, consider the proof that Postam as a good hot meal time drink for all the family is just about tops,

00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:47.500
 just about the grandest feet you could hope to get.

00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:52.060
 And is there any better proof than that more and more folks are enjoying Postam every day,

00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:55.660
 that Postam's popularity is drawing by leaps and bounds?

00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:58.100
 Well, as a matter of fact, there is better proof.

00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:01.260
 Your own keen pleasure when you take your first sip,

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:04.340
 when you first raise a good hot cup of Postam to your lips,

00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:08.820
 and discover for yourself just what the words fragrance and flavor really mean.

00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:12.460
 Believe me, you'll bring in a verdict for a post-em, not because it tastes like coffee

00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:16.020
 for a dozen, any more than coffee tastes like tea.

00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:20.700
 But because post-em has a goodness of its own, a distinctive flavor is roundly satisfying

00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:22.820
 as anything you've tasted.

00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:25.660
 Now why not let your own taste tell you about post-em?

00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:28.300
 Yours and your families, including the children.

00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:32.700
 We can only tell you about the goodness of post-em, but you can enjoy it, and I'm sure

00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:48.300
 you will. Now getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldrich, Henry and his friend Homer

00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:53.420
 are in trouble. Just what the trouble is, their parents have been unable to figure out.

00:15:53.420 --> 00:16:00.380
 The scene opens on Aunt Harriet's front porch. Doesn't she seem to be home, Henry? I don't

00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:06.380
 Well, hello there. Hello, Anne Harriet. I'm sorry to bother you, but I wanted to ask you something.

00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:08.380
 Henry, why aren't you in school? School's over.

00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:10.380
 It's over. My goodness, what time is it? I don't know.

00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:13.380
 But it's over just the same, Miss Briar. What is it you want?

00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:16.380
 Well, do you remember when I dropped in for a second this morning?

00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:20.380
 I do. Well, I didn't leave a package, did I? A package? What was it?

00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:24.380
 Nothing. It was just... It was just...

00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:27.380
 It was just something we bought at the hardware store.

00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:32.380
 Oh, yes ma'am, and when I left the house this morning I had it with me now I can't find it.

00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:34.380
 I see, but you can't tell me what was in the package.

00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:37.380
 Oh, it wasn't anything. It was just a can of paint.

00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:39.380
 Paint? Black paint. Black?

00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:43.380
 Well, you didn't leave it here, and if you would excuse me, I'll go in the house.

00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:47.380
 Are you sure I did not? I thought I'd tell a phone somebody about something white this minute.

00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:53.380
 [music]

00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:56.380
 Yes, Harry. Yes, Harry.

00:16:56.380 --> 00:16:59.380
 Yes, Harriet, thank you for calling. Goodbye, Harriet.

00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:01.380
 Miss Thompson. Yes, Mr. Olrich.

00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:04.380
 Did you try to call the school? Yes, sir. The line's still busy.

00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:08.380
 Did you phone that attorney over in Middletown? Mr. Norton Adams, I called his office twice, Mr. Olrich,

00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:12.380
 and then I tried to reach him at court. Keep trying. In the meantime, I'll try one other place.

00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:15.380
 Number, please. Police headquarters. Police headquarters.

00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:19.380
 Miss Thompson, did you cancel all my other engagements for the day? Yes, Mr. Olrich.

00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:23.380
 Please headquarter, Sergeant Kelly speaking. Oh, Sergeant, this is Sam Olrich.

00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:24.380
 How are you Mr. Orridge?

00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:28.780
 As Argent, my boy hasn't gotten into any trouble down there, has he?

00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:30.180
 Oh, not that I know of.

00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:31.480
 I see.

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:33.480
 You looking for anyone but the name of Weber?

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:34.280
 Weber?

00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:35.580
 Double your Weber.

00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:37.680
 Any complaints filed against anyone but that name?

00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:39.880
 No, nothing against any Weber that I know of.

00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:40.880
 I see.

00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:42.480
 See, about how old is this Weber?

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:43.980
 Why he's...

00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:44.980
 not Henry's age.

00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:48.380
 Well, the only charges we have here are against two unidentified boys.

00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:50.080
 They are one, it fucked Eddie Larson.

00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:50.680
 Yes?

00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:52.280
 As for stealing bicycles.

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:53.280
 I see.

00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:54.680
 Did you say bicycles?

00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:55.380
 Yeah.

00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:56.580
 And you don't know who they are?

00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:57.180
 Not yet.

00:17:57.180 --> 00:17:58.480
 But we're working on it.

00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:00.280
 You know, it's always a hard thing to follow up.

00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:02.280
 Then kids get some paint and do the job over,

00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:03.480
 then you can't identify them.

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:03.880
 I see.

00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:06.180
 Well, if you find out who the boys are, let me know.

00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:06.680
 Of course.

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:07.180
 Goodbye.

00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:08.580
 Yeah, well, Chris Thompson.

00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:09.380
 Yes, Chris, you're all right.

00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:11.180
 See whether you can get Norton Adams at once.

00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:12.780
 Regardless of whether he's tied up in court,

00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:13.780
 I want to talk to him.

00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:22.780
 [Music]

00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:24.580
 Henry, is that you?

00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:26.380
 Yes, mother. It's Homer and I.

00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:28.180
 Did your father get you at school?

00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:29.180
 Was he at school?

00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:31.780
 No, Henry. He's trying to get you on the telephone.

00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:34.280
 Oh. Oh, I wonder why.

00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:37.280
 Well, I think it would be very much better if you let him tell you.

00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:37.880
 Oh.

00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:39.280
 Will you call him right away, please?

00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:40.780
 Well, I'll tell you, mother.

00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:42.580
 I think you'd better call him right away.

00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:43.580
 Yes, mother.

00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:46.580
 Homer, Henry, Henry, where are you going?

00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:48.580
 I'm on my way to the phone mother.

00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:49.580
 What's the matter, Henry?

00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:51.580
 Homer, I think my father knows about it.

00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:52.580
 What makes you think so?

00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:53.580
 Something tells me.

00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:54.580
 You're crazy, Henry.

00:18:54.580 --> 00:18:55.580
 Operator.

00:18:55.580 --> 00:18:56.580
 Operator.

00:18:56.580 --> 00:18:59.580
 He was though, if your father knows, do you suppose my nose?

00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:00.580
 Henry!

00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:01.580
 Yes, mother?

00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:05.580
 When you get your father, when you tell him Mr. Bull will be here at 530 to see you?

00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:06.580
 Mr. Bull?

00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:07.580
 He's coming here.

00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:08.580
 Number please.

00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:09.580
 Why, yeah.

00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:11.580
 My mother, what's father's number?

00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:20.940

00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:42.740
 Well, mr. Thompson do you know what it was about? Yes

00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:45.420

00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:49.540
 What was it? I think it would be better if you had the whole thing out with him. Oh

00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:56.540
 What did she say Henry? You'll see you when it gets home. Well, thank you. Goodbye

00:19:56.540 --> 00:20:00.380
 Homer, why do you have an extra bed over at your house?

00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:06.380
 Yeah, well look Homer. Why don't you invite me over and I'll take my pajamas see and when I get over there

00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:08.980
 I can call back and say you're begging me to stay.

00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:17.880
 Mr. Aldrich, is that you?

00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:19.680
 Yes, yes. Hello, Mr. Bow. Sit down.

00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:21.880
 No, your wife said I should wait for you here in the living room.

00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:24.180
 I'm sorry to have kept you waiting, but I got tied up in Middletown.

00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:26.080
 Oh, yes? Trying to get in touch with a lawyer there,

00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:28.580
 and I got over there only to find that he'd been called over here.

00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:31.480
 Well, I'm anxious to have a talk with you, Sam, if you have a minute.

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:32.280
 Yes, of course.

00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:34.780
 It's about a little deal I made with Ed Pratt.

00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:35.280
 Ed Pratt?

00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:37.680
 Yeah, I've practically to buy my car.

00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:39.880
 See, now he wants to run a gig on the deal.

00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:40.680
 What's the reason?

00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:42.980
 Because of a scratch on the fenders, Sam.

00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:44.480
 No bigger than that.

00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:46.680
 I bumped into a car that wasn't even moving.

00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:47.680
 Yeah?

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:49.480
 Yes, well, I lost my temper at the time,

00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:52.680
 but my wife calmed me down and I never thought anything more about it.

00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:53.680
 I see.

00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:54.680
 Yes, Alice?

00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:56.680
 Could I take a new out here just a moment?

00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:57.680
 Excuse me.

00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:00.080
 I'm sorry to interrupt you, but it's quite important.

00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:01.080
 What's going wrong?

00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:02.680
 I don't know, dear, but Harriet just boned

00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:04.480
 and she said she saw Henry going by her house

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:09.760
 with Homer a little while ago and Henry was carrying a suitcase. Mr. Bull, for that

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:12.560
 matter of yours waiting till tomorrow I've got to get busy on something right

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:14.760
 away.

00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:26.120
 Homer. Yes mother? I want to have a talk with you. The only thing is mother Henry's

00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:30.640
 waiting out in the hall. Homer why is Henry staying here tonight? Well he just

00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:32.760
 thought it would be a nice change for him.

00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:34.400
 Do the old did you know he's here?

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:36.320
 Well, not right this minute, mother,

00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:38.000
 but he's going to phone them.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.280
 Homer, do you have anything you'd like to tell me?

00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:42.480
 For me, in what way?

00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:44.840
 Are you sure Henry hasn't done anything he shouldn't have?

00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:45.840
 Mother.

00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:46.680
 Homer?

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:47.520
 Yes, Henry.

00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:49.680
 You want me to stay out here much longer?

00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:51.440
 You may come in now, dear.

00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:53.920
 Homer, would you remember not to become involved

00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:55.280
 in anything you're going to regret?

00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:56.080
 No, mother.

00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:59.560
 Boy, am I glad to be here, Mrs. Brown.

00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:00.800
 Why do you say that, Henry?

00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:01.440
 I don't know.

00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:03.400
 It's just the atmosphere here.

00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:05.520
 So relaxing.

00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:07.120
 Will you excuse me while I go to the door?

00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:08.280
 I'll go for you, Mother.

00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:09.040
 No, I'll go.

00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:11.360
 Mrs. Brown, if that's my father, would you mind telling him

00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:12.560
 I'm staying here tonight?

00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:13.960
 What's that?

00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:15.640
 Good evening, this day is this, Mrs. Brown.

00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:16.000
 Yes, sir?

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.200
 Well, I'm Sergeant Kelly from down at Priesthead Waters.

00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:20.040
 You have a son by the name of Homer, haven't you?

00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:20.480
 Homer?

00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:20.980
 Homer?

00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:21.320
 Homer.

00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:22.840
 I think my folks are worried about me.

00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:25.000
 I better go home.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.240
 I've been asked to try and find him and Henry Alders.

00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:28.000
 Henry?

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:28.720
 What, Homer?

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:30.720
 They've got us both.

00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:34.720
 [Music]

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:36.720
 Now Henry, suppose you tell all of us exactly what happened.

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:39.720
 But Father, why did you have me brought down here to the police station?

00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:41.720
 Because we couldn't find you. We didn't even know where you were.

00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:44.720
 Sergeant Callis tumbled into you. Now tell us exactly what you did.

00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:48.720
 Well, Henry, no matter what you've done, it's better for you to confess it and get it over.

00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:49.720
 Yes, Mother.

00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:51.720
 Henry, before you begin, could I say so?

00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:53.720
 You'll get your chance later. Henry Aldrich, now go ahead.

00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:56.720
 Well, it was this way.

00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:59.720
 It happened on the way to school one morning.

00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:02.720
 Henry, what I want to know first is where is the bicycle?

00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:05.720
 The bicycle? It was a car.

00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:06.720
 A car?

00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:10.720
 Henry, I thought it was only a bicycle. Oh no, it was a car.

00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:12.720
 That's why we were so scared.

00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:15.720
 Sure, a bicycle wouldn't have bothered us.

00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:17.720
 Henry, go on.

00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:18.720
 Yes, Father.

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:23.720
 Well, we'd heard of a lawyer over in Middletown that we understood was pretty good at fixing things, so we wrote them.

00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:24.720
 I see.

00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:27.560
 Now just a minute, let's get back to that car for a second.

00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:33.280
 Yes sir. Well, at first we were going to paint the car over sort of, so the owner wouldn't recognize it.

00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:34.960
 You were going to try to cover it up?

00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:36.920
 Yes Father, I'm sorry but we were.

00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:39.120
 We did it once before and nobody found out.

00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:41.720
 How was it?

00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:43.480
 Henry and I did, Mother, it was easy.

00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:46.880
 One minute now, how many of these cover-up jobs have you gotten away with?

00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:47.560
 Just one.

00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:48.680
 That was on a car that...

00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:50.800
 ...that never mind.

00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:53.920
 Henry, who suggested you do a thing like that?

00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:56.560
 Nobody, Homer and I thought it up all by ourselves.

00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:58.360
 But the owner scared us off.

00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:00.680
 Boys, do you realize what a thing like that can lead to?

00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:02.920
 Just putting a little paint on a car?

00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:04.920
 What do you mean just putting a little paint on a car?

00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:06.080
 Sam, I don't believe it.

00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:07.280
 Henry, look at me.

00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:08.320
 Are you making this up?

00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:09.840
 Oh, no, Father.

00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:15.000
 As long as we've started, I think it's better to tell the whole thing and get it off our minds, don't you, Homer?

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:15.920
 The whole thing?

00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:18.400
 Henry, regardless of the consequences, let's hear everything.

00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:20.560
 Yes, Father. Only are you going to tell Mr. Bull?

00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:22.920
 Mr. Bull, Mr. Bull has anything to do with this, please begin.

00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:27.880
 But he has father. He's the whole story. What about him? Well, I was holding out my hand

00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:33.920
 See where out the window. I was signaling for homework. Let them know the coast was clear. Yes, sir

00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:41.520
 But then mr. Bull ignored my signal and came right on mr. Bull saw you know, that's the trouble

00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:45.440
 He just came right on wait a minute. What are you talking about? Isn't it clear? No?

00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:49.860
 Well, we were backing up see we were parking Homer's father's car

00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:54.260
 What's that show? We were almost late for school and I said, Henry, let's park here and run.

00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:54.760
 Go on.

00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:59.060
 And I put out my hand and the first thing we knew there was a terrible scraping of fenders

00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:02.560
 and Mr. Bull got out of his car and said I'm gonna sue you for this.

00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:04.260
 And where was the bicycle in the car?

00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:05.560
 Why bicycle?

00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:07.260
 That you took and were going to sell.

00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:09.760
 The one I took? I was going to sell my own.

00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:13.360
 Why? To get enough money to pay for the damage on Mr. Bull's car.

00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:14.560
 But I couldn't get enough.

00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:16.560
 And that's what this is all about?

00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:17.260
 Well, yes.

00:25:17.260 --> 00:25:19.820
 Well, why didn't you tell me when it happened?

00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:22.620
 Because Homer was afraid his father would find out.

00:25:22.620 --> 00:25:25.420
 Well, wait until your Aunt Harriet finds out about it.

00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:27.740
 What do you mean, find out about it? Here I am.

00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:29.100
 Harriet, where did you come from?

00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:31.020
 Sam, I've got everything fixed for you.

00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:31.660
 But Harriet.

00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:34.860
 Sam, I know it's going to kill you, but I've just gone and hired a lawyer.

00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:35.900
 A lawyer? What for?

00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:37.260
 To take care of Henry.

00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:38.860
 You mean I'm going to be sued after all?

00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:41.100
 No, Henry. Harriet, what have you been doing?

00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:42.700
 I've got Norton Adams for you.

00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:45.260
 But Harriet, there isn't anything to worry about, Alice.

00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:46.940
 He can clear this case up in a minute.

00:25:46.940 --> 00:25:50.740
 Yes, Alice, take Harriet over in the corner and tell her a few of the facts of this case.

00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:52.940
 You mean you know something I don't?

00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:55.240
 Henry, I hope for as long as you live you'll remember this.

00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:55.940
 Yes, Father.

00:25:55.940 --> 00:25:57.140
 Hasn't it taught you a lesson?

00:25:57.140 --> 00:25:58.040
 Yes, Father.

00:25:58.040 --> 00:25:58.540
 What?

00:25:58.540 --> 00:26:01.440
 I'm never going to hold my hand out of a car again.

 Henry Aldrich will be back in just a moment.

00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:34.340
 In the meanwhile, if coffee makes you nervous,

00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:36.960
 remember to drink Postam instead.

00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:38.760
 Remember too that Postam is a swell drink

00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:41.000
 for all the family, tempting in flavor

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:42.560
 and most economical.

00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:44.700
 You can still enjoy Postam at its old time,

00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:47.560
 low cost of less than one half cent a cup.

00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:50.920
 So for tip top good taste and rock bottom economy,

00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:53.280
 get Postam from your grocery tomorrow.

00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:55.860

 Now then boys, won't each have another chocolate soda?

00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:26.220
 No, thank you, Anne.

00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:27.860
 No, thanks, Miss Briar.

00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:29.620
 Well, can you imagine that?

00:27:29.620 --> 00:27:30.420
 Bob, trouble.

00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:31.820
 I've lost my automatic.

00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:32.820
 Your automatic.

00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:33.940
 You've lost it, Henry.

00:27:33.940 --> 00:27:35.100
 Your automatic?

00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:36.660
 Yes, I wonder where it is.

00:27:36.660 --> 00:27:40.420
 Henry, will you excuse me while I step into this phone booth?

00:27:40.420 --> 00:27:41.860
 Henry, where did you leave it?

00:27:41.860 --> 00:27:42.820
 Here it is.

00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:44.500
 Look, Homer, isn't it a beauty?

00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:48.100
 You punch the end here and the lead comes out here.

00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:49.420
 I wonder who she's phoning.
