00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 And now, America's Christmas to you, and here, the Aldrich family on NBC.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
 [MUSIC]

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 Henry, Henry Aldrich!

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 Comic mother!

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
 [APPLAUSE]

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
 Yes, it's the Aldrich family, Francois, written by Clifford Goldsmith.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 [Music]

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 The holiday season is always the wide-eyed time of the year for a typical teenage boy.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 But no matter how wide open his eyes are, he's almost certain the walkwright's smack in the summer's sorted troubles,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.160
 especially if he's like Henry Aldrich. The scene opens at the Aldrich breakfast table

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.000
 the time is morning. 10, 11, 10.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.800
 Will you pass the cream please? The creamery here yard 12, 13.

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.320
 Henry that's the sugar you're passing. Oh excuse me here. 12, 13, 14.

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.000
 Henry now I have that piece of toast if you aren't going to eat it.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 I'm going to eat it mother. It was up 13 or 14? 12.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.200
 Now Sam don't rattle him. It was 14 dear. 14? Are you sure?

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.200
 Yes, Henry.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.200
 Fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.200
 Well, Gee whiz.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.200
 What's the matter?

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.200
 You know how many Christmas cards I received this time last year?

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.200
 How many?

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.200
 According to my records, thirty-five.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.200
 That shows how times change.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.200
 You, Henry, this is under the day before Christmas.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.200
 There's one more delivery.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.200
 Well, I know, mother, but all my old standbys are hurt from.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.200
 I can't depend on any new ones coming in.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.200
 Henry, are you sure you have the right attitude, Dort Christmas?

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.200
 The right attitude, Father?

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.200
 Well, I've got to know where I stand, don't I?

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.800
 I just look back to practically 1949.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.040
 All right, dear. All right.

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.960
 Eat your cereal.

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.680
 I'm eating it, Mother.

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.600
 Sam, did we spend the Whitmore's a card?

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.800
 The Whitmore's?

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:56.680
 Sure, the Whitmore's.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:57.520
 Don't you remember?

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.000
 We met them on the train coming back from Chicago.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.760
 You mean that trip we took way back in 1946?

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:03.600
 Yeah.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.520
 And they're still sending us cards?

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.240
 Every Christmas.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.880
 And actually, we ought to send them one.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.760
 Henry, are you going to Nancy Adams's party tonight?

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:11.600
 What's that, Mary?

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:12.520
 The party tonight.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:13.480
 Are you going?

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.440
 Well, I'll tell you, Mary.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.440
 Henry Nancy isn't giving a party on Christmas Eve, is she?

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.440
 Well, in a way, she's giving it on Christmas Eve.

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.440
 What do you mean, in a way, she is?

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.440
 Father, I hope you don't think I'm going to walk out of my whole family tonight. You don't have to worry about that.

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.440
 You mean you're not going, Henry?

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.440
 Mary, do you have to pin your own brother down like that?

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.440
 I'm just going for a little while.

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.440
 By Henry, we always spend Christmas Eve together as a family, and then go to church together.

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.440
 Mother, I thought that after we got the tree trimmed, well, naturally, we'd want to sit around and rest for a second.

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.940
 I thought that while we're resting I just raced over and sailed over the gang and then come around and meet you at the church.

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.440
 Oh, you had it all figured out then?

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.940
 Well, I didn't have it figured out exactly. I just thought I'd be prepared if the subject came up.

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.440
 Well dear, I'm sorry to have to tell you, but you're not going to any party tonight.

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.940
 Not even for 12 minutes?

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:02.440
 Not even for two minutes.

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.440
 My goodness, Henry, don't you realize tonight is Christmas Eve?

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.440
 Alice, who are Ed and Bill?

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.440
 Ed and Bill? Ed and Bill, who dear?

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.940
 I don't know. This card's just signed Ed and Bill.

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:15.940
 Well isn't that strange?

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.940
 Mother is the subject of the party dropped for good?

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.940
 Yes dear. Sam, look at this.

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:20.940
 At one.

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.940
 I have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven cards here from people we haven't sent cards to.

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:27.940
 And here it is the day before Christmas.

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.940
 Merry Christmas everybody!

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:30.940
 She was Homer.

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:32.940
 Where'd you come from?

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:33.940
 From Homer Mrs. Olmett.

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:34.940
 Good morning Homer.

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:35.940
 Hello Homer.

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:36.940
 Good morning Homer.

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.940
 Then you'll get a very private piece of news for you.

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:39.940
 You have?

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.940
 She was. Is that coffee cake?

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.400
 Coffee cake? Yes, dear.

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.040
 Wouldn't you like to go out in the kitchen and get a plate and have a pee?

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.340
 No, thank you. I've got my gloves on. I'll just take a piece right here.

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.740
 Oh, look out in your coat, LaPalle.

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:54.440
 Missle, Tomary.

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.140
 Al, Mr. Rollage, you expecting any telegrams today?

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.940
 Telegrams?

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.640
 Because, if you are, I'll keep my eyes open for them for you.

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.840
 Why, are you working down at the telegrapher office?

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.040
 Well, not yet exactly, Mrs. Ollridge, but I've been talking to them about it.

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.940
 And things may open up at the last minute.

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.140
 Will you excuse me, please, everybody? Come on, Homer.

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:12.980
 Henry, you didn't hold your napkin.

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:14.380
 I didn't even unfold it.

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:17.540
 Alice, we didn't meet anybody by the name of Ed and Bill

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:19.500
 at the United City that summer did we.

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:20.860
 Homer, why do you got to tell me?

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:23.020
 She got wonderful news for you, I think.

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.460
 What about Ellen, I was going to give you a Christmas present.

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:26.140
 Who me?

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.980
 For sure.

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.100
 I just met her on the street, and she wanted me to ask you

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:30.780
 to meet her in front of the Santa Bo gift shop

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.060
 just as soon as you can get there.

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:33.180
 Well, gee, what makes you think she's

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:34.500
 going to give me something?

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:35.860
 That's why she wants you to meet us.

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:37.260
 You can help her pick out a wallet.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.940
 A wallet?

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:38.940
 I'm not kidding, honey.

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:40.420
 I swear, that's what she told me.

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:43.020
 Oh, did Eleanor come right out and say she was gonna give it to me?

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:44.420
 Well, of course she didn't.

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:47.220
 I said to her, I said, "You mean you're getting it for Henry?"

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.120
 And she got all red and embarrassed and said, "Well, of course not.

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.520
 I'm getting it from my father."

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.420
 But I could tell she was covering up.

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:55.620
 Oh boy, oh boy.

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.320
 And under me to doubt the gift shop she said?

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:59.620
 Well, sure. Just as soon as you can get there.

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:09.220
 Hello, is this Toby Smith?

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:09.720
 Yes.

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:14.640
 Well this is Eleanor Winford. Toby could you meet me down at the gift shop in the next 15 minutes?

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:15.960
 At the center real gift shop?

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:19.240
 Yes I'm there now. I want you to help me pick out a wallet.

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.360
 A wallet? You mean a man's wallet?

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.080
 Yes of course only I don't know anything about that sort of thing.

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:25.960
 You mean you're getting... you're getting...

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:27.120
 It's for my father.

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.960
 For your father, for your father, that's a hot one.

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.800
 Toby Ray, it is and I'd love to see what kind you'd pick out.

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.600
 Well sure Eleanor. Oh boy I'll be down there in 10 minutes.

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.600
 [phone ringing]

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:45.600
 Hello?

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:46.600
 Hello Alice, this is Sam.

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:47.600
 Yes dear, where are you?

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:48.600
 Down at the office.

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.600
 Do you remember the Mulligan's?

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:51.600
 The Mulligan?

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:52.600
 They live over in Abbott City.

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:53.600
 What's his first name?

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:54.600
 Well I believe it's Joe.

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:55.600
 Joe?

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:56.600
 Yes I'm sure it's Joe.

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:59.600
 And the Mulligan's didn't send that card from Ed and Bill.

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:00.600
 Goodbye.

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:01.600
 Goodbye.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:02.600
 [laughter]

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:05.600
 - Hey, baby, since Christmas card I just got.

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:06.600
 - Let me see it.

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:07.600
 - Isn't that embarrassing?

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.600
 I bet it costs 75 cents.

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:10.600
 - Who's it from there?

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:11.600
 - From Homer.

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:12.600
 Isn't that embarrassing?

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:15.600
 - Oh, now I think it was a very nice thing for him to do.

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.600
 - But, Mother, do I have to send one back to him?

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.600
 - Well, of course, Mary.

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:20.600
 Now, please don't bother me, dear.

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:21.600
 I've got to wrap up that fruitcake.

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.600
 I've been meaning to send Mrs. Hawkins all week.

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:24.600
 - To Mrs. Hawkins?

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:25.600
 - Yes, dear.

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:28.600
 She has three boys in this service and she's all alone this Christmas.

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:29.600
 - Mother!

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:30.600
 Mother, where are you?

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:33.200
 I'm out here in the kitchen, Henry, and I'm very busy.

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:34.600
 I'm very sorry to interrupt you like this,

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:35.900
 but could I have a talk with you

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:37.600
 confidentially about something important?

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:38.600
 Who's what's happened here?

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:41.100
 Nothing. Only could you please step into the dining room a second.

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:43.400
 Mary, I don't like to be rude, but this is about Christmas.

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:44.800
 Oh, that's all right, Henry.

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.600
 Only I hope you're not going to spend a whole lot on me.

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.600
 On who? Now, Mary, don't start getting any ideas.

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:53.200
 Henry, you'll have to hurry. I haven't more than a minute.

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:54.600
 Yes, mother. Here's what happened.

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:58.100
 Eleanor Wentworth has given me a $3.95 wallet.

00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:59.500
 Plus tax.

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:00.600
 What's that?

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:03.600
 How well it's made of leather and it even has a place for my student body.

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:04.600
 For your what?

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:06.600
 My student body car.

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:09.600
 That's in case if I'm in an accident, people will know who I am.

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:10.600
 Well, now just one minute dear.

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:13.600
 Suppose you calm down and tell me very slowly what it is that happened.

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:16.600
 But mother, there's no time to lose. I've got to have four dollars.

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:17.600
 What for?

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:20.600
 Don't you understand? I've got to give Eleanor a present just as good as the one she's giving me, haven't I?

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:26.600
 Well, frankly, Henry, if Eleanor at her age wants to spend money on presents for boys, it's none of my business.

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:32.320
 But I don't believe I have four dollars to give you to buy her anything mother what am I gonna do about Toby Smith

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:37.440
 What's that well Toby Smith was down there to putting his in his two cents worth because he thinks the wall is for him

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:40.680
 And that one are pointed out something she's crazy about and it costs four dollars

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:45.540
 And if I don't beat him to it he'll get it first and then more I look like a fool Henry if you have four dollars of your own

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:48.640
 That's something else, but I really don't think I should give it to you

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:53.720
 Mother when you please look at what I just discovered. I'm certainly not going to send a card to Homer

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:57.720
 - Why not, Mary? - Mother, I held a card he sent me under a very strong light

00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:59.720
 and look at what's been erased on it.

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:02.720
 I hope you like your gun, love at best.

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:09.720
 We'll see either. Homer was probably just cutting down expenses.

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:15.720
 Mary, Mary, could you step into the living room while I have a confidential talk with you for a second?

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:18.720
 - What about Christmas? - Oh, you want some advice?

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:22.720
 Mary, do you remember what it was? I was going to do just a ten-rate day in.

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:24.220
 No, Mother.

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:25.220
 Well, Henry.

00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:26.220
 Do you know Toby Smith?

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:26.720
 Yeah.

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:27.420
 Do you like him?

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:29.020
 Henry, I can't stand him.

00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:30.720
 Mary, I'm sure glad to hear you say that.

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:32.220
 Could you lend me $4?

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:34.220
 $4?

00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:36.720
 Well, look, Mary, if I don't give Eleanor more than a 25-cent hank of chip,

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:39.220
 I'll never be able to walk on a public street again.

00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:40.720
 And I know just exactly what she wants.

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:41.220
 What?

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:42.720
 Well, she pointed it out in the gift shop.

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:44.720
 She said it was about the nicest thing she'd ever seen.

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:45.720
 What was it?

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:47.220
 Mary, haven't you even been listening?

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:48.720
 A Christmas tree that lights up.

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:49.720
 A war?

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:51.220
 So where in the lapel of your coat?

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:53.820
 It's a pin, so you know it has a little battery in it.

00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:54.520
 Really?

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:56.520
 Sure, and it's only four dollars.

00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:57.920
 And they've only got one left.

00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:00.020
 But Henry, you already owe me money.

00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:01.420
 Hey, Henry! She was home.

00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:02.120
 Where are you?

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:04.820
 Boy, I think I'm going to get that job delivering telegrams this afternoon.

00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:06.220
 Well, that's fine. Listen, Mary.

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:07.420
 Hello, Mary.

00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:08.520
 Hello, Homer.

00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:09.920
 Did you...

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:10.920
 Did you...

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:13.820
 Have the males been coming through all right today?

00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:14.720
 Yeah.

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:17.320
 Well, how do you feel?

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:19.320
 I feel just fine.

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:20.720
 Oh.

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:22.260
 Homer, what is it you want?

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.420
 Listen, did you know Toby Smith is taking Eleanor to the party tonight?

00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:27.020
 You're crazy. Who told you that?

00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:29.720
 Toby did. I met him just a little while ago in his way home.

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:31.220
 He had to get some money to buy something.

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:32.420
 Married, do you hear that?

00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:34.320
 Haven't you got any family pride?

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:45.120
 What counter is it at, Henry? It's right over here, Homer. Oh, mister.

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:46.720
 Uh, something I can know for you, young man?

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:48.220
 Yes, sir. I came back to get the tree.

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:49.220
 Uh, what's that?

00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:50.620
 The Christmas tree that lights up.

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:53.460
 Oh yes, we do have a nice one here in the store this year, haven't we?

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:55.220
 I guess he's hard of hearing, Henry.

00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:57.180
 No, the little Christmas tree.

00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:57.700
 The what?

00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:01.100
 Don't you remember the little Christmas tree that surprises you when it lights up?

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:02.340
 Oh, you mean the pinch.

00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:04.220
 Sure, I finally got the $4 for it.

00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:06.500
 Well, I'm sorry, but that's just been sold.

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:07.540
 What's that?

00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:08.340
 It's been sold?

00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:09.700
 Less than 10 minutes ago.

00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:10.940
 Well, that's a fine thing.

00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:14.620
 After I promised to make my sister's bed every morning for a month, there's compound intruders.

00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:15.820
 I'm sorry, sir.

00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:18.940
 Hey, look, Henry, how about getting Eleanor just a straight flashlight?

00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:21.240
 Boy, I saw one that's so powerful and adorable.

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:24.740
 Oh no, what would she do with a flashlight?

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:26.640
 Well, I know, Don, well, I'd like it.

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:27.640
 Mr.

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:28.140
 Mr.

00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:29.740
 Are you positive that pin's been sold?

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:31.540
 There's the clerk over there who made the sale.

00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:33.240
 She might even be able to tell you who bought it.

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:34.340
 Oh, I know who bought it.

00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:36.240
 I just don't see how he got down here so fast.

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:38.940
 And Eleanor said herself, it's the only pin she's ever seen.

00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:39.840
 She really liked.

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:40.640
 Hey, Mr.

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:41.340
 Hey, Mr.

00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:42.140
 She was Toby.

00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:43.340
 What are you doing back here?

00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:43.640
 Mr.

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:44.640
 How about that Christmas tree?

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:45.740
 The lights have like a pin.

00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:47.240
 I mean, you know what I mean.

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:48.140
 I beg your pardon?

00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:49.340
 The pen, the pen.

00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:51.700
 I'm sorry, young man, but that pen's been sold.

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:53.100
 It's been sold?

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:54.180
 Yeah?

00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:55.580
 Now listen, Henry.

00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:56.420
 She was Toby.

00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:57.580
 I mean, you didn't buy it?

00:10:57.580 --> 00:10:59.580
 Now listen, Henry, I'm supposed to get that braille in her.

00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:00.420
 Hand it over.

00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:00.860
 What over?

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:01.660
 I haven't got it.

00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:02.860
 Toby, stop pushing Henry.

00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:03.740
 That's what I say.

00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:05.300
 Listen, Homer Brown, did you buy it?

00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:05.800
 Hey.

00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:06.820
 Now listen, Toby.

00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:07.700
 Now, wait a minute, boys.

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:08.220
 Wait a minute.

00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:11.660
 Be careful of that piece on Earth saying--

00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:14.660
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:17.320
 (horns honking)

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:20.320
 (horns honking)

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:21.320
 - Hello?

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:22.660
 - Hello Sam Horace speaking.

00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:24.060
 - Oh hello Sam, this is Alex.

00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:24.900
 - Yeah.

00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:27.860
 - Did you room with someone at Princeton by that name?

00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:29.200
 - By what name?

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:30.640
 - Ed or Bill.

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:32.500
 - He didn't have both names.

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:34.000
 Anyhow, we called him Murph.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:34.840
 - Oh.

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:36.880
 (audience laughing)

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:38.640
 Well the reason I called here is to ask

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:40.280
 what we ought to do about Homer.

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:41.520
 - Oh but what's happened to him?

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:43.040
 - Well he was here just a little while ago

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:46.280
 After he left, I found a card on the living room table addressed to me.

00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:47.080
 Yes?

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:49.080
 Well, he's apparently saving postage.

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:51.120
 Don't you think I would have given something rather nice?

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:52.240
 All right.

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:53.760
 How about one of your fruitcakes?

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:55.480
 Sam, that reminds me.

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:58.280
 Don't let me forget to send Mrs. Faulkens that fruitcake.

00:11:58.280 --> 00:11:59.320
 That's a nice idea.

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:01.000
 No one in town I'd rather remember.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.440
 She's got three sons in the service.

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:03.720
 That's the way I feel.

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:05.560
 And Alice is starting to snow pretty hard.

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:07.240
 Tell Henry he'd better start shoveling.

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:08.600
 Well, Henry isn't here right now.

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:09.640
 Oh, when he comes in, tell him.

00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:10.640
 All right, dear, goodbye.

00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:11.960
 Goodbye.

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:12.960
 Mother!

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:13.960
 Yes, Henry?

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:14.960
 I've got to ask you something.

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:16.960
 Dear, your father wants you to keep the walks clear to the snow.

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:18.460
 Oh, you're a mother, but listen.

00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:19.460
 Who could this be?

00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:20.460
 She's a lady.

00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:21.460
 See, she's a lady.

00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:22.460
 What's that?

00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:23.460
 Well, no, wait, Mother.

00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:26.460
 She's a lady about so high, see, and she wears a black coat with a black fur collar.

00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:27.460
 Who is she?

00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:28.960
 Henry, what are you talking about?

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:29.960
 Who is she, Mother?

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:30.960
 Who is she?

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:31.960
 I've got to know.

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:32.960
 Is this a game, Henry?

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:33.960
 A game!

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:34.960
 Mother, my whole Christmas is at stake.

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:35.960
 She's my only clue.

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:38.960
 Henry, I can't possibly know what you're talking about.

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:40.460
 She was, you know, all the ladies in town.

00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:41.460
 Now, listen very carefully.

00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:45.460
 She comes up to here on me, see? She wears a black coat with fur cuffs.

00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:46.460
 I thought you said a fur color.

00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:51.460
 I did? Sure. And she's not very heavy. She weighs maybe... maybe...

00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:53.460
 Well, you know Mrs. Brown? Yeah.

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:55.460
 Well, she isn't like that at all, but that'll give you an idea.

00:12:55.460 --> 00:12:58.460
 And she wears her eyeglasses on a chain.

00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:02.460
 Oh, my goodness. Henry, why do you have to know the answer?

00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:04.460
 She's got the tree. She's got the tree.

00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:06.460
 Who's tree? My tree that I'm giving Eleanor.

00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:09.460
 What's that? She got there ahead of Toby and me. Don't you see?

00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:13.300
 you see the clerk described it to me I got a finder and make her an offer she

00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:17.820
 wears her glasses on a chain and she's about so high and for on a coat well the

00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:21.380

00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:31.540

 glasses on a chain a woman yes of course Miss Perkins Miss Perkins all right I'll

 - No, I won't, Mother.

00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:41.380
 Just as soon as I take and carry this.

00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:42.700
 Bye.

00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:44.700
 Henry, I thought it was someone else.

00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:45.540
 Henry?

00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:48.120
 (upbeat music)

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:54.980
 - Hello there, Henry Aldrich.

00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:55.900
 - Why don't you step inside?

00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:57.020
 - No thanks, Mrs. Kittenger.

00:13:57.020 --> 00:13:58.620
 Only gets no all over your rug.

00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:01.100
 - Oh my goodness, look at the snow.

00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:02.340
 - Well, what can I do for you, Henry?

00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:05.700
 - Well, first, do you have a coat with fur on it?

00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:08.180
 - Well, not to get away, Henry.

00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:09.940
 No, I was just wondering.

00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:12.100
 I thought you wore glasses.

00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:14.500
 Why, I do sometimes.

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:17.940
 - Did your mother send you over? - Well, in a way, she did.

00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:21.540
 - Were you kind of at the gift shop this morning? - Yes, I was.

00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:24.020
 Well, did you make a purchase there?

00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:25.380
 Yes, of course.

00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:28.500
 As a matter of fact, it was very foolish of me to wait until the last minute.

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:31.300
 There was hardly anything left. - I'll say.

00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:34.580
 Erm, Henry, just what was it you wanted?

00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:36.460
 Nothing, nothing.

00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:38.860
 She, your walk certainly needs shoveling, doesn't it?

00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:41.060
 Yes, I'm afraid it does.

00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:42.760
 Well, Mrs. Kittenger, if you have a shovel,

00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:44.460
 I'd be very glad to clean it off for you.

00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:46.860
 I know that's very thoughtful of you, Henry.

00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:48.260
 And I'd be glad to pay you.

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.660
 Oh, no, no, I wouldn't take any money from you.

00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:52.760
 But when I get through, Mrs. Kittenger,

00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:54.660
 you're going to be around, aren't you?

00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:55.860
 Yes.

00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:57.860
 Because I want to have a little talk with you.

00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:00.860
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:07.260
 My Henry Eldridge.

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:08.860
 How do you do, Mrs. Tarbell? Merry Christmas.

00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:10.460
 And Merry Christmas to you.

00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:13.260
 Well, I'm sure glad to see you're wearing your glasses on a chain.

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:13.960
 What's that?

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:16.660
 Boy, did I make a mistake over it, Mrs. Kidnier's.

00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:18.260
 She wears them, but they're not on a chain.

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:20.060
 And that's where I got off on the wrong foot.

00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:23.060
 Henry, didn't I see you just as I was leaving the gift shop this morning?

00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:23.760
 Did you?

00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:25.260
 Yes, I'm sure I did.

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:28.260
 Mrs. Tarbell, how would you like to have your walk clean?

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:30.260

00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:39.060
 We'll return to the Aldrich family in just a moment.

00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:41.900
 Later this evening, NBC will deliver a Christmas package

00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:44.980
 bursting with good cheer, a radio adaptation

00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:48.260
 of Charles Dickens' classic, "The Pickwick Papers."

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:51.100
 Our stars will be Alan Webb, Melville Cooper,

00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:52.540
 and Cyril Richard.

00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:54.100
 The Pickwick Papers over the years

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:56.820
 has become the favorite of young and old alike,

00:15:56.820 --> 00:15:59.340
 and it's in keeping with the holiday season.

00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:01.100
 Don't miss "The Pickwick Papers,"

00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:05.260
 as brought to you by "Theta Guild on the Air" later tonight.

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:09.180
 Now tomorrow night NBC will bring you more you old time at attainment when the railroad

00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:12.960
 hour welcomes as guests of Prana, Dorothy Kirsten.

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:17.400
 Miss Kirsten will join your singing host, Gordon McCray, in excerpts from the Nutcracker

00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:20.720
 Suite and Christmas songs of many countries.

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:24.780
 Stay tuned to NBC tomorrow evening, the Monday night of music.

00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:28.980
 You'll hear the telephone hour, the voice of Firestone, an old-fashioned band concert

00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:34.240
 by Paul LaValle in the band of America, an NBC's newest show which features the talents

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:41.240
 of Marguerite Piazza, Robert Merrill, and NBC's Man About Music, Meredith Wilson.

00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:55.640
 Now getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldrich.

00:16:55.640 --> 00:17:00.040
 So far this Christmas Henry's one purpose is to catch up with the lady who bought the

00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:05.960
 The only pin of its kind in town, a pin that cost $4 and it looks like a small Christmas tree,

00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:11.040
 which Eleanor said she'd just love to have if anyone wanted to give her anything.

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:14.040
 The scene opens in the Aldrich living room.

00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:17.040
 Dad, are you all?

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:18.040
 I am.

00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:21.040
 I thought I sent the words for Henry to clean off our walk.

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:25.040
 Well, dear, I am, but he went out and he hasn't come back soon.

00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:27.040
 Ah, and look at me.

00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:29.040
 I had the words to have a drift up to my knees.

00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:30.840
 When you go right up and change your clothes.

00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:32.360
 What got into that boy?

00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:35.280
 You can take time to shovel other people's walks, but not ours.

00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:36.480
 Why do you say that?

00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:38.520
 Miss Perkins stopped me on the street on the way home

00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:41.920
 and told me how nice it was of Henry to come over and clean her walk.

00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:43.280
 Well, my goodness.

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:47.520
 Oh, and here, see whether you can figure these Christmas cards out.

00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:50.720
 One is signed Ida and one is signed Van.

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:51.760
 Ida.

00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:53.480
 I never heard of Ida.

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:54.600
 Well, who's Van?

00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:56.120
 Well, that isn't the point here.

00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:59.820
 But why would any Ida be sending you a card at the office?

00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:02.920
 I'm going up and soak my feet.

00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:03.420
 Hello?

00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:05.040
 And this is Western Union, Paul.

00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:06.520
 It's Henry Aldrich there.

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:07.220
 No, he isn't.

00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:08.720
 Do you have a telegram, Florin?

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:10.420
 No, I just wanted to say hello.

00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:11.120
 Who is this?

00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:11.720
 It's Homer.

00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:12.620
 I got the job.

00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:13.320
 Goodbye.

00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:14.920
 Was this?

00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:15.920
 Mother!

00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:18.320
 I have that fruit cake ready for Mrs. Hawkins.

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:19.520
 You have Mary?

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:20.120
 Says!

00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:20.920
 Yes, Alice.

00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:22.720
 Have you started to soak yet?

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:24.520
 What?

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:25.620
 For my gracious.

00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:27.620
 Christmas is always like this.

00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:28.620
 Hello?

00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:29.620
 Is this Miss Aldrich?

00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:30.620
 Yes.

00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:31.620
 This is Miss Kidger.

00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:33.620
 I just wanted to call and tell you how nice it was

00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:35.620
 if you'd send Henry over.

00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:36.620
 What's that?

00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:39.620
 I think it was so sweet if you'd send Henry over to clean my wall.

00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:40.620
 Oh.

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:42.620
 Oh, did he clean yours too?

00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:45.620
 Yes, he did a perfect job and he wouldn't take a cent.

00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:48.620
 All he wanted to do was come in and look at the presents I'm giving.

00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:49.620
 What's that?

00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:50.620
 Alright, Iris.

00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:51.620
 What is it you want?

00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:52.620
 Merry Christmas Mrs. Aldrich.

00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:54.620
 Well, thank you very much and Merry Christmas to you.

00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:56.560
 - Bye bye. - Goodbye.

00:18:56.560 --> 00:18:59.560
 Sam, what are you doing down here in your bare feet?

00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:02.400
 You asked me to come down. What do you want?

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:06.200
 Oh, well, I was going to ask you to take that fruit cake over to Mrs. Hawkins,

00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:07.640
 but I guess it will have to wait.

00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:09.000
 But I'm down here now.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.340
 No, dear. You go right back up and soak.

00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:14.320
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:27.700
 Hey.

00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:29.060
 Hey, Henry, isn't that you?

00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:29.660
 Sure, Homer.

00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:30.500
 What is it you want?

00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:32.740
 Well, come on with me while I deliver a couple of telegrams.

00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:33.820
 She was untired.

00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:34.620
 I'm going home.

00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:36.260
 Some of you few blocks out of your way.

00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:37.020
 Homer, look at me.

00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:37.780
 My feet are wet.

00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:38.820
 I haven't had any lunch.

00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:40.180
 Boy, what are you been doing?

00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:42.500
 I've been shoveling every walk in town.

00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:44.140
 Boy, did my mother double cross me.

00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:46.220
 Yeah, but look, Henry, my first stop is Mrs. Hawkins.

00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:48.060
 Just three doors down the street.

00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:50.180
 I'll even let you borrow one of my gloves.

00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:51.140
 Here, take the right one.

00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:53.220
 I carry my telegrams in the left one.

00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:54.060
 Thanks.

00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:55.860
 And one of the telegrams I've got is a war message.

00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:56.700
 A what?

00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:58.700
 Sure, it's from John Hawkins to his mother.

00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:00.460
 He's in an army camp down in Texas.

00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:02.180
 I thought John Hawkins was in Korea.

00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:04.260
 No, it's two brothers are in Korea.

00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:05.260
 And here's the house right here.

00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:06.860
 And that's a war message you have for her?

00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:07.860
 Well, sure.

00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:09.100
 John says he's very sorry,

00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:11.220
 but he wasn't able to get a frill or to come home.

00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:13.660
 And he's also sorry he and his brothers can't all be here tonight

00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:15.940
 to spend an old fairish Christmas with their mother.

00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:16.440
 Yeah?

00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:18.460
 And then he wishes her a merry Christmas.

00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:19.420
 Rumor, I thought you weren't supposed

00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:21.220
 to read confidential messages.

00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:23.420
 Well, she was Ivan Reggie the message, Henley.

00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:26.140
 Besides, everybody will know about it tomorrow.

00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:27.380
 Oh, how do you do, boys?

00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:28.540
 How do you do, Mrs. Hawkins?

00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:29.380
 A telegram.

00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:30.540
 For me?

00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:32.980
 Won't you step in while I see whether it needs an answer?

00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:33.860
 Well, OK.

00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:36.020
 Honey, I don't think you'll find it does, Mrs. Hawkins.

00:20:36.020 --> 00:20:37.180
 No.

00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:38.900
 Now let me see if I can get

00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:40.400
 my glasses untangled.

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:43.000
 Change is always catching on something.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:44.100
 Can I help you untangle it?

00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:45.300
 No, no, thank you.

00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:46.100
 I have it.

00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:47.200
 Mrs. Hawkins.

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:48.900
 I'll be there in just one minute.

00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:51.700
 She was home with that sounds like Toby Smith in the living room.

00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:53.400
 Mrs. Hawkins, this is it, all right?

00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:54.900
 I'll pay you $4 for it.

00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:56.500
 Toby, what are you doing there?

00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:59.000
 Hey, look, Homer, they're on a chain.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:20:59.500
 Why?

00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:00.700
 Her glasses.

00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:02.800
 Now listen, Toby, you can't have that pin.

00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:03.600
 Get away, Henry.

00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:04.400
 Now listen, Toby.

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:06.000
 Henry, don't let him push you like that.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.900
 Boys, boys, look out that angel.

00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:09.240
 Now listen, Henry!

00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:10.240
 Where, darn ya?

00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:10.900
 Hey!

00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:12.900
 Boys, boys, what's the door?

00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:17.400
 [Laughing]

00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:18.900
 Oh, Jesus.

00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:31.900
 [Music]

00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:35.700
 Sam, would you mind putting another log on the fire, please?

00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:37.500
 That's just what I'm going to do.

00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:40.500
 My goodness, but it's an awful night out.

00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:42.100
 You ought to look out the window, mother.

00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:45.420
 I've never seen so much snow on Christmas Eve.

00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:47.100
 Mary, straighten that piece of holly

00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:48.700
 that's hanging right over your father.

00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:49.820
 All right.

00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:51.420
 Whole still father.

00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:54.500
 I can't lift the log and whole still too.

00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:55.780
 And do you look out for the fox?

00:21:55.780 --> 00:21:57.620
 All right.

00:21:57.620 --> 00:22:00.460
 Mary, when Henry came a while ago, exactly what did he say?

00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:02.380
 He just asked whether you and father were in.

00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:04.540
 And I said no, you'd gone out to do some shopping.

00:22:04.540 --> 00:22:06.180
 And then he ran upstairs.

00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:08.700
 And when he came down he had his best suit on.

00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:10.100
 And that's all he said.

00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:12.860
 Well, he said to tell you he finally straightened out

00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:14.820
 the whole problem of Eleanor's present.

00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:16.060
 And then he was in an awful hurry

00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:17.380
 to get down to the glass cutters

00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:19.620
 and something about a party.

00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:21.620
 Sam, what do you think we ought to do?

00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:23.980
 Phone were over the party is and tell him to come home.

00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:26.780
 Now, dear, we aren't going to do anything like that.

00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:27.900
 But didn't you explain to Henry

00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:29.820
 that we always spend Christmas Eve together,

00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:31.100
 as all families do?

00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:34.180
 Dear, if Henry doesn't want to spend this evening with us,

00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:37.180
 It's something I'm not going to force him to do.

00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:39.180
 - Mother, don't you think you ought to be punished?

00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:40.180
 - Mary dear.

00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:44.180
 - Will you go out to the kitchen and get that big bowl of fruit and nuts out there?

00:22:44.180 --> 00:22:46.180
 - Yes, Mother.

00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:48.180
 - Sure, Alice.

00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:50.180
 You'll be alarmed shortly.

00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:55.180
 - Sam, I'm afraid Henry doesn't even begin to know what Christmas really means.

00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:59.180
 The one thing he's thought about all day is himself and that President wanted to get Eleanor.

00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:02.180
 That's the only thing that's meant anything to him.

00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:05.880
 He didn't shovel the wall. He didn't get the cellar window fixed.

00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:08.980
 Oh my goodness, Anne. That reminds me.

00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:11.780
 You didn't get that fruitcake over to Mrs. Hawkins.

00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:15.780
 Well, could I, Alice? I had to go out and shovel the wall for Henry.

00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:19.980
 Oh, I know, dear. But here it is Christmas, even Mrs. Hawkins.

00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:22.480
 Well, of all the people in this town, we should have sent one hand.

00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:25.480
 All right, Alice. All right. I'll take it over first thing tomorrow.

00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:27.080
 Can't we take it over now?

00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:28.480
 Tonight in this storm?

00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:31.080
 We could certainly drop it off on the way to church, can't we?

00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:35.060
 Alice, I realize Mrs. Hawkins misses her boys like everything,

00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:38.140
 but the church is in one direction and the Hawkins house is in the other.

00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:39.940
 It's snowing to beat the band.

00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:42.140
 I'll take it over first thing tomorrow.

00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:42.820
 Very well.

00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:46.340
 Incidentally, I wonder how the Hawkins boys are getting along.

00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:48.660
 Well, I understand she hears from them quite often.

00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:50.300
 Yes, there was always one thing about them.

00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:52.620
 They were devoted to their mother.

00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:54.980
 Yes.

00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:55.820
 Alice, don't cry.

00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:57.420
 I didn't mean it that way.

00:23:57.420 --> 00:23:58.380
 I'm not crying.

00:23:58.380 --> 00:23:59.980
 Here's the ball of fruit and that's not it.

00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:03.260
 We have some no dear what would I want with any fruit and not

00:24:03.260 --> 00:24:05.060
 I'm Christmas Eve.

00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:06.580
 Father.

00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:08.380
 I'm not hungry Mary.

00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:10.220
 What's the matter?

00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:12.940
 I thought you wanted me to bring them in.

00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:14.140
 We did dear.

00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:17.460
 Just put them down there on the table where they'll look Christmas.

00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:21.220
 Oh I might the candles on the piano just as though.

00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:23.100
 Dear where you're going.

00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:25.820
 I'm going to phone Henry and tell him to leave that party and come home.

00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:27.780
 Sam Aldrich I don't want you to.

00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:31.780
 But mother if father doesn't, Henry won't even be here to go to church with her.

00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:36.780
 Now Henry knows we're going. If he isn't here by then, we'll go alone.

00:24:53.780 --> 00:25:00.180
 When they had heard the King, Lady Potts, and all the star which they saw in the east went before them,

00:25:00.180 --> 00:25:03.680
 till it came and stood over where the young child was.

00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:08.480
 When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.

00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:15.780
 Let us all rise while we sing, "We three kings of Orient are."

00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:18.780
 Sam.

00:25:18.780 --> 00:25:19.780
 Yes, Alice.

00:25:19.780 --> 00:25:20.780
 Sam, look.

00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:21.780
 Where?

00:25:21.780 --> 00:25:25.140
 Just three rows ahead. It's Mrs. Hawkins.

00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:28.320
 Yeah? And maybe we should have brought the fruitcake with it?

00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:29.320
 No, dear.

00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:33.520
 Look who's with her. My goodness mother, look!

00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:35.960
 And the three Hawkins boys come home?

00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:39.360
 No, Mary. Can't you see who that is, Wither?

00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:42.160
 It's Henry and Homer and Toby.
