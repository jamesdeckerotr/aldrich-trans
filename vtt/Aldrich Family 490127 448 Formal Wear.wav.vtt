00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.360
 [Music]

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.160
 And now the Jell-O family presents...

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.840
 Henry! Henry O'Rourke!

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:18.960
 Coming, mother!

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.400
 [Applause]

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:29.520
 Yes, it's the Oldridge family based on characters originated by Clifford Goldsmith

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:34.080
 and starring Ezra Stone as Henry with Jackie Count as Homer.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.680
 And yes, it's the Jell-O family with its three famous desserts.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.240
 Jell-O in those six delicious flavors,

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.560
 Jell-O puddings with that old-fashioned homemade flavor,

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.640
 and Jell-O tapioca puddings,

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.160
 a miracle of goodness, a marvel of speed.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.880
 ♪ Everyone's a Jell-O good fellow ♪

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.400
 ♪ A very good Jell-O good fellow ♪

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.400
 So rich, so tempting and mellow,

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.800
 J-E-L-L-O!

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.600
 And now for the Aldrich family.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:20.300
 Whatever and whenever the Golden Age was,

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.800
 it is less important to most people than the Teenage.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.300
 A time of life made notable by typical American boys

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:33.300
 like Henry Aldrich and all their mishaps. The scene opens in Mr. Aldrich's bedroom.

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.300
 It is just before breakfast.

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.300
 But Father, do you think that's fair?

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:38.300
 Fair.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.300
 I don't mean to be rude, but do you?

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.300
 Henry, every time you've asked to wear my tuxedo in the past, I've let you have an eye.

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.300
 You sure, Father, and that's just the point.

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:47.300
 What is?

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.300
 Isn't there such a thing as squatters' rights?

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.300
 Squatter's rights would hardly apply to my tuxedo.

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.300
 Are you sure we can't rent one for your dance tonight?

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.300
 Father, there isn't a tuxedo my size left in town.

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:00.300
 Sam Henry!

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.300
 Then I'm sorry Henry.

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.300
 But Kathleen's bought a new formal and everything.

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.300
 Aren't you coming down to breakfast?

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.300
 Yes Alice! Come along Henry.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:16.300
 Father I know you have the kind of mind that once it's made up dynamite couldn't change it, but could we do this?

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:17.300
 Do what?

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:22.300
 Fix it so that you can wear your tuxedo to that concert tonight with a clear conscience.

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:23.300
 My conscience is clear.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:28.300
 Sure, but if I had my own tux, you wouldn't have me hanging over you.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.300
 Are you proposing that I'd buy you one?

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:31.300
 You mean you'd consider it?

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:32.300
 Certainly not.

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.300
 Henry, what's wrong with your blue surge suit?

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:36.300
 My blue surge.

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.300
 Father, I give you my word.

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.300
 There's only one guy in the whole class who dareshow up in civilian clothes, and that's

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:43.300
 Willy Marshall.

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.300
 And Father, he has no pride whatsoever.

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.300
 There's nothing more that I can suggest, Henry.

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.300
 And let's consider the subject closed.

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.140
 My goodness, your eggs are getting cold. Please sit down, both of you.

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.820
 Mother, I couldn't eat a bite. There you can at least drink your juice.

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.100
 Well, I'm all choked up.

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.980
 Henry?

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.580
 I'm drinking it, Father.

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:02.620
 Sam!

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:03.740
 Yes, Alice?

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:06.300
 Do you know what I was thinking about your tuxedo?

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.020
 Alice, Henry and I have agreed to close the subject.

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.740
 We have?

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:11.180
 And please answer the phone, Henry.

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:12.060
 Yes, Father.

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.660
 Drink your juice, Sam.

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.740
 Alice, I'm afraid I'm not very hungry either.

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:17.180
 Hello?

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:18.620
 Hi, Henry. This is Lily.

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:19.120
 Who?

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.880
 Willie Marshall.

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.380
 And listen, Henry, how are you fixed for formal shoes?

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.940
 What?

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:24.920
 Formal shoes, formal shoes.

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.380
 The closest thing I've got is a pair of black and white saddle shoes.

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:29.120
 But Willie--

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.380
 I've always have trouble dancing in rubber soles.

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.200
 Have you got an extra pair of patent letters?

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.340
 No, I haven't.

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.860
 Boy, except for those shoes, I'm practically set.

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.080
 I've got a stiff shirt, suspenders, and a real genuine cloth

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.260
 coronation.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:42.380
 Willie, you mean--

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:45.660
 Boy, I need now shoes, black socks, cufflinks, studs,

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:46.820
 a muffler, and a girl.

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:48.580
 [LAUGHTER]

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.740
 Willie, you're actually wearing a tuxedo tonight?

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:54.180
 Sure, it's the most important dance of the year.

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.580
 Do you think I want to stick out like a sore thumb?

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.580
 Well, she was where'd you get it?

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:01.080
 From a waiter I know who's off duty tonight.

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.580
 Oh boy.

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.580
 You mean I'm going to be the only one there in just a blue surge suit?

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:11.080
 You're? Henry, don't you have any pride whatsoever?

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.580
 Listen, Willie, goodbye. I've got to go back to work.

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:16.080
 On what? Never mind. Goodbye.

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:17.580
 Father!

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:21.080
 Father, could I have your permission to reopen the subject,

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:24.080
 providing I use a completely new angle?

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:35.080
 Agnes, calm down. You're on the phone.

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:39.080
 Calm down, Homer. How can I calm down when I'm miserable?

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.080
 You mean your parents won't buy you a new form of...

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:45.080
 No, they said the minute I stopped growing in all directions, they'll get me one.

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.080
 - We're in a lapi. - Well, it won't be before the dance.

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:49.080
 I know that.

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.080
 She was. I've got my tuxedo all pressed and everything.

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.080
 - You have? - Sure. It's been under my mattress for a week.

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.080
 Look, Agnes, what's wrong with your own form?

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.080
 Oh, it's prehistoric.

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.080
 What?

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.080
 Sure, it's got a neckline that practically comes up to my chin,

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.080
 and I don't want to stick out like a sore thumb.

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.080
 Agnes, what are we going to do?

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.080
 I'll just have to keep working on my folks till I wear them down.

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:18.080
 I know, but the only thing is Homer, if I do talk to him in a buying a new dress,

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.080
 I can't get them to give me money for the tickets, too.

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:24.080
 What? But Agnes, that's our arrangement.

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.080
 I take you out and you flip the bills.

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:31.080
 Homer, can't you make us sacrifice justice once?

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.080
 How can I, I'm broke.

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.080
 Why not ask your father for some money?

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.080
 Agnes, I have a bargain with my father.

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:38.080
 What, father?

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:42.080
 I don't mention money, and he doesn't mention my report card.

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:43.840
 (laughing)

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:44.680
 - Hey, old man.

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:45.680
 - Look, Homer, if I hang up now,

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.480
 I think I can corner my father in the living room.

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:48.320
 Goodbye.

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:49.320
 - Bye.

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:52.480
 - Homer, would you be willing to sign this protest?

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:54.400
 - Can't you let me worry and pee?

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:57.600
 - But listen, it says, we're as in here too,

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.680
 all in sundry, know the country club

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:03.000
 gets pretty darn stuffy, to heck with tuxedos,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.840
 and let's make this a simple dance where nobody dresses.

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:08.280
 - You don't want it formal?

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:10.680
 - Boy, have you ever tried putting on a tuxedo?

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:13.200
 You finally get the stiff shirt on, seat,

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:16.520
 and then you have to lie on your back to put on your shoes.

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:17.360
 But, Henry--

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:18.240
 And by the time you're through,

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.480
 you're no good for anything signed here.

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:23.640
 Well, before I do, I'd like to make just one minor change.

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:24.140
 What?

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:26.760
 Instead of all that junk about tuxedos,

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:29.320
 just say, whereas, in here too, we

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:32.080
 think it's a disgrace to charge money for tickets.

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:32.560
 Why?

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:35.680
 Gee, was the dances for members of our own classes,

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:38.800
 and it's like charging to get into your own house.

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.160
 But Homer, I've got to.

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:41.920
 And I've got a tuxedo.

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:42.420
 Oh.

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:45.160
 Look, Henry, how'd you like to do me a big fave?

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:45.760
 What fave?

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:48.440
 All you have to do is point out to my father

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:50.640
 that if your father gave you money for tickets,

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:53.200
 the least my father can do is get in the spirit.

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:53.760
 Well--

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:54.840
 Will you do that, Henry?

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:56.240
 Sure, Homer, old-timer.

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:56.960
 You will.

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.120
 And while I'm doing that to your father,

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:02.120
 would you point out just one thing to my father?

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:05.120
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:17.620
 Look at me, Father! Look at me! Isn't it heavenly?

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:19.120
 What is that you're wearing, Kathleen?

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:22.900
 Mine your evening gown for the dad's tonight, do you like it?

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:23.900
 Where's the rest of it?

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:24.900
 That's all there is.

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:25.900
 What?

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:26.900
 Isn't it heavenly?

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:29.000
 Heavenly is hardly the word.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.100
 So, Father, would you be willing to point out to Mother that her pearls are just what

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:34.660
 I need to round me out?

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:37.820
 Kathleen, you don't need rounding out, you need covering up.

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:39.260
 (audience laughs)

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:40.540
 I want you to wear that lace shoe

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:41.980
 all your grandmother gave you for Christmas.

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:42.820
 - A lace shoe.

00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:43.820
 - Around your shoulders.

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:45.540
 - That's Father, it'll ruin the whole effect.

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:47.140
 - That's just what I had in mind.

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:47.980
 - Father.

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:50.460
 - Kathleen, I will not have you catching pneumonia in public.

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:51.780
 - But I've been taking vitamins,

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:53.340
 don't you think that's enough protection?

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:54.260
 - I do not.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.020
 - But Father, if I go to the dance hall,

00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:59.180
 cover it up with a show of a stick out like a sore thumb.

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:01.760
 (upbeat music)

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:13.480
 Mr. Brown, is that you under the hood of your car?

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:14.480
 Was that...

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:16.480
 Oh, it's you, Henry.

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:17.480
 Yes, sir.

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:18.720
 Hand me that small wrench within.

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:19.720
 Sure, here.

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:20.720
 Thanks.

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:23.320
 Well, what can I do for you, Henry?

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:24.320
 For me?

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:25.320
 Why, you...

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:28.400
 Why just happened to be casually passing by?

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:35.800
 I said to myself why not talk the whole thing over with good old mr. Brown talk what over Homer? Oh

00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:39.760
 You're standing on my pliers. Oh

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:42.840
 gee poor kid I

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:45.840
 Keep thinking of them in that dance tonight

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:52.840
 Everybody who's everybody is there see and where's poor old Homer? Where that's just it?

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:59.580
 The biggest affair of the whole term and he hasn't enough money to pay for his tickets. Oh

00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:02.600
 The poor kid

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:07.160
 Doesn't it touch you? It does not and she's own for it

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:10.900
 He spent every last time he had in the world on a pair of waterproof raw hide boots

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:12.120
 Well, gee whiz mr. Brown

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:15.560
 Even if he did go overboard for a practical thing like waterproof boots

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:21.840
 You think you want to make him suffer for it? I mean boy, we all make mistakes. You don't say sure

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:23.820
 Even I make them.

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:26.280
 - He was, do you know when I did once? - What?

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:29.680
 I put a dime in a peanut machine seat, and you know what came out?

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:31.580
 - What? - Three cents stands.

00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:34.780
 So you see, those things happen to the best of us.

00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:39.680
 Henry, it isn't easy for a father to teach his son that money doesn't grow on trees,

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:41.080
 but it has to be done.

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:44.380
 Now, if he's going to that dance, you'll have to dig up the ticket money himself.

00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:46.680
 - But Mr. Brown... - I have to think of his character.

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:49.280
 But she was, Mr. Brown, think of me.

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:50.780
 - You? - Sure.

00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:56.620
 When the band strikes up the first wall, and I look out the window, and there's Homer.

00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:58.140
 Poor kid.

00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:01.340
 All dressed up in his tuxedo and no tickets.

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:06.620
 Staring in at us, with his nose pressed up against the window.

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:09.660
 Boy, I won't be able to dance a step.

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:10.940
 You don't say.

00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:14.540
 It was now that I think I'm poor kid.

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:17.260
 I've got half of mine to give Homer my tickets.

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:18.620
 And not go yourself?

00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:21.620
 Yes, sir. I've got half a mine.

00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:23.720
 (audience laughing)

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:26.900
 - Henry, did Homer ask you to speak to me?

00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:27.820
 - Homer?

00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:31.380
 Well, gee whiz, Mr. Brown, I give you my word.

00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:33.220
 Look, here are my two tickets.

00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:34.660
 You give them to Homer.

00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:35.900
 - You really mean that, Henry?

00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:36.740
 - Sure.

00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:37.820
 - You're positive?

00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:38.940
 - Positive.

00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:41.140
 - Well, thank you very much.

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:43.340
 - Mr. Brown, you mean you're really gonna take them?

00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:45.920
 (upbeat music)

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:48.500
 (upbeat music)

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:53.120
 - What's the name, Mr.?

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:53.920
 - All rich.

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:55.720
 - And could you have it pressed by three o'clock?

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:56.480
 - Three.

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:58.980
 - Look, Mr. I've got every tuxedo and centerville

00:10:58.980 --> 00:10:59.820
 in my shop.

00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:00.960
 - Yes, I know.

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:03.680
 Well, as long as I have it in time for the concert tonight.

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:06.120
 Oh, and here I'll pay for it now.

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:08.000
 - Send it to 117 Elm Street.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.520
 - Okay, Mr. I'll try, but I've only got two hands, you know.

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:12.560
 - Yes, I know.

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:13.600
 Thanks very much.

00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:17.660
 Well, Gee was... Hi Mr. Aldridge.

00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:18.760
 Hello Homer.

00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:21.360
 Aww, isn't that fantastic?

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:22.260
 I beg your pardon.

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:26.460
 Here I've been looking all over San Diego for you and Gee was here you are.

00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:27.660
 You've been looking for me?

00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:28.460
 Yes sir.

00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:30.660
 I thought we might have a little chat.

00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:31.460
 Chat?

00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:32.460
 Yes sir.

00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:33.460
 You and I?

00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:34.460
 Yes sir.

00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:37.460
 Homer, I'm afraid I'm in a hurry. I'm driving out to see a client.

00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:39.460
 That's swell. I'll go with you.

00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:39.960
 What?

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:41.960
 Then we can chat as we drive.

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:43.960
 All said Mr. Aldridge.

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:45.180
 Mush.

00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:46.060
 What did you say?

00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:47.180
 Mush.

00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:50.140
 Let's ask him, Oph, let's start.

00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:51.140
 I see.

00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:53.540
 [LAUGHTER]

00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:55.860
 Homa.

00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:58.180
 Homa, what's on your mind?

00:11:58.180 --> 00:11:59.540
 On my mind.

00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:02.660
 I look like I have something on it.

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:04.940
 Frankly, it's hard to tell.

00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:07.980
 I just thought we'd have a chat.

00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:10.180
 How are you, Mr. Aldrich?

00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:11.460
 Fine.

00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:13.620
 That's fine.

00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:16.820
 Well, now that we've had our chat, shall I let you off at the next corner?

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:18.920
 Before I drop a hint about the sale.

00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:19.520
 What sale?

00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:23.020
 Why the one the Emporium is having, unpractically everything.

00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:23.720
 You don't say.

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:24.320
 Yes, sir.

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:25.720
 Especially Tuxedo.

00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:26.420
 Tuxedo?

00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:27.620
 Yes, sir.

00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:29.020
 Boy, if...

00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:31.820
 If a person wanted to buy one, now's the time.

00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:32.520
 I see.

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:35.320
 Well, thank you very much, Homer, but I really don't need one.

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:38.320
 Mr. Aldridge, I didn't mean you. I'm in Henry.

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:39.520
 I know you did.

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:42.720
 Mr. Aldridge, why not look at it this way?

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:46.720
 Don't you warn Henry to get married and get out of the house someday?

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:48.720
 I certainly do.

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:51.720
 Well, he'll need a tuxedo for the ceremony.

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:55.720
 When that time comes, I'll scrape up the money somewhere.

00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:58.720
 Homer, do you realize I'm driving all the way to Middletown?

00:12:58.720 --> 00:12:59.720
 You are, as far as that?

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:04.720
 Yes, and it'll probably be several hours before I come back, so maybe it'll be best if I drop you at the next corner.

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:06.720
 Oh, no, Mr. Old, which I'll go along.

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:07.720
 But Homer...

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:11.720
 looks of things and may take me at least a couple of hours to have this little chat.

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:25.800
 Hello there Henry, what do you have?

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:29.640
 Gee Mr. Dehaven, I don't know if I'm in the mood for anything.

00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:34.280
 Mr. Dehaven, do you happen to have a set of cufflinks and studs for as little as a dollar?

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:35.400
 Cufflinks and studs?

00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:37.400
 That's one thing I haven't been able to dig up.

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:39.400
 I'm afraid I don't carry them, Willie.

00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:40.400
 Oh.

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:43.400
 Say Henry, would you mind if I have a few dances with your girl tonight?

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:44.400
 My girl.

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:46.400
 That's another thing I haven't been able to dig up.

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:50.400
 Willie, I may not even be going to the dance tonight.

00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:53.400
 You won't? Gee, when we're having a slow orchestra and everything?

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:54.400
 I know.

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:57.400
 I hear they're even working their way through college. That's how good they are.

00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:00.400
 Well, I'd better try someplace else for those stunts.

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:01.400
 Hi, Homer.

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:03.400
 Listen, Homer, where have you been?

00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:06.400
 Chatting with your father. Chatting with your father.

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:11.400
 And that's the last time I'll ever talk to a lawyer in my life, even socially.

00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:13.400
 Listen Homer, speaking of fathers...

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:17.400
 Boy is he tricky. I had him to the point where any minute I thought he was gonna say,

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:19.400
 "Okay, I'll buy Henry a tuxedo."

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:20.400
 Yeah.

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:23.400
 And the next thing I knew there I was lending you mine.

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:24.400
 What?

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:26.400
 I never know how he did it.

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:30.400
 Homer, your father did the same thing. I'm giving you my tickets.

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:31.400
 What?

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:34.400
 Gee, we're right back where we started from.

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:36.440
 - Only vice versa.

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:37.440
 - Boy.

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:38.440
 - Boy.

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:41.040
 Henry, why should we both be miserable?

00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:42.640
 Why don't we flip for it?

00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:43.480
 - Flip, sure.

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:45.280
 The winner gets the tux and the tickets.

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:46.280
 - Double or nothing?

00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:47.280
 - Sure.

00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:48.280
 - It's a deal.

00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:49.280
 I've got a coin in my pocket.

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:50.280
 - I thought you were broke.

00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:51.280
 - I am.

00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:52.280
 This is street guard token.

00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:53.280
 Ready?

00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:54.280
 - Sure.

00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:55.280
 Flip it.

00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:56.280
 Heads.

00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:57.280
 - Tails.

00:14:57.280 --> 00:14:58.280
 What does it say, Homer?

00:14:58.280 --> 00:14:59.280
 What does it say?

00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:00.280
 - Not good after June 1st.

00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:01.280
 (laughter)

00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:02.280
 - 1939.

00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:03.280
 Homer, that's true.

00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:06.280
 I win Homer, I win the tuxedo.

00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:07.280
 I'm all set.

00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:09.280
 I don't know, I'll ever break this tag.

00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:12.280
 There's a double cherry, Henry, it'll cheer you up.

00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:14.280
 Give it to Homer, Mr. Dehaven.

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:16.280
 He's the one who needs cheering up.

00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:19.280
 I'll just run over to your house, Homer, and pick up your top.

00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:21.280
 Okay, have a good time, hen.

00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:24.280
 Homer, you're looking worse shaped than Henry did.

00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:25.280
 I know.

00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:29.280
 Boy, just two sides to a coin, and I had to pick heads.

00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:31.280
 I could have just as easily said...

00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:35.520
 easily said, said, wait a minute.

00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:36.240
 What's wrong?

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:40.160
 Since when is not good after June 1, 1939,

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:40.760
 Tails?

00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:41.520
 What?

00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:43.600
 Listen, Henry, you double-crosser.

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:45.520
 Come back with my tuxedo.

00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:48.500
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:53.520
 [APPLAUSE]

00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:59.760
 And now, while Homer is chasing Henry,

00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:06.760
 there's time enough to listen to marith wilson and his talking people

00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:13.600
 and erm, erm, ah, the heck with it. Hey, what's the matter here? Marith, we hate being

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:17.720
 intermission. You hate being intermission? Well, why for goodness sakes? Because Henry's

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:22.400

 Uh, no.

 Since Henry had no tuxedo for tonight's big dance and

00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:42.400
 Homer had no tickets, they flipped for both with a streetcar token.

 The only thing is, why do you suppose Uncle John wired that money for a birthday present today?

00:24:14.180 --> 00:24:14.980
 Why?

00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:17.220
 My birthday isn't until next month.

00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:19.780
 He probably wanted to be sure he didn't forget.

00:24:19.780 --> 00:24:25.220
 I know, but Gee was he never gave me anything like $50 before.

00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:26.260
 Well...

00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:31.940
 Well, uh, you see, uh, Uncle John suddenly sold that copper mine stock of his.

00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:34.420
 Gee whiz, who did he unload that on?

00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:34.980
 Why?

00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:38.500
 Uh, his town hall just dropped us at the front entrance, Henry.

00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:39.780
 Yes, mother.

00:24:39.780 --> 00:24:43.300
 Gee, you're sure it won't inconvenience you to loan me the car, father?

00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:45.540
 No, we'll get a ride home with someone.

00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:46.740
 Thanks a lot.

00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:49.300
 Gee, a tuxedo and a car.

00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:52.340
 Boy, this is gonna be the biggest night of my life.

00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:53.300
 Good night.

00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:54.660
 Have a good time, Henry.

00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:55.940
 Good night, son.

00:24:55.940 --> 00:24:59.940
 Sam, I'm very proud of you.

00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:00.940
 What for?

00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:02.940
 Dear, you know very well.

00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:04.940
 Alice, it really wasn't anything.

00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:08.940
 If they ever do find copper in that mine, I'll make a fortune out of that stock.

00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:11.940
 Let's go in the concert to do a start.

00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:16.940
 You know, Sam, I still think you should have gotten yourself a tuxedo when you went down with Henry.

00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:21.940
 Alice, for the last time, this tuxedo is all right. It's just comfortably snug.

00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:25.620
 If you say so dear, just be careful when you sit down.

00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:27.780
 Let's go to our seats.

00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:29.300
 Oh, that's strange.

00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:30.420
 What's wrong?

00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:33.220
 I'm positive I put the tickets in my jacket this morning.

00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:34.580
 Sam, you mean you don't have them?

00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:38.100
 Let's not get excited, Alice. Maybe someone found them and turned them in at the ticket window.

00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:39.460
 Oh, excuse me, mister?

00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:40.020
 Yes, sir.

00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:42.260
 Or did someone turn in two lost tickets?

00:25:42.260 --> 00:25:43.380
 Third row, center?

00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:44.580
 No, they haven't, I'm sorry.

00:25:44.580 --> 00:25:45.460
 Sam!

00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:46.820
 Alice, I can buy other tickets.

00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:49.540
 As a matter of fact, I do have two left in the last row.

00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:51.620
 Sam, take them or we'll miss the first number.

00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:55.120
 There's no rush madam. We're starting a half hour late. Half hour late? Why?

00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:58.120
 Well, the orchestra had some difficulty with their dress suits tonight.

00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:01.120
 They're still getting them sorted. Here you are sir. Four dollars please.

00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:03.120
 Hey, Agnes, look who's here.

00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:06.120
 Hi Mrs. Oliver, time Mr. Oliver, how do we look?

00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:09.120
 Lovely dear. Is that a new formal?

00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:12.120
 I'll say I got a five minutes before the star close.

00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:13.120
 You don't say.

00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:16.620
 Yeah, my father finally agreed my request was perfectly reasonable,

00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:20.620
 and told my mother to buy me the formal before I went out of his mind.

00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:22.820
 But why aren't you two at the dance?

00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:26.060
 We're making a real evening of it, the concert and then the dance.

00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:27.140
 You don't say.

00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:28.460
 Have some popcorn.

00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:29.300
 Popcorn.

00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:31.980
 That's the only way I can enjoy concerts.

00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:35.700
 Homer, you mean your father finally gave in and bought you the tickets for the dance?

00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:37.660
 No, the tailor did.

00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:38.260
 What's that?

00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:38.980
 Sure.

00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:43.340
 All I had to do was promise to use the tailor shop on the other side of town from now on.

00:26:43.340 --> 00:26:45.300
 [LAUGHTER]

00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:47.900
 And he threw in tickets for the concert too.

00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:51.060
 No, gee, it's the strangest thing how I got those.

00:26:51.060 --> 00:26:54.060
 I just happened to reach into the inside pocket of my jacket,

00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:55.600
 and there they were.

00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:56.240
 What?

00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:57.500
 Third row center.

00:26:57.500 --> 00:26:58.840
 Sam.

00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:02.840
 Homer, isn't that tuxedo a little loose on you?

00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:07.220
 Gee, you should have seen it before the tailor sold me together.

00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:10.480
 And was there a button missing on your tuxedo jacket?

00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:11.180
 She was.

00:27:11.180 --> 00:27:12.740
 How did you know?

00:27:12.740 --> 00:27:13.540
 Never mind.

00:27:13.540 --> 00:27:15.900
 Will you step into the washroom with me for a minute?

00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:18.900
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:32.500
 Gee, Henry, who's that new girl on the snazzy dress dancing

00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:33.100
 with Homer?

00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:34.500
 Boy, is she snazzy.

00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:35.780
 How do I know?

00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:40.460
 Well, Gee whiz, if it isn't Agnes Lawson, boy.

00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:43.180
 Agnes Lawson, boy, here's where I cut in.

00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:44.100
 Hi, Agnes.

00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:45.220
 Now listen, Willie.

00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:48.680
 How am I way willy? Here's where I cut in. Hi, Agnes.

00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:50.080
 Now listen, Henry.

00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:54.040
 Thank you. Where have I been all my life? Bye!

00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:57.040
 Sure, it's great to be popular.

00:27:57.040 --> 00:28:01.560
 And that's what happens to a hostess when she serves Jello Tapioca Puddings for dessert.

00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:06.320
 Yup, Jello Tapioca Puddings, a miracle of goodness, a marvel of speed.

00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:09.080
 And Jello Tapioca Puddings are ready prepared.

00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:12.240
 All you do is add milk and cook for about five minutes.

00:28:12.340 --> 00:28:16.060
 Nothing to go wrong, and three glorious flavors.

00:28:16.060 --> 00:28:19.420

00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:48.780
