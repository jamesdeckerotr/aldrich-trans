00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 The Aldrich family based on characters originated by Clifford Goldsmith and

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 starring Ezra Stonner's Henry with Jackie Kalk as Homer.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 Henry! Henry Aldrich!

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 Come in, other!

00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,980
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:24,980

 [Music]

8
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:52,980
 And now for the Aldrich family. Memories of youth are precious things to be challenged and recalled all your life.

9
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:59,080
 And there's no better way to keep those memories fresh than knowing a real teenage of everything boy like Henry Aldrich

10
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:03,620
 Or Henry's every escapade seems a mirror held up to your own you

11
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:06,140
 The scene opens in the Aldrich front hall

12
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:14,460
 Homer are you sure sure I was walking by the emporium and I saw them right in the window with my own two eyes

13
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:19,860
 That's what I mean. You've been complaining. You don't see too well lately. That's only in Latin

14
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:20,860
 Oh.

15
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:23,860
 Hey, man, is that the phone?

16
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:25,860
 No, Father, just Homer.

17
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:28,860
 Oh, I thought perhaps it was that long distance call I'm waiting for.

18
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:32,860
 Henry, can you think of a way we can raise $6.95 a piece?

19
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:34,860
 Just $6.95 for genuine pilots?

20
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:35,860
 Oh, sure.

21
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:37,860
 They're surplus from the Air Force.

22
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,860
 Boy, would I like those.

23
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:41,860
 I'll say they're even for a line.

24
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:43,860
 The only thing is, it's $6.95.

25
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,860
 They'll go like hot cake, Homer.

26
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:49,860
 - Hey, my father will never advance me that much voluntarily.

27
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:50,860
 - Henry!

28
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:51,860
 - Yes, Mary.

29
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,860
 - Well, maybe you have any white elephants you'd like to get rid of.

30
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:54,860
 - Do I have one?

31
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:55,860
 - Hey, elephant.

32
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:56,860
 Do you, Henry?

33
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:57,860
 - I don't think so.

34
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:59,860
 - Do you have any--your hot, Homer?

35
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:00,860
 - White elephant?

36
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:02,860
 - Yes, I'd be glad to stop buying collection.

37
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:05,860
 - Well, I haven't noticed any lately.

38
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:08,860
 - Can we--is Mary feeling all these days?

39
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:10,860
 - Hey, Mama, I've got an idea.

40
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:11,860
 - What about?

41
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:12,860
 - How we can get the pilot's food?

42
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:13,860
 - How?

43
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,860
 Oh you calling Henry?

44
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:16,860
 Number three.

45
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:17,860
 Al, two, three, two.

46
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:18,860
 No, two, three, two.

47
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:20,860
 Hey, that's my house.

48
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:24,860
 Homer, all you have to do is talk your parents into it, and mine will be a pushover.

49
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:30,860
 When Henry, every time I ask my father for money, he makes me count out ten dollars in pennies.

50
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:31,860
 That poor.

51
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,860
 It's supposed to teach me the value of money.

52
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:37,860
 Homer, the least you can do is try here, take it.

53
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,860
 But, Henry.

54
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,860
 Hello?

55
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:42,860
 Yes.

56
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:45,860
 Is this Mrs. Brown?

57
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:46,860
 Yes.

58
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:47,860
 Who is this?

59
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:48,860
 Homer.

60
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:49,860
 Homer, who?

61
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:50,860
 Homer, you're Sam.

62
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:52,860
 Wow.

63
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,860
 Yes, dear.

64
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,860
 Mother, how's your headache?

65
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:57,860
 Fine.

66
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:00,860
 It cleared up just a little while after you left.

67
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:03,860
 Oh, that's good.

68
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:06,860
 Mother, how do you feel about boots?

69
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:07,860
 You mean the polyn?

70
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:11,860
 No, the crane with fur lining from the Air Force.

71
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:15,860
 Fear the Air Force would never take you. You are after way.

72
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:21,860
 He was, I don't want to join the Air Force. All I want is $6.95.

73
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:27,860
 So do I. I'd like a new hat. But I'm not going to cut out $10 in this heading together.

74
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:28,860
 But mother...

75
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,860
 Oh, my head aches back. Goodbye, dear.

76
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:31,860
 But mother...

77
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:33,860
 I don't think he makes me suffer.

78
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:34,860
 I love it.

79
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:35,860
 Hello.

80
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:39,860
 Boy, you don't know how to handle mothers at all, Homer.

81
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:41,860
 Well, let's see you do better.

82
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:44,860
 Dear, you're not disturbing your father, are you?

83
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:45,860
 Disturb him?

84
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:46,860
 How could we do that?

85
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,860
 Well, I want you to be very careful today.

86
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:50,860
 He's working on a very important case.

87
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:52,860
 Has he been kicked out of his office?

88
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,860
 No, Homer, it's being painted.

89
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:57,860
 And I'd appreciate it if you'd steer clear of his study.

90
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:58,860
 Mother...

91
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:03,660
 Mother, how would you like to go through this winter and not have to worry about my

92
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:04,660
 catching cold.

93
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:05,660
 Catching cold.

94
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:06,660
 Nice going, him.

95
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:08,660
 Let me see your forehead, Henry.

96
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:09,660
 Oh, no, Mother.

97
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:10,660
 You don't understand.

98
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:11,660
 I don't have a cold now.

99
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:14,660
 It's this winter I'm worrying you about.

100
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:16,660
 So, could I have 695?

101
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:17,660
 What's for?

102
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:18,660
 Boots.

103
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:19,660
 Politics boots.

104
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:20,660
 Sort of like a luscious.

105
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:23,660
 Dear, you'd have to ask your father for that much money.

106
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:25,660
 You mean if it's alright with him, it's alright with you?

107
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:28,660
 I suppose so, but do it quickly.

108
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:29,660
 He's in his study.

109
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:32,660
 Can we explain it's really our patriotic duty to take these boots off

110
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:37,820
 boots off the governor's hands. Yeah. Father. Yes. Is it the phone is at long

111
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:41,960
 distance the phone? No sir. Henry I do not wish to be disturbed this afternoon.

112
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:47,140
 Is that clear? But but I'm going out and play. Father couldn't you answer just one

113
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:56,300
 question for me. Yes. May I have 695 for a pair of boots? You may not. Homer maybe

114
00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:03,540

 fine

138
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,180
 The first is volume three.

139
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,740
 - Article 14.

140
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,780
 - Article 23.

141
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:57,780
 Got it?

142
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:58,780
 - Yep.

143
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:00,420
 - The second one, let me see.

144
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:03,860
 - Connor, would you consider those tattoo of Liberty bookends on your desk?

145
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:04,860
 White elephant?

146
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,860
 - Mary, I'm speaking to Chicago.

147
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:07,860
 - Oh, mother.

148
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:08,860
 - Oh, hello, Bert.

149
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:10,620
 Now, what's the second one?

150
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,860
 - Mother, I found it.

151
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:13,060
 - Oh, you found what, dear?

152
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:16,020
 - Got black and purple veins at Bellgate five years ago.

153
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,540
 It's a perfect white elephant.

154
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:21,260
 - Peter, do you think we should give that away after all your Aunt Bell paid 25?

155
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:27,100
 $5 for it she told you that of course not just happened to leave the price tag on

156
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:31,620
 Oh, well, it's certainly not doing anybody any good up in the alley. All right, dear

157
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:37,140
 Sammy you still on the phone? Oh, thank you very much, right?

158
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:39,500
 Goodbye

159
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:44,380
 What is it Alice dear? Please come and eat your lunch. Oh first I must copy these figures into my brief

160
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:49,780
 You can do that if you eat you've got to take some nourishment. Oh, but I am sick very well

161
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:54,780
 And Alice isn't there any way to get the boys out of the house this afternoon?

162
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:57,780
 I'll speak to them, dear. You go in and start on your salad.

163
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:00,780
 Oh, certainly a relief to have that Chicago business all over.

164
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:02,780
 Henry, I saw it myself.

165
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:04,780
 Henry? Yes, mother.

166
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:05,780
 Dear, I'd like to speak to you.

167
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:11,780
 Mother, I know what you're going to say, and the only reason I'm excited is because of a ridiculous thing Homer just said.

168
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:15,780
 Mrs. Allrich, do you happen to have last night's paper around?

169
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:21,380
 It's right there on the telephone table, but dear you and Homer will have to get out of the house this afternoon

170
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:27,980
 Yes, mother here. I'll show you Henry even if the ad is in there. They never give a job like that to us

171
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:33,880
 Why not? We're we're too young. No, that's a beautiful part of it. What I find the ad

172
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:40,320
 There it is Henry. Let's see wanted men to work on street cars Saturdays

173
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:43,060
 Good pay experience unnecessary

174
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:49,620
 Call L950. Experience unnecessary. I know. Police we can do is call.

175
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:56,980
 Number three. L950. L950. Hope they pay us higher. Three dollars a day, Henry. For us?

176
00:07:56,980 --> 00:08:00,260
 Now tell the truth. Doesn't that sound foolish?

177
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:06,660
 Senator Streetcard Company Employment Office. Hello. I'm calling about the ad in yesterday's paper.

178
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:12,340
 Yes? How inexperienced can you be? You've had a high school education?

179
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:15,340
 In a manner of speaking you might say so.

180
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:16,340
 That's enough.

181
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:18,340
 Would you tell that to my friends?

182
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:19,340
 Here Henry.

183
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:20,340
 Hello?

184
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,340
 What is it you want to know?

185
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:24,340
 You mean you'd let us drive street cars without experience?

186
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:26,340
 Of course not.

187
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,340
 Do just help collect fares.

188
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:30,340
 On the line that runs down to the football stadium.

189
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:32,340
 Is that all? Just collect fares?

190
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,340
 That's right.

191
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:36,340
 If you want that job you better come down today before 5.

192
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:37,340
 Ask me.

193
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,340
 This is Lincoln's browser.

194
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:40,340
 Lincoln's browser?

195
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:42,340
 Homer write that down.

196
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:44,340
 Blingenspelzer?

197
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:46,340
 How do you spell it?

198
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:48,340
 Just the way it sounds.

199
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:50,340
 Blingenspelzer.

200
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:51,340
 Prashiller.

201
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:53,340
 Blingenspelzer.

202
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:55,340
 I'll write it down next to the ad.

203
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:57,340
 Mr....

204
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:59,340
 How much would that job pay?

205
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,340
 Six twenty a day.

206
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,340
 Six twenty?

207
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:02,340
 Six twenty.

208
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:03,340
 Oh boy.

209
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,340
 What do you take?

210
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:05,340
 Okay.

211
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:06,340
 Drop down.

212
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:07,340
 Goodbye.

213
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:08,340
 I told you, Henry.

214
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:09,340
 I told you.

215
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:12,340
 Henry, could I have part of that paper to wrap this phase in?

216
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:13,340
 Sure, Mary, here.

217
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:15,340
 My goodness, I don't need that much.

218
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:17,340
 Here, I just cleaned this hole.

219
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,340
 I'll pick the paper, Seth.

220
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:20,340
 Are you using all of that paper, Henry?

221
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,340
 Now, just this section.

222
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:23,340
 It will give me the rest of it.

223
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:25,340
 'Cause the junk man comes today.

224
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:27,340
 I'm going down to the White Elephant shop.

225
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:28,340
 Very well.

226
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:31,340
 And Henry, remember what I told you about getting out of the house.

227
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:33,340
 Henry, you know what? Let's do one.

228
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,340
 Let's take a street car down there.

229
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,340
 We can get experience as we go.

230
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:37,340
 That's right.

231
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:44,340
 If they pay $6.20 for us the way we are, imagine what they'll pay if we know the business.

232
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:55,840
 You're crazy, Henry.

233
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,340
 You're the one who's crazy.

234
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:01,340
 Because you've been earning this trolley for 10 minutes, you're thinking of the whole thing.

235
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:03,840
 He uses that pedal to ring the bell.

236
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,340
 Ring the bell, ring the bell.

237
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:09,340
 Homer, what happens when your father presses the pedal in his car?

238
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:10,340
 It stalls.

239
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:14,340
 Come on, let's go up and stand by them motily.

240
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:15,340
 Okay.

241
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:16,340
 Find straight off.

242
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:19,340
 Do you mind letting that lady off, Sonny?

243
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,340
 Excuse me.

244
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:22,340
 Watch your step getting off, Miss.

245
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:25,340
 Wallen Street next.

246
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:27,340
 You boys getting off the ball?

247
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:29,340
 Ah, no, sir.

248
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:32,340
 Mr. Do you mind us standing here?

249
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,340
 I guess not.

250
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:37,340
 You think you might like to take up transportation when you get older?

251
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:40,340
 Yes, we're thinking of going into it right now.

252
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:41,840
 It's a fine career for a man.

253
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,840
 Is that a fine?

254
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:46,840
 Yes, indeed. You get around. See the world. You know what I mean?

255
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:51,840
 Oh, mister, that pedal on the floor there. Is that the gas or the bell?

256
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,340
 Neither. It's a brake.

257
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:56,340
 You see, Homer. It's a good thing we ask.

258
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:58,840
 Well, this isn't Walnut Street, mister.

259
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:01,340
 I know. I have to go out and switch the track.

260
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:05,980
 Oh boy, look at all those things he has to work.

261
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:08,380
 Henry, which one is the belt he's supposed?

262
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:10,060
 Now listen Homer, don't touch anything.

263
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:11,500
 There it is, hand that butt.

264
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,780
 Homer, look out for the clank.

265
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:13,100
 Why?

266
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,220
 Homer, you're out of all!

267
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:16,380
 I'm hoping Homer's not there!

268
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,140
 I don't know how you stay!

269
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:21,900
 Oh boy, he hit stop.

270
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,660
 Huh, good work, Homer.

271
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:25,500
 May, didn't you stop it?

272
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,540
 Who started that car?

273
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:27,660
 Who started that car?

274
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,340
 Oh, it's futile.

275
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,940
 It was an accident, hon.

276
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,860
 Sure, and it stopped it, man.

277
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,180
 It stopped all right.

278
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,180
 It chanced.

279
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:36,460
 Smack into the Swiss.

280
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:38,940
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

281
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:45,620
 Hello?

282
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:46,280
 Hello?

283
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,140
 Hello, sir.

284
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:48,140
 What had cost you--

285
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,020
 Yes, pretty much.

286
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:49,860
 I'm sorry, sir.

287
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,620
 There'll be three hours a day.

288
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:52,380
 Three hours?

289
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:55,420
 Operator, don't you realize that brief has to be in by five?

290
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:56,220
 I'm sorry, sir.

291
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,220
 We'll do that quick, yes.

292
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,220
 Thank you.

293
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:59,380
 No, Sam, calm down.

294
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:00,420
 Calm down, Alice.

295
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,500
 Do you realize what losing that paper means?

296
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,980
 But if you'll just tell me what sort of paper it was--

297
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:05,900
 A newspaper.

298
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:06,540
 A newspaper.

299
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:07,660
 Yes, it is times.

300
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:10,300
 I jotted it down on the margin and left it right here

301
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:13,340
 on the telephone table when you made me come to lunch.

302
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:14,580
 Oh, dear.

303
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:17,420
 Sam, I thought it was just an ordinary center bill time.

304
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:19,140
 Alex, what did you do with it?

305
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,740
 I told Henry he could have it.

306
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,460
 Henry has it?

307
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:23,380
 Yes, that is he has part of it.

308
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:24,300
 Where the rest?

309
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:27,660
 Mary, all except the part I put on the trash pile outside.

310
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:28,580
 On the trash pile?

311
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:29,740
 Maybe the part I want is there.

312
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:34,340
 The only thing is, go to the jumpman, take that out, not more than 15 minutes ago.

313
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:35,340
 Oh, no.

314
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:36,340
 Mother, are you all?

315
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,840
 Mary, come in here at once.

316
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,840
 My goodness, Father, you should have seen the excitement downtown.

317
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,440
 Travel was tied up for bomb.

318
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,440
 Never mind, that way.

319
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,440
 We were jacking up a streetcar right in the middle of Maine.

320
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,240
 Alice.

321
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,740
 Mary, what did you do with that part of the newspaper?

322
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,440
 You wrapped Aunt Belle's vase in.

323
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,440
 I left it in the white elephant shop with a vase.

324
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,740
 Go right back there and get it.

325
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:54,540
 His father.

326
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,140
 Who are?

327
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:58,340
 I have some very important information written down on part of that paper.

328
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:00,260
 Oh my goodness, I'll run all the way!

329
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:02,060
 Before you do, change your display deal.

330
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:04,020
 - Let him out in the flat heels, just start.

331
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:04,860
 - Yes, Father.

332
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,300
 - Did Henry say where he was going out?

333
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,140
 - No, dear.

334
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:08,140
 - Well, I'll have to find him somehow.

335
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:09,700
 Meanwhile, you called us and tell him

336
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,100
 to bring all our papers right back.

337
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,940
 - Yes, dear, and how about a cup of tea?

338
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:13,940
 - Tea, tea.

339
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:15,580
 - To calm you down.

340
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:16,780
 - I'll get it, let your car go.

341
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:18,900
 - I'll put on the wall, hey.

342
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:19,820
 Go ahead, Chicago.

343
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:21,140
 - I should go where?

344
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:24,380
 - Henry, is that you?

345
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:26,900
 - Yes, Father, boy, and do we need a lawyer?

346
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:27,740
 - Where are you?

347
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:32,740
 downtown with Homer and the streetcar company and sits where responsible.

348
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:34,740
 Hey, redoch you will the step. I'm coming right down.

349
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:35,740
 You are?

350
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:40,740
 Homer, we have nothing to worry about. I just got us the best lawyer in town.

351
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:52,740
 Where'd your father go?

352
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:55,740
 And there he is talking to the man from the streetcar company.

353
00:13:55,740 --> 00:14:01,900
 company where there in front of the drugstore oh yeah boy is that guy in man see

354
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:05,500
 the way he's pointing his finger right in your father's face you'll notice though

355
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:09,540

 Yes, Mary. I'm just as thrilled as I can be about that.

00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:33,360
 But I can't go through a whole wagon load of papers

536
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,840
 right in front of the courthouse.

537
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,160
 And then I'll find it then.

538
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,600
 Well, back, Sheila up to the curb.

539
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,680
 I suppose I'll have to try.

540
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,680
 Yes, sir.

541
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,840
 Back up there, Sheila.

542
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:42,840
 Back up.

543
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:43,840
 Back up.

544
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,600
 Hey, the wagon seems stuck somehow.

545
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,440
 Hurry up, Gus.

546
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,120
 Here comes a policeman.

547
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,320
 Well, I'll be hanged.

548
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,840
 No wonder she won't move.

549
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,520
 The winds are stuck in the street, gertrags.

550
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,400
 What?

551
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:56,200
 Well, I'm not getting mixed up with the streetcar company again.

552
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,760
 Hey, hey, you can't leave me now.

553
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,480
 There comes Henry.

554
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,240
 There, but what will I tell the law?

555
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,760
 Hey, Henry, how are you?

556
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,720
 I'm a boy, Father.

557
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,840
 We ran all the way.

558
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:05,560
 Have you got the paper?

559
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,960
 That's a long story.

560
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,840
 We went down to the graveyard, see?

561
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:09,600
 What graveyard?

562
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,800
 But they'd already cleaned old 99 out.

563
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,800
 So we had to go to the incinerator.

564
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,920
 But it was already incinerated.

565
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:16,920
 Father?

566
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,840
 Father, I thought it.

567
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:18,520
 What's that?

568
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,480
 No, Mary.

569
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,720
 Where did you find it?

570
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,160
 Where I've been all afternoon.

571
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:22,960
 And Mrs. Smith.

572
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:23,640
 What floor?

573
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,040
 Facing this newspaper together.

574
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:25,800
 Never mind that.

575
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:26,840
 Read off what's there.

576
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:27,960
 It's 10 minutes to five.

577
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,000
 Yes, Father.

578
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,120
 Oh, wait till I get this brief, Oban.

579
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:31,560
 Go ahead.

580
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,120
 From the top?

581
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:32,520
 Yes.

582
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,240
 What's the first?

583
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,920
 Five pounds of potatoes.

584
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:35,320
 What?

585
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:35,840
 What?

586
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,280
 Then comes a pound of coffee.

587
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,240
 Mary.

588
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,800
 That's a grocery list.

589
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,880
 I know, but I thought it might be part of your case.

590
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,480
 Mary, what kind of a case would I have

591
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,040
 with five pounds of potatoes?

592
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,760
 Well, I didn't know it.

593
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,240
 I mean, I thought--

594
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,000
 I was just trying to help.

595
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,500
 Oh, well, of course you were.

596
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,500
 I'm sorry, Mary.

597
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,000
 I'm sorry, too.

598
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,200
 So am I, Mr. Aldrich.

599
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,560
 Homer, keep out of it.

600
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,040
 Well, thank you, Homer.

601
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:05,120
 Henry, I appreciate what you did, too.

602
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,400
 Well, we might as well go home.

603
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:10,640
 You mean you're giving up, Father?

604
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,120
 It's just a few minutes to five.

605
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,520
 There isn't much hope left.

606
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,120
 Does this mean you're ruined, Mr. Aldrich?

607
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:19,000
 Well, not completely, Homer.

608
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,160
 Come on, Mary, we'll walk on ahead.

609
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:26,320
 Boy, if we hadn't wanted those pilots boots,

610
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,320
 that's what started the whole thing.

611
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,320
 How, Henry?

612
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,080
 If it hadn't been for them, we would never

613
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:33,560
 have called Hellsinfessor for that job.

614
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,000
 Hellsinfessor?

615
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,120
 Henry, that man's name was Hockendouper.

616
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,400
 Homer, you're crazy.

617
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,840
 You are the one who's crazy.

618
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:41,200
 Man?

619
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,280
 Sure I'll prove it.

620
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:42,720

00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,160

622
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,640
 Here's that clipping with his name or--

00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,640
 What's wrong?

624
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,640
 Was his name Voll III, Art 14?

625
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,640
 What?

626
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,640
 Oh, she was.

627
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,640
 I was looking at the wrong side.

628
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,640
 Voll III, Art.

629
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,640
 Homer, let me see that.

00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,640
 Oh boy.

 Four fifty-nine.

 and three quarters. Boy, if it wasn't for the streetcar company selling us, everything would be fine.

646
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:44,640
 Henry, would you do me a favor? Sure, fine. In the future, would you please stay away from streetcars?

647
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:49,640
 You mean for the rest of my life? If necessary. Maybe you're right.

 Here it is on this table. Who's it from? I haven't looked yet.

 Oh, my goodness. What's so funny?

 Is this bad? There are jokes on it? Sam, do you know what it says?

 What? For smoother writing, use this pad by Golly.

 For smoother writing, use the center of the control.
