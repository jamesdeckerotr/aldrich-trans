00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.240
 Henry! Henry Oldry coming, mother!

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:27.560
 The Oldry family written by Clifford Goldsmith and starring as Ristone. Entertainment for

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:34.560
 all the family brought to you by Postam, attempting wholesome drink for all the family. Postam.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:53.880
 Friends, welcome once again to a visit with the Aldrich family. And since this program

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:58.040
 as intended primarily for your amusement, we hope there's nothing to interfere with

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.720
 your sitting back and enjoying the fun.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.880
 Of course, if something does interfere, if perhaps you're troubled by a touch of indigestion,

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.040
 we suggest that for the moment you be practical about it.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.600
 Now while you think of it, consider whether coffee may cause your indigestion, whether

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.800
 you wouldn't benefit by drinking post-em instead.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.080
 You see, while coffee is popular with most people, and while many people can drink it

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.680
 without feeling distress, many others cannot.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.520
 So by all means, if you think coffee upsets you, switch to postam.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.120
 For postam contains no stimulants, nothing upsetting in any way.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:38.680
 Just drink fragrant flavorful postam instead of coffee, and see if before long your indigestion

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.960
 hasn't gone, see if you don't feel lots more humid again, after you give postam a fair

00:01:43.960 --> 00:02:00.960
 [Music]

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.960
 There is a neat white house at 117 Elm Street in Centerville.

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.960
 It's the home of the Aldrich's and an average American family.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.460
 Their son Henry is typical of any teenage youngster.

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.760
 He's lively, adventurous, a real boy.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.460
 Tonight we find Henry in the living room with his mother and father.

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:25.360
 But why do you say that, dear? Because, mother, because I don't want to get mixed up with anybody.

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.660
 But Henry, simply writing a letter to a girl doesn't mean you're in love with her.

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.660
 It could be taken that way. And I'm not even interested in her.

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.060
 You're not even interested in whom?

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.860
 In Darris Townsend, father.

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:36.960
 When did you see her?

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.680
 I didn't see her. I had a letter, just a ordinary short letter from her.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.680
 And mother thinks I ought to sit right away and answer it.

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.680
 Well, Henry, I think she ought to know the truth.

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:46.720
 The truth about what?

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.120
 About me getting married.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.360
 Getting what?

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.000
 Married. That's what the letter's about, Father.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.560
 She says, "Dear Henry, we happen to read in the Centerville section of last evening's

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.360
 Middletown paper that a Mr. and Mrs. Aldridge announced the engagement of their son.

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.040
 Is this you? If so, mother says congratulations.

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.440
 Father says, "Who's the lucky girl?" Sincerely, Doris.

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.540
 How to thing like that get into the paper.

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.640
 It's a very simple mistake, Sam.

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.340
 The older Isoil born Maple Street is going to be married sometime next spring.

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.840
 Oh.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.440
 And that's why I think Henry should take the time to write to Doris.

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.840
 But, Mother, why don't we just put a denial in the paper, then everybody will be satisfied.

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.740
 Henry, I think your mother would like you to write a letter.

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:29.540
 But, Father, I'm doing what Nancy Adams writes this minute.

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.940
 She's probably sitting over to her house wondering why I'm not there.

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.240
 And here I am here.

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.680
 But Henry, by this time, you could have had the letter written.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.640
 Not an explain things properly, mother.

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.400
 Henry, you're to write the letter tonight.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.900
 Tonight?

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:41.640
 Now.

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.200
 Now, Sam, as Nancy Adams is waiting, I don't think it's quite as important as that.

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.680
 I thought you wanted him to write it.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.760
 I do, dear, but after all, why can't he be home by 9.30 and write a postcard before he goes to bed?

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.760
 Yes, mother. That's the least I can do.

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.280
 Are you sure you'll come home early?

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.960
 Yes, mother.

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.680
 Alice, you don't think you ought to write it before he goes?

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.080
 Sam, Henry's promised to be here by 9.30.

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:07.080
 And, G-Father, you know me, when I promise to do a thing, I break my neck doing it.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:17.080
 [Music]

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:19.580
 Do you really think so, Henry?

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:26.080
 Oh, sure, Nancy. You take any marriage. Gee, the average marriage. I think that when a person's...

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:27.080
 You know what I mean?

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.080
 Well, as a matter of fact, Henry...

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.580
 Well, I think that you ought to have a diversity of interest.

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.000
 - No, you thought about this a lot, haven't you?

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.780
 - It's just common sense.

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.580
 Suppose a man marries a girl

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.220
 and all they both like is the same thing.

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:42.860
 Like, take gardening, for instance.

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.340
 I don't know why I take gardening, but some people do.

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:46.580
 And they have one.

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.020
 I don't mean a little one naturally, it's a big one.

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.960
 Lots of acres, like a ranch.

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.260
 Did you know they raised cotton in Arizona?

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:55.100
 - Who does?

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:56.180
 - The people in Arizona.

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:57.300
 - The married people?

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.180
 - I guess both kinds, why do you ask?

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.340
 - I just wondered whether you know anyone out there.

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:03.380
 No, I just may go to school out there.

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:05.740
 Really, Henry? I know a boy that goes to school there.

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:06.580
 In Arizona?

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.180
 Yes, I had a letter from him just day before yesterday.

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:10.040
 Is that right?

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:12.100
 Would you like to have me get it and read you some of it?

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.340
 No, I don't believe I'd care to hear it.

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:16.260
 Well, I'm sure you'd be interested, Henry.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:17.640
 You write beautifully.

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.060
 Well, the way I look at it, Nancy,

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:21.580
 if a person gets the idea,

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:24.380
 he has to go all the way to Arizona to go to school.

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:27.060
 I don't think they deserve to have any state.

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:27.980
 You know what I mean?

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:28.980
 No, I don't.

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:30.380
 Well, you take your school.

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:34.300
 Suppose you're not crazy about it. It's not the fault of the government of the state, isn't?

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:34.800
 No.

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.420
 Well, there you are. Your father's a taxpayer, isn't he?

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:41.880
 Yes. I never thought of it that way, Henry. Just a second while I answered the phone.

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.460
 Have you ever tasted peppermint crunch ice cream?

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:45.740
 No, I haven't. Why?

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:49.020
 They served it in the school cafeteria today. It was pretty good.

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:50.820
 Hello?

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:53.200
 Nancy, this is Homer. Is Henry there?

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:53.860
 Yes.

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:55.460
 Homer, I've got to speak to him.

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:56.220
 Henry?

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:57.260
 Is that my mother?

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:58.900
 It's Homer, he wants to speak to you.

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.900
 Well, Gee whiz, I can't even go visiting without his bothering me.

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:02.900
 Hello?

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:03.900
 Now listen Homer.

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:05.900
 In me I'm in a terrible predicament.

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:06.900
 What's the matter?

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:09.900
 I'm over at your house and I want some help on our Latin assignment.

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:11.900
 Well, I can't come home just for that Homer.

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:13.900
 But in me I have to have it.

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:16.900
 My father says I've been fiddling around too much in Latin.

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:23.900
 But Gee whiz, I don't have to be home until 930 and even then I'm going to be very busy writing a postcard.

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:24.900
 Alright, here.

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:30.400
 All right. If you want to put Nancy Adams in your correspondence ahead of my homework, all right.

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:32.200
 You mean you're going home again?

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:33.600
 No, always.

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:37.700
 But your father said to be here not a second later than 9.30.

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:40.300
 Well, G.I'll be there. I've got plenty of time.

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:41.300
 No, I'm...

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:42.500
 Henry, you threw?

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:43.000
 Sure.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.900
 I just ran up to get some of Dick's letters.

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:45.900
 Who's Dick?

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:49.700
 You're so interested in Arizona, I thought you'd like to have me read some parts of them.

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:51.700
 Did he write all the letters in that bumble?

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:55.700
 I'd been writing ever since last Christmas when I met him.

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:56.700
 Oh.

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:58.700
 I don't think he's missed a week since then.

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:01.700
 Here's what about Arizona's irrigation ditches.

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:02.700
 To you?

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:03.700
 Yes.

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:04.700
 Very interesting.

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:08.700
 He says, "My dear Nancy, did I see a ditch today?"

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:14.700
 It began miles and back of me and came up to me and then what as far as the eye of man could reach.

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:20.700
 When one realizes that all of this was done with human hands, it makes one proud to be a member of this human race of ours.

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:23.700
 After that we went dancing and I certainly wished you were there.

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:25.700
 They danced in the ditch?

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:29.700
 That was afterwards. And then he goes on to say...

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:30.700
 What?

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:32.700
 Oh, my goodness, I can't read you that.

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:33.700
 Oh?

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:37.700
 Here's one. Well, well, Nancy, here I am writing again.

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:41.700
 Didn't you scream at me? You'd certainly die if you ever met him.

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:44.700
 Yeah. It's got a nice sense of humor.

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:48.700
 Your letter came this morning and I have read it at least...

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:51.700
 No, no sense in reading that.

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:53.700
 Now, let's see.

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:55.700
 I have your picture on my bureau.

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:56.700
 No.

00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:58.700
 Oh, here's something interesting.

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:00.700
 Here's something wonderful.

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:02.700
 Yesterday a crowd of us saw the Grand Canyon.

00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:04.700
 Boy, is that something.

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:06.700
 Is he only interested in ditches?

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:08.700
 He's interested in everything, Henry.

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:09.700
 I'd like to read it yourself only.

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:12.700
 There's some rather personal things in it.

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:13.700
 Naturally.

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:14.700
 Of course.

00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:16.700
 Is that clock on the mantle, right?

00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:17.700
 Yes, I think so.

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:21.000
 Well, gee, I didn't realize it was nearly 8.35.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.100
 You mean you have to go?

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:23.200
 I'll say I have.

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:24.500
 Why so early?

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:29.800
 Well, I've got to help Homer with his Latin, and then I've got to write a long letter.

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:30.800
 Oh.

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:32.800
 Boy, am I ashamed of myself.

00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:36.600
 I bet there are at least four letters from this person.

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:38.200
 I haven't even started to answer.

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:40.100
 Well, I'm certainly glad you came over.

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:42.600
 She'll... the person.

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:44.600
 We'll be wondering what's been keeping me.

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:46.700
 Does she live very far away, Henry?

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:48.700
 No, just in the middle town.

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:51.420
 But her family's thinking of moving to California,

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:54.060
 and then of course my letters will have to be longer.

00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:56.460
 Well, I'm awfully sorry, you have to go.

00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:57.740
 Good night, Nancy.

00:08:57.740 --> 00:08:59.660
 And I just want to tell you how much

00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:01.940
 I enjoyed hearing your correspondence.

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:12.260
 Wait a second, huh, huh?

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:15.460
 Well, I dropped this postal card in the mail box.

00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:17.460
 Tonight's night, isn't it?

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:19.460
 Let's walk back to the house.

00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:21.960
 Did you ever notice, Henry, when you look up at the moon,

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:23.960
 it looks as though the clouds were standing still,

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:26.460
 and the moon is watch-moving?

00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:27.460
 So what?

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:29.460
 What's the matter with you, Henry?

00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:31.460
 Nothing's a matter with me.

00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:33.460
 Well, why'd you come home from Nancy so early for?

00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:36.460
 Well, you wanted me to help you with your Latin, didn't you?

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:39.460
 She was... you know how many times she's... how many times

00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:41.460
 she's gotten letters from him?

00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:43.460
 Who's gotten a lot?

00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:48.160
 Every week, Homer, every week since last Christmas, all he talks about is ditches.

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:51.760
 So, and in the meanwhile, she goes around leading other people on.

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:53.960
 Into ditches?

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:58.260
 Anybody think that just because somebody you happen to know casually is going to school

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:01.760
 where you aren't going to school, then Gee, was he's pretty wonderful.

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:02.760
 Who is?

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:04.460
 Who cares how deep the Grand Canyon is?

00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:05.460
 Do you?

00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:06.460
 I ask you.

00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:07.460
 I'm going home.

00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:08.460
 Well, go ahead.

00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:10.060
 And not only that, Homer.

00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:13.360
 Nancy's been writing to this guy just as often as he's been writing to his family.

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:19.120
 to her. Oh. Oh. Well do you know what you want to do Henry? Why should I do anything?

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:23.080
 You ought to show her though. All you have to do is write a letter to some other girl

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:27.000
 and leave it lying around when Nancy will see it. You're crazy. You talk as though I

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.660
 cared on her. But you leave right out of your hand Henry. My own sister used to do it. She

00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:36.680
 did? Sure every week. Did it get results? Well she's married isn't she?

00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:41.600
 Mary just from that? Well you don't have to let it go that far if you don't want to.

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:45.840
 The only trouble is I don't know of any of the girl I'd want to write to.

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:47.840
 You don't have to. You aren't going to mail it.

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:50.160
 You're just going to write it and let Nancy see it.

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:53.100
 Now, how about this girl you just mailed a postcard to?

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:54.300
 Darr's Townsend?

00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:57.900
 She was home. I could hardly get up enough interest to write that much to her.

00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:01.000
 Well, I'll tell you what to say. I remember my sister's letters.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.900
 Only when you write it, Henry, do it on your father's typewriter.

00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:05.400
 Don't write it in your own handwriting.

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:06.000
 Why not?

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.700
 Because it isn't romantic enough.

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:10.200
 Okay, and I'll type it on some blue paper.

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:19.200
 [Music]

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:20.700
 Have some toast, Alice?

00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:21.700
 No, thank you.

00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:22.700
 Sam, I'm worried.

00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:23.700
 Worried?

00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:29.700
 Well, dear, I don't like to mention it, but this morning, when I went in to make Henry's bed, I happened to see a letter. He typed a darst town.

00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:32.200
 I thought he was just going to send her a postcard.

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:36.700
 Well, so did I, Sam. I thought the whole thing was just a casual, ordinary bit of correspondence.

00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:37.700
 Well...

00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:42.700
 Well, Sam, I shouldn't have looked at it, but I couldn't help noticing that the letter began my darling daris.

00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:43.700
 What's that?

00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:45.700
 That's what it said, Sam. I saw it with my own eyes.

00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:47.700
 What else did he say?

00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:49.700
 Well, naturally, dear, I didn't read anymore.

00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:50.700
 Why not?

00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:52.700
 Well, because it was a personal letter.

00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:55.700
 But it was your duty as a mother to read it.

00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:58.700
 Well, if you must know, I did read the first sentence.

00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:00.700
 But that's all.

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:01.700
 What did he say?

00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:06.700
 Your letters have been coming through regularly and you will never know how they have changed my entire life.

00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:08.700
 You mean that letter she wrote him wasn't the first one?

00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:12.200
 No dear. Apparently that's why Doris Townsend was so concerned.

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:14.600
 She was afraid Henry really was engaged.

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:16.000
 You mean you think it's reached that point?

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:21.400
 I know it has. The only thing is why did he insist last night that he didn't want a right to her?

00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:25.200
 Well that's obvious Alice. He was trying to cover up that cover up.

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:26.200
 Cover up what?

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:27.200
 I don't know.

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:29.700
 Well Sam I think it's time we did something.

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:37.480
 You see her, Henry?

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:39.640
 Sure, she's sitting right there on the school steps.

00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:41.400
 And your letter's right in front of her.

00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:42.720
 But what good will it do, Homer?

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:44.680
 You dropped it so darn far from her.

00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:46.680
 I dropped it practically at her feet, Henry.

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:47.760
 And look, she's got it.

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:48.400
 She's reading.

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:49.680
 She is old boy.

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:51.480
 Old boy is she going to get a shot.

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:52.840
 Didn't I tell you, Henry?

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:54.280
 The only trouble is, Homer.

00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:55.240
 That isn't my letter.

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:56.680
 Mine's still on the ground.

00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:57.720
 It is.

00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:00.640
 Homer, can you see where the one she's reading is from?

00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:01.880
 How could I?

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:03.920
 Well, I can see as it's a fat one.

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:05.320
 A fat one?

00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:06.320
 See, I wonder...

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:07.320
 Do you suppose?

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:09.680
 Well, if it is from Arizona, don't let it get your go-head.

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:13.680
 But Homer, she doesn't have to read his letters right here on the school grounds.

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:16.320
 Wouldn't you think she'd have some loyalty to our school?

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:18.320
 Look, Henry, she's standing up.

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:19.320
 Oh boy.

00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:20.320
 She's leaning over.

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:21.320
 She...

00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:23.320
 Well, she wish she's only tying her shoelace.

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:24.320
 Homer, she blind.

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:27.320
 She's even stepping on my letter.

00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:29.320
 Now she's going into the building.

00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:30.320
 Quick, Henry, why?

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:31.320
 He'll let us going away.

00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:32.320
 Well, she was...

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:33.320
 Homer, you go that way and we'll corner it.

00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:34.320
 Hurry up.

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:35.320
 I'm hurrying.

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:41.620
 Where is she, Homer?

00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:44.020
 She's right there in the corridor talking to Eleanor.

00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:46.620
 Or if you think she saw you when you slipped my letter into her coat,

00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:47.820
 pocket, how could she?

00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:49.120
 I was talking too fast.

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:51.320
 Well, she certainly can't miss this one.

00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:54.520
 And I think it's better than a letter that blew away yesterday.

00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:56.520
 Look, Nancy's walking away.

00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:58.520
 Well, she puts her hand in her pocket.

00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:00.920
 All my troubles will be over.

00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:04.120
 The only thing is, Homer, boy, isn't that my letter sticking out of Eleanor's pocket?

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:07.520
 pocket where listen Homer did you put that in the wrong pocket of the wrong

00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:11.480
 coat I didn't know they were standing that close together I saw a pocket and

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:15.080
 went up to them we've got to get that away from Illinois I can get it away

00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:18.880

 follow her in there you'll be expelled

 - What do you think? - After all, if I were a boy and you were girl as nice as Doris Townsend,

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:02.160
 I think I'd want a picture of her. Wouldn't you, Sam?

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:05.160
 - Uh, wouldn't I, what? - Like a picture of Doris Townsend.

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:09.160
 - Well, yes, of course. - Well, I wouldn't. I just... I just...

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:13.160
 - You just what? I just don't think I like any girls.

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:16.160
 - Not any? - No, from. - Good. That's fine.

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:20.160
 Didn't I hear you using my typewriter upstairs just a few minutes ago?

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:22.160
 - Yes, Father. - What was it you were typing there?

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:28.320
 dear. Why, just something I was doing over, I typed it night before last and it blew away

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:35.840
 yesterday. Then I did another last night and that got lost today through an error. I see. Homework

00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:43.040
 dear? Why, in a way you might say it was sort of homework. I was talking with Nancy Adams' mother

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:50.560
 today. She said Nancy is writing to some boy out in a school in Arizona. If I were you, I'd take a

00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:51.560
 a little interest.

00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:53.800
 Well, I'm not going to waste my time on her mother.

00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:55.360
 You'll never find a nicer girl.

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:56.280
 She was, father.

00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:58.960
 I have other things to think about besides just girls.

00:15:58.960 --> 00:15:59.300
 She was.

00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:01.360
 I've got a lot of other things on my mind.

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:02.600
 Where are you going, dear?

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:05.040
 Just upstairs and do a little--

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:06.880
 do a little typing.

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:07.400
 Sam.

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:07.800
 Well--

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:09.200
 If you think you ought to come right out

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:11.480
 and forbid he's writing any more letters to Doris Townsend--

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:12.320
 No, Alice.

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:15.080
 Let's not make matters any worse than they are.

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:17.320
 Much better to be subtle about it.

00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:18.960
 You can't tell he may be up in his room

00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:22.200
 right this minute wondering whether Doris Townsend is worth it.

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:24.240
 That's the way a boy's mind operates.

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:27.000
 Well, of course, dear, you know more about it than I do.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:36.960
 Oh, Bunch, Bunch, Ralph.

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:38.040
 What do you have, Eleanor?

00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:39.640
 Bunch, did you lose a letter?

00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:40.520
 No, why?

00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:41.720
 You didn't.

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:44.440
 Don't you go around with a girl over in Middletown by the name

00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:45.680
 of Darf Townsend?

00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:47.840
 Sure, I take her out practically every weekend.

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:51.120
 I don't know how it got there, but I found this letter addressed to her in my

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:53.440
 coop pocket and I thought it was probably yours.

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:54.160
 Let's see it.

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:54.960
 Here you are.

00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:57.600
 Oh listen, this isn't any kind of a joke is it?

00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:58.320
 Oh no.

00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:00.240
 My darling Doris.

00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:02.160
 Say, what is this?

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:04.000
 Is it some but you wrote it?

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.520
 But getting back to earth, I hope someday I can show you the Mississippi,

00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:13.520
 which is 2,470 miles long, reaching at some point to a width of four miles.

00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:16.640
 Hey, what I want to know is who wrote this. Where's the end?

00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:20.560
 Have you ever noticed on a moonlight night how the clouds seem to stand still

00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:23.040
 and the moon zooms along in a breathtaking pace?

00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:24.800
 That's how I think of you.

00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:27.920
 Oh! Oh, so that too, Rhoda.

00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:28.960
 Who did, Rhoda?

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:31.760
 Never mind. He isn't going to live long anyhow.

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:45.280
 [Music]

00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:49.880
 Well, poor Henry is certainly having a tough time getting the right letter to the wrong girl.

00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:52.680
 And whether he ever will manage it is more than I know.

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:57.380
 But I do know, ladies and gentlemen, that if you like to get the right mealtime drink for your family,

00:17:57.380 --> 00:18:01.480
 you really shouldn't miss all the grand things that Postam has to offer you.

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:05.980
 Believe me, you'll enjoy a good hot cup of Postam for the same reason millions enjoy it.

00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:09.380
 Just because Postam tastes so downright good.

00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:14.980
 Yes, when you pour yourself a steaming cup of Postam and add just a dash of cream and sugar to it,

00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:19.780
 You have a drink that's so tempting and fragrance, so unusually delightful in flavor,

00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:22.980
 that you keep wondering why you never thought of trying it before.

00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:25.580
 Just don't expect Postam to taste like coffee,

00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:28.580
 any more than you'd expect coffee to taste like tea.

00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:32.580
 For naturally, the goodness of Postam is the goodness of a distinctive flavor,

00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:35.980
 a flavor that puts the "mmm" in Postam.

00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:38.280
 So enjoy delicious hot Postam tomorrow,

00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:41.080
 and be sure to make enough for the young folks to enjoy too,

00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:43.680
 because Postam is the drink for all the family.

00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:46.280
 Just as your family will be all for post-em.

00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:57.920
 Now getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldrich,

00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:00.440
 in an attempt to make Nancy Adams jealous,

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:03.360
 Henry has typed several letters to another girl.

00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:05.840
 But instead of mailing them, he has tried to leave them around

00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:07.800
 for Nancy would find them.

00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:10.280
 So far, however, he has been totally unsuccessful

00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:13.000
 and has lost all of the letters he's written.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.000
 The scene opens now in the typing room at central high school.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:24.700
 Homer, have you any idea where the A would be on this typewriter?

00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:26.200
 Why can't you find it yourself?

00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:30.200
 I haven't never seen the typewriters in this classroom the keys don't have any letters on them.

00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:31.700
 Well, what good are they then?

00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:33.200
 Oh, Gee whiz.

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:34.200
 Did you get an A?

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:35.400
 It's a W.

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:39.700
 Homer, what word is there that begins with W? That means the same thing.

00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:40.400
 As why?

00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:41.400
 As Angel.

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:47.380
 Why don't you just make it wing it angel wing it my wing it angel sure

00:19:47.380 --> 00:19:53.360
 Where do you think the eye would be used to be around here somewhere

00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:57.660
 Are you making plenty of carbon copies this time Henry sure look out?

00:19:57.660 --> 00:20:00.880
 OJ did you get an eye an H?

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:06.960
 Now what am I gonna do? I've got WH why don't you make it white wing at angel?

00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:09.360
 Yeah, that's nice

00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:13.360
 The only trouble is Homer, if we don't find it this time, we're really stuck.

00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:20.360
 Hello, Sam.

00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:21.360
 Yes, Alice.

00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:24.360
 Sam, I'm sorry to call you away from the office, but I want you to come home right away.

00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:25.360
 What for?

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:27.360
 Rosales Townsend's mother is here.

00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:28.360
 What's on her mind?

00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:32.360
 I can't tell you on the phone, dear, but the sooner you come home, the better. She's terribly upset.

00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:35.360
 Yes. I'll come over right away, Alice. But remember this.

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:40.360
 Remember this, no matter what she says, the girl is probably just as much to blame as Henry is.

00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:47.360
 [Music]

00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:49.360
 Homer, are you sure she finally found my letter?

00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:53.360
 Yes, Henry. I put it right in your lunchbox, right on top of her lemon pie.

00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:55.360
 Are you sure she didn't tear it up for anything?

00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:59.360
 Why should she? A letter written by you to another girl that you're calling your white wing at Angel?

00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:01.360
 It took me darn near a week to get it to her.

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:05.600
 get it to her all you have to do now and we have to go home by Monday Nancy will

00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:09.760

00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:54.200

00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:18.240

 study, isn't she? Is that right? And she, he's the biggest guy in school, Henry.

00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:27.520

 You're not.

00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:26.440
 What happened to you?

00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:28.440
 We're looking for something down here.

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:30.440
 What was Bunch Rouch doing to Henry?

00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:31.440
 To me?

00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:32.440
 He was.

00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:33.440
 He wasn't doing anything.

00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:35.440
 Well my goodness Henry, your folks just phoned the main office and they said you'd

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:37.440
 come right home to very minute schools out.

00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:46.440
 I wonder what that could be about.

00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:49.440
 I don't see why you have to feel that way about it Henry.

00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:51.440
 After all butchers three times as big as you.

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:53.440
 Did you brush the back of my coat home?

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:55.560
 I'm sure your folks won't notice a thing.

00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:56.400
 Henry!

00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:57.760
 Yes, mother, where are you?

00:23:57.760 --> 00:23:59.720
 I want you to come into the living room.

00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:01.680
 Your father and I, will I have a talk with you?

00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:02.960
 A talk with our mother?

00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:04.440
 Yes, Henry.

00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:06.400
 There's something wrong, father.

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:08.280
 How did you tell your cook pocket?

00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:09.040
 Oh, that?

00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:09.400
 That?

00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:10.600
 Well, gee whiz.

00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:11.200
 Home a deer.

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:12.800
 Would you mind leaving the room?

00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:13.720
 You want me to go?

00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:14.840
 We do.

00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:16.920
 Please go up to Henry's room until we're through.

00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:18.320
 Couldn't I wait out in the kitchen?

00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:19.560
 You could not.

00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:20.680
 Please go upstairs.

00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:21.880
 Yes, Mrs. Aldrich.

00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:23.240
 I'll wait upstairs.

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:25.240
 Now then, Henry. Yes, Father.

00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:27.440
 Your mother wants to have a talk with you.

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:30.140
 Sam, I think you're the one that should have a talk with him.

00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:32.340
 Aren't you the one Doris Townsend's mother talked to?

00:24:32.340 --> 00:24:35.040
 Doris Townsend's mother. Yes, dear. She's been here.

00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:36.940
 That would be putting it mildly.

00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:40.240
 What? Henry, Doris Townsend was never so upset in her life.

00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:42.140
 She's upset. She's upset.

00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:44.340
 Over the letter you've been writing her.

00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:45.940
 How did she get any of those?

00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:47.540
 What do you mean, how did she get any of them?

00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:49.140
 Haven't you been writing her?

00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:51.640
 I've been... I've been...

00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:52.440
 Look, Father.

00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:53.540
 Have you been writing her?

00:24:53.540 --> 00:24:54.040
 Yes, sir.

00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:56.440
 I've been writing her, but I haven't been mailing them.

00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:57.840
 What have you been doing with them?

00:24:57.840 --> 00:24:59.840
 I've been losing them.

00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:01.040
 Henry, don't be absurd.

00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:02.040
 But I have, Mother.

00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:04.340
 If you didn't intend mailing them, why did you write them?

00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:04.840
 Because--

00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:06.540
 They were written to be read by someone, weren't they?

00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:08.540
 Yes, sir, but not by Doris Townsend.

00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:09.640
 Then by whom, dear?

00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:11.540
 Look, Mother, I know you won't believe it,

00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:13.240
 but there are copies of my letter

00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:15.540
 all over Central High School.

00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:16.740
 What do you mean by that?

00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:19.640
 Father, this English paper is a very good example.

00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:20.940
 Do you mean you failed in English?

00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:23.300
 No, I gotta see Plosh for it. Let me see it.

00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:24.980
 Now, Alice, don't let him evade the issue.

00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:26.860
 We're talking about his letters.

00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:28.380
 But, Sandy, there's a letter.

00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:29.420
 To Doris Townsend?

00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:30.540
 Yes, dear.

00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:32.540
 That's what Henry's been trying to tell us.

00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:34.460
 He wrote those letters for English.

00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:36.380
 He never intended to nail any of them.

00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:37.180
 Did you, dear?

00:25:37.180 --> 00:25:38.180
 Oh, look, mother.

00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:39.260
 Of course you didn't.

00:25:39.260 --> 00:25:40.740
 It is clear as they say.

00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:43.060
 Well, why did Doris Townsend's mother

00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:45.220
 have to get so upset over a composition?

00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:46.980
 That's exactly what I wondered.

00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:48.580
 Sam, I'm going to the phone and tell her.

00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:50.140
 And give her my regard.

00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:51.880
 Hey Henry, Henry.

00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:53.140
 Here's your composition, Henry.

00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:55.040
 Oh, am I interrupting the lecture?

00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:57.040
 You are not interrupting anything, Homer.

00:25:57.040 --> 00:25:58.440
 Only Henry.

00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:01.320
 Next time, see to it that you get more than a C plus.

00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:02.040
 Yes, Father.

00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:04.480
 Henry, you know that letter Nancy handed back to you?

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:04.840
 Yeah.

00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:06.320
 Well, that isn't one of your letters.

00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:06.840
 Who's this?

00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:09.280
 It's a letter she wrote to the guy in Arizona.

00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:09.880
 From her?

00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:11.200
 You mind if I see what it says?

00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:13.080
 Wait, Homer, that letter wasn't meant to be read.

00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:14.240
 What do you mean it wasn't?

00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:15.240
 It isn't even sealed.

00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:15.640
 She said--

00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:17.240
 Now listen, Homer, give that to me.

00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:18.160
 Oh, boy.

00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:18.720
 Homer.

00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:19.720
 Oh, boy.

00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:21.720
 Oh my. Oh boy.

00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:23.720
 Are you reading? You're all homo.

00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:25.720
 The whole thing's about you.

00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:26.720
 About me?

00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:29.720
 She says you're one of the nicest sweetest boys she's ever known.

00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:30.720
 Who me?

00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:33.720
 Henry, you're one of the nicest sweetest boys she's ever known.

00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:36.720
 Now wait Homer, she said that about me?

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:39.720
 Well gee whiz, can you imagine that?

00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:56.720
 [Music]

00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:59.720
 Henry Aldrich will be back in just a moment.

00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:03.720
 In the meanwhile, folks, a reminder of the double-barreled reason why you like Postam.

00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:06.720
 For one thing, you'll like it if coffee upset you.

00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:10.320
 For another you like it just because Postam tastes so swell.

00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:13.020
 It's a grand tempting drink for all the family.

00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:15.420
 So get Postam from your grocer tomorrow.

00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:22.420
 [Music]

00:27:22.420 --> 00:27:23.820
 No, mother.

00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:27.320
 I'm sure I don't feel well enough to go to school today.

00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:29.720
 But Henry, you'll miss some very important work.

00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:32.220
 No, I won't, mother. I won't miss a thing.

00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:34.420
 All we were going to do today, anyhow,

00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:38.420
 always read our English compositions in front of the class.

00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:41.420
 And I never felt so low in my life.

00:27:41.420 --> 00:27:44.420
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:53.420
 Here is a popular Christmas suggestion.

00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:57.420
 In addition to your other presence, give United States defense bonds and stamps.

00:27:57.420 --> 00:28:00.420
 Make patriotism a part of your giving.

00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:03.420
 The money you spend for defense bonds helps to resist tyranny and oppression.

00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:06.420
 helps keep the spirit of Christmas alive in this country.

00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:12.420
 So buy defense bonds and stamps and keep on buying them for yourself and for your friends this Christmas.

00:28:12.420 --> 00:28:22.420
 Be sure to listen again next week to the Aldrich family same time, same station, for another sparkling half hour with your favorite youngster, his family and his pals.

00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:26.420
 The Aldrich family starring as Rustone is written by Clifford Goldsmith.

00:28:26.420 --> 00:28:29.420
 Original music is composed and conducted by Jack Miller.

00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:34.420
 This is Harry Van Zell saying, "You will enjoy fragrant flavor for Postam."

00:28:34.420 --> 00:28:37.420
 And remember, Postam contains no stimulants.

00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:40.420
 It cannot give you indigestion. Good night.

00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:53.420
