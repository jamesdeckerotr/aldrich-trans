00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.800
 Henry! Henry Oldrich!

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.300
 Coming, Mother!

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.800
 The Oldrich family!

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.200
 A special rebroadcast for you soldiers, sailors, and marines of the United Nations.

 [Music]

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.800
 A typical teenage boy has always scampered across the American scene.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:52.280
 First came Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn and then Penrod, and nowadays there's Henry Aldrich.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.840
 And Henry adds his own individual flavor to every mishap he bumps into.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.480
 The scene opens in the Aldrich front hall.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:00.980
 The time is evening.

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:02.480
 Mary!

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.780
 Mary, are you in the living room?

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.380
 Yes, Henry! Come on in!

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.280
 Could you come out in the hall, please?

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.380
 I want to speak to you about something important!

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.380
 Henry, don't you realize Muriel Watson is in the living room and she wants to say hello to you?

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.180
 Listen, Mary, I'm in no condition the bother with Muriel Watson.

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:18.480
 Boy, you've all up.

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.680
 I want you to put on a phone call for me.

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.920

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.960
 to me Henry you're taking your best girl just a bit for granted hello hello

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.960
 Oh, I was just going to... Hello.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.960
 Henry, I'm awfully sorry, but would you mind not coming over tonight?

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:21.960
 Who I?

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.960
 Yeah, something's just come up and I'm awfully sorry, Henry.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.960
 Well, that's all right, Kathleen. As a matter of fact.

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.960
 You can come over tomorrow night though, I think.

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.960
 Oh, well, that's not an idea.

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.960
 Henry, if you're going to the movies with Homer, why don't you ask Kathleen to go along?

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.960
 Mother, do you want everybody to hear you?

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:40.960
 What's that, Henry?

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.000
 Everybody to hear you.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 What's out, honey?

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.920
 Goodbye, Catalina.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:44.920
 And thanks very much.

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:45.760
 Hi.

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.560
 Henry, you mean you're going over there?

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.960
 Why, I tell you, mother, well, it's sort of a coincidence.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.160
 Huh.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.840
 Hello?

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:54.760
 Number, please.

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.200
 Elm 232.

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.560
 Elm 232.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.600
 Henry, won't you please go in there and talk to Muriel?

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.160
 Will I go up and change my dress?

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:02.000
 With Muriel?

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.600
 What's there to talk to her about?

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.480
 Henry, she's an awfully pretty girl.

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:06.160
 No, Mary.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.560
 I'm going to the movies with Homer.

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:08.440
 Hello.

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:09.360
 Hello, Homer.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.120
 This is Han.

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.420
 Hi. So, it's just gonna call you.

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.120
 Yeah? Well, I'll meet you.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.820
 Why? I tell you, Henry. I don't think I can go to the movies tonight.

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:18.620
 What's that?

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.920
 Well, something else just came up that I don't have any control over.

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.820
 That's what I was just gonna call you about.

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.920
 I know, but Homer, you can't do a thing like that.

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.620
 You did the same thing last night.

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.320
 Henry, can I help but if something came up last night too?

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:32.220
 But she will.

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.020
 I've gotta go now. I'll see you tomorrow.

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.720
 But Homer!

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:35.220
 Bye.

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:36.220
 And now listen, Homer.

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:37.520
 She will.

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:38.320
 Henry?

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.520
 Yes, who's calling me?

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.120
 It's Nereal Henry. Wouldn't you like to come in here?

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.420
 Why, I tell you...

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:45.620
 Oh, me?

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.220
 Well, what did you want?

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.220
 Nothing in particular. I just thought maybe you'd like to talk, wouldn't...

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.220
 Are you upset about something?

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:53.420
 Boy, I'll say.

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.120
 My best friend Homer Brownie just busted a date with me.

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.620
 Oh, yes, I remember. Homer's going over to Catholic this night, isn't he?

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.220
 - Who, Homer? - Yes.

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.120
 - She said he was over there last night, too. - Who, Homer?

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.020
 Yes.

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:06.520
 Over to Kathleen's...

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.020
 Oh, no, you're...

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:09.620
 You've got it all mixed up.

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.420
 Homer runs around with Agnes.

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:12.420
 With Agnes?

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.020
 Why are you supposed to tell me a thing like that?

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:16.620
 She didn't. She didn't.

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.420
 She probably said that Agnes told her that...

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:20.220
 Excuse me while I answer the phone.

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.820
 Well, I don't know how I could have made a mistake like that though.

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.220
 Well, frankly, Muriel, I think you ought to be a little more careful.

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.220
 Henry, are you being rude to Muriel?

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:29.220
 Who, I'm Muriel?

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.620
 She was. When a person goes around saying it's Kathleen, when it's Agnes,

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.020
 and I know perfectly well...

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.220
 Hello?

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:36.420
 Oh, this is Agnes.

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:37.420
 What's that?

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:38.260
 Kathleen?

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.060
 No, my goodness, Henry, it's lightning.

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.980
 Oh, hello?

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:43.180
 Listen, Henry, call the speak with Homer, please.

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:44.220
 Homer isn't here.

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:45.060
 He isn't.

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:46.620
 We'll be there last night, Henry.

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:47.820
 No, something came up.

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:48.940
 Well, that's what I suspected.

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:50.460
 That's exactly what I suspected.

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:51.100
 Goodbye.

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.900
 What's that?

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:52.340
 I'm Miss.

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:53.340
 Where is he?

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.840
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.420
 (upbeat music)

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:09.320
 - Henry?

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:10.160
 - Yes, mother?

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.360
 - Could you bring that light around here

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.160
 so I can see the reed, please?

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:14.400
 - Yes, sure.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:15.760
 - Here, I thought you said last evening

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:17.840
 you were going over to Kathleen's tonight.

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:18.920
 - Who, my mother?

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.200
 - Well, didn't you phone her last night

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.560
 and break a date with her and change it to tonight?

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.160
 - I know, but I...

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:28.160
 I decided I'd just stay home and get acquainted with the family for a change.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.160
 Henry, I want you to look at me.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.160
 What is the matter?

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.160
 Mother, will you tell me something?

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.160
 I mean, will you tell it to me frankly?

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.160
 I'll try to.

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.160
 Did you like Kathleen?

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.160
 Well, yes, Henry, of course.

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.160
 Only why do you ask, did I like her?

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:46.160
 No reason. Only I was just wondering...

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:52.160
 Gee, did you ever notice when she used to go down the street how she'd always be smiling?

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.300
 Here is something happened to Kathleen.

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:55.460
 Happened to her?

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:57.460
 No, not especially.

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:00.160
 But do you know how I'll always think of her?

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:04.380
 I mean, for as long as I live, I'll always remember how she loved chocolate marshmallow

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:05.380
 sundies.

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:06.380
 What's that?

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:09.180
 She, the poor kid, she kept me broke half the time.

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:10.180
 But I didn't mind.

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:13.220
 Henry, you talk as though Kathleen Anderson were dead.

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:15.220
 Well, so far as I'm concerned she is.

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:17.220
 She's a thing of a past.

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:19.180
 My boy's just dropped the subject.

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:21.180
 Please don't even mention Kathleen anymore.

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:26.600
 I'm tired of hearing about her, but Henry I've hardly mentioned her if that doorbell should ring right this minute

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:32.140
 And I should open and see Homer Brown standing there. I'm all off it. I'm all off it. Oh boy

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:37.140
 Yeah, wasn't that the doorbell? Yes, mother. I'll answer it Henry. Please at least un-cringed your fit

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:42.480
 I'm not going to him hard as a matter of fact. I'm going to get something out of this whole car

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:47.780
 Mother I hope you don't think I'm going to let him come to this house and add insult to injury to me do you

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:51.500
 Well, oh

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:53.640
 Oh, gee, it's you

00:06:53.640 --> 00:07:00.240
 Nothing nothing is Mary ready who isn't Henry? It's me or Mrs. Aldrich

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:06.140
 Henry is it all right for me to go into the living room? Oh, yes sure. Hello there dear. My goodness

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:12.440
 But doesn't your hair look nice. Do you like it this way, Mrs. Aldrich? Do you like it Henry? What's up? If you'll excuse me, Muriel

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:19.080
 I'll go upstairs and tell Mary you're here. All right, Mrs. Aldrich boy Henry. I'm off the glad you're home boy

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:20.080
 Oh, yeah.

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:21.520
 What's the matter, Henry?

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:22.520
 I'm Muriel.

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:26.520
 Would you be willing to drop into Kathleen's on your way home and deliver a note for me?

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:27.520
 Oh, Kathleen.

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:30.120
 That isn't fucking fine, the darn thing.

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:31.960
 Is it very personal, Henry?

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:34.920
 No, no, gee whiz.

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:37.560
 Do you mind if I dump out my pocket here on the sofa beside you?

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:38.560
 No, of course not.

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:40.560
 Why don't you sit down here next to me?

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:42.360
 What are you supposed to have...

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:44.920
 What do you suppose I could have done with that note?

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:47.800
 I remember distinctly writing it in Latin class today.

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:52.360
 And then, and finally, do you mind if I tell you something I've always wanted to tell you,

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:54.920
 but never felt I knew you well enough before, too?

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:55.920
 What?

00:07:55.920 --> 00:08:00.800
 Well, I think you've just been throwing yourself away on Kathleen.

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:02.120
 Really?

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:05.400
 You know, maybe it was a good thing I lost that nose.

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:06.800
 Of course.

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:11.200
 As a matter of fact, I think it was terrible have heard of breakup a beautiful friendship

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:13.480
 like that that you and Homer had between yourselves.

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:14.200
 You do?

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:17.320
 I'm going to have a talk with Homer and tell him how awful you feel.

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:22.820
 Oh, well Henry, do you mind if I fix that lock of hair that's standing up in the back of your head?

00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:27.820
 Oh, geez, that up again? Somebody ought to follow you around just all day long.

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:28.820
 There.

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:30.020
 Is it down now?

00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:32.820
 I went so busy, I'd be glad to follow you around.

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:36.820
 Gee, was, can you imagine that? I never even noticed it before.

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:37.820
 Never noticed what?

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:40.820
 Your eyes are practically the same color as mine.

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:41.820
 They are?

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:46.820
 Henry, you have no idea how much respect I have for you.

00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:48.020
 For me, why?

00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:51.820
 You're the only boy I've ever met that's never tried to kiss me.

00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:53.420
 What's that? That's right, Henry.

00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:55.820
 Well, gee, I'm glad you feel that way.

00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:58.020
 Because I don't think I'll follow...

00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:00.220
 I mean, the minute he sits down and so far...

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:01.220
 Well, you know...

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:02.420
 Gee, he ought to...

00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:03.220
 I mean...

00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:04.420
 You know what I mean?

00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:05.620
 Yes, Henry.

00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:06.220
 Well...

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:07.620
 Henry, are you in the living room?

00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:08.420
 She was.

00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:09.420
 Yes, Mary.

00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:12.020
 You know anything about that phone call that just came?

00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:12.820
 What phone call?

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:14.420
 Brothers on the phone, write this minute.

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:16.620
 Don't you have a teacher by the name of Miss Elliot?

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:19.220
 Yes, you're in Latin. She's a darn good-looking teacher.

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:21.220
 Oh, I goodness. Wait, will I tell her more there?

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:23.220
 No, no, no, let me tell you what Henry just said.

00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:24.220
 What's up, Mary?

00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:26.620
 Listen, I'm getting along all right in Latin.

00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:45.620
 - This is breakfast already. - Yes, Sam. Sit down and I'll make some toast for you.

00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:47.380
 That's the news in the morning paper.

00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:50.420
 Well, dear, first there's several things I'm anxious to talk to you about.

00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:50.920
 Yes?

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:53.620
 Dear, while you were out last evening, a phone call came.

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:56.420
 And, Sam, I don't think I've ever been so upset in my life.

00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:57.620
 Who was the call from?

00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:00.220
 It was from Henry's Latin teacher. Her name is Miss Elliot.

00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:03.620
 Alice, I've always told you Henry would never be any good at languages.

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:07.620
 Now, wait, Sam, because even when I tell you, you're not going to believe me.

00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:09.220
 You mean he's leading the class?

00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:12.620
 Now, remember, dear, I'm only telling you what Miss Elliot told me.

00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:15.120
 When Henry handed in his Latin paper yesterday,

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:20.280
 to be he enclosed with it a note a note yes I'm a note to Miss Elliott well don't

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:24.360
 you understand here Henry thinks he's in love with his Latin teacher what's that

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:28.600
 now wait a minute Sam I knew Henry was upset he hasn't eaten for two days now

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:32.200
 but I suppose it was always some trouble he was having a cat Lee what do you say

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:36.240
 in the nose the usual thing why don't you pay any attention to me what have I

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:39.680
 done that's offended you and things like how much he wants to be with her yeah

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:43.680
 well and here's what we decided Miss Elliott should do she's going to ask

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:46.800
 Henry to come into her classroom this afternoon and have a little talk with it.

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:49.060
 Yeah. Come to think of it, Alice.

00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:52.360
 Didn't Henry take Latin on the row, Miss Dudley, at the beginning of this term?

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:53.940
 Yes, and then he suddenly switched.

00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:55.260
 Yes? To Miss Elliot?

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:59.720
 Yes, Sam. That only goes to show you never know what's going on in a side of boy's head.

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:02.940
 Mother, yes, Henry. Is Brett was ready?

00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:04.800
 Oh, her father. Hello, Henry.

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:07.400
 Boy, do I feel good. You feel good?

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:09.400
 I've just been catching up on my Latin.

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:12.640
 What's that? And Brett and Harley wait to get the class today.

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:15.140
 Henry, tell me, how...

00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:17.940
 How are you in Kathleen getting along these days?

00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:19.340
 Kathleen, Father?

00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:21.440
 See, I'm not interested in Kathleen.

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:22.640
 No.

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:24.440
 I'll answer the phone. I'll answer the phone.

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:25.840
 Will you have some bacon out of it?

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:27.840
 No, thank you, Sam. I can't eat a thing.

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:31.240
 Save some bacon from me, Father. I'm very hungry.

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:32.040
 Hello?

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:33.440
 Hello? Is this Henry?

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:35.440
 Yes. Well, this is Mira.

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:37.940
 I was just talking to someone on the phone about you.

00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:39.940
 About me? Who are you talking to?

00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:41.140
 Home around.

00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:45.140
 And Henry, he's very sorry he broke up your friendship with Kathleen.

00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:47.140
 And once very much to be friends with you.

00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:49.140
 Well boy, am I glad to hear that.

00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:53.140
 And look, Muriel, you're going to the movies with me tonight, aren't you?

00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:55.140
 Oh yes, I'm looking forward to it.

00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:58.140
 Only Henry, do you mind if Homer goes with us?

00:11:58.140 --> 00:12:01.140
 What's that, Henry? Homer felt so bad about everything.

00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:04.140
 I thought the least I could do was to ask him about what's the dinner.

00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:05.140
 For dinner at your house?

00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:08.140
 No, I'm not sure. Glad you didn't send that note to Kathleen.

00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:10.140
 Oh, I'll be seeing you, Henry. Goodbye.

00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:12.140

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:55.420
 Henry, who has been having his difficulties with Kathleen,

00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:57.920
 has lost a note that he intended to send her.

00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:01.420
 Meanwhile, his Latin teacher has received the note

00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:03.420
 along with his Latin paper.

00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:07.820
 The scene opens in a school corridor, just outside his Latin teacher's door.

00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:09.220
 Hello Henry.

00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:09.920
 Hello Agnes.

00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:11.120
 Are you going home Henry?

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:13.820
 I can't right now. I've got to go on and have a talk with Miss Elliot.

00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:15.320
 You have? What's happened?

00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:17.120
 That's what gets me Agnes.

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:19.120
 Remember that paper we handed in yesterday?

00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:19.720
 Yeah.

00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:22.720
 Well, she last night Miss Elliot phoned my house.

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:25.420
 And boy, my mother hasn't eaten since.

00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:28.120
 And today Miss Elliot said, "Right out of a clear blue sky.

00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:30.020
 Will you see me as soon as school is out?"

00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:31.020
 My goodness.

00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:33.920
 And gee, I thought I was doing fine.

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:36.220
 She didn't even call me all during class today.

00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:37.220
 Really?

00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:40.020
 Henry, have you seen Homer the last day or so?

00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:40.520
 No.

00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:42.320
 He's going to the movies with Muriel tonight.

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:43.920
 He is with that Muriel Watson?

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:45.220
 Yes, but I'm not going with him.

00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:46.420
 You can rest assured of that.

00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:48.520
 Well, my goodness, if that isn't--

00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:49.220
 If that isn't--

00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:49.720
 Henry.

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:50.720
 Oh, she was--

00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:52.020
 Yes, Miss Elliott?

00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:54.320
 You hadn't forgotten that I wanted to see you, had you?

00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:55.020
 And no, ma'am.

00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:56.120
 I'll be right there.

00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:56.920
 Goodbye, Henry.

00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:59.120
 I'll wait and walk on part way with you if you want me to.

00:16:59.120 --> 00:16:59.720
 OK.

00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:02.280
 I want to ask your advice about something.

00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:03.840
 No, then Henry.

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:05.160
 Yes, Miss Elliott.

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:07.480
 Would you mind leaving the door open, please?

00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:08.880
 Oh, you want it open?

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:10.120
 I think it might be best.

00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:13.080
 Yes, Miss Elliott.

00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:14.800
 Henry, frankly, I don't know how to begin

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:16.440
 this little conversation.

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:17.920
 Yes, Miss Elliott.

00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:20.440
 I've been criticized in the past for conducting

00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:22.400
 my classes a bit informally.

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:26.240
 But I always thought they should be fond in a way

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:28.000
 between the students and the teacher.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.800
 Well, Gee, I'm glad to hear you say that, Miss Elliott.

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:34.800
 Because that's why I'd rather take Latin from you than with from a step, Dudley.

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:36.900
 But that's just the point.

00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:40.800
 I didn't realize, Henry, that things were going quite so far.

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:42.900
 You mean about being informal?

00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:46.900
 I refer especially to that paper you handed me yesterday.

00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:48.700
 Oh, that, Miss Elliott.

00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:49.800
 Didn't you like it?

00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:53.800
 Well, Henry, after all, Gee, I'm certainly sorry about that.

00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:57.100
 When I started to write it the other night, I couldn't get going.

00:17:57.100 --> 00:17:58.360
 You know what I mean?

00:17:58.360 --> 00:17:59.820
 So I went to bed.

00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:01.700
 And then I started to think about how you'd feel

00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:03.060
 if I didn't finish it.

00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:05.340
 So I got up and got the darn thing off my mind.

00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:06.180
 - Oh.

00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:08.500
 - And you know, the minute I finished it, I felt swell.

00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:10.540
 And I went back to bed and went right to sleep.

00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:13.620
 - But Henry, don't you realize it was all wrong?

00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:15.220
 - All wrong?

00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:16.740
 The whole thing?

00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:19.980
 - Well, maybe it was because I was tired.

00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:21.800
 - Well, I can say as I was never quite

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:23.660
 so mortified and all my life.

00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:24.980
 - Well, I want you to know, Miss.

00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:26.040
 I can do better.

00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:29.980
 Henry, do you realize how old you are?

00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:32.660
 Yes, Michelle, you're...

00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:34.780
 You're still just a very young man.

00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:36.460
 Yes, Michelle, you're...

00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:39.520
 Then under the circumstances, don't you think it would be best if we...

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:42.580
 face the facts and just drop this whole thing?

00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:44.860
 You mean... for good?

00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:45.900
 Yes.

00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:48.740
 I haven't even got a chance if I go on with it?

00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:50.220
 No, Henry.

00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:51.420
 Boy.

00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:54.620
 And, gee, I thought I was just beginning to get somewhere.

00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:56.420
 Henry, you weren't!

00:18:56.420 --> 00:18:57.060
 Not at all.

00:18:57.060 --> 00:18:58.460
 No, not at all.

00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:02.260
 Don't you think we better end the whole thing?

00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:03.700
 Yes, Miss Elliott.

00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:04.220
 There.

00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:06.140
 Now, don't you feel better already?

00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:10.460
 Well, frankly, it has been sort of praying on my mind.

00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:11.500
 Of course it has.

00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:13.500
 And let's not ever even mention it again.

00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:14.380
 OK.

00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:18.300
 As a matter of fact, my father's been against it from the start.

00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:19.580
 Naturally, he has.

00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:20.860
 Goodbye.

00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:21.740
 Goodbye.

00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:24.260
 Do you want me to close the door as I go out?

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:26.020
 Yes, please. I'd like to be alone.

00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:27.500
 Henry!

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:29.620
 - Hi, Agnes. - What a medallion at once.

00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:32.660
 Why, she said I was too young for Latin.

00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:33.420
 You are?

00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:34.260
 Yes.

00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:36.780
 Or else she's too old to teach it to me.

00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:38.460
 I couldn't figure out which.

00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:55.740
 Alice, how long before dinner will be ready?

00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:57.020
 At least an hour, Sam.

00:19:57.020 --> 00:19:57.860
 Yes?

00:19:57.860 --> 00:20:00.420
 Sam, I think you ought to have a hard talk with Henry.

00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:02.180
 A talk with Henry about Miss Elliot?

00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:02.940
 Yes, dear.

00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:05.580
 Now, Alice, if I were you, I'd forget the whole business.

00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:06.940
 But Sam, I can't forget it.

00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:08.500
 I've been worrying about it all day.

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:10.820
 And I say, let's not get mixed up in it.

00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:14.020
 Every boy has to go through what he's going through.

00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:14.900
 Did you?

00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:16.220
 Of course.

00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:18.300
 Only I didn't wait for my Latin teacher.

00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:20.500
 I fell in love with my first grade teacher.

00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:22.260
 Her name was Miss Sutherland.

00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:23.820
 She had light brown hair.

00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:25.660
 I used to follow her home every afternoon.

00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:28.260
 Sam, that was an entirely different situation.

00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:28.900
 What way?

00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:31.620
 In the first place, dear, a phone call came this afternoon.

00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:32.140
 From whom?

00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:33.740
 That Muriel Watson.

00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:35.380
 And Sam, I didn't know she and Henry

00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:36.820
 had had some kind of falling out.

00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:38.260
 A falling out?

00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:39.700
 I didn't even know he was interested in her.

00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:41.100
 Well, that's what surprised me.

00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:43.300
 And Sam, the girl, was all broken up.

00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:45.660
 She kept saying that she hoped Henry would understand.

00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:46.780
 Understand what?

00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:48.140
 I don't know, dear.

00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:50.380
 But I know sooner got to talking with her in the doorbell

00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:51.820
 rang, and who do you suppose that was?

00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:52.260
 Who?

00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:53.660
 Kathleen Anderson.

00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:56.460
 She stood there in the front hall and was practically in tears.

00:20:56.460 --> 00:20:57.320
 Over Henry?

00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:58.220
 Over Henry.

00:20:58.220 --> 00:20:59.700
 Well, that's a fine thing.

00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:02.060
 Our only son falls in love with his Latin teacher

00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:04.540
 and with two of her students at the same time, mind you.

00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:05.380
 What you saying, Father?

00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:06.420
 Why is it that Henry's done?

00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:07.940
 Not a thing, Mary, not a thing.

00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:09.220
 You mean it's that awful?

00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:11.660
 Now, dear, please don't let your imagination go to work.

00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:13.020
 Go see who's at the front door.

00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:13.700
 All right.

00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:15.580
 Holly, would you like to have me tell you something more?

00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:16.380
 No, thank you.

00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:18.500
 We would not.

00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:19.220
 Hello.

00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:20.060
 Hello, Aunt Harry.

00:21:20.060 --> 00:21:23.020
 I was just passing by, and I thought I'd drop in.

00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:25.100
 - Where are your mother and father? - They're in the living room.

00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:26.700
 - Talking about Henry. - Yes.

00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:28.900
 - Well, I just saw him downtown. - You did?

00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:31.700
 With Agnes Lawson into Haven's drugstore.

00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:33.940
 - Alice. - Oh, come on in, Harriet.

00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:36.140
 - How's everything? - Well, fine.

00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:38.980
 Fine. At least as well as can be expected.

00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:41.860
 - Oh, has something gone wrong? - No, Harriet, not at all.

00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:43.820
 Now, Sam, what on earth has happened?

00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:45.100
 Harriet, it isn't anything.

00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:47.620
 We were just talking about a young woman here in town that Henry--

00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:48.900
 Oh, that.

00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:50.740
 Oh, you upset over that.

00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:52.620
 What? You mean you know about it?

00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:55.220
 Why, goodness, everybody in town knows about it.

00:21:55.220 --> 00:21:56.180
 What's that, Harry?

00:21:56.180 --> 00:21:58.900
 Yes. I just saw them down town together.

00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:00.860
 In fact, I loan Henry some money.

00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:02.140
 They're downtown together.

00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:04.780
 They're sitting in the Haven's drugstore holding hands.

00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:07.500
 Henry is sitting in the Haven's drugstore holding hands?

00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:08.340
 Holding hands with--

00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:09.980
 Yes, Sam.

00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:11.700
 You don't think I'd make it up, do you?

00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:13.060
 Alice, maybe you're right.

00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:14.300
 I will have a talk with him.

00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:17.300
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:20.060
 (dramatic music)

00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:26.600
 - Mary, are you in the living room?

00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:27.520
 - Yes, Henry.

00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:29.700
 - Listen, Mary, could you do something for me?

00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:30.520
 - What is it?

00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:31.960
 - Has father seen you?

00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:32.800
 - Father?

00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:33.920
 - He wants to see me.

00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:35.920
 - Yes, Henry, and you might just as well know now

00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:37.520
 he's terribly upset.

00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:38.680
 - He is?

00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:40.600
 - Well, look, could you please help me out?

00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:42.600
 - Henry, have you gotten into some more trouble?

00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:44.280
 - Mary, all I want you to do is deliver

00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:45.720
 a note to Agnes Lawson, see?

00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:47.160
 - Henry, I'm not going out tonight.

00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:50.420
 I mean the first time you go by Agnes's house could you give it to her?

00:22:50.420 --> 00:22:51.720
 Isn't that strange?

00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:52.680
 What's the matter?

00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:53.960
 Oh, I wrote it over to Anne Harry.

00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:56.320
 It's a few minutes ago when I was paying her back.

00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:57.520
 A panger.

00:22:57.520 --> 00:22:59.040
 I wonder why I could have put it.

00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:01.080
 And you mean you're running around with Agnes?

00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:03.800
 Mary, walk for an idea like that in your head.

00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:05.920
 And just because you happen to be walking down the street

00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:07.960
 with a girl and you go into Haven's drug store

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:10.440
 and you think, well gee, I might as well

00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:12.800
 buy the poor kid a Sunday is no reason for her

00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:13.800
 to jump to a conclusion.

00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:16.000
 Think I'm-- and think it.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:17.000
 She wins.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:17.920
 Where can I put that?

00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:18.420
 No.

00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:19.200
 What's that?

00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:20.240
 I remember distinctly.

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:22.240
 I put it in here.

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:23.560
 I paid in here at the money.

00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:25.080
 Paid in here for the money.

00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:27.440
 And when I went into our kitchen and set down at the table

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:28.200
 and started right--

00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:29.200
 Are you home?

00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:29.680
 Are you home?

00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:30.520
 Yes, Father.

00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:31.240
 Say where you are.

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:32.320
 I'll be right down.

00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:33.440
 Oh, boy.

00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:35.240
 What are you supposed to see?

00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:36.240
 Is this been a day?

00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:38.240
 Candy, I certainly feel sorry for you.

00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:40.280
 Don't tell anybody, Mary, but I just

00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:41.680
 got kicked out of water today.

00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:42.680
 Honestly?

00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:43.560
 And Muriel.

00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:44.840
 Do you know what Muriel did to me?

00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:45.440
 What?

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:46.940
 And you know what Kathleen did.

00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:47.780
 - Henry.

00:23:47.780 --> 00:23:49.220
 - Yes, father.

00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:51.500
 - Mary, would you mind leaving the room for a few minutes?

00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:53.580
 - No, father, if you'd rather I wouldn't stay here,

00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:54.580
 why naturally?

00:23:54.580 --> 00:23:56.860
 - Henry.

00:23:56.860 --> 00:23:58.500
 - Yes, father.

00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:01.660
 - Son, I don't know how to begin.

00:24:01.660 --> 00:24:03.180
 - Yes, father.

00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:06.380
 - Naturally, every young man, that is, at least,

00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:08.660
 almost every young man,

00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:10.820
 at least every young man that's--

00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:11.660
 - Yes, father.

00:24:11.660 --> 00:24:13.020
 - Well, what I mean to say is that

00:24:13.020 --> 00:24:14.900
 it isn't always our fault.

00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:16.900
 Actually, sometimes it's...

00:24:16.900 --> 00:24:17.900
 What's that?

00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:20.900
 But in your case, Henry, in your case, I'm afraid I can't...

00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:22.900
 Frankly, I can't see your point of view.

00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:24.900
 My point of view, Father?

00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:25.900
 Yes, that's one way of putting it.

00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:28.900
 Yes, I think I know what you mean.

00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:31.900
 In fact, I've been a little worried about myself myself.

00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:34.900
 Henry, Homer Brown is at the front door.

00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:36.900
 Homer Brown is...

00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:38.900
 Father, please just speak to Homer for one second.

00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:39.900
 Yes, go on.

00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:40.900
 And I'll be right back.

00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:41.900
 No, Father.

00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:42.900
 Henry, did you hear me? Homer's here.

00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:46.900
 I heard you Mary. Where's my baseball bat? Where's my baseball bat?

00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:48.900
 Listen Henry, what's the big idea?

00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:51.900
 What do you mean what's the big idea? And will you please close our front door?

00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:55.900
 I'll close it when I go out. I know all about you're trying to cut me out with Agnes.

00:24:55.900 --> 00:25:00.900
 And Henry, she's my girl. Oh my what are you talking me like that for? I never even thought of Agnes.

00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:03.900
 And how about you and Kathleen? What do you mean by a thing like that?

00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:09.900
 Last night and the night before. Man, she whiz. Listen Henry, don't you realize why I was taking out Kathleen?

00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:13.900
 No, I don't it was to make Agnes jealous. What's that sure?

00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:20.500
 She wish she was beginning to take me for granted. She was sure and then you had a buyer ascend the and spoil a whole thing

00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:22.300
 I know her but

00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:29.800
 You mean Kathleen wasn't wasn't boy. Are you dumb now? Wait a minute. Oh, what about Muriel? Oh, that was just a coincidence

00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:37.380
 What oh who's that Kathleen? I'm out here on the front porch. May I command sure she was I mean

00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:42.980
 Hello, I just happened to be passing by and I saw your front door was open and I was just wondering Henry

00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:47.620
 If you wouldn't like to come over tonight for me. Oh sure. I mean, yes

00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:52.440
 Oh my goodness. What's going on here? Oh hello Aunt Harriet. What's the front door open for?

00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:57.500
 Henry, where's your mother? Why I guess he's out in the kitchen at Harry. I've got to see her right away

00:25:57.500 --> 00:26:02.860
 Now if Henry, what have you got the baseball back for? Oh, why are you putting it away for the wincer?

00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:04.620
 Are you in the kitchen?

00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:06.420
 Yes, Harry. I'm out here with Sam.

00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:08.060
 Oh, so that's that, Alice.

00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:09.580
 And Sam, you're a good talk with him?

00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:11.660
 Yes, Alice. I've got him all straightened out.

00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:14.580
 Alice, what do you think happened? You won't believe it.

00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:17.340
 What is it? I'm going to lose my ice man.

00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:19.140
 What? Yes, Alice.

00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:21.300
 And I don't know whether it's a good thing or not.

00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:22.620
 How do you know you're going to lose him?

00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:25.260
 I just found this note in my icebox.

00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:27.100
 And Alice, I didn't dream.

00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:29.220
 I didn't dream he felt that way.

00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:31.500
 May I see it? Here it is.

00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:35.500
 I think it would be better if we did not go on any longer this way.

00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:37.820
 Harriet, what does he mean this way?

00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:39.780
 Delivering ice to me, I suppose.

00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:41.900
 Go on, read the rest.

00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:47.500
 Now that I have cooled off, I realize that neither one of us could have been really happy.

00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:50.380
 Harriet, just how far are this gone?

00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:52.060
 Well, not so very far, Alice.

00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:54.500
 I'd given him a piece of pie now and then.

00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:58.220
 But I never dreamed he was going to take it seriously.
