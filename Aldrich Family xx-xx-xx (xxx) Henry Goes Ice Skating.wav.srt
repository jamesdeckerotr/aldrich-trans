00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 Henry! Henry Aldrich!

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 Coming, mother!

00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 The Aldrich family. A special rebroadcast for you soldiers, sailors and Marines of the United Nations.

00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 American boys always grow up. They can't stop themselves.

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 But no matter how important or how old they become,

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 they always like to grow down to boyhood again

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 and recapture their youth in the adventures of Henry Olridge.

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 The scene opens in the Olridge kitchen on a Saturday morning.

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 -Bye, Mother. So long. -Henry Olridge, where are you going?

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 No place, Mother. No place. Just skating.

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 Skating, dear. You're leaving without doing what I asked you to do.

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 -Who, I, Mother? -Henry, I told you I wanted you to take a package over to old Mrs. Proctor's before you did one thing today.

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 On the first day of skating, and the whole gang's going to be down on the lake, Mother?

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 I'm sorry, Henry, but you got to take this fruitcake over to Mrs. Proctor.

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,700
 Even when Homer's waiting for me out on the front porch with a skates and everything.

18
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:25,700
 Here's the cake, dear. It's in a tin and keep this side up.

19
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:27,000
 She, weren't you listening, Mother?

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,500
 Yes, dear. Now, please start.

21
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,700
 Well, where are you going, Henry? Skating?

22
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:31,700
 Skating, Father?

23
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:32,700
 Wonderful day for it.

24
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:37,000
 Now, Sam, I've just gotten through explaining to Henry it's going to be exactly as nice later on.

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,700
 Father, you... Oh, you aren't finding a chance going to drive over by Mrs. Plochner's today, are you?

26
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,500
 Oh, I know, sir. I have a very busy day scheduled.

27
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:48,100
 Sam, you haven't forgotten you're going to that reception with me this afternoon, have you?

28
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,860
 You know what reception Alice.

29
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,360
 Sam I don't believe you ever hear one thing I say.

30
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,760
 I've mentioned it at every meal for the last week.

31
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,960
 To me?

32
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,060
 Oh Henry.

33
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,600
 Yes Homer I'm coming.

34
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,240
 Henry you're tipping the fruit cake just as I knew you would.

35
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,400
 Not very much Mother.

36
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,040
 I just wanted to have it at the right angle as I went off the door.

37
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,600
 Alice what reception are you talking about?

38
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,440
 At the women's club at four o'clock.

39
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,480
 At the women's club?

40
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,580
 Yes dear and please go answer the telephone.

41
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:14,280
 At four o'clock I can't possibly make it.

42
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,280
 But Sam.

43
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,080
 Hello?

44
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,920
 Hello Sam this is Will Brown.

45
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,340
 Oh yes, good morning Will.

46
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,180
 Say Sam, is everything all fixed?

47
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,020
 You mean for...

48
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,300
 This afternoon?

49
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,460
 That's right, Sam.

50
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:27,020
 Well I'll tell you Will, I'm in sort of a jam here, I'm afraid.

51
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,120
 Yeah, what's the trouble?

52
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,260
 Could you call me again in just a few minutes and when Alice answers the phone,

53
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,320
 you tell her how important our engagement is.

54
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,120
 Why, Sam?

55
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,100
 Well frankly, I forgot there was a reception at the Women's Club.

56
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,760
 And she's going to make you go?

57
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,740
 Not if you handle it right Will.

58
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,660
 Oh, I see what you mean.

59
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:47,300
 Yeah, I'll tell her it's a case of life and death that we get together for a conference.

60
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,300
 That's right, Will, that'll do it.

61
00:02:49,300 --> 00:03:05,300
 Look Henry, look, the lake's just like glass.

62
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,300
 Oh boy.

63
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:09,800
 Well, be Henry, wait a second, where are you going?

64
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,300
 I told you ten times, Homer, I've got to deliver this fruitcake.

65
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,800
 But she was, I thought you were going out on the lake with me.

66
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,160
 Oh no Homer, I walked a block out of my way so we could see how the ice looked.

67
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,860
 And now I've got a gorbite Mrs. Proctor.

68
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,760
 Henry, we're right here, aren't we?

69
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,060
 Why don't we put on our skates and go down the lake once before the crowd gets here?

70
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:27,420
 And now Homer, don't tempt me.

71
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:29,100
 When I tell my mother, I'll...

72
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,100
 I'll...

73
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:34,300
 Although I'll admit I might step out here just one step to see how smooth it is.

74
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,300
 She or Henry?

75
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,060
 And why don't you put your skates on?

76
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:38,900
 And no Homer, I'm just going to walk out of ways.

77
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,300
 In the first place Mrs. Proctor is waiting for this fruitcake.

78
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:44,100
 Gee, it isn't bad out here, is it?

79
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,500
 No, Henry, and boy, watch me slide.

80
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,600
 Look out Homer, stand back.

81
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,400
 What are you gonna do?

82
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,300
 I'm gonna take just one long running slide

83
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,500
 and then beat it over to Mrs. Prok.

84
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,000
 Wait a second, I'll slide with you.

85
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,500
 Homer, I can't wait. Here I go.

86
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,900
 Wheee!

87
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,900
 Hey, hey Homer!

88
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,900
 Oh boy, Henry, look out!

89
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,900
 Hey Henry!

90
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:04,400
 What?

91
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,160
 (dramatic music)

92
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:17,680
 - Dallas!

93
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,680
 Dallas, where are you?

94
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,960
 - Come on, off the kitchen, Sam.

95
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,240
 - The telephone's ringing.

96
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,600
 - Yeah, you'll have to answer it.

97
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,040
 - I can't, I've got to go downstairs

98
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:24,960
 and look at the furnace.

99
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,320
 - Sam, how do you know it isn't someone

100
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,440
 who wants to speak to you?

101
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,280
 Hello?

102
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,480
 - Hello, is this M303?

103
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,320
 - Yes?

104
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,440
 - Oh, hello there, Alison.

105
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:39,540
 How are you just fine is this wheel brown? Yes. Well, this is a pleasant surprise just a minute

106
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:43,420
 Will and I'll call say I know Alice wait you don't have to call him you don't want to speak with him

107
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:48,620
 I just want you to give him a message all right. I tell him something pretty important has come up and no matter

108
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:53,420
 What he plans to do I've got to see him this afternoon really and what time well

109
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:58,900
 For oh, but we hope he hasn't planned to do anything at four. There are some figures

110
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:02,940
 I have to go over with him and and well, it's that important by naturally

111
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:06,520
 that was my any chance. Well, problem. Yes, Sammy. Still on here. Don't you want to

112
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:10,320
 speak to him? Oh, what? Oh, what's your calling for? He says you can't go to that

113
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,780
 reception. No, he did take the phone. I've got to go back to the kitchen. Hello,

114
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:20,260
 Will. Hello, Sam. I fixed it for you. You don't say well, Will, that's too bad.

115
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:25,940
 Now listen, Sam. It's your turn to phone me. What do you mean? Call me back and do

116
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:30,100
 the same thing with my wife. It's that reception, Sam. She hooked me.

117
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:34,100
 All right, Will. You can depend on me. I'll give that by immediate attention.

118
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:34,780
 Goodbye.

119
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:38,020
 Goodbye, Will. And thanks for calling. Alice.

120
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:39,180
 Yes, Sam.

121
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:43,220
 Alice, I'm certainly sorry about Will insisting I be with him this afternoon.

122
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:45,700
 Just what kind of figure is it that you have to go over?

123
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:50,180
 Why, they're rather intricate figures, Alice. In fact, they're...

124
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,380
 Well, I've got to be going to the office.

125
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:54,220
 Dear, you won't forget to stop off and leave those things at the tailor's, will you?

126
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,220
 I won't. I've already got them out in the car.

127
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:59,220
 Eh, is somebody in our back door there?

128
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,220
 Hello Mrs. Aldrich.

129
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:02,220
 Why, hello there, Homer.

130
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,220
 I thought you were with Henry.

131
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,220
 Who me?

132
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:07,220
 Well, tell ya, I was with him and...

133
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:09,220
 and then he asked me...

134
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:11,220
 I decided to come over here for something.

135
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:13,220
 Dear Henry, hasn't gone skating, has he?

136
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:14,220
 Skating?

137
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:15,220
 No.

138
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:17,220
 No, Henry didn't even put his skates on.

139
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:21,220
 Could I just step up to Henry's room for a second...

140
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:25,220
 and sort of look around for something that I'd like to see whether I can find.

141
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:26,720
 You want to go up to his room?

142
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,220
 It's okay, boy. I want to call somebody at the back door here.

143
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:31,220
 Oh, Charlie!

144
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:33,220
 What did she say, Homer? Did you talk her into it?

145
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:38,220
 Charlie! Say hello to Mrs. Aldrich. She's right here behind the door.

146
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:40,220
 Oh, hello Mrs. Aldrich.

147
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:42,220
 Good morning, Charlie. What did you want?

148
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:45,220
 Why, well, I just... Well, you see, here's what happened.

149
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:49,220
 I'm not mine, Charlie. Mrs. Aldrich is very busy baking, and we don't want to bother her.

150
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:51,220
 Okay. Now don't make a mess up there boys.

151
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:52,220
 Oh no.

152
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:54,720
 Alice, exactly what is it I'm supposed to tell the tailor.

153
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,720
 The same, everything in mind is to be dry clean.

154
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,220
 Yes.

155
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:00,220
 And Henry's soup and his two pairs of trousers are to be sponged and pressed.

156
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,220
 Fine.

157
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:05,720
 And tell him Henry would like at least his soup back by Monday because he hasn't a thing up in his closet except what he's wearing.

158
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,220
 Very well.

159
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:07,220
 Are you leaving now?

160
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:11,220
 No, not just yet. I've got to put in one more phone call.

161
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:12,220
 Mrs. Allbridge.

162
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:13,220
 Yes, Homer.

163
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:15,220
 Mrs. Allbridge, does Henry...

164
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:18,220
 Does Henry still have the same room he's always had?

165
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:20,220
 Why, yes, Homer, of course.

166
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:21,220
 Is that right?

167
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,220
 Why do you have?

168
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,220
 No reason.

169
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,220
 The closet.

170
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:26,220
 The whole thing seemed a little empty.

171
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:28,220
 Well, what is it you're looking for, dear?

172
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:30,220
 Nothing, Mrs. Aldrich.

173
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,220
 Oh, Charlie.

174
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:33,220
 Homer, was Henry gonna meet you here?

175
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,220
 Well, no, not exactly.

176
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,220
 We were gonna come here and...

177
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:37,220
 and then...

178
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:39,220
 he'll probably be at the lake when I get back.

179
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:41,220
 Hey, Homer, what's keeping you?

180
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,220
 Listen, Charlie, did you find anything?

181
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,220
 I found a sweater.

182
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,220
 What could a sweater do?

183
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:46,220
 What Henry needs is a pair of trousers.

184
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:47,220
 Well, where are his trousers?

185
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:52,020
 That's what I don't understand and listen Charlie you gotta let me take your pants over to him

186
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:57,660
 Oh no Homer, but Charlie don't you realize Henry's over at the lake and only spent to keep him warm as a fire?

187
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:01,340
 Come on now. Let me have no no Homer. Oh no. I'll take your pants

188
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:07,620
 But Charlie don't you realize your pants are brown. They're the same color as Henry's all he's gotta do is put them on and nobody

189
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,620
 11. No, we fell in well

190
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:14,220
 But why don't you go over to your house and get in your brown pants because my mother's looking for me

191
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,420
 And if I go anywhere near my house, I'm sunk.

192
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:17,820
 Well, you can't have mine.

193
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,720
 What, Charlie? You look tired.

194
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,020
 You can get into Henry's bed and read a good book.

195
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,020
 Oh, no.

196
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:24,420

 Why do you know you were down here at the light, Henry?

 Come on out here and skate with me.

 Wait, I tell you Agnes, I can't write this minute.

 Why not? What are you doing behind that bush?

206
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,880
 Why nothing? Have you seen Homer?

207
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,400
 No, is he down here tonight?

208
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,920
 Well, he was. Then he left to go on sort of an errand.

 Listen, Agnes, just stay away from here. Just stay away.

00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,360
 Why? Because, well, this is my fight.

 Oh, listen, do you see that house down at the end of the lake?

00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,140
 Yeah.

222
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,560
 Well, could you run down there and ask to borrow a blanket?

223
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,880
 Why can't you go?

 An Agnes, while you're down there, ask if you could get anything I could fish with.

00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:32,440
 Yes? Did you fix everything?

308
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,640
 Well, that's why I'm calling you. Your wife, Walt.

309
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,440
 She bought?

 She says it's Saturday afternoon, and you need to get away from your work, and she's taking you to that reception.

 But, Sam, I've been calling on--

312
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,340
 I know how you feel, Will. I don't blame you a bit.

313
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:46,740
 Sam, you couldn't arrange to serve me a summons, could you?

314
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,240
 A summons?

315
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,740
 No, the courthouse is closed.

316
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,240
 But I could send you a wire.

00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,240
 Say, that's an idea, and make it strong.

318
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,340
 I know what I can say.

319
00:12:56,340 --> 00:13:00,580
 Good. And Sam, when you send it, don't send it here to my office. Send it to my home.

320
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,740
 Then Elizabeth will be sure to open it.

00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:14,540
 Oh.

 Who is this speaking?

329
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:17,540
 Why? This is Homer.

330
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:18,540
 Oh?

331
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:22,540
 Homer, don't turn them to Homer. I had breakfast at your house this morning.

332
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:24,940
 Oh yes. Homer.

333
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:30,940
 Mr. Aldrich, Mrs. Aldrich happened to mention that you took some clothes to the tailor when you left the house a little while ago.

334
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:31,940
 Yes, what about them?

335
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:33,940
 Well, why not pay there?

336
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:34,940
 What's that?

337
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:36,940
 I've just been over to the tailor, isn't he? Doesn't he know anything about?

338
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:42,940
 Of course he doesn't. If Mrs. Aldrich is worried about them, tell her they're in my car and I'm going to take them in a few minutes.

339
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:44,940
 Oh, well do you know where your car is?

340
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:45,940
 You mean it's been stolen?

341
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:48,940
 It has. With Charlie. With Charlie's?

342
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:52,940
 Homer, I can see my car from my window here. It's parked right there on Main Street.

343
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:54,280
 It is on Main Street.

00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,440
 Yes, of course. Right in front of the barbershop.

345
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,480
 Oh, then I guess it is in stone.

346
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,480
 Goodbye.

347
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:13,160
 Oh, Gee whiz.

348
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:17,100
 Now, wait a second, Terry Young fella.

349
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,900
 Oh, boy. Are you speaking to me?

350
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:19,640
 Is this your car?

351
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:22,100
 Oh, yes, sir. No, sir. I'm just looking through it.

352
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,860
 That's what I thought. What's your name?

353
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:24,600
 My name?

354
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,140
 You think I haven't been watching you? You even tried to get into the trunk?

355
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:28,640
 Yes, sir. I'm looking for something.

356
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,140
 Yeah?

357
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:31,700
 Look, a friend of mine dropped a fruitcake, see?

358
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:34,680
 I mean, first I borrowed another guy's pants, see?

359
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:35,740
 And this is his car?

360
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:38,140
 Yes, sir. No, sir. It's Mr. Olwich's car.

361
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:38,840
 Good for Olwich's?

362
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,880
 Yes, sir. It was his wife who baked the fruitcake.

363
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,980
 Oh, so it's a fruitcake you're looking for?

364
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:43,600
 Yes, sir.

365
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,480
 No, sir.

366
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,620
 He's taking it to the cleaners, see?

367
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:48,620
 Now, wait a minute. What's your name?

368
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:50,920
 Don't you understand? Charlie's pants.

369
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,920
 They're holding everything up.

370
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,280
 Now getting back to the troubles of Henry Olridge.

371
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:24,980
 Henry, while supposedly delivering a fruitcake for his mother,

372
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:27,180
 has fallen through the ice on the lake.

373
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:31,180
 Now, while he's waiting for someone to bring him a pair of dry trousers,

374
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,980
 the scene opens with Homer returning to Charlie,

375
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:35,780
 whose trousers he had borrowed.

376
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:37,980
 Charlie?

377
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,380
 Hey, Charlie, wake up.

378
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:41,480
 Now listen, Homer, where are my pants?

379
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,980
 That's so loud, Charlie. Do you want Mrs. Olridge to hear you?

380
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,280
 Mrs. Olridge isn't here.

381
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,280
 I heard her go out.

382
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,080
 Who is here?

383
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,080
 Nobody's here.

384
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,700
 I've been alone here all day.

385
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:52,020
 What do you mean all day? It's hardly three o'clock.

386
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:53,340
 Well, I haven't had any lunch.

387
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:54,780
 And I want my pants.

388
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:57,540
 Oh, that's what I came over to tell you about, Charlie.

389
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,540
 Where are they?

390
00:15:58,540 --> 00:15:59,940
 They're being cleaned.

391
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,220
 They think.

392
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:01,860
 They're what?

393
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:04,780
 Well, the cleaning promised me definitely it had been back on Monday.

394
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:07,460
 I've got to stay here until then without anything to eat.

395
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:08,180
 Oh no!

396
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:09,620
 Charlie, take your hands off me.

397
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:11,180
 No, I won't. I'm going to get out of here.

398
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:11,620
 How?

399
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:12,860
 I'm going to take your pants.

400
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:13,580
 Now watch out!

401
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:14,660
 Quick, Charlie.

402
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,060
 Hey, Charlie, get off me.

403
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:18,060
 No I won't! Don't let go of my ears!

404
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,060
 Let go of my pants!

405
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:20,060
 Well hold your foot up!

406
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:21,060
 You make me!

407
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:23,060
 Now listen Charlie, stop dragging me across the floor!

408
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:24,060
 Let go!

409
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,060
 Let go of yourself!

410
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:27,060
 Oh boy!

411
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:28,060
 Oh boy!

412
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:31,060
 Now look what you've done! You tore my pants right in two!

413
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:33,060
 Why didn't you let go of them?

414
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:36,060
 Well this is a swell thing to do, a guy! Look at me!

415
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:37,060
 Can't we solve them back together?

416
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:40,060
 Sure, sure! How are we gonna sew them together?

417
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:42,060
 I've got one leg on and you've got the other in your hands!

418
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:57,860
 Sam, I certainly want to thank you for fixing everything up with Elizabeth.

419
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:59,060
 No trouble at all, Will.

420
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:01,060
 Well, she got that telegraph.

421
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:02,660
 Now, wait a minute, Sam.

422
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:03,460
 I've struggled.

423
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:04,460
 Let's go this way instead.

424
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:05,460
 Let's hurry too.

425
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:06,460
 Only you see, Will.

426
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:07,660
 I think that was your wipe up the street.

427
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:08,660
 Alice?

428
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,660
 You must be on the way to that reception.

429
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,660
 Nothing to worry about, Sam, she didn't see us.

430
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:13,660
 Hello there, Mr. O.

431
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:14,660
 What's that?

432
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:15,660
 It's Agnes Lawton.

433
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:16,660
 Hello.

434
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:17,660
 Oh yes, hello there.

435
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:18,660
 Where are you going?

436
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:19,660
 It's not your ride.

437
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:20,660
 I'm going home to get something for...

438
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:21,660
 for...

439
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:22,660
 boy, am I in a hurry?

440
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:31,660
 [Music]

441
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:32,660
 Boy.

442
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,660
 Boy of all...

443
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,660
 Listen Homer, get off that bed.

444
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:38,660
 It's my turn to lie down for a while.

445
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:40,580
 What's wrong with that chair you're sitting on?

446
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,380
 It's hard, but I'm tired.

447
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,980
 Well, I'll tell you one thing.

448
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:46,700
 The next time I do something to try to help you out, Charlie,

449
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:49,300
 don't think you know more than anybody else that ever lived.

450
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,780
 Hey, is anybody in there?

451
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:52,100
 She whiz, who's that?

452
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:54,100
 So much, fellas, is it all right to come in?

453
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,220
 Oh, hello, Elwood.

454
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:56,180
 Where'd you come from?

455
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:58,020
 Listen, Henry wants to know where you are.

456
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:59,220
 Does Henry want to see me?

457
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,740
 Sure, Homer.

458
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:01,940
 What's your line now, Cory?

459
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:02,620
 You're sick?

460
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:04,260
 I'm getting up.

461
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:05,460
 Say.

462
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,500
 Come here a minute, Elwood.

463
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,540
 Come here a minute.

464
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:10,640
 What for? I just want to see something.

465
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,840
 Listen Homer, you've got to need pants on.

466
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,240
 Well they're better than nothing.

467
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,540
 What do you mean by that home?

468
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:18,540
 And nothing else with nothing. Just come here to Homer.

469
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:19,640
 What for?

470
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,540
 Elwood, I'm not gonna hit you.

471
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:23,540
 Come here. Come here.

472
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:37,840
 Henry!

473
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,540
 I'll be there in just a second, Agnes.

474
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:40,940
 Do they fit you, Henry?

475
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:42,540
 Well, they cover me.

476
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:44,140
 But don't come near this bush again.

477
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:45,340
 I'm not coming near it.

478
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:46,340
 They fit me.

479
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:48,540
 But just how big is your father?

480
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:50,940
 Well, he has to be centered on the air football team.

481
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:51,640
 He did?

482
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,640
 Yes, but he's put on a little waist since then.

483
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,340
 There.

484
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:55,840
 Now I guess I have them on all right.

485
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:56,840
 My goodness!

486
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:57,540
 What's the matter?

487
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:58,740
 You're just a sight!

488
00:18:58,740 --> 00:18:59,240
 Boy!

489
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,240
 Hey, Henry!

490
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,140
 She was-- who's that?

491
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:01,840
 Here they are, Henry.

492
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:02,540
 Here they are.

493
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:03,940
 Listen, Homer, where have you been?

494
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:06,440
 I've been trying to get to these pants, and boy.

495
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,440
 Here, put them on.

496
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,140
 Homer, I've got a pair of pants on.

497
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:11,240
 You have? Are those pants?

498
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,240
 Sure, they're Agnes's fathers.

499
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,240
 Agnes's who?

500
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,040
 My father.

501
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,240
 Oh, well, Henry, don't you want Elwood's?

502
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,040
 Elwood? How'd you get Elwood?

503
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,340
 I just borrowed them.

504
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:22,540
 And then went over to Charlie's and got a pair for myself.

505
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:23,340
 And here are yours.

506
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:26,040
 Homer, I certainly hope you don't think I want to wear neat pants, do you?

507
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,340
 Well, why shouldn't you?

508
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:30,040
 I would, I'm right out in public, all the way over to Charlie's house.

509
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,640
 Henry, isn't that your father over there?

510
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,940
 Where, Agnes? Where's my father?

511
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,840
 Right out there on the lake. Look at him, scaring.

512
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,600
 Oh boy, stand in front of me.

513
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,280
 She was, is that my father, with him?

514
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,080
 Yes, sure.

515
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,200
 They certainly are doing some fancy figure skating.

516
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,760
 Homer, won't you please stand in front of me?

517
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,260
 No!

518
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:45,320
 Agnes, what's the matter?

519
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,000
 No, Mr. Overt, you just fell in.

520
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:47,800
 He did?

521
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,840
 My father fell in.

522
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,400
 Oh boy, him, you old boy.

523
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,000
 Look out.

524
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,080
 Homer, where you going?

525
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,480
 Where do you think to your father I'm

526
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,040
 going to take a Melwood's pants?

527
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,520
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

528
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,280
 (dramatic music)

529
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:12,060
 - Can you see through the window, Will?

530
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:13,520
 - Yes, I'm looking.

531
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,160
 - It's all right to go in, is the coast clear?

532
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,440
 - Come on, Sam, your wife isn't in the front of the house

533
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,000
 anyway.

534
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,600
 - Are you sure?

535
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,880
 - Alice, Alice Aldrich!

536
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,640
 - Will, don't do that!

537
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:31,640
 It's alright. If you don't look so bad in those pants, Sam, they just look like a skating costume.

538
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:36,640
 Just the same, well, I don't want her to see me. Look, I'm going upstairs to take a hot bath.

539
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,640
 Okay, and as a matter of fact, I think I'll be pulling out.

540
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,640
 Sam!

541
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,640
 Will, is that Alice?

542
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,640
 Goodbye, Sam!

543
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,640
 Yes, Alice?

544
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,640
 Was that you that just came in the front door?

545
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:48,640
 Well, yes. Yes, that was I.

546
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,640
 Well, come on out here to the kitchen a minute.

547
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,640
 Well, I can't right now, Alice.

548
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,640
 Sam, I want you to come out here and help me with something.

549
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,140
 I'm coming with something.

550
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:58,340
 Very well. I'm coming.

551
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,140
 Did you see Harry?

552
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:02,640
 Yes, Alice. I'm right here on the other side of the door.

553
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,640
 Why don't you come all the way in?

554
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,640
 Well, I would, Alice. Only I was afraid I'd bother you.

555
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,640
 Sam, I'm peeling these onions and I can't see a thing.

556
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:13,140
 Step over to the range. Will you please and see whether I turn that back burner off?

557
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,140
 Now, Alice?

558
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:17,640
 Yes, dear, of course now. Did you get all your figuring done?

559
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:20,640
 Why, we went over a few figures.

560
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,140
 And then something else came up. But that is, yes, you might say we got them done.

561
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:26,740
 Goodness, but these onions make my eyes water.

562
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:29,940
 You mean you can't see anything Alice? Not anything at all?

563
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:31,340
 No dear, where are you?

564
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:33,540
 I'm sort of around here behind you.

565
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:36,940
 Well, I suppose I'll have to keep on peeling these or I'll never get them done.

566
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:39,140
 And incidentally Henry is upstairs.

567
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:40,140
 He's upstairs?

568
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:42,740
 Yes, he came in just a few minutes ago and he's taking a hot bath.

569
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:43,940
 Well, that's fine.

570
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:46,340
 And after dinner Sam, I want you to have a talk with him.

571
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:46,940
 Yeah?

572
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:49,140
 He started off this morning to deliver a fruitcake

573
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:51,940
 and he distinctly disobeyed me and went skating and fell in the lake.

574
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:53,940
 Er... yeah?

575
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:55,940
 Sam, you don't seem a bit concerned.

576
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:57,940
 Oh, I am too concerned, Alice.

577
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:59,940
 I was just going to say "falling" in the lake.

578
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:01,940
 I also wish you'd have a talk with Henry about Homer.

579
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:02,940
 About Homer?

580
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:03,940
 Yes, Sam.

581
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:07,940
 Elwood Hazard's mother phoned a little while ago and said that Homer had knocked Elwood down today.

582
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:10,940
 Stolen his trousers from him and locked him up in some room someplace.

583
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:12,940
 What did he do that for?

584
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:13,940
 I don't know.

585
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:17,940
 And now Mrs. Hazard is going out all around town trying to find the poor boy's pants.

586
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,940
 Elwood Hazard?

587
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:22,540
 Sam and he's only a little fellow in knee pants.

588
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:23,540
 Hmm.

589
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:26,540
 Well, that's how I think I'll be going upstairs and get dressed.

590
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:28,040
 Don't be like Virginia Sam.

591
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,340
 You will stick to Henry, won't you?

592
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:30,340
 Yes, Alice.

593
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:33,540
 And if this is hazard bones again about Elwood's pants, tell her not to worry.

594
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:35,340
 I'll try to get to the bottom of them.

595
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:51,340
 [Music]

596
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:53,840
 Henry, did you take part of this morning's paper?

597
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:58,340
 - Why, Mother? - Yes, dear. There was a picture in it of some man who fell into the lake yesterday.

598
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:00,840
 And it was the funniest thing it looked exactly like your father.

599
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:03,840
 - It's our ride! - Yes, dear, and I wanted to show it to him.

600
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,040
 You know where it is?

601
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:12,040
 Well, to tell the truth, Mother, Father and I were lighting a fire in the living room a little while ago and I guess we must have burned it!

602
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:31,040
