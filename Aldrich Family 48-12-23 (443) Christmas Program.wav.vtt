00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
 [Music]

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.800
 And now the Jell-O family presents...

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.240
 Henry! Henry Oldridge!

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.500
 Coming, Mother!

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.900
 [Applause]

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.000
 Yes, it's the Oldridge family, based on characters originated by Clifford Goldsmith,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.800
 and starring Ezra Stone as Henry with Jackie Kelk as Homer.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.260
 And yes, it's the Jello family with its three famous desserts.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.520
 Jello and those six delicious flavors,

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.760
 Jello Puddings with that old-fashioned homemade flavor,

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.720
 and Jello Tathioca Puddings,

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.780
 a miracle of goodness, a marvel of speed.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:51.620
 [

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:57.540
 They are made by famous J-E-L-L-O.

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.540
 And now for the Aldrich family.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:19.540
 To a typical teenage boy like Henry Aldrich, every holiday is naturally a red letter day.

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.540
 And whatever the celebration, Henry is always certain to be right in the center of it.

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.540
 Adding a little color of his all.

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:30.040
 The scene opens at the Aldrich breakfast table. It's the week before Christmas.

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.740
 Sam, I'm just as pleased as I can be.

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:33.540
 Yes, what about?

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.540
 Henry, he's been so helpful this past week.

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.540
 And dear, do you know what I think?

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:39.040
 What?

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.040
 He's really growing up.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.040
 You know what I think?

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.040
 What?

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.540
 Christmas is just around the corner.

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.040
 Sam Aldrich, you're just being cynical.

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.040
 No, Alice, I'm just experienced.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.540
 Anytime now he'll start in dropping hints.

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:52.540
 What hints?

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.540
 Is that what he'd like us to give in for Christmas?

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.500
 Sam, if he does, it's just because he's trying to be helpful.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.780
 Father, are you in the dining room?

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:00.780
 Yes, Hadra.

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.700
 Hi, you father old-timer.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.060
 There we go.

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.300
 I thought you might like your pipe here.

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.900
 Thank you, Ed.

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.180
 Can I fill it for you?

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.860
 No, thank you.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.780
 Or strike a match and light it?

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:12.460
 No, thanks.

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.780
 She was, isn't there anything I can do?

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.300
 Would you care to smoke it for me?

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.020
 Sam!

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.540
 Henry, is there something special on your mind?

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:23.940
 Something you want to say?

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.260
 Why, no sir, I'm just passing the time of day.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.260
 I see.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:35.380
 Only, now that I think of it, did I mention that swell football game I saw?

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.140
 Wendy, Thanksgiving day.

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.100
 Boy, it was some game.

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.100
 It was?

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.460
 Yeah, too bad I didn't enjoy it.

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:43.460
 Still didn't?

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:44.460
 Why not?

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.020
 I don't know.

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.820
 You take a football game and you sit way back in the stands, see?

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.700
 And if you're not equipped, where are you?

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.700
 You're right. It sure makes you angry.

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:57.700
 (audience laughs)

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:58.700
 Hey, Henry!

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.700
 Oh, gee, I'll be right with you, Homer. Excuse me.

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.700
 Hi, Henry. Wouldn't you like to be a little more explicit?

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:10.700
 Sure, Father. The game I missed the best part of was the one we came closest to winning all season.

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:11.700
 Hi, Homer.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.700
 Listen, Henry, when are you going to casually show that advertisement to my father?

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:17.700
 What? I'll tell you.

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.700
 Oh, gee, you wish. Don't you want him to make me happy for Christmas?

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:21.700
 Christmas?

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.860
 Oh, my intent is show it to him.

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.420
 Just as soon as I find it.

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:26.420
 You lost it?

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:27.580
 Not permanently.

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.340
 I was eating some cookies the other night, see?

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.580
 And the next thing I knew, your ad had disappeared.

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:34.580
 Temporarily.

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.380
 You mean you ate it?

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:37.380
 Aiden?

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.380
 Now that I think about that last cookie was kind of chewy.

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:45.660
 And you'll never get that piccolo if you go around eating up my head.

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.900
 Besides, Homer, if you ask me, you ought to be more subtle about that piccolo.

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.900
 Who's not subtle? I'm not subtle.

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.460
 Look, for Christmas, I want those binoculars down into Havens, right?

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:57.460
 Right.

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:03.060
 So I just subtly drop a few hints and mention that I wasn't able to see the Thanksgiving

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.060
 football game from way back where I sat.

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.580
 And right away, they know what's binoculars I want.

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:10.940
 They do, sure.

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:15.340
 Only, they just try to worry me by pretending they don't understand.

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.540
 She, Henry, are right. You have to be subtle.

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:19.860
 You know what I'm going to do?

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:24.260
 Just a few days before Christmas, I'm gonna give my father a box of good cigars.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:25.060
 Cigars?

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.260
 Sure, and right inside I'll put a copy of that piccolo ad.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:29.860
 How's that for being subtle?

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:30.860
 Henry!

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:31.860
 Yes, Mary?

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.460
 Maybe one of you could help me.

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:34.660
 With what, Mary?

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:35.860
 Well, look, Homer.

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:37.860
 Suppose you were a man, see?

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.860
 Mary, are you insulting me?

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:41.860
 Of course not, Homer.

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.860
 I just said "suppose you were."

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:44.860
 Oh.

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:49.660
 So if you were this certain party, would you prefer a pen and pencil set or a three-speed

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:53.660
 You're buying me a blanket that travels at three speeds.

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:57.660
 I should have known better than to ask you a simple question, mother!

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:00.660
 Wait a minute, Mary. Ask me again.

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:02.660
 Mother, are you in the kitchen?

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:04.660
 Mary, dear, I'll be right back. Sam!

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:07.660
 Mother, I just want to ask you what I should buy, Kermit for Christmas.

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:11.660
 Sam, look what I just found in the cookie jar, an advertisement.

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:13.660
 Someone's advertising in our cookie jar.

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:17.660
 Here, don't you get it. Henry put it there for us to find.

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:19.660
 Oh, let me see him.

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:21.660
 Are you never the life of the party?

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:25.660
 Buy one of our piccolo's and start playing second fiddle.

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:27.660
 675 delivered.

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:28.660
 Alice a piccolo?

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:30.660
 San, that's what he wants for Christmas.

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:32.660
 In grade with bluebirds, one dollar extra.

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:34.660
 That would be lovely.

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:38.660
 But Alice, where does a football game enter into a piccolo?

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:40.660
 Here it's obvious.

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:43.660
 Of course Henry wants to play in the school band.

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:44.660
 What?

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:47.940
 so he can sit right on the sidelines and get a perfect view.

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:50.940
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:59.900
 Oh, Mr. Dehaven.

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:00.980
 I'll be right with you, boy.

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:02.780
 Look, Homer, there are my binoculars.

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:03.280
 Where?

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.780
 Right there in the store window next to that sign that

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:08.060
 says, make mother happy for Christmas

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:10.620
 with a personalized darning egg.

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:12.260
 Now, what can I do for you, boy?

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.260
 Mr. Dehaven, I like a box of your best cigars.

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.560
 Yes, sir. We have an excellent brand here that comes all wrapped for Christmas.

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:19.960
 Oh, that's swell. I'll take it.

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:22.060
 Good. That'll be $11.50.

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:23.060
 How much?

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:24.460
 $11.50.

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:27.660
 That 11 you're speaking of. Is that dollars?

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:29.160
 Here it is.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.760
 Cheers, all I have is a dollar and a quarter.

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:35.360
 Mr. Dehaven, could I please try these binoculars in the window?

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:36.860
 Very well, Henry, but be careful.

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:37.660
 Gee, thanks.

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:41.360
 Mr. Dehaven, don't you have cigars without quite so much tobacco

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:44.160
 that come for about a dollar and a quarter.

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:45.700
 - No, I'm afraid not.

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:47.480
 Why don't I get your father something else?

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:48.700
 - Not cigars.

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:51.440
 - We have some nice simulated plastic picture frames.

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:52.680
 - Picture frames?

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:54.040
 - Yes, you could slip your picture

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:56.520
 and one of them and give that to your father.

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:57.960
 - My picture.

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:00.480
 And watch my piccolo go right out the window.

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:01.480
 (audience laughing)

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:03.600
 - Apparently I'm afraid there's nothing I can do Homer.

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:05.280
 Now be careful with those binoculars, Henry.

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:07.400
 - Yes, Mr. Dave, and all I'm doing

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:08.520
 is looking through them.

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:11.920
 Boy, imagine 11.50 for cigars.

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:13.820
 People sure do burn up money.

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:17.320
 Boy, Homer, boy, are these binoculars in these.

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:19.120
 Let me look to them, Henry, let me look.

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:21.820
 Okay, but take it easy, Homer.

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:24.820
 Hey, you see, Agnes lost him down by the soda fountain?

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:25.620
 Yeah.

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:27.520
 You know how much her check is?

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:29.120
 Only five cents.

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:32.320
 Gee, are those binoculars as powerful as that?

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:33.520
 Excuse me, Homer.

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:34.420
 Who are you, phone?

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:37.320
 My father to drop another hen.

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:38.120
 Number three.

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:39.480
 Al 992.

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:40.480
 Yeah, 992.

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:41.880
 I think I'll join Ag.

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:42.560
 What for?

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:44.480
 I wrote her a treat for a long while.

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:47.440
 And boy, this looks like a good time to pick up her check.

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:48.120
 Hello?

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:49.520
 Hello, Father.

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:51.040
 Henry, I've got to meet your mother.

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:51.800
 What is it?

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:54.280
 Why, nothing in particular.

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:58.440
 I just happen to be down here in de Haven's drug store.

00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:01.000
 And I saw--

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.960
 I saw--

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:04.400
 Saw what?

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:06.120
 Nothing, Father.

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:11.280
 But don't you think it's pretty interesting to be able to see a check from as far off as 20 feet?

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:11.920
 See a what?

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:13.380
 A check, a check!

00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:14.520
 Henry, what are you driving at?

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:16.320
 Driving at Father, I?

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:20.320
 Well, Gee, I just called to pass the time of day!

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:21.420
 Yes, but...

00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:24.920
 Well, now that I've passed it, so long, Father!

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:28.120
 Henry, where's Homer?

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:30.520
 Over there with Agnes and Mr. de Haven.

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:35.720
 If things go right, my parents ought to be in for these binoculars sometime today.

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:38.720
 Good. Did I mention there's no extra charge for the leather case?

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:40.220
 They come in a case?

00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:42.220
 Oh yes, with a strap that goes around your neck.

00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:44.620
 Boy, that's a fine thing.

00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:49.020
 Say Homer, I found a sample box of 15 cigars that I can let you have for a dollar and a quarter.

00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:51.620
 But Mr. Dehaven, I have narrows a dollar.

00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:52.120
 What?

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:54.320
 Agnes' check was 25 cents.

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:56.320
 I thought it was only five.

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:57.320
 So did I.

00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:00.420
 Only she was deliberately holding her thumb over the two.

00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:11.420
 [Music]

00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:12.420
 [Music]

00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:13.420
 May I help you, sir?

00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:15.420
 Yes, do you sell a checkers at this counter?

00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:16.420
 Oh, we do indeed.

00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:19.420
 Would you like to see them in wood, plastic, or reinforced cardboard?

00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:23.420
 Well, or if you want to go whole hog, we have a dandy set and hand-carved ivory.

00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:29.420
 Well, it really doesn't matter what the checkers are made of, just so that they're big enough to be seen from 20 feet off.

00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:33.620
 Twenty-three? Yes. Oh, wouldn't it be rather inconvenient to play from that distance?

00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:38.420
 Oh, it sounded ridiculous to me too, but as near as I can figure out, that's what my son wants for Christmas.

00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:42.820
 Well, if you'll, uh, just wait a minute, I'll see if we have any large checkers and stuff.

00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:44.820
 Thank you! Mother! Oh!

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:47.020
 Father, what are you doing down here at the Apario?

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:50.620
 I was supposed to meet your mother at the information counter ten minutes ago.

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:53.020
 Oh. Well, she still has time.

00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:57.820
 By the way, Father, does a letter case with a strap that goes around your neck mean anything to you?

00:09:57.820 --> 00:09:58.620
 No, I...

00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:03.420
 I ran into Henry and he said if I saw you to casually mention that what he wants for Christmas comes in one.

00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:04.520
 You don't say.

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:06.520
 And Father, I have a problem.

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:07.420
 Yes.

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:11.120
 Well, if you knew a certain party that was...

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:13.120
 well, close to you.

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:15.220
 Uh... close to you?

00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:16.220
 Yes.

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:21.620
 And suppose you wanted to get him something very special for Christmas to show him how you feel about him.

00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:22.620
 What would you get?

00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:26.620
 Well, I really don't feel I should say.

00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:28.320
 Father, you must tell me.

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:31.920
 Well, naturally, Mary, I'm sure whatever you get him, he'll be crazy about.

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:34.760
 But if I were that man, you know what I'd really like.

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:35.360
 What?

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:38.000
 Well, a new hunting rifle?

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:38.860
 My goodness.

00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:40.200
 You're right, Mary. It's too expensive.

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:41.760
 Oh, I'm not worried about the money.

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:42.200
 No.

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:44.640
 No, it's coming out of my special campaign fund.

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:47.200
 Well, Mary, I hardly know what...

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:49.800
 Well, that is. I'm certainly... Mary.

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:55.040
 Father, my goodness, you kissed me right in the middle of the Emporium.

00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:57.440
 [LAUGHTER]

00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:59.780
 I don't mean to interrupt, huh? Oh, that's quite alright.

00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:02.000
 And could you please tell me which way to guns?

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:02.740
 I beg your pardon?

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:04.240
 Oh, I know, and sporting goods.

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:06.740
 Now, don't you go spending too much, Mary?

00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:07.980
 Nice girl, Mary.

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:08.980
 Lovely.

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:10.880
 Friend, daughter.

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:12.680
 Oh.

00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:15.380
 Oh, I'll say, isn't your jewelry department nearby?

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:19.220
 Two miles over, but as long as she's going as far as a hunting rifle,

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:21.020
 I wonder how she'd like a pearl necklace.

00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:25.460
 But, sir, about those checkers, I've measured all of them in the largest as an inch and a quarter in diameter.

00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:26.900
 Oh, well, I'll tell you, uh...

00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:28.340
 Does the set come in a leather case?

00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:31.180
 - Why no? - And it doesn't have a strap that goes around your neck.

00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:32.180
 - No. - Well, thanks.

00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:35.340
 The more I think of it, the more I'm sure we're on the wrong track with checkers.

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:37.420
 Well, we have this chest-set in leather case,

00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:40.060
 - Chests. - And it's been reduced, and we could have a strap put on it.

00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:41.900
 No, no, I'm afraid not.

00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:43.940
 If I don't like Chests, why should Henry?

00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:46.340
 - Sir! - Oh, that's my wife. Excuse me.

00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:50.700
 Yeah, I'm sorry. I've laid but I've finished every last bit of our Christmas shop.

00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:53.180
 No, you haven't, Alice. We still need a gift for Henry.

00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:55.940
 Henry? Didn't you send away for that piccolo?

00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:58.700
 Yes, but he wasn't heading for a piccolo.

00:11:58.700 --> 00:11:59.700
 He wasn't?

00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:02.020
 Not unless a piccolo has something to do with checks.

00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:04.980
 You can see 20 feet off when it goes around your neck.

00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:05.500
 What?

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:08.020
 Incidentally, Alice, what do you think of pearls?

00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:09.020
 Pearls?

00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:10.140
 What?

00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:11.980
 Why, dear, they're very lovely.

00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:14.300
 They'd make a nice present for a young lady, wouldn't they?

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:15.060
 Oh, my goodness.

00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:18.340
 Yes, but aren't they rather expensive?

00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:20.100
 Alice, in this case, nothing's too good.

00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:23.900
 Well, well, naturally, Sam, it's up to you

00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:27.900
 And dear, while you're doing your shopping, there's something I ought to take care of too.

00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:30.900
 Very well, dear, and try to think why it is Henry's been handing out.

00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:31.900
 I will.

00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:34.900
 Excuse me, madam, could you let me buy, please?

00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:35.900
 Young man.

00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:36.900
 Young man.

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:38.900
 Well, back again, madam.

00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:42.900
 Yes, these ties I bought a little while ago, I'd like to return them.

00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:43.900
 So soon?

00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:44.900
 Well...

00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:47.900
 Our ties don't usually start coming back until after new years.

00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:51.900
 Well, you see, I think I'm getting a pearl necklace from my husband,

00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:55.180
 and I couldn't very well give him just ties in return.

00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:57.620
 I see. Very well. I'll make out a refund slip.

00:12:57.620 --> 00:12:58.620
 Thank you.

00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:02.580
 Incidentally, you've had quite a bit of experience with gifts, haven't you?

00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:03.820
 I certainly have.

00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:08.220
 Well, what would you say it was that handy at football games

00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:11.220
 comes in loud checks and goes around your neck?

00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:12.740
 Why, madam, that's obvious.

00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:13.540
 It is?

00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:16.340
 Yes, you will find our mufflers right over there at the next count.

00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:17.340
 [LAUGHTER]

00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:20.940
 But that's incredible. Henry would never...

00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:22.300
 Why, it's incredible.

00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:24.100
 What matter, what else could it be?

00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:36.580
 Mary, you bought Kermit, what, for Christmas?

00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:38.220
 A gun, mother, a gun.

00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:40.380
 Do you really think you should be giving a man

00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:42.660
 you might eventually marry a thing like that?

00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:45.820
 What about it, though, that's just what Kermit would like?

00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:49.020
 And, mother, my problem is, what should I have engraved on it?

00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:50.020
 and grave?

00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:55.060
 And on the barrel, I was thinking of something like, "To Kermit, peace on Earth, goodwill

00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:56.060
 toward men."

00:13:56.060 --> 00:14:00.260
 Here I wouldn't have it engraved until after Christmas.

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:01.260
 Why not?

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:04.500
 Well, suppose it's the wrong size and has to be returned.

00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:07.980
 And Mary, wait till you hear what I'm getting from your father.

00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:08.980
 Hey, Henry!

00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:11.180
 Mrs. Alvich, have you seen Henry?

00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:13.740
 Well, I believe he's up in his room home or I call it.

00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:15.380
 Before you tell me what you're getting?

00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:17.260
 Mary, maybe you can help me out.

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:18.260
 With what?

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:21.140
 I've never had any experience rolling cigars.

00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:22.140
 Rolling, what?

00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:23.500
 Cigars.

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:25.500
 I thought if I bought the raw materials

00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:30.340
 and eliminated the middleman, I might get by for a dollar.

00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:32.780
 I've never rolled a cigar in my life.

00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:33.620
 Hi, Homer.

00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:35.020
 And I don't think it's a bit nice of you

00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:36.500
 to infer that I have.

00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:37.860
 My goodness.

00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:40.060
 Homer, Mary didn't mention anything about my family

00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:41.660
 buying those binoculars, did she?

00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:42.260
 No.

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:44.340
 She, I went through every hiding place in the house.

00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:47.420
 And the only Christmas present I found was a muffler.

00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:48.220
 For you?

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:50.420
 Gee whiz, no.

00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:53.740
 My parents wouldn't palm a thing like that off on me.

00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:55.500
 You should see it, Homer.

00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:57.260
 Chex is big as that, although--

00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:58.180
 [LAUGHTER]

00:14:58.180 --> 00:14:59.180
 No, kid.

00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:01.140
 Boy, it looked like it was on fire.

00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:02.140
 [LAUGHTER]

00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:02.640
 Henry.

00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:03.460
 Yes, Homer?

00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:05.340
 I hate to mention this, but--

00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:07.740
 Well, maybe your parents didn't get your hints straight

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:10.300
 and watch you something else instead of binoculars.

00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:12.540
 Henry, will you please answer the phone?

00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:13.980
 Yes, mother.

00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:17.100
 Homer, what else could they have thought I was heading for?

00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:19.780
 Hello? Hello, is this Aldrich? Yes.

00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:23.140
 L-303? That's right. Well, this is the Emporium calling.

00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:26.540
 Have you decided on what sort of engraving you want on that hunting rifle?

00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:29.140
 Hunting rifle? Yes. Hunting rifle?

00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:31.100
 But you bought this afternoon for the young man.

00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:34.100
 Are you sure you're calling Aldrich? Yes.

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:36.500
 L-303? Yes.

00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:40.900
 And somebody here bought a hunting rifle? Yes.

00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:44.260
 Hello? Oh, boy.

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:46.220
 Only maybe you shouldn't have told me that.

00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:47.420
 Oh, it's for you?

00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:50.780
 You better call back later and speak to either my mother or father.

00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:52.280
 Goodbye.

00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:54.220
 Homer, did you hear that?

00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:57.220
 I'm getting a hunting rifle for Christmas.

00:15:57.220 --> 00:16:00.620
 Oh, anything fall I asked for was a piccolo.

00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:05.660
 Boy, that just goes to prove what a few subtle hints can do.

00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:09.140
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:17.140
 [Music]

00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:19.140
 [Applause]

00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:24.140
 Now we'll hear something holiday hints from Meredith Wilson and this fucking piece.

00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:25.140
 You know Meredith?

00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:26.140
 What?

00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:30.140
 That wonderful, colorful, jello family sure had a lot to holiday cheer.

00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:36.140
 Oh, there's no doubt about it. Those big red letters are just as friendly and cheerful as...

00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:42.180
 Santa's red suit? Yeah. Hey Prancer. Come on boy, come on boy up,

00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:47.440
 that's a whooow now. Take it either on that chin. Okay. And after the holidays too, the

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:51.560
 same big red letters stand for the same good cheer, the year round.

00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:58.120
 J. E. L. L. O. Also means satiny smooth, jello pudding.

00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:04.200
 Every day of the year. J. E. L. O. Also means jello, tappy ochopunny.

00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:09.720
 And J. E. L. O. Also means jello, the world's most famous shimmering dessert, and nothing

00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:14.600
 could taste better or sparkle prettier on your table through the holidays, or any day

00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:21.480
 than any or all of the six delicious fruit-like locked-in flavors of shining, shimmering jello.

00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:25.980
 Listen to that man go I'll take strawberry, we we we we we we.

00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:27.480
 Cherry, we we we.

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:28.480
 Lemon, we we we we.

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:29.480
 Lemon, you're not.

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:30.480
 Mmm.

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:34.480
 Jake, eat, help, help.

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:37.480
 Oh, and back to the Aldrich family.

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:46.480
 Now getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldrichs.

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:50.480
 Henry wanted a pair of binoculars for Christmas, but the subtle hints he's been dropping have led his parents to the first place.

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:54.680
 have led his parents to buy him a muffler and a piccolo. Only now Henry

00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:57.920
 believes they've bought him a hunting rifle, which is really Mary's present to

00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:02.880
 her boyfriend. The scene opens in the Aldrich living room and it's Christmas Eve.

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:07.280
 A snow shovel? Mother, you're giving father a snow shovel for Christmas? Mary,

00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:12.160
 let me finish. First, your father will give me my pearl necklace. Then I'll give him

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:16.560
 his snow shovel. And Mary, you're going to see the longest face you've ever seen.

00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:17.800
 Well, I should think so.

00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:22.360
 And then I'll give him his real present, a lovely chess set and a leather cage.

00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:23.400
 A chess set?

00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:26.200
 Yes, I saw him admiring it in the Emporium the other day.

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:28.160
 Oh, Mother, you're so sweet.

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:30.880
 Oh, and Mary, I feel so warm.

00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:32.000
 So do I.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.440
 The house has been so different since Father insulated it.

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:37.600
 I didn't mean that.

00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:40.480
 I mean, everything's so perfect.

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:41.560
 Hello, Mother.

00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:42.600
 Hello, dear.

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:43.560
 Hello, Mary.

00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:44.720
 Hello, Henry.

00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:48.520
 Would anybody like me to make them a glass of eggnog?

00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:49.680
 Eggnog, Henry?

00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:50.360
 Sure.

00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:53.160
 That's just the thing I'm in the mood to make.

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:55.960
 Thank you just the same, dear.

00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:58.560
 Mary, please phone Mrs. Dixon, and make sure she

00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:01.000
 launders our good tablecloth in time for Christmas dinner.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.520
 Henry, I got that box of cigars from my father.

00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:04.400
 I did for a dog?

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:05.600
 Sure, from Willie Moore.

00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:07.320
 I don't know Willie smoked cigars.

00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:09.960
 He does, and this is a box his uncle send his father.

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:10.800
 No kidding.

00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:11.240
 Sure.

00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:14.240
 Mr. Marshall said the way he feels about his wife's family,

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:16.640
 He wouldn't smoke them with a 10 foot pole.

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:17.940
 (phone ringing)

00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:19.440
 - I don't mind answering it, ma'am.

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:21.040
 - I'm practically there.

00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:21.880
 Hello?

00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:23.040
 - Hello, Mary.

00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:24.000
 This is Kermit.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.800
 - Oh, hello, Kermit.

00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:26.640
 - Hello.

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:27.460
 - Hello.

00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:28.540
 - Hello.

00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:29.800
 How have you been?

00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:31.160
 - Fine, Kermit.

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:33.120
 - You had the sniffles when I left last night

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:34.120
 and I've been worried.

00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:35.220
 - You have?

00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:37.160
 Isn't that sweet?

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:38.240
 - How are they?

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:39.080
 - Who?

00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:39.920
 - The sniffles.

00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:40.760
 - Oh, why?

00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:42.600
 (audience laughing)

00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:44.600
 I just finished my Christmas shopping.

00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:45.600
 You have?

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:48.600
 Kermit, I certainly hope you didn't get anything from me.

00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:49.600
 Well, I...

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:50.600
 Oh, Kermit, you shouldn't have.

00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:52.600
 It's something you wear on your hand.

00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:53.600
 Really?

00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:55.600
 Kermit, you're teasing.

00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:56.600
 No, I'm not.

00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:58.600
 And they're made of pigskin.

00:19:58.600 --> 00:19:59.600
 Oh!

00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:00.600
 Oh!

00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:01.600
 Oh!

00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:03.600
 That's only if I'm going to give you.

00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:04.600
 Oh.

00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:08.600
 Well, I certainly hope you won't ask me to give you any hints about what I got you.

00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:09.600
 I won't.

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:10.600
 You won't?

00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:14.320
 I'll give you a tiny hint. Just keep your eye on the bull's eye.

00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:15.700
 On the bull's eye?

00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:17.960
 And I'm not going to say another word.

00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:20.060
 Gee, that's a puzzle.

00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:21.160
 It is.

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:24.560
 Well, I can't think of what it could be unless it's a gun.

00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:25.380
 A gun?

00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:28.000
 But I know you wouldn't be foolish enough to buy a thing like that.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:28.500
 What?

00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:31.200
 Not for a guy who served four years in the infantry.

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:32.680
 [LAUGHTER]

00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:34.840
 Well, naturally, I didn't.

00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:36.640
 Oh my goodness.

00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:37.720
 Is anything wrong, Mayor?

00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:39.280
 No, no, but I have to hang up.

00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:40.780
 Are your snipples coming back?

00:20:40.780 --> 00:20:43.280
 Kermit, I haven't time to explain goodbye.

00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:44.280
 Oh my goodness.

00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:44.880
 What is Mary?

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:45.480
 What's her?

00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:46.480
 Can we out of my way?

00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:48.680
 Don't you realize all the stores closed at seven tonight?

00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:50.780
 Are you looking for something in that closet, Mary?

00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:52.780
 My goodness, I hope it isn't too late.

00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:54.280
 Mary, Mary, what are you doing?

00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:54.980
 Mary, let go.

00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:56.380
 I've got to return this right away.

00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:57.480
 Return to listen, Mary.

00:20:57.480 --> 00:20:58.380
 What's that down?

00:20:58.380 --> 00:20:58.380
 What's that down?

00:20:58.380 --> 00:20:59.380
 Mary, out of my way.

00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:00.180
 Mother--

00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:01.380
 Mary, don't you move another step.

00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:01.880
 Mother--

00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:03.880
 Mary, I warn you.

00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:05.880
 What's all the shouting about?

00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:08.780
 Mother, Mary's going to return my Christmas present.

00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:10.340
 That mufflers for Henry.

00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:11.340
 Mufflers!

00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:15.540
 I'm returning comets gone.

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:16.540
 Kermit's gone.

00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:17.540
 Kermit.

00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:18.740
 Now please let me go, Henry.

00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:20.740
 I'll never be able to return it in time.

00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:27.780
 But Henry, Henry, you didn't think that gun was for you instead of Kermit, did you?

00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:28.780
 Why?

00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:29.780
 For Henry Alice.

00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:30.780
 For Henry.

00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:33.780
 If that gun was for anyone, it was for...

00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:35.780
 For whom?

00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:36.780
 Kermit.

00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:37.780
 Kermit.

00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:38.780
 Excuse me.

00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:40.780
 Where are you going?

00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:43.620
 Up to my room.

00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:46.700
 And I hope Mary's very happy with her pearl.

00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:47.700
 Mary?

00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:48.700
 The pearls of...

00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:49.700
 High stoodness.

00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:52.700
 Boy, that's a fine thing.

00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:55.700
 Henry, where are you going?

00:21:55.700 --> 00:21:57.860
 How, mother?

00:21:57.860 --> 00:21:58.860
 Just out.

00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:00.620
 Dear, you haven't got your coat on.

00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:01.860
 Gee, who cares?

00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:04.580
 Well, at least take your new muffler.

00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:06.020
 Mother, I...

00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:09.020
 I'd rather not even mention that muffler.

00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:11.860
 (classical music)

00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:23.260
 - Hey Henry.

00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:25.060
 Henry, what are you doing on the curb?

00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:27.460
 - He's sitting at Homer, Gee Whiz, what does it look like?

00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:30.340
 - I've been looking for you for nearly two hours.

00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:31.340
 Merry Christmas.

00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:33.620
 - Sure, Merry Christmas.

00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:34.700
 - Right.

00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:37.300
 I heard about the gun being for Kermit.

00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:38.300
 Tough luck.

00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:39.600
 That's okay, Homer.

00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:41.360
 That's okay.

00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:43.100
 Maybe the better man won.

00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:44.400
 Henry, don't say that.

00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:45.400
 Why not?

00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:46.400
 Why not face facts?

00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:47.400
 Gee.

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:52.700
 And to think I've been looking forward to this Christmas since last Christmas.

00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:55.300
 I know how you feel.

00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:57.700
 I'm not getting my piccolo either.

00:22:57.700 --> 00:22:58.700
 No?

00:22:58.700 --> 00:22:59.700
 I'll be lucky to get anything.

00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:01.500
 Didn't you give your father those cigars?

00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:02.500
 Sure.

00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:03.500
 He lit one.

00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:04.500
 You know what happened?

00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:09.940
 up in his face. It did? And Willy won't even give me my money back. He says, "Is it his

00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:14.880
 fault? His uncle doesn't like his father." What's that? A bunch of kids singing

00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:19.320
 carols on the library steps. Boy, you'd think they'd know better than to disturb the

00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:29.060
 piece. I'll say. Oh, are you humming? Me? She was, I was just checking to see if they're

00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:31.060
 - Are they? - No.

00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:33.060
 - Hi, fellas. - Who's that?

00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:35.060
 - She was at Staches Johnny Dixon again.

00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:37.060
 - Merry Christmas to you all.

00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:39.060
 I just delivered your mother's table clock, Henry.

00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:41.060
 Aren't we lucky? - Lucky?

00:23:41.060 --> 00:23:44.060
 - Sure. Look, snow on Christmas Eve.

00:23:44.060 --> 00:23:45.060
 Isn't it neat?

00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:48.060
 - What's so neat about snow? All it does is get under your collar.

00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:50.060
 - And when do you mind leaving us alone?

00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:52.060
 - Whoa, sure, fellas.

00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:54.060
 And I hope your mother's cold gets better, Henry.

00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:56.060
 - Cold? She's got a cold?

00:23:56.060 --> 00:23:58.060
 - Whoa. That's the way she looked to me.

00:23:58.060 --> 00:24:02.420
 to me. Say that I show you the swell present I got for my mother. Look, a real

00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:09.680
 aviator's helmet. Yeah, fur line. That swell. With real fur. Well, I better get home and help

00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:17.040
 her trim the tree. Merry Christmas to you all. Chee. Yeah, gee. Imagine getting all excited about a hat.

00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:23.040
 Henry, what? I'm going home.

00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:26.040
 Oh, you're going to leave me alone? On Christmas Eve?

00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:30.040
 I'm sorry, Henry. That's where I'd rather be.

00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:33.040
 She was. Good night.

00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:35.040
 And Henry.

00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:38.040
 Yeah? Merry Christmas.

00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:41.040
 (SINGING)

00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:43.040
 Henry! Henry, all great!

00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:46.040
 She was. Mother, what are you doing out in the street?

00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:47.040
 Here's your coat.

00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:48.040
 Gee.

00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:49.040
 Thanks, Mother.

00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:51.280
 Don't think I'm forgiving you, Henry.

00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:53.920
 But if you get sick, I'm the one who'll have to suffer for it.

00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:54.920
 Now put it on.

00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:55.920
 Yes, Mother, and look.

00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:56.920
 Hey, Ray, is that you?

00:24:56.920 --> 00:24:57.920
 Sam!

00:24:57.920 --> 00:24:59.920
 Alice, what are you doing out here?

00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:02.920
 Sam, I know we agreed not to speak to Henry, but...

00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:04.760
 Father, what's that under your arm?

00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:05.760
 Why, uh...

00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:08.200
 Gee, whiz, it's my lumberjackin'.

00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:11.560
 Henry, I'm still the one who has to pay the doctor.

00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:12.560
 Gee, thanks.

00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:16.000
 Well, Alice, can we go home?

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:19.600
 You're going before I wish I marry Christmas to you all?

00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:20.600
 What?

00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:22.600
 Merry Christmas, Henry.

00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:23.600
 Yes.

00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:25.600
 Merry Christmas, son.

00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:28.200
 Gee, Gee, listen to what they're saying.

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:32.000
 Love and joy come to you and to your also too.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.000
 And God bless you as a whole, Father.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:39.000
 Father, could I apologize for thinking that gun was for me?

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.500
 Well, that's all right, son.

00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:42.500
 We all make mistakes.

00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:45.500
 Sam, I'm so happy.

00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:47.500
 Hey, I'm just curious.

00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:49.500
 What was it you were heading for, always?

00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:50.500
 G-Father, it was silly.

00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:51.500
 Forget it.

00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:52.500
 I'm curious.

00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:55.500
 Well, a pair of binoculars, I saw in the haven.

00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:56.500
 Binoculars?

00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:59.500
 But, G, they don't compare to a muffler.

00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:00.500
 Yeah.

00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:02.500
 Well, shall we all go home now and trim the tree?

00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:03.500
 Right.

00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:07.500
 I'll tell you, Alissa, suppose you go home and start without me.

00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:11.500
 I just remembered I, I ran out of cigar.

00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:15.500
 Don't buy them from Willy Father, they blow up in your face.

00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:18.500
 Well, Leah, shall we start for home?

00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:22.500
 What, before we do, could I go into this store here and put in one phone call?

00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:23.500
 To whom?

00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:29.500
 To Haven's drugstore, and tell Mr. de Haven not to sell my binoculars before Father gets there.

00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:41.500
 [Music]

00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:45.500
 Now, very Christmas to all of your families from the Jell-O family.

00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:48.500
 Jell-O, Jell-O puddings and Jell-O tapioca puddings.

00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:52.500
 Now for all you youngsters listening in, here's a little Christmas poem.

00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:55.500
 If you ever get the feeling that you'd like to squeeze the cat,

00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:58.500
 or tie a tin can to the dog or sit on father's hat,

00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:03.620
 is hat, or pull the lamp from off the desk or overturn the ink, better stop before you

00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:06.180
 do, better stop and think.

00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:08.820
 Because you know what's coming and it's not so far away.

00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:11.900
 Just two days from now it'll be Christmas day.

00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:15.420
 You can squeeze the cat in April, you can tease the dog in June.

00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:18.500
 In August you can dig the yard with Mother's Silver Spoon.

00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:22.580
 Fathers had a squash in March and next month they'll still be ink.

00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:25.620
 Better wait a little while, better wait and think.

00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:28.980
 As you know what's coming, and it's not so far away.

00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:32.620
 Just two days from now it'll be Christmas Day.

00:27:32.620 --> 00:27:35.260
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:27:35.260 --> 00:27:41.420

00:27:41.420 --> 00:27:43.060
 a very Merry Christmas.

00:27:43.060 --> 00:27:44.100
 Good night, folks.

00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:47.100

00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:20.380
