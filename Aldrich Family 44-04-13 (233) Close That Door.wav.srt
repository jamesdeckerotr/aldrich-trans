 Coming, Mother!

00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 The nearest thing to perpetual motion is a typical teenage American boy.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 A youngster like Henry Aldrich, for instance, never rests.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 He's always on the go and always keeping others on the go.

00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 The scene opens in the old-rich living room. The time is afternoon.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 Henry, may I ask aren't you the one who left this broom in here?

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 That broom, mother? That broom? Yes, dear.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 Mrs. Oldrich, we had to use it to see whether we could find something under the sofa there.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 It doesn't matter what you were using it for, Homer. When you're through with something, you should put it back.

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 And may I ask you that that desk drawer opened?

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 Whoa! Homer, didn't you close that desk drawer?

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 Who I, Henry?

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 And Henry, look at that piano, bitch!

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 Oh, yes, it's wide open, isn't it?

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 And Mrs. Aldrich, may I explain something to you about that piano bench?

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 Now, Homer, does your mother like to see things left open like that?

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 Who, my mother? She, she never so much as raises, and I brow over a thing like that.

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 Really? Well, when I go out in the kitchen in the minute, I'm going to ask her.

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 Out in the kitchen, Mrs. Aldrich? Is my mother out in your kitchen?

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 She is. Henry, what do you say we take a little walk?

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 Listen, Homer, will you help me close it?

27
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 In the darn desk drawer?

28
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 What's Mary? We... stand back so I can...

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,960
 So I get look Henry you be shutting the piano bench

30
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:55,740
 Gee whiz okay, go ahead and close if you're so strong. Let me see you close one makes you think I can

31
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:59,060
 Now listen home, and you should never close a drawer with your feet

32
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:02,400
 I didn't I put a sheet of paper between my foot and the drawer when you're

33
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:08,640
 What else it was that we were supposed to close wait? Let's see. What's it that glass book case now listen?

34
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,440
 Homer put your foot down. Do you hear me? I'm putting it down Henry. I thought the darn case was open

35
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:16,760
 Do you see anything that does me closing that isn't well?

36
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:22,160
 Where are you telling I'll wait just a second while I go out and ask my mother if you see my mother the teller and behaving

37
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:29,860
 Mother yes, and I hello there Henry. Oh, hello, Mrs. Brown. Homer's all right. He's what there isn't anything to worry about a mother

38
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:33,880
 I don't want you to think I didn't pay any attention to you, but but listen dear

39
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:39,480
 Didn't you just come through that door which door that one you just left open? Yes, sure well

40
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,760
 Is there something you oh?

41
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,600
 Yes.

42
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,000
 Boy, am I dumb.

43
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,680
 Now, what was it you wanted to ask me?

44
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,500
 Right.

45
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,160
 What was it you wanted Homer and me to close?

46
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,120
 What was it?

47
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,640
 Naturally, there I want you to close everything you left open.

48
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:54,000
 Yes, Mother, sure, but it's hard for me to tell

49
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,600
 what things are open that I didn't close,

50
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,760
 so I didn't open it first.

51
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,600
 I mean--

52
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,440
 And what about the broom?

53
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,520
 Oh, yes, the broom.

54
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,360
 How was it?

55
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,200
 I'll go get it.

56
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,200
 And Henry, how about that door you just opened again?

57
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,440
 Well, isn't it clear, Mother?

58
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,120
 I'm going to bring a broom right back through it.

59
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:06,960
 Henry?

60
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,120
 Yes, Mother, I'm closing it.

61
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,360
 Alice, I'm glad you see your training, Henry, like that.

62
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,360
 - Well, Elizabeth, I've always said I don't care

63
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,960
 whether my children graduate with honors,

64
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,960
 and I don't care whether they ever make a lot of money.

65
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,720
 But there is one thing I shall always insist on,

66
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,320
 and that is they do not go through life

67
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,720
 leaving things open behind them.

68
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,040
 - And I agree, Alice.

69
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,320
 I started a week of married training real,

70
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,000
 and I resolved a day Homer was born

71
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,160
 at the woman he married,

72
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,920
 will never go through what I had to go through.

73
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,720
 - You mean you never have trouble with Homer?

74
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,920
 - No, not anymore.

75
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,880
 He hasn't left anything open since he was three years old.

76
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,560
 - Mrs. Aldrich, are you by any chance alone?

77
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,240
 - No, Homer, your mother's here.

78
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,940
 Oh yes, call mother.

79
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,240
 Home, I closed that door.

80
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,240
 Closest?

81
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,540
 You mean, I'm not staying, mother.

82
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,540
 I just popped in long enough to ask Mrs. Old

83
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:52,940
 which whether she has a few spare cookies she could spare.

85
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:56,440
 Oh, but, uh, what have I always said about people

86
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,940
 that leave doors open?

 Oh!

 Who do you went, Homer?

91
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,640
 What's the matter, you're buying the door right in a person's place?

92
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,640
 I didn't know you were coming in here, Henry.

93
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,440
 I just-- why didn't you knock or something?

94
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,240
 There.

95
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,840
 Oh, Murk, if you and Henry but each like a cookie, you'll find them in that cupboard up there.

96
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,840
 Yes, Mrs. Paul.

97
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,840
 Thank you, Mother.

98
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,440
 But you're not to eat any until you put that broom away at the head of the cellist's

99
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,440
 day as well.

100
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,440
 Yes, Mother, that's where I'm heading right this minute.

101
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,240
 I'll be getting the cookie stand out of this cupboard, Henry.

102
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,940
 Oh, boy, Mrs. Old, rich old boy.

103
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:27,040
 They're my favorite kind, too.

104
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,640
 Here, Henry, do you want one?

105
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,640
 Yeah, sure.

106
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,640
 Thanks very much.

107
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,640
 Oh, huh?

108
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,640
 Yes, Mother.

109
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,640
 Haven't you forgotten something?

110
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,640
 Who I?

111
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,440
 Here, do you want a cookie?

112
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,040
 That is not what I'm referring to.

113
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,640
 Oh, I know you want me to close the cookie jar.

114
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,640
 There.

115
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,640
 Whoa, that's only part of what you're gonna do.

116
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,440
 It is?

117
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,140
 It is?

118
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:46,740
 Don't look down at your feet. Look up.

119
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:47,240
 Ah!

120
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,240
 Ow!

121
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,540
 Oh, Homer, did you hurt your head on the cupboard doo?

122
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,040
 Now don't be afraid of putting that on.

123
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,840
 The only way he ever learns anything.

124
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,840
 Come on, Homer.

125
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,540
 Let's see where I left out. Who's it?

126
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:58,240
 I can't find out the stationery store.

127
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,540
 Okay, let's go.

128
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:01,640
 And listen, Homer, you're coming out of the door, last.

129
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,040
 Don't let me have to speak to you.

130
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:03,640
 You won't.

131
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,640
 Goodbye, Mrs. All.

132
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,940
 It's goodbye, mother.

133
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:06,940
 Goodbye.

134
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:11,500
 - There, Alice, is a very good example of how a little firm and cysting can teach them

135
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,700
 but he'll never forget.

136
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:13,700
 - Elizabeth!

137
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:14,700
 - Yes, Alice?

138
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:17,340
 - Do you happen to know how that door about a cellar stays not open?

139
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,340
 - Footdoor.

140
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:19,340
 - Oh, Alice.

141
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:20,340
 - Oh, Alice.

142
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:22,340
 - Oh, dear, could he live in my home?

143
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:24,740
 - No, Henry left it open when he put his broom in there.

144
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:25,740
 - He did.

145
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:26,740
 - Well, I didn't even I do.

146
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:31,340
 - I'd make Henry come back in no matter where he is or what he's doing and close that door.

147
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:32,340
 - Henry!

148
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:33,340
 Henry!

149
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:34,340
 - Hello!

150
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:35,340
 - Goodbye, Mother.

151
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:36,340
 - Don't wait, Jennifer, if I'm late.

152
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:38,900
 Mary, you're just the person I want on your way downtown, dear.

153
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:41,380
 Look for Henry, and tell him he's to come right straight back here.

154
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:41,900
 But, Mother...

155
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:44,020
 And Mary, if you see Homer, you're telling to come back too.

156
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:46,900
 If he sees Henry get away with a thing like this, you'll think he can do it.

157
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,900
 But Mrs. Brown, I have thought of an engagement and I'm terribly late for it.

158
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:53,580
 Dear, do you realize the government's trying to save fuel so we can win this war?

159
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:56,260
 You mean they left the furnace wide open on a night stay like this?

160
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:58,100
 They've been leaving everything wide open, Mary.

161
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:58,820
 Oh, my goodness.

162
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:03,220
 And Mary, I want you to find Henry and Homer and tell him they'd come back here and see what they've done.

163
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:03,820
 Really?

164
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,180
 You think we ought to call father?

165
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:07,100
 Your mother and I can handle that, Mary.

166
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,940
 And if you think anything of your brother's character

167
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,540
 in Homer's future, you will find him.

168
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:12,140
 Yes, Mrs. Brown, you can depend on me.

169
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,140
 Goodbye.

170
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,140
 Goodbye.

172
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:23,580
 But Kathleen, I'm trying to explain why I'm late.

173
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,540
 When it seems to me, Mary, you're always late.

174

 No, thank you. I just found the Mother's Day card I bought in here this morning.

 I'm right in this store with all your other Mother's Day cards.

 You don't like the first one?

 Well, I tell you. My mother's done an awful lot for me, and frankly,

197
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:27,540
 well, I feel I ought to spend more than a dime on it.

346
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:39,300
 and we didn't realize what they'd done until after they'd gone.

347
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,700
 How did this all start?

348
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:44,200
 They came to the kitchen, Sam, and wanted some cookies, and I gave them some.

349
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,200
 And they left something wide open?

350
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,500
 Not wide open, Sam, but what's the difference, mother?

351
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,400
 It's all the way up, three inches, but then he just does the same.

352
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:54,200
 And may I have tried? You didn't call me first thing.

353
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,200
 Because I didn't want to bother you.

354
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,400
 And I didn't know that he would feel it was serious, and I'll just...

355
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,700
 Alice, don't be absurd. Of course it's serious. I'm going out and trying to find them.

356
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:04,200
 Now, Sam, if you do find them, don't lose your temper.

357
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,800
 Lose my temper? What do you mean?

358
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,700
 Well, remember, they aren't very holy.

359
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,900
 That doesn't make any difference. Goodbye.

360
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,900
 Father, what were you talking about?

361
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:12,900
 Where's my hat to coat?

362
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,900
 I'm Mr. Orrics before you go on a place.

363
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,900
 Could you give us some ideas to whether we're responsible?

364
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:19,900
 I mean, about putting somebody accidentally out of business.

365
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,900
 Boys, there are other things more important than that. Come with me.

366
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:22,900
 With you, Father.

367
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,900
 I want to get my hands on two young fellows,

368
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,900
 and I'll probably need your help in case they try to run away.

369
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:53,900
 [Music]

370
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,900
 Now getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldrich.

371
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:59,900
 In trying to train her son to close things behind him,

372
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:04,900
 Mrs. Aldrich has sent word downtown for Henry to come back and close the cellar door.

373
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:10,900
 In so doing, she has quite innocently started a rumor that someone has wrecked the Aldrich home.

374
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:15,900
 The scene opens on the front porch of a house a few miles outside town.

375
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:20,900
 Henry, don't ring that bell again if anybody's home or that's at the door.

376
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:24,660
 Yes, Father. Are you sure they came out here on old church, relative Mr. Ulrich?

377
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:26,700
 I mean, the two hoodlums we're looking for.

378
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,340
 Yes, Homer, at least that's the report.

379
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:30,580
 - How do you do it? - Oh, how do you do?

380
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:32,500
 This is Mr. Ulrich, I live back in town.

381
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:36,500
 I wondered whether anyone in your family happened to see a couple of young fellows out this way,

382
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,900
 but apparently escaped from the County Reform School.

383
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,740
 Oh, my. And then with law?

384
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:43,900
 Yes, ma'am, but we're closing in on them, we're pretty sure.

385
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,860
 Oh, my. No, I haven't been.

386
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:48,100
 And they broke into our house and did quite a bit of damage.

387
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,900
 If you happen to run across them, will you phone Elm 303?

388
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:53,600
 I certainly will, but I hope they don't ring my dole, Del.

389
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,900
 All we know is that they're very fond of cookies. In case I help, Janie.

390
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,100
 Well, thank you. Good-bye.

391
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,100
 Now which way are we going, Mr. Aldrich?

392
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,900
 We've got to get in the car here and go right on out until we locate them.

393
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:07,600
 Homer, let me see those two guys. If you know what we ought to do, why?

394
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,200
 Just walk up to them and though we knew them real well and fight,

395
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,800
 well, how are you anyhow?

396
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,200
 Yeah, and then what?

397
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,800
 And then before they know what happened, we'll jump on them.

398
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:19,300
 Sure, I'll take the one in blue and you take the one in gray.

399
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:24,800
 What's the matter, father? Haven't you turned the ignition on?

400
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,300
 I've turned it on.

401
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:33,800
 Mr. All, it's you on me to stand on the running board the way I do on my father's car and jump up and down a little.

402
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:37,800
 Homer just remains seated and keep quiet. We're out of gas.

403
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,300
 Oh, is that all, it's the matter. We're just out of gas.

404
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:43,300
 That's all. And your mother has the coupons back home.

405
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:50,300
 [Music]

406
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:54,300
 Well, how do you do?

407
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:57,300
 Hello Mrs. Aldrich, it's Charlie Clark. I've got to get something for your father.

408
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:03,300
 I mean for your mother. Look, I was just riding my bicycle out on old church road and I found it.

409
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,300
 Charlie, you found who?

410
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:09,300
 Well, I ran into Mr. Aldrich, see. And he said, "Would I please come here and get your gas coupon?"

411
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,900
 - Of course, come in. - Okay.

412
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:13,300
 And Charlie, will you pose the door please?

413
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,500
 Oh, did you want to close?

414
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:17,700
 I'm sorry, but that's one thing I'm very particular about.

415
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:18,940
 You must be tired, Charlie.

416
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:20,380
 Wouldn't you like a banana or something?

417
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:22,860
 But Mrs. Aldrich, he's dry, he's dry.

418
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:25,300
 Oh, Mr. Aldrich needs some gas right away.

419
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:27,100
 Oh, now let me see.

420
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,500
 Coupons are right and it's this drawer.

421
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,700
 I can get it open.

422
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,540
 - Do you want me to help you, Mrs. Aldrich?

423
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:34,540
 - Well, but whoever closed this last

424
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:36,740
 shouldn't have posed it all the way.

425
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:39,980
 Well, we've got a drawer at our house like, oh gee whiz.

426
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:40,820
 What's the matter?

427
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:43,060
 The handle came off right in my hand.

428
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:45,020
 So there we've got to get this drawer open.

429
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:47,860
 Well look, Mrs. Olrich, have you got a hammer and chisel?

430
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:50,600
 (dramatic music)

431
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:57,980
 I'm sorry, Mr. Rorich, but I haven't seen anything

432
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:59,220
 of a couple fellas like that.

433
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,060
 No.

434
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,140
 Mr., can I have a package of chewing gum, please?

435
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:03,100
 Yeah, here you are.

436
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,420
 I'd order a milkshake on you.

437
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:06,260
 I haven't got any more money with me.

438
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:09,420
 And I know Mr. Oldrich has too much on his mind to loan me any.

439
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:11,100
 What's that, Homer?

440
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,260
 That's all right, Mr. Oldrich. That's all right.

441
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:16,020
 I shouldn't drink a milkshake just before dinner anyhow.

442
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:19,100
 And when you look down the road a minute ago, did you see anything at Charlie Clark?

443
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,860
 No, Father, there wasn't any sign of it.

444
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:22,340
 Well, I know what your father could do.

445
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:24,260
 I don't know why I didn't think of it before.

446
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:24,860
 What, Homer?

447
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:26,620
 You don't need coupons to get gas.

448
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:28,540
 He was my father, has a lot of trucks.

449
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:30,140
 You can get all the gas you want.

450
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:32,060
 Thank you, Homer. That's very kind of you.

451
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:34,300
 But I happen to know that your father obeys the law.

452
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,260
 What law?

453
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:37,600
 I'm a side you down looking for those two boys in town.

454
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,800
 Henry Aldrich, you're such you in there.

455
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,320
 She lives marine-ported you come from.

456
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,680
 He's been looking all over for you and your grandpa.

457
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,560
 What for?

458
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:47,880
 Has anyone told you about all the damage that was done and how upset Mother is?

459
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,680
 Sure, I know all about it, Mary. That's why Homer and I are on here.

460
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,960
 That's why you're out here.

461
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,280
 You don't care how Mother feels?

462
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:57,200
 Surely, do, Mary. But we're helping her. We're helping her in our own way.

463
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:57,800
 Sure.

464
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:01,300
 Well, you just wait, Henry, until I tell Father about your attitude and it matters.

465
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,280
 But Mary...

466
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:04,820
 She always gets so darn excited.

467
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:05,820
 Sure.

468
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:08,820
 Over something she doesn't understand the first thing about.

469
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:09,820
 Henry, where are you going?

470
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:13,820
 I'm just going to step over here and close the school booth, or some of that part reopening.

471
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:16,820
 Just how much damage was done at your house?

472
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:21,820
 Wait, we haven't seen the damage yet, but we understand the first two floors are practically white-bound.

473
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:22,820
 Yes?

474
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:27,820
 My father said he tried nothing sure if he gets the whole downstairs all gone over the way he's always wanted it.

475
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:29,820
 Say him the incidentally, where is your father?

476
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,060
 Where is your father?

477
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:32,860
 Oh, then. She was the new step outside?

478
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:33,700
 He did.

479
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,620
 How'd you get out there without our scene?

480
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:37,220
 Come on, maybe try to park his car.

481
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,660
 Oh boy, Henry.

482
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:41,540
 Homer, will you please close that door and close me?

483
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:45,700
 Hello, rustic milkshake boy.

484
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,580
 Hello, this is Mr. Orange speaking.

485
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:48,420
 Who?

486
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:50,540
 Mr. Orange, could you let me out, please?

487
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:51,820
 Let's get out, where are you?

488
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:54,020
 I'm right around here in one of your phone booth.

489
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:56,380
 Somebody close the door and you can't get out.

490
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:58,260
 Oh, Mr. Orange, you should never have closed that.

491
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,620
 We've had trouble before.

492
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:10,140
 Boy, I wish your father would show up in me.

493
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:12,500
 It's getting kind of cold waiting in this car.

494
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,100
 You'll be along, Homer. You'll be along.

495
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,820
 Instead of sitting here wasting time,

496
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:18,980
 my father could have been out here by now with all the gas coupons you need.

497
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:22,820
 Oh, my father's very particular about not using anybody else's coupons.

498
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:24,500
 And besides, here comes the tolling truck.

499
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,460
 Maybe my father's on.

500
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:28,140
 Oh, boy. Come on, let's get him. Watch him hook her.

501
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:31,140
 Mom, she was just going right by.

502
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:34,080
 Well, in the first place, Henry, it isn't a towing

503
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,080
 pocket to telephone company trucks.

504
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,080
 Oh, yeah.

505
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:40,080
 And look, they're pulling right up in front of the milkshake bar.

506
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,080
 See?

507
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,080
 A couple of guys are going inside with a lot of heavy tools.

508
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:46,080
 Come on, Henry, let's go in and see what they're going to do.

509
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,080
 Listen, Homer, the thing for us to do is to stay right here by this car.

510
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:52,080
 So my father can put his hands on us when he wants it.

513
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,080
 Wasn't that awful, Mother? I mean, about Henry refusing to come home.

514
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,080
 Yes, Mary.

515
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,080
 And, Mother, will you please tell me something else?

516
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,080
 What is it? What was it Mr. Britain wanted when he was here?

517
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,080
 Yeah, I don't know. I was busy trying to get the gas coupons out of the bin.

518
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:14,080
 Mother, it was the clear thing. You wanted to go all through the house.

519
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,080
 Mary threw the whole house?

520
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,080
 Yes, Mother. He said he wanted to start the basement and work his way up all the way to the attic.

521
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:22,080
 And after he left, I saw him practically every door in the house open.

522
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,080
 Really?

523
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,080
 Isn't father's gonna sell a house?

524
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,080
 Well, was Mr. Britain interested?

525
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,080
 Alice!

526
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,080
 Who's saying is that you on out in the kitchen?

527
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:32,080
 Alice, would you please tell me why you couldn't send the gas coupons out to me?

528
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:36,080
 See you, I was going to send them out, and I had to send Charlie Clark for us to get a cop in there so we could get them.

529
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,080
 Get them? Where are they?

530
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:41,080
 And in the meantime, Sam, you got a banana out of the icebox and let the door wide open.

531
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,080
 What did that to do with it?

532
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,080
 Well, don't you understand? We're entirely defrosted.

533
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,080
 You, what's that in your hair?

534
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,080
 My hair? What do you mean?

535
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,080
 My goodness, Todd, you've got wood shavings all over your head.

536
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:54,880
 Yeah? You know how this telephone company gives very good service.

537
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,240
 The gift card? Did you find them, Sam?

538
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:00,280
 Did I find them? No, I didn't find them. How could I when I ran out of gas?

539
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,560
 Tell me, Sam, have you offered to sell our house?

540
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,620
 But you asked that. You mean we're going to have to get out?

541
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:06,020
 Father, don't you like it anymore?

542
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:10,020
 Like this? Of course I like it. But it's never going to be the same, Mary. How could it be?

543
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:12,360
 Sam, Mary asked exactly what you're talking about.

544
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,800
 Mother, are you having a kitchen?

545
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,100
 Well, Henry, is that you?

546
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:17,360
 Yes. Did Father tell you what happened to him?

547
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,160
 I did not.

548
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,400
 Well, Jean, this is all Vicki should have been there.

549
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,400
 They had to leave the booth right down on its side and roll them out.

550
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:28,960
 What? I do not know what you're talking about, but I knew though I've been waiting for you all at the noon.

551
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,260
 For us, Mrs. Aldrich?

552
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:31,820
 I want you to take a look.

553
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:32,860
 Take a look, mother.

554
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:34,780
 Oh, can we have some more cookies?

555
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:36,520
 Sure, I'll get them out of the cupboard.

556
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:40,580
 Homer leaves the cookies on the shelf, and look over there for the cellar stairs.

557
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:41,460
 Both of you.

558
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:42,600
 The cellar stairs?

559
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,620
 It's something I did?

560
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:45,140
 It most certainly is.

561
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:47,460
 How recently did he do it, Mrs. Aldrich?

562
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:48,900
 Alice, what have they done?

563
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:51,040
 Boy, do you see that cello door?

564
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,400
 It's open.

565
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,940
 It's open, Mrs. Hall.

566
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:57,140
 Alice, do you mean...

567
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:58,440
 Alice, do you mean...

568
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,840
 And, Ben, I'm very glad you found them for me.

569
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,940
 Now, Henry, please close that door.

570
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,740
 Yes, Mama.

571
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,380
 Well, I'm glad that's settled.

572
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:08,340
 And I hope it'll be a very good lesson to you.

573
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:09,880
