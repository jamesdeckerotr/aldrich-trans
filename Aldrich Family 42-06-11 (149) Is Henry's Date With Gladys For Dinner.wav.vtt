00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 To a teenage boy each new day is a new world.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.100
 Filled with all sorts of discoveries and excitement and even mishaps, which drop a

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.900
 Always empty.

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.900
 Or it is with every opening.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.200
 The scene opens at the telephone and calls it front hall.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.200
 It is Saturday morning.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.200
 Hello?

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.200
 Hello?

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.200
 Oh, how are you, Gladys?

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.700
 Fine, can you hear us?

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:36.700
 Fine.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.200
 Do you, well, hear your voice?

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.200
 Thank you.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.200
 You're a student.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.200
 It is?

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.200
 I can see you.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.200
 Oh, it's a little bit more.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.200
 Oh, Henry.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.200
 Henry.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.200
 Henry, all of you?

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.200
 Yeah.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.200
 Oh, oh.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.200
 Oh, oh.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.200
 Oh, oh.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.200
 Oh, oh.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.040
 Henry.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.040
 Oh, just a minute, Gladys.

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.040
 Yes, Mother.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.680
 Me, tell me to birth the...

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:56.600
 Sure, Mother.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.280
 Just as soon as I find out one thing from Gladys.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.480
 One thing, Henry.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.840
 Oh, I...

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.360
 Do you remember last Thursday, Gladys?

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.680
 I think I do.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.960
 You mean you don't remember making a date with me?

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.040
 Of course I do.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.600
 How could I forget that?

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:11.600
 When we get bored?

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.880
 Oh, tonight.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.760
 And the reason I call, Gladys,

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.040
 about what time do you want me to come over?

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:18.880
 What time?

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:19.720
 Yeah.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.720
 I wasn't sure whether you wanted me to come in time for

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:25.720
 for what?

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.720
 I mean I certainly wouldn't want to barge in right in the middle of your

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.720
 your

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.720
 how does five thirty sound?

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:34.720
 Five thirty?

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.720
 Isn't that a little bit of a challenge?

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:37.720
 It is?

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:38.720
 It isn't?

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.720
 Well how about six?

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.720
 Is that two early?

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:43.720
 One or maybe six thirty?

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:44.720
 Six thirty?

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:45.720
 Not a dash.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.720
 You're at 630 is a nice round number.

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.720
 Is that before?

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.720
 Well, that is, was that the answer?

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:54.720
 No.

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:55.720
 Henry!

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:56.720
 Well, 630 is fine, Gladys.

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:57.720
 I'll be there.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:58.720
 You can go by.

00:01:58.720 --> 00:01:59.720
 I'm coming, Mother.

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.720
 Your breakfast is getting cold.

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.720
 Now, can you reach the cream, please?

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:04.720
 There you are, dear.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:05.720
 Thank you.

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:06.720
 Father.

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:07.720
 Yes, Henry.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.720
 Father, you've had quite a bit of experience eating.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:11.720
 I beg your pardon?

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:12.720
 Fantastic.

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.720
 Great.

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:14.720
 So, down to Henry.

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.120
 People sometimes invite you over to their house for dinner, don't they?

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.760
 That happened occasionally.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:21.760
 Why do you ask?

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.760
 Well, Father, when someone invites you over to their house at 6.30, does that mean it's

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.760
 for dinner or just social?

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:28.760
 What's that?

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.840
 Henry, please eat your grapefruit.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:31.840
 When I've got something on my mind?

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.760
 The other best way to get something off your mind is to put something in your stomach.

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.760
 Now start on your grapefruit.

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:38.760
 Yes, Mother.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:39.760
 Oh, Henry.

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.680
 Did I get you, Father?

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:42.680
 You did.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.680
 Do you see how upset I am, mother?

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.180
 Alice, let him ask me whatever he's going to.

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.680
 The sand must simply stay up until he does.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.180
 Now, who's invited you to dinner?

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.680
 That's it, I don't know.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:54.680
 What?

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.680
 I mean, I know who it is. Sure, but I'm not sure they are.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:57.680
 Oh, what? Sure.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:58.680
 Alice.

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:59.680
 Yes, ma'am.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.680
 Alice is your son. Translation, please.

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.680
 Don't you understand, Father?

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:06.680
 No.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.680
 It's perfectly simple. I've got a date tonight with Gladys Krennis,

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.680
 and I'm not sure whether eating goes with it or not.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.580
 Oh, that seems simple to me. Did she invite you?

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.480
 Well, she told me to be sure and be there no later than 630.

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.780
 630? Yes, mother. I got the idea. That was the absolute deadline.

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.980
 Well, it certainly sounds like dinner.

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.180
 Oh, this is sounds like nothing of the sort. It might easily be after dinner.

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.880
 Now, Sam Mabel Prentice was a cabinol before she was married, wasn't she?

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:32.880
 Well, that got to deal with it.

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.780
 Well, her father was a railroad engineer.

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.780
 And, Ray, she's your mother. Transplacement, please.

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.780
 They live right across the street from us and I know.

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:46.780
 Mr. Kavanaugh's train got in at 6.50 and they never ate before 6.50.

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.780
 Oh boy, you mean I'm really invited?

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.780
 No, Henry, let's not see Hasty.

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.780
 What you heard with Mother said, they always eat at 6.30. It's in their blood.

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.780
 It's a very simple way to find out if you're invited to dinner.

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:59.780
 There is how?

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:00.780
 Phone Gladys and Asker.

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.780
 Asker? Right out?

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:03.780
 Why not?

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.580
 I couldn't see if he wasn't expecting me to think I wanted an invitation.

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:09.880
 Well, don't you?

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:10.680
 Sam.

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.380
 No, look, suppose I do this.

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:14.780
 Toby Smith lives next door to Gladys.

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.380
 Maybe he could tell me whether they eat before or after 630.

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:19.680
 Finish a great suit first.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.180
 But Mother, don't you think I should find out?

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:22.280
 I'm going to do it, your mother said.

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:23.180
 But, Father, I'm right.

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.980
 Yes, sir.

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:25.380
 I'm sorry, Dee.

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.480
 What's in there, Dee Whizmother?

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.380
 Did I get you in the eye too?

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:31.880
 Now see here.

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.880
 The fans are heaven's sake, letting go make his phone call.

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:45.880
 But, Mark, you want to tell me what you saw?

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.880
 I think you're not quite in those dishes very well, good.

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:49.880
 Oh, Mark, it was time to...

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:55.880
 And if you're lending our best sign of the ass-mable for her engagement party tonight, we certainly want to send them over, please.

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.880
 But doesn't it sound like you're so happy, Mark, when I say to you, Mark?

00:04:58.880 --> 00:04:59.720
 - Hey, Mom.

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:00.540
 - Well, thank you.

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:02.280
 I think you may be doubting the conclusion.

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.160
 But why would you want to come over so early

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.840
 if you didn't take me out to dinner?

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.360
 - I'm glad it's a wise thing for you to do

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:09.480
 with falling in red,

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.840
 trying to out definitely just funny as you might.

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.440
 - Oh, my God, I just couldn't.

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:14.280
 - Why not?

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.360
 - Because if you haven't had taken me to dinner,

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.800
 my goodness, I just died in the dark, no.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:19.640
 - How's it going?

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:20.480
 - I'm good.

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:21.320
 - But I went out there and I said,

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:22.680
 well, what if you sit,

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:23.520
 (scoffs)

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:24.360
 my goodness.

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:25.360
 - You couldn't break the place, did you?

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:26.200
 - Yeah.

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:29.080
 I could warn I saw somebody up in that big M3.

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:30.680
 That's all I got, y'all.

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:31.680
 You did.

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.880
 Another, you know, it looked like me.

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:35.200
 Oh, but it couldn't be.

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.880
 What would Henry all be to doing up in all M3?

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:40.880
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:48.200
 Son?

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:49.720
 I just found the brown.

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:50.520
 They'll join us?

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:51.200
 Yes, dear.

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:54.960
 And Elizabeth had the same reaction I did, imagine going out

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.120
 to dinner for no reason whatsoever.

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:57.800
 Why not?

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.480
 Henry's having dinner at the furnaces.

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:00.560
 You deserve a day off.

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:01.160
 Why not?

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:02.200
 Yes, the same thing.

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:03.600
 I can't help being thrilled.

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.120
 What time do you tell the ground to me, to--

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:06.120
 Seven.

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.520
 And do you think you should call the mansion house

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:09.440
 for a reservation?

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:10.560
 No, well, we necessary.

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:11.600
 But suppose it's crowded.

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.320
 How if I'm positive it won't be?

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:14.920
 Besides, the head waiter knows me very well.

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:16.240
 I can always get a table.

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:19.000
 Boy, mother, look at my blue skirt suit.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.520
 Mary, hunger, and gourish sweater right next to it.

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:26.800
 I'm sure we can clean it up clean it up. Well, could you do it now, mother?

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:31.720
 It's only five more hours until six thirty and I can't go looking like a bowl weevil

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:38.480
 Henry I don't like to seem over cautious, but I just like to have one more

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:42.280
 Are you absolutely searching you're invited to dinner at the fantasy?

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:45.400
 And he said he was positive. He's been positive before

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:50.800
 I told you what I saw with my own eyes when I just happened to be up in their own tree this morning

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:54.960
 She was with they be getting out their best kind of just things with each other

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:58.800
 I'll be right there Homer

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:06.840
 Lucky dog and they're lucky. Do you are why?

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:10.880
 It's that right here

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:16.800
 My folks are going out with your folks for dinner and they gave me a dollar and a half to blow in an any turn of dinner

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:22.520
 I was now kidding a whole dollar and a hand together with the corner. I guess they now be able to

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:29.480
 myself six. Oh, I am running a lucky joy. Well, mama, what do I tell you about me?

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:33.320
 And why don't you get some money from your parents and little stuff ourselves together?

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:38.880
 I'm just in home. I'm sort of invited out to dinner tonight. You're where?

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:44.840
 The Gladys Prennis is. No kidding. Sure. That's funny. I just delivered something here from the

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:47.840
 We're glad I see the link a little for the boxy little room.

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:50.840
 Homer, you think this blue-haired suit?

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:54.840
 Yeah, I'm even cleaning Mary's Angora off it. That's how sure I am.

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:57.840
 Yeah, you are a rucking dog.

00:07:57.840 --> 00:07:59.840
 I don't think you better wear your blue-haired suit.

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:00.840
 Why not?

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:03.840
 Because the fur had your limit with all your hair.

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:04.840
 Evening, yeah?

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:05.840
 Sure.

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:07.840
 They told the truth, they had to have it for today.

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:08.840
 Tonight?

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:10.840
 Oh, boy.

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:11.840
 Hey, what's the matter?

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:12.840
 Oh, boy.

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:15.280
 Homer, you don't suppose that dinner is formal, do you?

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:16.320
 Little Pacito.

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:17.520
 Sure.

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:19.560
 And boy, my father didn't even think

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:21.760
 I was important not for good China.

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:24.760
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:33.680
 Dennis, would you let me up the back, please?

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:34.200
 Yes, mother.

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:36.040
 And look, why don't I do this?

00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:37.960
 Why don't I call all the restaurants in town

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:40.200
 and see us heading with me to reservation?

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:42.360
 Here, that's very foolish.

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:44.160
 and I get all the way.

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:47.120
 Well, could we hold this a little bit more, Mother?

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:50.640
 You know, I think that cleanness grunks this gown.

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:53.160
 Mother, why don't we admire you down over that labor?

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:54.860
 I'm much too boned here.

00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:56.200
 Oh, which reminds me?

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:58.280
 Your daughter and I've been discussing that evening,

00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:02.200
 down Gladys, and, well, we think it might be wise

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:04.440
 to sew on a little lace around the shoulders.

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:06.200
 Mother, I'm not calling you.

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:07.400
 We realize that.

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:08.400
 (audience laughing)

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:11.000
 That's why we thought some lace would add a great deal.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.400
 - But in my family, you know how easily you can't go.

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:16.760
 In a year or two, when you build up your resistance,

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:19.680
 we can take the light off and answer the phone.

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:21.240
 - Yes, ma'am.

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:22.240
 - Hello?

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:24.240
 - Oh, hi, glad I'm hearing you.

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:25.400
 - Hello, honey.

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:26.240
 - Lucky.

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:27.080
 - I have to say that sign here,

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:28.600
 not asking about sign up.

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:29.520
 - Bye, bye.

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:30.360
 - Hello?

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:31.200
 - Hello?

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:32.520
 - How are you?

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:34.080
 - Fine, how are you?

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:35.000
 - Fine.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.600
 I'll see what's exciting, hold on.

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:40.160
 - You're asking you a 632, wanna?

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:47.280
 Oh, I'm glad it's yes, I just wanted to know I never look forward to a new move. I can't I could you hold on?

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:50.480
 Are you sure?

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:59.040
 Oh

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:00.040
 You know.

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:01.040
 And I am better.

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:02.040
 Of course you did.

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:04.040
 I mean, I'm so glad you called.

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:05.040
 You are?

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:06.040
 Well, the...

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:08.040
 The rule of glad is I'm sorry.

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:11.040
 Well, what you might call a problem about dinner tonight.

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:12.040
 Problem?

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:15.040
 I mean, nothing's going wrong with you, am I?

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:17.040
 No, things you're fine and I am.

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:18.040
 That's fine.

00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:20.040
 How are they at yours?

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:21.040
 Fine.

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:24.040
 I mean, would you mind very much if I wore a maroon tie?

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:26.040
 I'm a maroon tie?

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:30.600
 in my tuxedo. She was somehow my black when things who have disappeared come point like

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:33.560
 tuxedo? You were a tuxedo tonight?

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:34.600
 Then you want me to?

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:37.400
 Well, yes, that's a good idea.

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:37.560
 Well...

00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:41.240
 I'm gonna have to hurry and hang up, Mom. I think it's just say goodbye.

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:42.040
 Come on.

00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:46.200
 Mother! Mother, you have to go on that late on my evening down right away!

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:56.200
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:57.160
 Let's cross over.

00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:59.600
 Glad it's lived on this block.

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:05.000
 Homer, in a formal dinner, which sport do you use first?

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.520
 They have a more than one.

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:08.800
 Of course.

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:12.400
 Well, I start at the end and work hard my place.

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:13.400
 And that makes sense.

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:15.000
 And hey, Lisa, if you were moving,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000
 Did you get the business name special at the main sector in order to table the holder,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
 hamburger paradise?

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.000
 Well, where would you want?

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
 Well, I was concerned that it would be about like a good, solid bowl of soup.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
 But, in this, the rest would be heard.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.000
 I don't know.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000
 Oh, and here I am with a dollar 7.05 and I'd only have to eat it up.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
 Can you make this out?

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.000
 What is it?

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
 A menu I picked up from the purple goo.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:43.000
 Does this at the bottom say all new foods are salad and potatoes or salad or potatoes?

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.000
 Why aren't they?

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.840
 Oh, we haven't got time to fool around here.

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:49.200
 Gladys is half along.

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:53.360
 Yeah, so is that our moonlit going over in South Abby's?

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:54.360
 Our moonlit?

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:56.040
 And then we'll come with a few.

00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:58.040
 So are we.

00:11:58.040 --> 00:11:59.040
 So are we.

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:00.040
 Oh, gee.

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:01.040
 Hi, guys.

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:02.040
 I was just about to knock.

00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:05.040
 I saw you coming up to walk.

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:08.160
 Now, good for you, the person who wants to feed her.

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:10.160
 I do.

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:12.880
 You look pretty handsome yourself.

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:13.880
 Thank you.

00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:16.680
 Boy, that's some gown.

00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:19.680
 Wait a minute, here I go after I build up my resistance.

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:26.480
 I'm certainly looking forward to this evening.

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:31.280
 So am I. Well, here's my hat.

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:32.880
 You're closing it off?

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:35.480
 You don't think I should?

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:36.880
 I'm just going to go.

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:39.480
 I'll put a visor on the hall table to the time being.

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:42.480
 You're... Boy, I sure am hungry.

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:44.600
 - It's so mild. - Yes, sir.

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:47.720
 - Yeah. - Mmm, what's that I smell?

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:50.080
 - Smells so good. - Smells so good.

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:52.360
 Mmm, sure smells good.

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:56.200
 - Oh, that's taboo. - It is, I've never eaten any of you.

00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:58.200
 (crowd laughing)

00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:01.440
 - That's my tooth, you, Kelly. - First, huh?

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:03.920
 Oh, oh, you're...

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:04.920
 (crowd laughing)

00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:06.240
 - Yeah, honey.

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:07.960
 Would you like a glass of cinead with you?

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:09.680
 - Cinead with you? - My mother thought you might

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:13.380
 I've been before before before what?

00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:14.880
 Oh, excuse me, honey.

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:16.880
 I'm phone.

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:17.880
 Hello?

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:18.880
 And this is Linda Dolders.

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:19.880
 Can I see the head briefly?

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:20.880
 Yes, Linda Dolders.

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:21.880
 Let me see.

00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:22.880
 Let me see.

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:23.880
 Oh, it is.

00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:24.880
 Thanks, Linda.

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:25.880
 I've been in a living room.

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:26.880
 Hello, mother.

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:28.280
 Dear, your father and I are just about to leave some

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:29.280
 imagine houses.

00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:30.280
 Everything all right?

00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:31.280
 All right?

00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:32.280
 About dinner, I mean.

00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:37.280
 Why, why don't we have a start and eat yet, but they just serve the tomato juice.

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:38.280
 Staying in?

00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:39.280
 Sure.

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:41.880
 going into the dining room for the rest of it any minute now.

00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:43.980
 Well, have a good time and have a good day.

00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:44.780
 Yes, Mother?

00:13:44.780 --> 00:14:03.740
 And the dis

00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:06.340
 That's my aunt, maybe they're going to eat alone.

00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:07.660
 - We're going to eat alone?

00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:09.220
 - Oh, yeah.

00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:10.620
 - Is this the two of us?

00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:11.860
 - Yeah.

00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:13.220
 - Oh, boy.

00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:15.220
 (crowd laughing)

00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:16.420
 - You mean you're starting?

00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:18.900
 - Maybe I'm ready any time you are.

00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:19.900
 - That's good.

00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:21.380
 You're too hot.

00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:23.780
 (crowd laughing)

00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:25.860
 - You mean you want me to put on my hat?

00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:26.860
 (crowd laughing)

00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:28.660
 - That's good, you sure?

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:29.660
 - Oh, sure.

00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:33.460
 I just didn't realize it was going to be that formal.

00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:36.460
 (audience laughing)

00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:38.340
 I was real, this is the first room I've ever had

00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:41.260
 a formal dinner with any born in private.

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:42.860
 - Me too, I mean you don't.

00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:45.540
 - I'm practically honest, this is the first time

00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:47.500
 I've ever been invited out to dinner.

00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:48.700
 - Is that a thought?

00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:50.140
 (audience laughing)

00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:51.140
 Invited out.

00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:52.620
 - Tell me what's wrong.

00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:54.940
 - Why you thought you had to dinner, didn't you?

00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:55.780
 - Why, yeah.

00:14:55.780 --> 00:14:57.620
 You are.

00:14:57.620 --> 00:14:59.380
 - Oh, I thought I might have missed anything.

00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:07.380
 Goodness, this is going to be a night I'll never forget it will. I have a feeling it's gonna be one I'll never forget

00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:21.780
 I'm getting back to the troubles of Henry Olmer. They carved his date with Gladys Kretz began at 6 30

00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:28.180
 Henry jumped at the conclusion that he'd been invited to dinner. After a quick tomato juice cocktail however

00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:32.180
 He learns that planet is expected to be taken out to dinner.

00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:35.180
 The scene opens in the lobby of the Manchin house restaurant.

00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:36.180
 It is dinner time.

00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:37.180
 Now, take here.

00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:38.180
 Sister Aldridge, you're raising your voice.

00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:40.180
 I'm not raising it. Besides, I have ever right to.

00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:43.180
 I've been coming here to the Manchin house regularly for 15 years now,

00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:46.180
 and it is no time to tell me to have no cable.

00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:49.180
 Naturally, I'm very sorry, sir, but you should have phoned for reservation.

00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:51.180
 That's beside the voice. Let me speak to the headwaiter.

00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:54.180
 I'm the headwaiter. I mean, the headwaiter was of all hands.

00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:57.180
 He left six months ago. He couldn't have. But he did.

00:15:57.180 --> 00:15:58.000
 But he did.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.340
 Now, you're the one who's raising yours on.

00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:01.700
 I'm sorry.

00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:03.260
 You're all that I'm willing to give you a table.

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:04.700
 I'm anxious to.

00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:06.300
 But it'll have to be one on the side of the room.

00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:08.100
 But I can't sit behind those palms.

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:09.380
 I'm allergic to them.

00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:11.500
 To palm, the last time we sat behind them,

00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:13.860
 I sneeze from the fruit cup right through the strawberry

00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:14.860
 shortcake.

00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:17.260
 You said they have to give us a table in the middle of the room.

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:18.460
 Very well, Mr. Olgich.

00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:19.220
 Very well.

00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:20.940
 But you'll have to wait at least 40 minutes.

00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:21.780
 40 minutes?

00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:22.340
 At least.

00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:23.380
 Now, just a moment.

00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:25.060
 The browns will be here any second,

00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:26.140
 and they're counting on us.

00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:27.060
 So it may be arranged.

00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:28.060
 I'm sorry.

00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:29.060
 Sorry.

00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:32.060
 After we've been coming here for 50 years, all you can say is you're sorry.

00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:33.060
 Alex, please.

00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:34.060
 You're raising your voice.

 [MUSIC]

00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:40.060
 Hey, we're not really going to have dinner here in the morning.

00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:48.060
 We might.

00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:53.060
 I mean, that depends on whether you happen to see my mother and father in the dining room.

00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:54.060
 Good evening, sir.

00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:55.060
 Just you.

00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:56.060
 Could I speak to the head waiter?

00:16:56.060 --> 00:16:59.840
 I'm afraid not he went home about an hour ago with a very severe headache

00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:03.680
 Well, glad if you mind if I talk to the waiter for one second

00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:08.940
 No, excuse me look waiter. Do you happen to know my mother and father?

00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:11.100
 I'm not sure I've had a pleasure well

00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:18.220
 They're eating here tonight. See I thought under the circumstance as they might like to have a join them and put everything on one

00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:24.900
 I'll only be a second glatter a young man. What's your parents look like look like?

00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:26.900
 I've never seen my grandmother.

00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:30.900
 I'll tell you, my mother looks like life.

00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:32.900
 Have you ever seen my grandmother?

00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:34.900
 No, it's not.

00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:35.900
 That's too bad.

00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:37.900
 They're the image of each other.

00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:40.900
 I'm afraid I can't help you, son.

00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:42.900
 Hey, Gladys, what are you doing at that table?

00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:43.900
 I was swinging out the car.

00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:45.900
 I'm going to get a gun, hold it.

00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:47.900
 Here, I've got to know you fine.

00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:49.900
 Gladys, my goodness is, look at these places.

00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:51.900
 I think you're sad.

00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:53.900

 Someone calling me.

00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:00.900
 It's me.

00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:01.900
 You'll go by the door, Wayne.

00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:02.900
 Oh, yes, sir.

00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:04.900
 Have you and the young lady decided on your order?

00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:07.900
 Why, if she's still having a little trouble making up her mind.

00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:10.900
 And while she is, I thought I'd ask you.

00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:12.900
 Do you have an easy credit plan?

00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:13.900
 [LAUGHTER]

00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:14.900
 Easy, credit.

 Yes.

00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:16.900
 I'm sorry.

00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:17.900
 I'm sorry.

00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:22.900
 - The easier the better.

00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:26.140
 No, I'm afraid not.

00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:27.380
 - Wrong.

00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:31.140
 Well, will you be taking on any help for the summer?

00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:32.700
 - Where it closed for the summer.

00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:33.540
 - Wrong.

00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:35.380
 - Yes, we usually did.

00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:36.220
 - Just look at that.

00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:37.060
 - You see my parents?

 - Where?

00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:43.060
 - Right next to the menu.

00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:44.540
 - Go away young man, go away.

00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:47.180
 - Excuse me.

 Please tell him he's touching the entire window.

 Homer, boy, am I glad I found you.

00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:56.180
 - Yes, can we just look at these prices?

00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:57.300
 - Homer, you haven't eaten all red.

00:18:57.300 --> 00:18:59.620
 - No, I'm setting up an old year.

00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:01.340
 Boy, you have to be a lady there.

00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:04.620
 - I know, and that's why you have to limit your dollar 75.

00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:06.020
 - Are you crazy, honey?

00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:07.260
 That's for my dinner.

00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:09.740
 - Homer, don't you want to save me from a terrible disgrace?

00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:12.100
 - Yeah, if it's gonna cost me a dollar 75.

00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:14.660
 I thought you were eating a brandy.

 Don't deny, but somehow I'm taking her here instead.

00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:20.260
 So Homer won't you please let me have that money.

00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:21.100

 Suppose I do this.

00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:37.780
 I'll be a part of my money.

 Say 75 says.

 That's all?

 That's all I can afford.

00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:44.100
 Stand back while I get out of my pocket.

00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:47.580
 $25.

00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:11.700
 So, Cian comes now with a first call.

00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:13.700
 Gladys, before he comes to die, swing one thing until you...

00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:14.700
 Here you are.

00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:16.700
 Oh, wait, or stay, ever.

00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:17.700
 I think...

00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:20.700
 I think I'd better have another little talk with you.

00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:21.700
 Privately.

00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:22.700
 Yes, sir.

00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:24.700
 But first, here's the check.

00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:25.700
 And the check?

00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:26.700
 Before we...

00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:27.700
 There you are.

00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:30.340
 That is halfway a couple of rows, quick.

00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:31.700
 Wait a minute.

00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:32.700
 This number of five.

00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:34.100
 I'm going to reach the butter.

00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:34.900
 What number, sir?

00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:36.500
 This one with the dollar sign in front of it.

00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:37.900
 The red queen pass the salary.

00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:38.400
 Yes, sir.

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:39.100
 That's a five.

00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:40.100
 Oh, boy.

00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:40.900
 Oh, but you did.

00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:43.300
 Oh, you put a box in your pocket, sir, again.

00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:43.800
 Oh, look.

00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:45.700
 Well, it is something I have to tell you.

00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:48.100
 There's something I have to tell you.

00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:49.500
 That Jack says.

00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:50.100
 Hey.

00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:50.600
 Hey.

00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:51.400
 I can't.

00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:52.900
 What's going on?

00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:54.100
 Oh, I'm hiding.

00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:55.700
 There's a note on the back that explains it.

00:22:55.700 --> 00:22:57.500
 Turn it over, Henry.

00:22:57.500 --> 00:22:59.500
 Well, do you win?

00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:01.500
 But what does it say?

00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:07.500
 Maybe in the future we'll all be a little less positive and a little more careful.

00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:09.500
 Who's there?

00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:11.500
 Nobody.

00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:13.500
 I'm just like you are.

00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:15.500
 Well, do you win?

00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:17.500
 Potter, is that you behind that palm?

00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:19.500
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:34.580
 Boy, you're going to need your back.

00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:35.080
 That's it.

00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:36.980
 It's going to cost me a pretty penny.

00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:38.660
 Homer costs you a pretty penny.

00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:40.860
 When we got it for free from my father,

00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:44.020
 I'm sure, but I'll have to pay and pay and pay.

00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:45.820
 Oh, well, what are you talking about?

00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:49.660
 He was angry so little that the man who was glad he was there.

00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:52.620
 Now he's so glad he'll ever put the bill for the movie.

00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:54.820
 He'll have a banana split for us again.

00:23:54.820 --> 00:23:57.060
 (buzzing)

00:23:57.060 --> 00:23:59.300
