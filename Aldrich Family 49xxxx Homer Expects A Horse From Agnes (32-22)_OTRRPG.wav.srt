 [Music]

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 Coming, Robin.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 [Applause]

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 Yes, it's the Oldridge family based on characters

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,600
 by Clifford Goldsmith and starring Edward Stone as Henry with Jackie Kelker's home.

7
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,000
 And now for the Aldridge family.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:48,400
 Typical teenage boys are too busy even to sit down and remember way back when.

9
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:52,200
 Like Henry Aldridge, they live only the exciting here and now,

10
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,000
 with only everything to look forward to.

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 It is late afternoon in the scene opens in to Haven's drugstore.

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 But, Agnes, aren't you even interested?

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 Of course not, Kathleen. Of course not.

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 Fasting up with Homer is the best thing that ever happened to me.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 It is?

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 What's Henry saying to Homer now?

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 Nothing.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 Mr. de Haven just delivered something to Homer.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 What?

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 A banana split.

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 He's gonna eat a banana split?

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 Kathleen is not supposed to. It makes him break out in bunks.

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 Now Henry's saying something.

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 He's leaning over and pointing his finger right in Homer's face.

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 What's Homer doing? He's eating it.

26
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 And his finger? No, the banana split.

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 Oh my goodness, what's the matter?

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 He did take a bite of it. The banana split?

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 No, Henry's finger.

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 He got it too close to the spool.

31
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 Now he's feeling the convincing Homer.

32
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 Why not that I'm the least bit interested?

33
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 Oh my goodness, Henry's coming back.

34
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 I'll let you decide, Kathleen.

35
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 Now let you decide.

36
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 Does the end of my finger look like a spoonful of banana split?

37
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 Why, of course it doesn't.

38
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 And that's a good example of how pig-headed Homer is.

39
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 Sure, Agnes.

40
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 And if you ask me, you're much better off without him.

41
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 I am.

42
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 After all the beautiful years they've been stuck together.

43
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 Sure.

44
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 Hey, did you explain that Agnes had no idea

45
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 that his home is red-boarding, she put the papery in.

46
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 Sure.

47
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 And we're just sitting there in the school cafeteria

48
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 without a bit of a identification on it.

49
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 And I thought... I thought...

50
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 Did you ask him what happened to his sense of humor?

51
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 Sure.

52
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 And you know what he said?

53
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,600
 - What do you say? - What?

54
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,440
 Huh?

55
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,600
 What?

56
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,600
 Huh?

57
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,440
 (audience laughing)

58
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,080
 I told you, Kathleen, I told you it was no use

59
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:26,920
 coming down here.

60
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:27,760
 Agnes, wait.

61
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,280
 And I wouldn't have if you hadn't pointed out

62
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,760
 a dimple like a fight with people.

63
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:33,120
 Agnes, we can't give up this easily.

64
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,120
 And we will have to go back and talk to him again.

65
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:35,960
 - But carefully, Harry.

66
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,320
 - Harry, we can't sit by and see our two best friends

67
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,840
 go over the dam.

68
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,680
 Go ahead.

69
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,080
 - Well, okay.

70
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,000
 Excuse me.

71
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,440
 - Just watch out for your finger this time.

72
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,600
 - Homer, excuse me, Charlie.

73
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,100
 Homer, old timer!

74
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,100
 Henry, aren't you ever gonna give up?

75
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,100
 (audience laughing)

76
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,400
 - Not a Homer.

77
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,800
 - I'm gonna do the Haven, another banana split.

78
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,100
 - Another one, Homer.

79
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:59,600
 Don't you think you ought to go easy on that stuff?

80
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,000
 - Henry, I'm no child.

81
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,400
 If I don't mind being a mess of bumps,

82
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,600
 she was who cares anyway.

83
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,600
 - Agnestah?

84
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,900
 - Sure, sure.

85
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:10,700
 - Or I mean to her as someone she can play jokes on.

86
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:13,200
 - No, Homer, she's very fond of you.

87
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,200
 - Fun.

88
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,100
 - Henry, there was so much pepper in that pudding

89
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:19,100
 When I got to French, I couldn't even say mercy, Vocoupe.

90
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:24,300
 Sure, but that's what it's like to have Agnes Fern, love, you know? Thanks.

91
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,600
 I can't afford to live that dangerously.

92
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,700
 Okay, all right. Okay.

93
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:31,100
 That's the way you feel. That's the way I feel.

94
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:33,100
 That's the way you feel. Okay.

95
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:36,600
 Only you can't blame Kathleen and I for being depressed.

96
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:40,300
 Gee, when you think of those wonderful times the four of us adds.

97
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,600
 Wonderful times?

98
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,800
 What wonderful times.

99
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:46,040
 She was how about that summer we all spent it like which I'm a clatching.

100
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,520
 Remember those picnics down by the water?

101
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,040
 A rowing parties in the moonlight?

102
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:51,880
 Yeah.

103
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,320
 Dancing on Agnes' veranda?

104
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,720
 Standing in our heads on the raft?

105
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,040
 Yeah, sure.

106
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:01,520
 And Henry the way Agnes visited me in the hospital every day?

107
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,240
 Hospital?

108
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,840
 Don't you remember I had that bad case of poison in the ivy?

109
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,360
 Well why, I'm a wise guy.

110
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,640
 Put it in my bed to play a joke on me.

111
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,080
 - Son of a joke. - Homer.

112
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,640
 Boy, I scratched for weeks.

113
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,120
 Homer, there's a perfect example of how you exaggerate things.

114
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,360
 Agnes didn't even know it was poison ivy.

115
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,360
 Agnes?

116
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,360
 No, she thought it was skark cabbage.

117
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,800
 I was Agnes who did it.

118
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,800
 You mean he didn't know?

119
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,760
 I can tell her to go jump in like what you're mclatching.

120
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,760
 Homer, you mean nothing do.

121
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:34,160
 But Homer, you may be throwing away someone who could share your old age.

122
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,400
 Tell me if I sit to Agnes, this is a good chance I may never reach my old age.

123
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:46,040
 [Music]

124
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,600
 Hold the box straight, Henry.

125
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,840
 Gee, Agnes, I think you're foolish to throw up the sponge like this.

126
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:56,600
 Listen, Henry. If Homer feels the way he does, and I feel the way I do,

127
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:00,680
 well, she was, why sit around with a lamp in my window? You know what I mean?

128
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,680
 Sure only you don't.

129
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,920
 Gee. She sure was cute, though.

130
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,920
 'Cause that postcard he sent me when you booked

131
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,720
 that trip to Washington.

132
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,120
 Put a circle around the room where you slept.

133
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:11,960
 - That's our room?

134
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,520
 - That's what it says.

135
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,060
 - Geez, my memory serves me, Agnes.

136
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:16,720
 That's the elevator shaft.

137
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,120
 - His next cue.

138
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,120
 Poor Homer didn't even know where he slept.

139
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,720
 Put him in the box with the rest of the junk Henry.

140
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,560
 And here, here's that cupidow we wanted the carnival.

141
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,000
 - You're returning that too?

142
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,840
 - Why not?

143
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,880
 - But you wanted.

144
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,920
 You were the one who hit the bell with a sledgehammer

145
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,760
 four times in a row.

146
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,760
 That's why I wanted to have him.

147
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,760
 She, you're the first thing he ever gave me.

148
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,720
 It's swimming medally, gotten camped.

149
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,000
 Oh, yeah.

150
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,760
 He nearly drowned winning.

151
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,600
 That's fine.

152
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,480
 I was never so touched.

153
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,920
 Gee, Agnes.

154
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:51,120
 Gee, I'm certainly sorry you've had to end this way.

155
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:51,840
 Agnes?

156
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:52,600
 Yes, mother?

157
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,800
 Could I see you for a moment?

158
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,400
 Sure.

159
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,280
 Excuse me, Agnes.

160
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,160
 I'll be getting everything together.

161
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,200
 OK.

162
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,080
 Yes, mother?

163
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,000
 Dear, I put up some hot milk for you.

164
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,720
 Hot milk?

165
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,880
 Yes, dear, with butter.

166
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,320
 It'll make you feel a great deal better.

167
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,120
 But mother, I'm not supposed to feel better.

168
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,400
 At a time like this, I'm supposed to feel miserable.

169
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,120
 Dear, I don't think that's necessary at all.

170
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,200
 Why, look at the way your father took the news at home

171
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,040
 or wouldn't be coming over anymore.

172
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,840
 He just swallowed his disappointment

173
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,760
 and actually managed to smile.

174
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,600
 He did?

175
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,080
 He even laughed.

176
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,640
 Incidentally, dear, we heard from your uncle Clifford

177
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,600
 in Arizona.

178
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,440
 And do you know what he's sending you?

179
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,520
 Mother, not one of his horses.

180
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,680
 Agnes, he spends a great deal of time on them.

181
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,120
 He was in my condition.

182
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:35,520
 you think he'd come across with a present I can use instead of a heart he draws on

183
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,520
 his typewriter.

184
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,320
 Dear, in some circles, they're very highly put off.

185
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,320
 Agnes, I'm about ready to leave.

186
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,520
 Thanks, honey, Henry.

187
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,320
 I'll see if you're a male kiss boy.

188
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,420
 Mother, I beg of you.

189
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:48,720
 Boy, will Nell Polone make me think of Homer more.

190
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,120
 Is there anything else you want to send back to Homer?

191
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,020
 No.

192
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,620
 Boy, if that doesn't make a whole thing complete.

193
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:55,420
 What does?

194
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:57,620
 My uncle's sending me one of his darn horses.

195
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,620
 Oh, boy, is that right?

196
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:00,920
 And listen, Henry.

197
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,520
 Shake his hand, will you?

198
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,420
 I don't even know your uncle.

199
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:05,620
 I mean, Homer.

200
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:07,720
 And just tell him there's no hard feeling, see?

201
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,420
 There isn't.

202
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:09,520
 Not a bit.

203
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,720
 And to prove it, you know what?

204
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,220
 What?

205
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:14,120
 Tell Homer if he wants to, we can keep my boxing gloves.

206
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:23,320
 Who was that on the phone, Alice?

207
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:26,920
 Elizabeth Brown, Sam, and she's very upset about Homer.

208
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,320
 That's understandable.

209
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,520
 What is it this time?

210
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,120
 Well, dear, it seems he stopped eating.

211
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,480
 Homer? Yes.

212
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,520
 The same Homer that's been eating us out of house and homes?

213
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,680
 Sam, this is no time for jokes.

214
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,760
 Elizabeth is very much concerned.

215
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,120
 What are you going to do with that bowl?

216
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,480
 Take it into Homer.

217
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,400
 Boys, are you still in the living room?

218
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,240
 Yes, mother.

219
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,480
 And I want you to know that Homer's

220
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,960
 going to take that box off a coffee table just as soon

221
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,400
 as he's finished going through it.

222
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,840
 I don't mind the box.

223
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:55,240
 I'm just looking for a place to put this bowl of figs.

224
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,840
 Would you like one, Homer?

225
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,200
 No, Mrs. Aldrich.

226
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,960
 I don't feel much like a fig.

227
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,840
 Well, maybe you'll feel like one later.

228
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,040
 Sure, Mrs. Orange.

229
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,560
 Gee.

230
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,680
 Gee, so Agnes really sent back all these things, huh?

231
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,520
 Yeah.

232
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,920
 Although if you want me to, I'd be glad to return them to her.

233
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,960
 Why would I want you to do that?

234
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,080
 Boy.

235
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,600
 Boy, there's some very valuable junk in here

236
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,160
 that I've been dying to get back.

237
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:20,680
 They're in?

238
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,760
 Sure.

239
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,800
 Take the swimming medal, for instance.

240
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,960
 Do you realize I had a swim door near 20 yards to win it?

241
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,040
 -Sure, only about an minute or two. -(audience laughing)

242
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:33,080
 Homer, this is the wrong time to break up with Agnes.

243
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:36,480
 Did I tell you what Agnes' Uncle Clifford is sending her for...

244
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,280
 A horse!

245
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,040
 -A horse? -Sure.

246
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,800
 A horse? A horse?

247
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,520
 Who are you trying to kid, Henry?

248
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,040
 I heard it with my own two ears.

249
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,880
 Her Uncle Clifford is sending her one from Arizona.

250
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,760
 -Yeah. -Really?

251
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,480
 -Really? -No kidding.

252
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,760
 No kidding.

253
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,920
 Sheeee, a horse.

254
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,640
 So now don't you agree it's worth patching Agnes up?

255
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,440
 No.

256
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,160
 But Homer...

257
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,880
 Okay, okay. So she's got a horse.

258
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,800
 What's so wonderful about that?

259
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,600
 You didn't hear her call me up and offer to share it with me, did you?

260
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:07,920
 No.

261
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,320
 Or even offer me a ride?

262
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,680
 Or even a walk?

263
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,400
 Homer, you didn't call her her even.

264
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,920
 Can we stop taking her side?

265
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:18,520
 That's probably the reason she wanted to break up in the first place.

266
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:21,800
 Well, if a horse means more to her than...

267
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,040
 Well, she can have...

268
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:23,880
 Homer.

269
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,880
 And they ought to make a very nice couple at the spring dance.

270
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,880
 Hand me my box.

271
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:38,600
 Agnes, dear, it's such a nice afternoon.

272
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,200
 Why don't you glott and get a breath of air?

273
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,680
 Mother, if you don't mind, I'd much rather read.

274
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:47,880
 But, dear, besides, don't you think these blustery winter days are too much for my constitution?

275
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,880
 Agnes, I hardly--

276
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,880
 Listen to this.

277
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,880
 Yet who'll complain?

278
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,880
 My heart and I, and this abundant earth no doubt,

279
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,880
 as little room for things worn out.

280
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:02,880
 Did you ever hear anything that was more darn soul stirring?

281
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,880
 Agnes, what book is that?

282
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,880
 The poems of Elizabeth Barrett Brownie.

283
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,880
 My goodness.

284
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,880
 I'm feeling quite worn, Mother.

285
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,880
 I think I'll go upstairs and lie down in my wheelchair.

286
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,880
 I mean my bed.

287
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,880
 Agnes Lawson.

288
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,880
 Now please see who's at the door.

289
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,880
 Isn't my condition?

290
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,880
 Here, if you don't stop this nonsense,

291
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,880
 I'm going to give you a good dose of sulfur and molasses.

292
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,880
 I'm going, mother.

293
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,880
 There's a limit to how foolish you can get about southern life.

294
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:29,880
 Mother, I assure you, Homer has nothing to do with the way I feel.

295
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,880
 Oh.

296
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,880
 How do you do, Miss Lawson?

297
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,880
 How do you do, Mr. Browning?

298
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,880
 I mean, Mr. Brown.

299
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,880
 Aren't you step inside?

300
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,880
 You're very kind.

301
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,880
 It's just that you're creating a draft.

302
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,880
 Would you care to come into the living room?

303
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,880
 Well, I can just stay a minute.

304
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,880
 I just stopped by to return this box of things you gave Henry.

305
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,880
 You want me to have them back?

306
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,880
 That's not the point, Miss Lawson.

307
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:57,880
 I just don't want certain parties getting the idea I'm an Indian giver.

308
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,880
 Oh, well, thank you.

309
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,880
 You're welcome.

310
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:04,880
 Well...

311
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,880
 Well...

312
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,880
 How have you been?

313
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,880
 Okay.

314
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,880
 Except, gee, I don't know. I haven't been sleeping too well.

315
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,880
 - Yeah, neither of us. - Yeah?

316
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,880
 Yeah.

317
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,880
 I guess some germs been going around.

318
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,880
 [laughter]

319
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,880
 I guess he had.

320
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,880
 Well...

321
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:24,880
 Yeah?

322
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,880
 Well, I guess I better be going.

323
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:28,880
 Holler.

324
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:29,880
 Yes, Agnes.

325
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:30,880
 Darnit.

326
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,880
 Would you excuse me while I answer the door?

327
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,880
 Sure.

328
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,880
 And you try to remember what you were going to say.

329
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,880
 And do you have anything to eat around the house?

330
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,880
 I've suddenly gotten her over.

331
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,880
 Sure.

332
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:40,880
 In just a minute.

333
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,880
 Hi, Kathleen.

334
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,880
 Agnes, I just heard the good news.

335
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,380
 I'm ready for Homer just to arrive.

336
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:47,380
 Homer?

337
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:48,380
 He's in the living room.

338
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:51,080
 I don't know what brought him around, but I have a feeling we're going to make up any

339
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,080
 minute.

340
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:55,880
 Agnes, Homer's one thing to get excited about, but do you really think he compares to a horse?

341
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:56,880
 In hot way.

342
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,880
 In any way.

343
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:58,880
 [LAUGHTER]

344
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,880
 My goodness, but hey, me tell me you were getting one from your uncle Clifford.

345
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,880
 I almost dropped, you did.

346
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:04,880
 Uh-huh, right there in my veranda.

347
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,880
 You did?

348
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,880
 About a thing like one of my uncle's horses?

349
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,880
 Agnes, how can you be so glad they?

350
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,880
 What's so special about a picture of a horse?

351
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,880
 A picture?

352
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,880
 Agnes, the horse you're getting is a picture?

353
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,880
 Sure, drawn on a typewriter.

354
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,880
 Oh, my goodness!

355
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,880
 You mean you thought it was a real one?

356
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:23,880
 What did you say?

357
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,880
 They did.

358
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,880
 They thought...

359
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,880
 Wait a minute!

360
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,880
 Agnes, what's wrong?

361
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,880
 So fast.

362
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,880
 So that's why Homer came sneaking back.

363
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,880
 I had my Benedict Arnold.

364
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,880
 I just...

365
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,880
 You and Homer came around because he saw how Kathleen...

366
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,880
 Homer!

367
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,880
 What are you gonna do?

368
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,380
 I'm gonna get even. That's what I'm gonna do.

369
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:45,880
 Homer!

370
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,880
 What are you calling me, Agnes?

371
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,880
 Yes, Homer, doll.

372
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:50,880
 What's that?

373
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,880
 I've been thinking Homer. We don't want to fight, do we?

374
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,880
 Boy, especially now that I'm getting a horse.

375
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:57,880
 A horse?

376
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:58,880
 You knew I was getting one?

377
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,880
 Boy, I've heard rumors.

378
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,880
 That's what I saw.

379
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,880
 In honor of our making up, you know what?

380
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:08,880
 I'm gonna write to my Uncle Clifford and ask him to send you one of his horses too.

381
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,880
 What?

382
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,880
 Agnes!

383
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,880
 Haffling, it's no more than he deserves.

384
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,880
 But, but, Gee, do you think you're sure?

385
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,880
 Why not?

386
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:18,880
 He's got more horses like that than he can give away.

387
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:19,880
 She, Agnes, Gee.

388
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,880
 Is it a deal?

389
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:22,880
 Sure.

390
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:27,880
 And Agnes, I want you to know I've never seen anyone with a nicer nature.

391
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:49,880
 [Music]

392
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:52,880
 I'm now getting back to the troubles of Henry Alberts.

393
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:58,880
 Agnes correctly guessing that Homer made up with her because he thought she was getting a real horse.

394
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:08,880
 It's now getting even. She told Homer he too would get a horse from a uncle, but what she didn't tell him is that the horse in question is a picture drawn on a typewriter.

395
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,880
 It is the next day in the scene opens in Homer's garage.

396
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,880
 Have you got the tape measure against the edge of the wall, Henry?

397
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,880
 Sure, start stretching it toward the other wall.

398
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:18,880
 Okay.

399
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:25,880
 Boy, Henry, can't you just see us in our boots and saddles galloping off into the sunset on Whitey?

400
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:26,880
 Whitey?

401
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,880
 That's what I'm gonna call my horse.

402
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,880
 Suppose he's black.

403
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:31,880
 I'll call him dusty.

404
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:34,880
 Have you got the tape to the other wall?

405
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,880
 Not yet. This post is in a way.

406
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:37,880
 Go around it.

407
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:38,880
 Around it?

408
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,880
 We'll never find out how wide my garage is by going around post.

409
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,880
 Sure you will, huh? When you get to the other wall, take off a foot.

410
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,880
 Oh, okay.

411
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,880
 No, my father's car is in the way.

412
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,880
 Well, go over it.

413
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:52,880
 Over it?

414
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,880
 Yeah, and subtract another foot.

415
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,880
 Okay.

416
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,880
 How wide does it say the garages?

417
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,880
 I'm putting the hand.

418
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,880
 I'm 12 and a half.

419
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,880
 I was looking at the wrong side of the table.

420
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:11,880
 12 and a half last two feet for the post and car last another two feet for lawnmowers, barrels and stuff.

421
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:15,280
 Oh, that leaves only two feet for the horse.

422
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,680
 That isn't enough room.

423
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,380
 Even if it's a small horse?

424
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:19,380
 I know, but--

425
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:20,880
 How big is a small horse?

426
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,880
 Homer, it still isn't enough room.

427
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,880
 What do I do?

428
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,380
 This is the only place where I can keep spotty.

429
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:27,380
 Spotty?

430
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:31,380
 That's why I'm going to call him if he comes in two different colors.

431
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:34,380
 Who's in there?

432
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:35,380
 Gee whiz.

433
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:36,380
 Hi, Father.

434
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:37,880
 Homer, your son.

435
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,380
 That's what I thought.

436
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:40,880
 It'll do you no good to hide.

437
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:46,260
 From why and it'll do you know good to play innocent either didn't I ask you to rake the leaves nearly a week ago?

438
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:49,960
 Wait, I believe the subject did come up and idle conversation

439
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:53,960
 Oh my grab that rake off the wall and start sure father

440
00:15:53,960 --> 00:16:00,200
 Boy if a father asks a son to do something that's one thing that should come before everything else if the son's a son

441
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:05,040
 And a father's his father and I want you to feel his freedom come to me as you want me to come to you

442
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:10,400
 Don't you oh my what are you up to he looks like he's up to something mr. Brown

443
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:14,080
 He does father. I don't want you answer right off

444
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:19,420
 But would it be too much trouble to move certain things out of the garage so I could move a certain thing

445
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:21,820
 Move out of what certain things right?

446
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:26,080
 Your car say and keep it in the driveway

447
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:31,900
 Absolutely not you promise not answer right off. Oh, but you realize what leaving it in the driveway

448
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:35,020
 We'll do to my cars finish, but if I have to leave my horse outside

449
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:39,980
 So I think what it'll do to his finish horse. Did I say horse horse father?

450
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:41,620
 before you close your mind.

451
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:43,380
 Would you consider this angle?

452
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:45,580
 You can't give a horse another coat of pain.

453
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:55,540
 The mother was just a joke.

454
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:56,500
 Very well, dear.

455
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,660
 If you want Homer to hate you for the rest of his life,

456
00:16:58,660 --> 00:16:59,980
 it's no concern of mine.

457
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:01,940
 He'll hate me when it's so funny.

458
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:04,260
 Agnes, Homer isn't going to think it's funny.

459
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:05,100
 No.

460
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:08,060
 Well, I suppose I better tell him that it's all a big joke

461
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,660
 and that I don't expect a real horse.

462
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:12,260
 - Agnes, he'll explode. - He will, of course.

463
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:14,980
 Well, couldn't I say Uncle Clifford's had a...

464
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:17,620
 a crock failure and ran out of horses.

465
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,180
 You're going to lie?

466
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:22,820
 Good mother, if I can't tell the truth and I can't lie, what can I do?

467
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:26,780
 Agnes, this is your problem. I wash my hands of the whole thing.

468
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,820
 [music playing]

469
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:36,100
 I'm sorry, Agnes, but I don't think I could.

470
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,100
 She was.

471
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,100
 Why not?

472
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,600
 I'm not asking Sheila to give up her career.

473
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,600
 I know, but the thing.

474
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,900
 All I want you to do is render.

475
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,700
 Tell me when she's through pulling your junk wagon.

476
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:48,900
 Well, the fact of the matter is, Agnes, Sheila's just not the kind of a horse to take to a saddle.

477
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:49,900
 She's not?

478
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,500
 That goes a real outlaw.

479
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,900
 But she pulls your junk wagon.

480
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,600
 Well, that's something else again.

481
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,600
 Besides, she's getting along.

482
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,400
 When it comes to horses, Sheila ain't no chicken.

483
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,600
 Oh, sure, but I retired a year ago only.

484
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,300
 She enjoys her work, so...

485
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,100
 But, gosh!

486
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:08,100
 Oh, she loves to hear them bells jingle.

487
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,600
 Oh, God, I have to get a horse.

488
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,400
 If I don't, I'll lose homework permanently.

489
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,100
 That's bad, is it?

490
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,100
 I'll say.

491
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,300
 Well, now let's sing.

492
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:19,100
 Say, tell you who my do.

493
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,100
 Yes, God's who?

494
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:23,100
 'Cause he wouldn't be entirely up to specification.

495
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,100
 Oh.

496
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,400
 Although with little imagination,

497
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,100
 he might be just what you want.

498
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:27,600
 God!

499
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,100
 What?

500
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,100
 Whoa!

501
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,680
 (upbeat music)

502
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:40,820
 Do you need any help up there, father?

503
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,460
 Father?

504
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:45,120
 Gee, it's your gonna be a swell shed.

505
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,860
 And I certainly wanna thank you for your cooperation.

506
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:50,360
 Father?

507
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,160
 Father, what are you doing now?

508
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,060
 Shingling.

509
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:53,900
 Why?

510
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:56,300
 Shingling, shingling, and shut up!

511
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,940
 (audience laughing)

512
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:58,860
 Yes?

513
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,340
 Here's a glass of water, Will.

514
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:01,260
 Yes.

515
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:02,420
 Step back.

516
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:03,780
 I'm coming down the ladder.

517
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:06,140
 Homer, I just came from the Centerboat Feed Company

518
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:07,460
 and they want $9.

519
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:08,300
 Mm-hmm.

520
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,140
 For what?

521
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:09,980
 A sack of oats.

522
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:10,980
 For just one sack?

523
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:13,260
 Although these are the best you can get, Mr. Brown.

524
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,580
 They're not only nutritious.

525
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:15,900
 They're delicious, too.

526
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:16,740
 You don't say.

527
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:17,420
 Yeah?

528
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:19,100
 I even brought along a sample.

529
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:19,860
 Mm.

530
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:20,860
 They are delicious.

531
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:21,360
 Homer!

532
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,020
 [LAUGHTER]

533
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:25,220
 You don't even know that it was sugar.

534
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:27,180
 Mother, do you have any cream in the house?

535
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:27,680
 Yes.

536
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,440
 You spoil your dinner.

537
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,080
 And if you're bothered by the tongue, they're even cheaper.

538
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,040
 A tongue?

539
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,040
 Henry, you buy just one sack.

540
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,120
 Yes, Mr. Brown, I'll go down right now.

541
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,040
 And Homer, it's coming out of your allowance.

542
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:39,880
 Moring?

543
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,320
 This family costs me enough without my having to shell out

544
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,480
 for anything that eats like a horse.

545
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,920
 Now step aside, while I go back up the ladder.

546
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,320
 Hi, everybody!

547
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,720
 Well, Chiwiz, it's Adam.

548
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,720
 What?

549
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,920
 What's that cheese leading?

550
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,760
 So, before you say anything, remember, it's time to do the job.

551
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,560
 What is?

552
00:19:56,560 --> 00:20:00,560
 But when I realized you had your heart set, I couldn't disappoint you.

553
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:03,560
 - That's the best thing. - I'm afraid this is the best I can do.

554
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,560
 His name's Otis and he's a very good friend of Sheila.

555
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,560
 - Yes, but... - He's not an outlaw or anything.

556
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:10,560
 Gee, so gentle sometimes he doesn't move at all.

557
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:13,560
 And you can have him every afternoon when he's through delivering vegetables.

558
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:17,560
 - Thanks, Jim. - This is what you're giving me.

559
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,560
 - Homer. - This?

560
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,560
 Homer, there's no need to take that attitude.

561
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,560
 A mule is as much a horse as any.

562
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:25,320
 (dramatic music)

563
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:34,260
 - Come on in and have a soda on me, homeroom time.

564
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:37,560
 - Oh, Henry, a darn old Mothys new.

565
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,400
 - How are you?

566
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,960
 - You're just getting upset over nothing.

567
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,640
 You know what my father's gonna do with that stably built?

568
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,040
 Turn it into a wood shed.

569
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,080
 - Yeah? - Yeah.

570
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,400
 - And you know who's gonna have to chop

571
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,520
 enough wood to fill with me?

572
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,360
 - Oh.

573
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,400
 - A sack of oats.

574
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,400
 What do I do with that?

575
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,400
 Here, here's a booth over here.

576
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,400
 Oh, gee whiz.

577
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,400
 Agnes.

578
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,400
 What do you want?

579
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,400
 What are you doing with that lampag?

580
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,400
 What do you think?

581
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,400
 I'm scratching out this heart with our names on the lampshade.

582
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,400
 You are?

583
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,400
 After what you said to me in your backyard, I never want to have another thing to do with you.

584
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,400
 Even on a lampshade.

585
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,400
 Well, same here.

586
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,400
 But if anyone's crossing that out, it's me.

587
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,400
 How many of us have this lampag?

588
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,400
 I came in all the way.

589
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,400
 Oh, my.

590
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,400
 And this quam.

591
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,400
 How is this?

592
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,400
 Oh boy!

593
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,400
 You broke it!

594
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,400
 That's all that.

595
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,400
 Homer sit down next to me quick and watch for.

596
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,400
 Do you want Mr. Dehaven to notice it's broken?

597
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,400
 No.

598
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,400
 What do we do?

599
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,400
 We'll have to get a fix somehow.

600
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,400
 We...

601
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,400
 You and I...

602
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,400
 I and you...

603
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,400
 Let's go about that.

604
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:41,400
 Listen, we can't desert each other when we're in common danger, Kenley.

605
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,400
 No.

606
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,400
 Let's call it temporary truths.

607
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,400
 I guess it makes sense.

608
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,400
 Sure it does Homer.

609
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,400
 Oh boy.

610
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,400
 Thanks.

611
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,000
 I'm going to show you holding my hand.

612
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,700
 I'm just trying to hide the lamp with my sleeve.

613
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:54,700
 Oh.

614
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:55,700
 In a way.

615
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:56,700
 Oh.

616
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:57,700
 Hold her.

617
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:01,600
 Would you like to make the truth more of the temporary?

618
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,600
 Boy.

619
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,600
 Gee, sure.

620
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,600
 Oh, her.

621
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:09,600
 Just to make it official, would you like to...to...

622
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,800
 Oh boy, would I?

623
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,800
 Oh boy.

624
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,800
 Oh boy.

 Oh boy.

 (audience laughing)

627
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,800
 - Miss Holler, you can have my apple-copper's picture of that heart.

628
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,800
 - I can...

629
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:27,800
 - In that case, would you have any use for a sack of oats?
