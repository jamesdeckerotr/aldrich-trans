1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 It's the Aldrich family.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 The Aldrich family presented by the Jell-O family.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 J-E-L-L-O!

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 Ooh!

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 Oh!

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 There it is!

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 Oh, there it is!

8
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 We'll sing!

9
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 Well, I'll take it, my dear little talking people, are all set to hear the Aldrich family.

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 Do, do, do, do, do, do!

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.

12
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 And just think, here we are all the way out in Hollywood.

13
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 And Henry is all the way out on the limb!

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 Aha!

15
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 No.

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 I mean, we're here on the West Coast, and Henry is there on the East Coast.

17
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 And we're both in love with world famous jello desserts.

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 Never mind.

19
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 Never mind.

20
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 Everybody goes for the jello family.

21
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 Oh, Meredith, we dearly love jello puddings.

22
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 They come in three delicious flavors.

23
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 Everybody loves those smooth as cream jello puddings.

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 And we dearly love jello tapioca pudding too.

25
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 Everybody loves the pudding with a personality.

26
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 Personality and dimples

27
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 That's right, and don't forget forget forget Jell-o the world's most famous shimmering dessert

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,560
 Well, that is what I meant. I forget Jell-o with those big red letters on the box

29
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,800
 No, no, no, you don't understand I forget those six delicious flavors

30
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,860
 Wish I were dead

31
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:16,860
 Got a better idea

32
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,420
 You be strawberry.

33
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:19,980
 OK, I'll be strawberry.

34
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:21,540
 [SINGING]

35
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:22,540
 Cherry, we will--

36
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:23,540
 Orange, we will--

37
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:24,540
 Lemon, you will--

38
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:27,540
 Blue.

39
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,380
 J-E-L-L.

40
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:32,300
 Oh, would you like it?

41
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,060
 No, not but--

42
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:34,560
 Uh-uh.

43
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,380
 Oh, B-T-I.

44
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:40,660
 Hey, look at that clock.

45
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:42,540
 It's time for--

46
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:45,620
 The Oldridge family, based on characters originated

47
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:51,260
 by Clifford Goldsmith and starring Ezra Stone as Henry with Jackie Kalk as Homer.

48
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:54,860
 Henry! Henry Oldridge!

49
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:55,860
 Coming, mother!

50
00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:14,820
 As every grown-up knows, a teenage boy never has to look around for interesting problems

51
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:21,220
 to solve, the problems always seem to come looking for the boy. A new one every day.

52
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:27,540
 So it is with Henry Aldrich. The scene opens in the Aldrich front hall. It is early evening.

53
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,540
 But Kathleen...

54
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:31,900
 "Henry, you don't have to explain. I don't own you."

55
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:36,020
 Kathleen, the only reason I broke our date last night was I thought I ought to take a

56
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:41,260
 load off Mizzetti's mind. You know, and get the difference between my subjunctive mood

57
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:43,620
 and my pastploo perfect under my belt.

58
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:44,620
 You don't say.

59
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:45,620
 Sure.

60
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:48,180
 And what's Geraldine love got to do with your past blue perfect?

61
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:49,380
 Oh boy.

62
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:51,100
 How did you find out about her?

63
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,460
 I have my sources, Henry.

64
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:53,740
 I have my sources.

65
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:59,460
 Well, look, in connection with Geraldine, could I explain one thing, Kathleen?

66
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:00,660
 You really needn't bother.

67
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,180
 I don't know, you.

68
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:06,220
 But the only reason I happened to be at her house last night was because she phoned me

69
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:10,340
 and said, "Henry, what's your assignment and why don't we do it together?"

70
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:11,860
 She phoned you?

71
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:14,160
 Sure, and there's really no harm done.

72
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:17,200
 We can see that Walter Pigeon picture tonight.

73
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,700
 - We can. - Sure.

74
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,360
 - Don't you have to study your past poo perfect?

75
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,360
 - Oh no, I've got it down, perfect.

76
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,360
 - All right, Henry, but remember, I don't own you.

77
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,800
 - Edra. - I'm on the phone, Father.

78
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,800
 - I know you are.

79
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,320
 Will you come in the living room, please?

80
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,880
 - Yes, Father.

81
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,720
 Kathleen, could you hang on for just one short second?

82
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,480
 - I'm hanging, Henry.

83
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:40,200
 - Edra. - I'm coming, Father.

84
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,160
 Is there something you wanted to say to I?

85
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,000
 - There is.

86
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,720
 - Did I hear you making plans to take Kathleen

87
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,560
 to the movie tonight?

88
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,320
 - Why, if you're thinking I should be studying instead,

89
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,560
 did I tell you about Miss Eddie?

90
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,400
 She said she never saw anybody with a better grasp

91
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,240
 of his past blue perfect.

92
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,760
 - I'm not referring to your past blue perfect.

93
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,200
 - Dear, have you forgotten you were sitting

94
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,840
 with the Ferguson baby tonight?

95
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,160
 - Well, I am?

96
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,960
 - Of course, you promised.

97
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:09,800
 - Well, gee, I don't like to argue, father, but no, I didn't.

98
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,160
 What your father means is he promised for you.

99
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:16,680
 But father, don't you think you should have told me before I raised Kathleen's hopes about going to the movies?

100
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:20,600
 Henry, I did tell you. I called you through the bathroom door this morning.

101
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,080
 Father, I give you my word. I didn't hear you.

102
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,680
 That'll teach you not to take a shower at the top of your lungs.

103
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,240
 But I...

104
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,760
 Henry, you'll be getting paid 25 cents an hour.

105
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,760
 Who wants money?

106
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,520
 Well, I must say that's a novel attitude.

107
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:39,560
 Yeah, the Ferguson's are counting on your babysitting for them tonight so that they can play bridge with us.

108
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,240
 Well couldn't they get someone else?

109
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,780
 Now dear you know sitters are almost impossible to get now a day.

110
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:48,280
 But Kathleen's looking forward to seeing Walter Pigeon die twice.

111
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,680
 Twice?

112
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,560
 Sure.

113
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,280
 Wants himself and wants his son.

114
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,320
 So do you think it's fair to deprive her of an experience like that?

115
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,040
 Henry you can go another time.

116
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,200
 But this is the last night it's playing and

117
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:06,200
 gee right this minute Kathleen's out there in the hall hanging in midair.

118
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,040
 Henry just explained the situation to her. She'll understand.

119
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:12,320
 There isn't a thing that can't be explained if it's done intelligent.

120
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,600
 I know, but father...

121
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,600
 Henry, I've given my word to the Ferguson's and the least you can do is to keep it.

122
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,080
 No, dear, hadn't you better get back to Kathleen.

123
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,080
 Yes, mother.

124
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:26,160
 But, gee, I don't know how she'll take being done out of water pigeon two nights in a row.

125
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,680
 I'm sure she'll survive.

126
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:33,240
 Hello? Kathleen?

127
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,520
 Henry, I've been thinking, why are we trying to make the early show?

128
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,760
 In case there are some good parts you want to see over.

129
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:42,760
 Uh, some good parts to see over? Well, I'll tell you.

130
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,760
 Mr. I started putting on my coat.

131
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:49,760
 Well, Kathleen, don't you think seeing Walter Pigeon die four times in one night might be overdoing it?

132
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,760
 What's that?

133
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,760
 Well, Gia, a thing like that could depress you for weeks.

134
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,760
 Henry, are you packing out again?

135
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:57,760
 Kathleen, I'm not backing out exactly.

136
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,760
 Henry, you don't have to explain.

137
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,760
 Kathleen, I don't own you.

138
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:05,760
 Kathleen, it's just that I have an obligation to a member of my family.

139
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,760
 Oh.

140
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,760
 Oh, why?

141
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,120
 I understand.

142
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,120
 You do?

143
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,120
 Certainly.

144
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,320
 If your assistant Mary wants you to walk her girlfriend Daisy Harper home again, why

145
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,560
 natural you can't be rude?

146
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:21,520
 Kathleen in connection with Daisy that night, can I explain one thing?

147
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,200
 That's alright Henry.

148
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,720
 Maybe Charlie Clark isn't as busy tonight as you are.

149
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,720
 Charlie Clark?

150
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,720
 No, wait a minute.

151
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,720
 Kathleen, wait a minute.

152
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,640
 Look, suppose I take another crack at my father.

153
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,600
 You mean about going to the movie?

154
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,600
 Sure.

155
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:38,600
 Was there isn't anything that can't be explained if it's done intelligently?

156
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:50,600
 Sam, did Henry leave for the Ferguson's yet?

157
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,600
 Yes, Alice, about ten minutes ago.

158
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:56,600
 Well, dear, I just want you to know I think you were right in being firm with him.

159
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,600
 Thank you, Alice.

160
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:02,600
 But, dear, it wasn't entirely Henry's fault he didn't hear you tell him about babysitting.

161
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:06,800
 sitting. We're the ones who've insisted that he take a shower every morning.

162
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,600
 No, Alice.

163
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:12,120
 Sam, it certainly wouldn't have hurt to let him talk you out of it,

164
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,280
 intelligent way.

165
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:13,840
 But, dear.

166
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,520
 Why couldn't we call the Ferguson's and more or less suggest that we play

167
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,440
 bridge over there?

168
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:21,760
 Alice, we can't do that. And besides, I gave Henry permission to get a

169
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,960
 substitute, didn't I?

170
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,680
 Well, if the Ferguson's couldn't get anybody else to sit, how can Henry?

171
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:31,320
 Although, Sam, I think I know the very person.

172
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,120
 Who? Miss Hotchkiss.

173
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,120
 Miss Hotchkiss?

174
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,320
 You remember her dear, the nice little girl who used to sit with Henry.

175
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,520
 Alice, that was 15 years ago.

176
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,520
 I don't think we should overlook anyone, I'll phone her.

177
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,320
 Very well, Alice, if it'll help matters.

178
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,520
 You remember I'll number her?

179
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,520
 It's in the old address book in the telephone table here.

180
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,520
 Number, please.

181
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,520
 Just a moment, operator.

182
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,320
 See, Hotchkiss, Hotchkiss.

183
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,320
 Here it is.

184
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,320
 L-9-1-1.

185
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,720
 L-9-1-1.

186
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,320
 Alice!

187
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,320
 Yes, Sam?

188
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:02,400
 If you can't get Miss Hotchkiss, I know someone with a call.

189
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,200
 Who, dear?

190
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,200
 Hello.

191
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,400
 Hello, Miss Hotchkiss?

192
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,400
 Miss Hotchkiss.

193
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,880
 Why, yes, I used to be.

194
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,960
 You did?

195
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,240
 This is Mrs. Aldrich.

196
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,120
 Henry's mother?

197
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:11,920
 Yes.

198
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,240
 Well, my goodness.

199
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:13,880
 Hello.

200
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,240
 It's been so long.

201
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,520
 How's the baby?

202
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,480
 The baby?

203
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,880
 Why, he's fine.

204
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,840
 I still have that picture you gave me of him.

205
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,840
 Oh, he looks so cute lying there on that bear skin rug.

206
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,480
 Yes.

207
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:27,440
 Does he still giggle when you tickle him under the chin?

208
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,280
 To tell you the truth, I don't know.

209
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,280
 The reason I called, do you still do sitting?

210
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,780
 Oh yes, but it's with my own baby now.

211
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:39,080
 Your married? Congratulations when did it happen?

212
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:42,780
 Oh, ten years ago. Do you have another baby Mrs. Aldridge?

213
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:44,780
 Oh no, we stopped with Henry.

214
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:47,280
 It's for a friend.

215
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:50,580
 Well, I know somebody who might possibly be interested.

216
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:51,080
 You do?

217
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,080
 Although I'm not sure she's free tonight.

218
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:57,280
 Well, if she is, would you send it to Mrs. Ferguson's 97-seater road?

219
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,840
 All right, but don't count on it, Mrs. Allridge. Goodbye.

220
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,840
 Goodbye.

221
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,040
 Can you call Malice?

222
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:06,120
 No, Sam, and she didn't sound too encouraging about getting anybody else.

223
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,720
 In that case, let me have the phone.

224
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,640
 Number, please.

225
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,800
 Elm 227.

226
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,200
 Elm 227.

227
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,400
 Sam, why are you calling my sister Harriet?

228
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,000
 She's always said, Henry, is her favorite nephew.

229
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,600
 Now's a good time for her to prove it.

230
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,400
 Hello.

231
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,560
 Hello there, Harriet. This is Sam.

232
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,880
 It is? Well, hello.

233
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:22,880
 Hello.

234
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,080
 Sam Hall.

235
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,480
 Sam Allrich, your brother-in-law.

236
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,920
 Oh, that's Sam.

237
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,000
 Yes?

238
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,400
 Harriet, er...

239
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,320
 Harriet, we have a bit of a problem.

240
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:33,800
 Yes?

241
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,560
 Yes.

242
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,280
 You see, we invited Mr. and Mrs. Ferguson to play bridge tonight, and...

243
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,000
 Well, I was wondering if you could help out.

244
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,160
 I'd be glad to.

245
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:41,760
 You would?

246
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,800
 Of course, my bridge is as good as my casino, but I'll do the best I can.

247
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,400
 What's that?

248
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:51,560
 My goodness, do you realize this is the first time you've invited me to one of your bridge evenings, since you got married?

249
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,040
 Harriet?

250
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,200
 I'll be dressed in over there before you know it.

251
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:54,680
 Goodbye.

252
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,480
 Harriet, wait!

253
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,880
 You don't understand. Harriet?

254
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,180
 Well, that's a fine thing.

255
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,440
 Sam, is she going to do it?

256
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,280
 No.

257
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,580
 And Alice, where can we dig up three more hands?

258
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:20,980
 Well, that's a nice boy, Stevie. Just sit there.

259
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:23,180
 Hello? Hello, operator.

260
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:24,380
 I'm ringing your number.

261
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:28,380
 Well, could you please hurry? I don't think Stevie's too happy here on the couch.

262
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,380
 Oh, sir!

263
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:31,380
 Stevie, the baby.

264
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:35,380
 He wouldn't let me leave his room, so I had to bring him in here while I made the call.

265
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:36,380
 I'll ring your party again.

266
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:37,380
 Thanks.

267
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:40,380
 Nice, Stevie. You're doing fine.

268
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:42,380
 Hey, don't pull the fringe off that pillow.

269
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:45,380
 Colony Theater, Mr. Harris, the manager's speaking.

270
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:47,380
 Mr. Harris, this is Henry the oldridge.

271
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,380
 Henry, I'm busy taking tickets. What is it?

272
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:52,380
 Mr. Harris, what time does your last show start?

273
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:54,780
 - Nine five. - As soon as that?

274
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,720
 - That's right. - Mr. Harris,

275
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,980
 how do you feel about children?

276
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:01,720
 - I like them. - Gee, that's swell.

277
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,220
 - Although they're awfully messy at Saturday matinees.

278
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,360
 - Yeah, well look, how would you feel

279
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,020
 if a gentleman was to bring one tonight

280
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:10,360
 provided he was accompanied by a very reliable

281
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,660
 young lady named Kathleen Anderson?

282
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,660
 - Tonight, how old is this child?

283
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:17,400
 - Well, Gee, he must be at least as old as six.

284
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,400
 - Years? - Months.

285
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,200
 - Months. Goodbye, Henry.

286
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,040
 - Goodbye, Henry.

287
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,300
 - But Mr. Harris, wait, Kathleen,

288
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,700
 is anxious to see Walter Pridge

289
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:27,140
 and grow up to be his own son.

290
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:28,040
 - Where does that happen?

291
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,580
 - Well, right in your own theater.

292
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:30,680
 - You don't say.

293
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,860
 - Yeah, and she's waiting for me

294
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,800
 to pick her right up this very minute.

295
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,380
 - What's that, Mr. Dannams?

296
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:37,500
 Just drop your tickets in the box.

297
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,620
 Henry, I have to hang up, goodbye.

298
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:42,900
 - But Mr. Harris, well, gee, what?

299
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,420
 - Say Henry.

300
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:45,820
 - Homer, is that you?

301
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,420
 - Sure, my mother said you phone

302
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:48,980
 and said something about a movie.

303
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:51,240
 I'll say I did Homer, you've got to help me out.

304
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,240
 I'd be glad to.

305
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,500
 You will, boy.

306
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,380
 What's playing?

307
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,040
 What?

308
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,840
 Aren't you inviting me to the movies?

309
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,400
 No, Homer, what I want you to do is save my life

310
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:02,200
 and make 25 cents an hour at the same time.

311
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,360
 That sounds like a nice arrangement.

312
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,480
 What do I have to do?

313
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,360
 Sit.

314
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,360
 That's all?

315
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,680
 Sure.

316
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:11,880
 And keep an occasional eye on Stevie over there.

317
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:12,800
 That baby?

318
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,040
 Sure, will you do it?

319
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:17,080
 I'm sorry, him, but I have to think of the 440.

320
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,120
 What 440?

321
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,860
 that I'm running in our first indoor track meet tomorrow.

322
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,440
 - You're running in a track meet?

323
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,260
 - What's so incredible about that?

324
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:25,500
 I'm on the team.

325
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,520
 - Homer, you're water boy.

326
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,840
 - Not anymore.

327
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,760
 Toby Smith broke his ankle,

328
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,760
 and then Butch Welch failed his English exam,

329
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:35,400
 and the coach said the fates were against him anyway,

330
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,020
 and put me in.

331
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:39,840
 So I feel it's my duty to get all asleep I can.

332
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,960
 - But Homer, you were willing to go to the movie.

333
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:45,160
 - Can we the movies aware I sleep best?

334
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,000
 - I know only--

335
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 I've never run as far as 440 yards in my life. I'll need all my strength.

336
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 But what am I going to do about Kathleen Anderson and Walter Pigeon?

337
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 Why don't you take a run down to the Havens and get one of the other kids to sit for you?

338
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 You mean you'll stay here with a baby while I do?

339
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 Why?

340
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 Homer, you're a real pal.

341
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 When Henry, I'm no good at taking care of babies.

342
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 That's the beautiful part, Homer. Stevie practically takes care of himself. So long.

343
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 Well, Gee whiz.

344
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 Well, what could we forget about--

345
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 - Kuchiko Stevie, Kuchiko, look at Uncle Homer.

346
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,160
 (screaming)

347
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:27,820
 - Oh boy, don't cry Stevie, don't cry.

348
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,460
 Here play with my tie.

349
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:31,440
 You like that?

350
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:36,120
 - No wait a minute Stevie, let go of my nose.

351
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,460
 Don't you let go.

352
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:43,960
 - Oh boy, Stevie my nose is nothing to play with.

353
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,160
 How about a doll?

354
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,160
 Look at the funny face, Stevie.

355
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:52,160
 [SINGING]

356
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,160
 Stevie, would you like some music?

357
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:58,160
 Would you like me to play the player piano?

358
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,160
 Would you just wait while Uncle Homer sits down?

359
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,160
 You'll hear the pretty music.

360
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:09,160
 [SINGING]

361
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:13,160
 Well, Gee whiz, it worked.

362
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:24,160
 Come to me my melancholy baby, coddle.

363
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:40,160
 Well friends, here's a cheerful theme song coming up, "Jello for dessert"

364
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,560
 dessert, and say ever try jello pineapple mounds, you love them.

365
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:50,000
 Just dissolve one package of strawberry jello in two cups of hot can pineapple juice.

366
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,840
 Turn into individual molds and chill firm.

367
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:58,400
 Then unmold each one on top a slice of pineapple, grand looking, grand eating.

368
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:03,920
 For all six jello flavors, strawberry, raspberry, cherry, orange, lemon, and lime, taste so

369
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:08,280
 rich and good they make you think of the real ripe fruit itself.

370
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:15,280
 for Jell-O, America's favorite gelatin dessert.

371
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:25,240
 And now getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldrich.

372
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:30,360
 Henry invited Kathleen to the movies tonight and then learned that Mr. Aldrich had volunteered

373
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,880
 Henry's services as a babysitter.

374
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:38,000
 Now both Henry and his parents are trying desperately to dig up a substitute.

375
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,500
 The scene opens at Aunt Harriet's house.

376
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,500
 It is later that evening.

377
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,000
 Well, come in, Sam.

378
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 Hello, Harriet.

379
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,500
 Sam, you didn't have to rush over for me.

380
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,500
 I was just leaving.

381
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,500
 Yes.

382
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:51,200
 Well, the reason I came, Harriet.

383
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,200
 The reason I came.

384
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,700
 Sam, you're perspiring.

385
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,100
 Yes, I know.

386
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:59,600
 Harriet, when I phoned you tonight, you thought I meant bridge.

387
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,600
 What I actually phoned about was Henry.

388
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,600
 Henry?

389
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,600
 Your nephew.

390
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,400
 Henry's playing with us?

391
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,700
 No, that is, we're not playing at all.

392
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:14,500
 that is you're not other than is yes and well you mean you don't want me to

393
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:19,140
 play bridge no that is yes that is it isn't that we don't want to Harriet

394
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:24,460
 that's quite all right Sam I understand not Harriet don't get insulted I'm not

395
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:30,980
 insulted I can take criticism Sam no matter how wrong it is Harriet here's the

396
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:36,140
 deck of cards Sam now deal them out and just show me what's wrong with the way I

397
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:39,140
 I play bridge. Really Harry. Sam Aldrich deal.

398
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:53,140
 Henry, please stand to one side of the lobby you're blocking the theatre, Enthry.

399
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:57,140
 But Mr. Harris. No, Henry. I won't run the news reel over twice and that's final.

400
00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:02,140
 But I haven't been able to find anyone to replace home or how I ever get Kathleen here on time.

401
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:05,140
 I'm sorry, Henry, but I've had a hard day too.

402
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,140
 Sure, but--

403
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,140
 Where's my ticket-taker, God's sick?

404
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:10,540
 Then the porter doesn't show up and I have to back him to lobby myself.

405
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:14,740
 And then to top everything the popcorn machine started throwing popcorn all over the plate.

406
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:18,340
 Well, look, could you tell me what time the earthquake starts?

407
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:19,340
 Earthquake?

408
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:20,340
 There's one do?

409
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:22,140
 Sure, it's the way the picture opens.

410
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,140
 Oh.

411
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:26,140
 And right in the middle of it, Walter Pigeon dies for the first time.

412
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:27,300
 Wouldn't you know it?

413
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:30,980
 The first time in six years we've had an earthquake and I can't even get into my own theater to

414
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:31,980
 see it.

415
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,620
 Oh, I'll be darned.

416
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:34,620
 There's Willy.

417
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:37,500
 Excuse me. I'd be glad to. Ouch!

418
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,420
 Oh, she was. What now?

419
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:41,900
 Who hit me in the neck with this piece of popcorn?

420
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:44,620
 Well, I'll be... I thought I had that machine fixed.

421
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:47,660
 Willy? Hiya, Willy, old-timer.

422
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:48,620
 Hi, Henry!

423
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:51,340
 Willy, how would you like to save my life?

424
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:52,300
 Well, that'll all depend.

425
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,940
 I promise, Kathleen, I take her to the movies tonight, see?

426
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,860
 And now I've got to sit with this baby.

427
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:59,180
 Well, in that case, I'd be glad to save your life.

428
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:00,940
 You would, Willy. How much?

429
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:03,100
 Oh, gee, I couldn't think of charging you.

430
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,600
 You wouldn't.

431
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:09,240
 You know, Willie, you're a changed man since you fell off that diving board this summer.

432
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:12,400
 Well, gee, Liz, why should I charge you for taking Kathleen to the movies?

433
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,400
 Kathleen!

434
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,400
 Willie, what I want you to do is sit with the Ferguson baby.

435
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,400
 Oh, in that case, it's 50 cents an hour.

436
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:19,900
 50?

437
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:22,300
 Henry, I do a professional job of babysitting.

438
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,100
 What do you mean?

439
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,800
 Well, I've got all kinds of things to keep my clients quiet.

440
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:29,800
 I've got bells, I've got a toy dog that barks, and all that doesn't shut 'em up.

441
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,100
 I've also got a hammer.

442
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,100
 Willie.

443
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,560
 A rubber one for them to bang on their crib with.

444
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:38,160
 Well, okay, I'm in no position to argue. 50 cents.

445
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,100
 It's a deal, shake, shake, shake.

446
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:43,100
 And while I'm picking up my equipment, you can pick up Dar's towns.

447
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:43,700
 What for?

448
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:46,600
 I've got a date with her and I might as well combine business with pleasure.

449
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,100
 But, Willie, I have to pick up Kathleen.

450
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:50,100
 Why not tell her to meet you here at the theater?

451
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,600
 I guess I could do that.

452
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:57,600
 Sure, then after you've your phone Kathleen and picked up Dar's, you can swing around by behaving and pick me up a quart of ice cream.

453
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,100
 What?

454
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:01,340
 - But willy, Henry, I'm bending over backwards,

 Boy, I wonder what's keeping Doris Townsend

486
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,500
 I found her nearly ten minutes ago

487
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,300
 and told her to meet me here.

488
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,200
 Henry!

489
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,200
 Hello there, Kathleen.

490
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,400
 Oh, she was.

491
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,500
 Henry, I waited for you for nearly fifteen minutes

492
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,700
 in front of the colony.

493
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,800
 Do you realize the second show has already started?

494
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,200
 Gee, Kathleen, are you sure?

495
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,200
 Positive, let's go, let's go!

496
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,200
 Kathleen, I can't go yet.

497
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,700
 What? Why not?

498
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:59,300
 Well, you see, it's like this.

499
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:02,300
 Henry, I demand to know why you're standing me up this time.

500
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:05,500
 Kathleen, you're backing me right into the hot water bottles.

00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,000

00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,300
 Yes, Mr. Dehayman.

 Oh!

505
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,500
 She and Willie are going to the movie.

506
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,400
 The movies, but Willie's supposed to be sitting with a baby.

507
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,200
 So Darris Townsend is the reason you're standing me up.

508
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:18,800
 What?

509
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,360
 Wait a minute, Kathleen.

510
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:24,080
 In connection with Doris, could I explain one thing?

511
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,200
 - Don't bother, it's perfectly clear.

512
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,800
 Good night, Henry Aldrich.

513
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,800
 - Whoops.

514
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,840
 - Homer Brown, don't you have a look where you're going?

515
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:31,680
 - Kathleen!

516
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,760
 - Okay, put up your dupes, Henry.

517
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,880
 Put up your dupes.

518
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,600
 - Homer, what are you doing here?

519
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,400
 - Well, my legs are just one big Charlie whore.

520
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,240
 - You got a Homer?

521
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:44,120
 - I had a pump my way through melancholy baby 12 times.

522
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:44,960
 - Homer, listen.

523
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,680
 - I won't even be able to walk for 140 yards,

524
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:52,960
 much less or on it. But Homer, if you're not with Stevie and Willy's not with Stevie,

00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,680
 who is?

527
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:07,680

529
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,680
 There you are Stevie. How was that?

530
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,680
 >> Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad.

531
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,680
 >> Is that your Mrs. Ferguson?

532
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:19,480
 Gee whiz father, are you the babysitter?

533
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,880
 Yes, Henry.

534
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,180
 Well, what about your bridge game?

535
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:26,080
 Henry, your Aunt Harriet came over to play bridge and...

536
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,980
 Well, since I got you into this, I felt it was my duty to get you out.

537
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:31,180
 But where's Willie? Why didn't he-

538
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:32,180
 I sent him away.

539
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:32,980
 You did?

540
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:37,380
 Gee whiz father, I promised him 50 cents an hour. You know Willie he'll sue.

541
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:40,680
 No, he won't. I've already settled out of court.

542
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:43,380
 Why aren't you and Kathleen at the movies?

543
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:46,180
 Oh, I don't know, Father.

544
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:50,180
 All of a sudden, Walter Pigeon just lost his appeal for me.

545
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:51,180
 You know what I mean?

546
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:52,180
 I think so.

547
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:54,180
 So, now you can go home.

548
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:55,180
 Oh.

549
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:57,180
 I'll stay with Stevie.

550
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:58,180
 Thanks very much, Bonnie.

551
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:01,180
 Uh, Henry, as long as you're missing the picture,

552
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:04,180
 maybe the only fair thing for me to do it to see it myself.

553
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:05,180
 You, Father?

554
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:07,180
 Yes, and let you know how it all comes out.

555
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:09,180
 But you'll miss your bridge game with Ann Harrien.

556
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:10,180
 I know.

557
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,180
 Good night, son.

558
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:15,180
 Uh, I'm sorry that your evening turned out as it did.

559
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:17,540
 Well, gee, why be sorry.

560
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:20,100
 I mean, boy, if Kathleen's gonna jump

561
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:22,220
 a conclusion in his all her life,

562
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:25,260
 well, I'm sure glad I found out while I'm still young.

563
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:27,460
 - Yes? - Sure.

564
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:29,580
 I can live without her.

565
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:30,900
 She doesn't own me.

566
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:33,020
 - Not yet.

567
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:34,940
 Good night, Henry.

568
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:35,900
 - Good night, Father.

569
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,580
 - And if Stevie wants more music,

570
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:39,740
 you'd better find another song for him.

571
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:41,980
 Melon Colley, baby, is about shot.

572
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:42,820
 (door slams)

573
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:44,300
 - Well, go, go, go.

574
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:47,540
 Come on Stevie, I'll take you back to your room.

575
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:48,540
 Here we go.

576
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:53,000
 Boy Stevie, you don't know how well off you are.

577
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,140
 - Bye bye, dog.

578
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:59,140
 - No school, no babies to mine, no girls.

579
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:03,900
 Boy, when you grow up Stevie, take my advice.

580
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:06,580
 Don't have anything to do with girls.

581

583

 Hello, hello do the Ferguson's live here. Oh, yeah

584
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:29,480
 I'm Pearl Pearl my aunt set me up here to set with a baby. You're in? Yes miss Hotchkiss

585
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:32,120
 Are you Henry?

586
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,120
 Yeah

587
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,120
 Come on in

588
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:39,640
 My aunt showed me your picture. She did yes

589
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,600
 "My, you've changed!"

590
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,600
 "I have?"

591
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,600
 "I should say."

592
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:49,600
 "Well, I guess you can go now if you want to."

593
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,600
 "Go?"

594
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:53,600
 "Didn't you want someone to take your place so you could go somewhere?"

595
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:57,600
 "Sure, but, gee, there's no place for me to go now."

596
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,600
 "Oh, well, I guess it was all a false alarm."

597
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,600
 "You're not going, are you?"

598
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,600
 "Don't you think I should?"

599
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:09,600
 "Why, uh, say as long as you're here, why don't we both sit down?"

600
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,300
 Why don't we both sit with Stevie and split the fee?

601
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:14,300
 - Well...

602
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:17,740
 - May I offer you a seat, Pearl?

603
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:19,460
 - Hi, thank you.

604
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:21,380
 - Oh, Gee, was I better see who else is at the door?

605
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:22,660
 - All right.

606
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:26,540
 And do you think we need all this life?

607
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:28,100
 - Oh, boy.

608
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:29,540
 (audience laughing)

609
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:31,220
 - It's not disturb the baby.

610
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:33,620
 - Kathleen!

611
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:34,740
 - Come on, Henry.

612
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:36,100
 - Kathleen, what are you doing here?

613
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:37,740
 - Henry, can you ever forgive me?

614
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:38,580
 - Forgive you?

615
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:43,140
 Ask your mother, call my folks and ask if they wouldn't like to join them in a game of casino at your house.

616
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:46,380
 And Henry I talked to her and she explained the whole thing.

617
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:47,380
 She did.

618
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:49,780
 Yes, so I came right over to apologize.

619
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:51,280
 That's fine Kathleen, only.

620
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,780
 Henry I'm just as ashamed of myself as I can be.

621
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:56,380
 The way I get jealous for no good reason.

622
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:57,880
 Oh, you've got good reason.

623
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:58,380
 I mean...

624
00:25:58,380 --> 00:25:59,380
 I don't know him.

625
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:00,580
 No, but...

626
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:03,980
 Henry, we won't have to miss that Walter Pigeon picture after all.

627
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:08,080
 Mr. Harris got so interested he's holding it over next to day so he can see it himself.

628
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,080
 Well, that's fine Kathleen only.

629
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,080
 And Henry, to show there's no hard feelings,

630
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:15,080
 I'm going to keep you company to the Ferguson's get home.

631
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,080
 What? No Kathleen.

632
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,080
 No.

633
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,080
 You got your gun to let me in?

634
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:21,080
 Sure, sure, only Kathleen.

635
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,080
 Yes, Henry.

636
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:25,080
 In connection with Pearl,

637
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,080
 could I explain one thing?

638
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:30,080

 Put up your dukes, Henry Oldrich. Put up your dukes.

641
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:46,080
 But home wearing out my track legs, doing your babysitting.

642
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,080
 Put 'em up, Henry.

643
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:50,080
 Homer, let's try to act like sensible human beings.

644
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,080
 Put 'em up, I say.

645
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:55,080
 Homer, can't we see eye to eye on the situation?

646
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,080
 Oh, no, Henry, oh, no.

647
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:01,880
 Say, wait a minute boys, here's a situation you'll see eye to eye about, and that's

648
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,480
 jello puddings.

649
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:08,400
 Because when it comes to jello puddings, everybody always agrees they're the best desserts yet.

650
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:12,600
 Yep, you never tasted anything better than jello, chocolate, butter, scotch, and vanilla

651
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:13,600
 pudding.

652
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,860
 A trio of treats.

653
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:20,640
 Their smoothest cream, rich and distinctive, chuck full of old-fashioned homemade goodness.

654
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,920
 Jello puddings made with milk are nourishing, and they cook to velvety perfection in just

655
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,560
 about five minutes.

656
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:32,280
 So no wonder more people buy "jello" puddings than any other prepared puddings in the world.

 Friends, this is United Nations Week.

659
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:45,880
 A national week set aside for discussing and learning about the vitally important work

660
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:51,160
 of the UN in its effort to secure permanent world peace and security.

 So do your part, friends, by becoming acquainted with this vast program for world betterment,

 by believing in it, by working for it.
