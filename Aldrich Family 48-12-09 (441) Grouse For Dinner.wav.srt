1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,820
 The Aldridge family based on characters originated by Clifford Goldsmith and

2
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:09,000
 starring Ezra Stoners Henry with Jackie Kalk as Homer.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,500
 Henry! Henry Aldridge!

4
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,000
 Come on, mother!

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:28,500
 Now for the Aldridge family.

6
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:40,500
 [Music]

7
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:46,500
 Typical teenage boys are always too busy to sit down and remember way back when.

8
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,500
 Like Henry Aldrich, they live only in the exciting here and now,

9
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:54,500
 with nothing to look back on and everything to look forward to.

10
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,500
 The scene opens in the Aldrich kitchen. It is morning.

11
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,500
 This morning Alice

12
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:04,680
 How long does it take to ask that she's got a burnt pot?

13
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,780
 Mary these sure use the fine side of the greater for those carrots. I am father

14
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:12,740
 What about the peppers in the cat? I'll get you work on those next foot Mary. They go in first

15
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:16,620
 Please start on them right away before I finish the cat now Mary. Let's try to keep calm

16
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:21,200
 I'm coming as fast as I can what did how do you say does she have one?

17
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,120
 I knew I shouldn't have phoned you mean she doesn't have a burnt pot no dear

18
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,680
 and she was very insulted that I should ask.

19
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,480
 But Alice, Pierre always used a burnt pot.

20
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,960
 And if he'd thought enough of me to send four genuine wild Canadian grouse,

21
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,320
 the least we can do is cook them in a burnt pot.

22
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,360
 Sam, they'll turn out just as well as the pot's cleave.

23
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,400
 And just because you're cooking the dinner is no reason for upsetting my kitchen like this, just look at it.

24
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,240
 This is a complicated recipe.

25
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,680
 If I'm going to be at it all day, I want things where I can put my hands right on them.

26
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,680
 Oh, they, Sam, I refuse.

27
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,760
 Alice, you just wait. It'll be worth it.

28
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,080
 I'm married. Please hand me the onion.

29
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,760
 Henry and Homer are still out on the back porch feeling them.

30
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,440
 What?

31
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,480
 Mary, we have to start browning them right away.

32
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,880
 Then I'm right in the middle of my peppers and cabbage.

33
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,840
 Now, Mary, let's take one thing at a time.

34
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,080
 Please tell the boys to hurry.

35
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:06,880
 Yes, Father.

36
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,600
 Alice, you know what we really need.

37
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,640
 A roaring fire of time-long.

38
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,040
 Sam, old Richard, you're not starting any fires in my kitchen.

39
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,000
 Henry!

40
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,480
 Homer, is that Mary?

41
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,320
 I'm not sure, Henry.

42
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,280
 It certainly sounds like her.

43
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,400
 My goodness, Homer, are you crying?

44
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,400
 Mary, how would you look after four pounds of onions?

45
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,400
 Father wants to know if you finished peeling them.

46
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,400
 Homer, feel around and see how many you're left.

47
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,400
 I'll see.

48
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,400
 There's four, six, seven.

49
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,400
 She was, Henry, here's a funny one.

50
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,400
 Homer, let's go with my toe.

51
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:45,400
 Oh, I thought it was kind of lumpy for an onion.

52
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,400
 I'll take in the peel one while you finish what's left.

53
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,400
 And hurry, father's ready to start here.

54
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,000
 Henry, who is this Pierre?

55
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,400
 Well, you know that moosehead in my father's study here?

56
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,400
 That's Pierre.

57
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,400
 What?

58
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,400
 Well, that is he was my father's guide when he bagged him.

59
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,400
 When he was?

60
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,400
 Bagged him Homer, bagged him.

61
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,400
 He sends us something every year.

62
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,400
 Last year he sent my mother Musgrat skin.

63
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,400
 No kidding.

64
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,400
 She's going to have it made into a coat as soon as she gets a few more.

65
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,400
 What?

66
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,400
 And this year he sent your father for four.

67
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,400
 And what would you call more than one grouse?

68
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,400
 Growses? Or is it rice?

69
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,400
 Gee, either one sounds right.

70
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,400
 Did I tell you my father's using Pierre's own special recipe to cook?

71
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,400
 He is. Boy, I can hardly wait to taste them.

72
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,400
 You? But Homer...

73
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,400
 That's one reason I love eating at your house, Hen.

74
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,400
 You never know what's going to show up on the table.

75
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:51,400
 Well, look Homer. That's why I didn't mind getting here at 7.30 this morning to help out.

76
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,400
 Sure, and we appreciate it Homer.

77
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:59,400
 And your father sure is a card. The way he's always joking about my showing up at meal times.

78
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,400
 Homer, I think you'd better excuse me for a minute.

79
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,400
 What's the matter? Well there's a certain conference I'd better have with my mother.

80
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:12,400
 Okay, and Henry asked if there's anything I can do after I finish her onions.

81
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,400
 Mother?

82
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,700
 If they haven't you finished those onions yet?

83
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,700
 Why, not exactly Father.

84
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,700
 Now Sam is doing the best he can.

85
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:20,700
 But please hurry.

86
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:23,300
 Mary, you're not chopping those peppers too fine are you?

87
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,300
 Mother, I've got good news for you.

88
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,300
 You had?

89
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,300
 Yeah, Homer can make it for dinner tonight.

90
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,300
 What?

91
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,300
 I didn't even have to talk a member with...

92
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,300
 Yeah, you mean you invited it?

93
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,300
 Well, not exactly.

94
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:40,300
 But don't you agree we should considering that he's been crying his eyes out for us all morning?

95
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,900
 Henry, I like Homer.

96
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,860
 I like him very much.

97
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:47,780
 There's something about him that, well, that warms your heart.

98
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:50,420
 But he's got to learn to wait until he's invited.

99
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:52,220
 But what can I say to him?

100
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:55,820
 Just tell him he can't come tonight under any conditions.

101
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:56,700
 But be tactical.

102
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,700
 Don't make him feel we don't want him.

103
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,100
 Sure, mother.

104
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,100
 I'll do my best.

105
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,540
 My goodness, Samuel, potatoes are burning.

106
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:04,500
 I know, Ellen.

107
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,420
 They're supposed to.

108
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:07,940
 [LAUGHTER]

109
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,740
 Home, old timer.

110
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,740
 Look, can I finish the onion?

111
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,040
 That's swell, Homer.

112
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:16,640
 Look, I just had a little talk with my mother, see.

113
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,640
 About me?

114
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:20,440
 Yeah, you happen to come up.

115
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:24,140
 And Homer, you know what she said about you?

116
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:24,940
 Why?

117
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:27,140
 You warm her heart.

118
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,140
 I do.

119
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:32,940
 And look, Homer, would it make you feel any better if my father took us to the movies tonight?

120
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,940
 On top of dinner?

121
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:35,940
 Why?

122
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:36,940
 Oh, boy.

123
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:38,940
 What a swell family.

124
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,440
 Homer, you're not gonna be here.

125
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,100
 No, I've been a heel.

126
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:45,540
 Here I've been warming your family's hearts all these years,

127
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:47,440
 and what have I done in return?

128
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,280
 Nothing.

129
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,120
 Homer, I didn't mean that.

130
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,280
 You know what I'm gonna do?

131
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,380
 I've got a present at home they'd love.

132
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:54,420
 Homer, wait, let me present me.

133
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:57,100
 If I warm their hearts, monogram matches

134
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,020
 are the least I can give them.

135
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:01,600
 (upbeat music)

136
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:09,600
 [Music]

137
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,100
 Mother, look, monogram matches.

138
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,100
 You see how Homer feels about us.

139
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,600
 Henry, they're not even our monogram.

140
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,100
 [Laughter]

141
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:20,600
 Don't you agree it's the sentiment that counts?

142
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:24,600
 So couldn't we forbid Homer to come the next time he's not invited?

143
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,600
 Henry, I told you to tell him not to come this time.

144
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,100
 Mother, you should have seen his eyes when I talked to him.

145
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:36,100
 And they were sort of, sort of, all watery.

146
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,540
 That was onions.

147
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:39,380
 - Well, mother.

148
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:42,820
 - I'm sorry, but we just have to put our foot down on Homer.

149
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:43,660
 - What?

150
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:45,580
 - Your father's already spoken to me several times

151
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,660
 about his coming to dinner without being invited.

152
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:49,020
 You mean if it's all right with father

153
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,100
 or it's all right with you?

154
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,420
 - Mrs. Aldrich.

155
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:52,260
 - He's coming.

156
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:53,500
 Yes, Homer.

157
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,620
 Would you mind explaining how the bag

158
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:58,020
 on your vacuum cleaner comes off?

159
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:59,100
 - Homer, what's happened?

160
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,420
 - Well, nothing.

161
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:05,060
 I thought I'd help out and sort of give that easy chair in the corner, the one's over, see?

162
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,060
 Yeah?

163
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:09,460
 Well, you know that doily that was on the back of it?

164
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:10,460
 Oh my!

165
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:12,460
 That was genuine Belgian lady!

166
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:15,140
 Mrs. Oldrich, I know exactly where it is.

167
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,140
 I'll get it out.

168
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:19,260
 Before you do, Homer, Henry has something to say to you.

169
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:20,260
 Haven't you, Henry?

170
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:21,260
 Sure, mother.

171
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:23,380
 As soon as I speak to father.

172
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:24,380
 Father!

173
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:26,660
 Henry, it won't do you a bit of good.

174
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:28,420
 Father, are you in the kitchen?

175
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:29,420
 Yes, Henry.

176
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:33,420
 And just look at those grouse lying there in the pot.

177
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:34,420
 Have you ever seen such beauties?

178
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:35,420
 Well, I'll say.

179
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,420
 And father--

180
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:39,420
 I admit, there's not much to them after you take the feathers off.

181
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:41,420
 But at least there'll be enough for the four of us.

182
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,420
 Just the four of us?

183
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:48,420
 I mean, Dean, now that I really look at them, there's enough for an army.

184
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:49,420
 An army?

185
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:50,420
 Sure.

186
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:53,420
 Henry Homer is not coming to dinner tonight.

187
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:54,420
 Ha-ha!

188
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:56,420
 Not under any circumstance.

189
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:58,420
 But, Father, suppose we stuff them with the--

190
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:04,080
 We stuff them with bread and butter first how much grouse can he eat Henry you were please tell Homer

191
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,160
 You're sorry, but tonight is out, but you know but Mary can I have the piece please?

192
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,940
 Father was I supposed to take care of them to you mean you haven't even started shelling them

193
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:18,860
 I was busy cracking the walnut Mary you should learn to take one thing at a time now the next see where does your mother keep the

194
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:20,560
 Fennel seed the one

 Fennel seed Mary Fennel seed it's an herb pierce grouse wouldn't taste like anything without it my goodness father

196
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:28,380
 We don't have anything like that.

197
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:29,220
 We don't.

198
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,300
 No, Fennelse?

199
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,540
 That's not fine, say.

200
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:33,420
 Wouldn't Pepper do just as well?

201
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:34,580
 No, it would not.

202
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,140
 I'll have to go out and get some.

203
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,380
 And while I'm going, Mary, be sure and base the grouts

204
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,060
 every three minutes.

205
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,660
 But what about the peas and the walnuts?

206
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:41,940
 Now, Mary, let's not get excited.

207
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:42,580
 But my goodness!

208
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:44,380
 That's the trouble with the way women cook.

209
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:45,300
 No organization.

210
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,420
 Mary, please start basing.

211
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:47,940
 My father was that final about--

212
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,500
 Mary, please, step aside.

213
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,300
 Look, Mary.

214
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,260
 How could you brush the hair out of my eyes?

215
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,060
 Sure, I'd be glad to.

216
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:56,760
 Mary, what can I do about Homer?

217
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:01,960
 Henry, you've just got to learn to look in square in the eye and say, "See here, Homer Brown."

218
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,860
 Mary, I can't say a thing like that to my best friend.

219
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:07,660
 Why not, it's easy. Here, grab this spool.

220
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:08,360
 What for?

221
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,460
 Then start facing. I'll show you how to get rid of Homer.

222
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:12,260
 Homer!

223
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:15,060
 Mary, why are you rolling up your sleeves?

224
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,460
 Homer, where are you?

225
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:17,760
 You're living in a mirror.

226
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,760
 Now, see here, Homer Brown.

227
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,560
 Homer, what are you doing with that picture album?

228
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:25,560
 Why, your mother took me off vacuum cleaning and put me on dusting books.

229
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,560
 And Mary, who's this?

230
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,560
 Let me see.

231
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,560
 Oh, my goodness, that's me when I was just four.

232
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,560
 That's what I look silly.

233
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,560
 Silly.

234
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,560
 Gee, I've never seen a cute little tyke.

235
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,560
 Cute or what?

236
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,560
 Tyke, Mary, Tyke.

237
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,560
 Kid.

238
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,560
 Oh.

239
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,560
 Gee, you're the cutest four year old I've ever seen.

240
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,560
 I am?

241
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,560
 Gee, sure.

242
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:50,560
 Oh, was there something you wanted to say to me?

243
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:57,680
 to me. All right. And I'll see you here Homer. Yes Mary. Homer I know you're expecting to

244
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:04,480
 come to dinner tonight and and yes well how would you feel if I were to invite you to come

245
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:14,360
 over next Tuesday. Oh boy. Mary I never imagined you felt this way about me. Homer I like you

246
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,360
 You do terribly.

247
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,360
 You do terribly.

248
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:22,360
 Boy, if someone told me, if they told me,

249
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:26,360
 gee, imagine being invited to dinner here twice in the same movie.

250
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,360
 What?

251
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,360
 Oh, will there be anybody here to say but just the two of us, Mary?

252
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,360
 Now see here, Homer.

253
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,360
 Even if there is, we could take a walk afterwards, couldn't we?

254
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,360
 Homer, stay on your side of the table.

255
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,360
 In Mary.

256
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,360
 Homer, keep away.

257
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,360
 Mary.

258
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,360
 There!

259
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:55,360
 Oh, excuse me, Miss.

260
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,360
 Yes, sir, may I help you?

261
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:01,360
 No, please. You see, I've been to several stores and none of them seem to carry it, and I thought you might have it here at the Emporium.

262
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,360
 Have what, sir?

263
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,360
 Fennel.

264
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,360
 Oh, yes, sir. Full floor less iron, you're right.

265
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,360
 Oh, fine, fine. Full floor?

266
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:09,360
 Yes, sir, in hardware. Just ask anyone for a funnel.

267
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:17,320
 I don't know no fennel fennel fennel seed fennel seed yes are you sure you don't mean

268
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:21,360
 kennel seed I think about it you find can in the pet shop on the second floor

269
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:27,140
 right next to sporting goods I don't want kennel seed I want sennel keys I mean I'm

270
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:34,940
 not the fennel seed I see and mr. McIntosh oh mr. McIntosh the mackintosh is our floor walker

271
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:41,340
 Perhaps he can help you good. Yes, this friend. Mr. McIntosh this gentleman would like some what is that again sir?

272
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:48,440
 Fennel feed seed. Oh, yes garden appliances two-eyes over but although I must confess I've never heard of fennels

273
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,620
 What time of the year do they come out?

274
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:56,980
 Mr. McIntosh fennel seed is not a seed. Hmm. That is it's a seed, but it isn't a seed that comes up

275
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:02,420
 They've come in jar jar. Yes. Oh now I understand

276
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:06,060
 Do you want white mouth jars or a narrow mouth jar?

277
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:11,060
 But then for storing seed I imagine the narrow ones would be more practice now just a moment. I

278
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:16,440
 Don't want to buy any jar. I don't want to buy funnel and I don't want to buy kennel feed

279
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,900
 I want kennel seed fennel seed. Do you understand?

280
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,080
 Yes, it

281
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:26,320
 Suppose I turn you over to our section manager, but over to the hiller brand with the hiller brand

282
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,320
 If you step this way for a moment.

283
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:39,320
 Mary, I must say I'm a little surprised at you.

284
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,320
 Surprised at me, Mother. What about Homer?

285
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,920
 I was nothing but an innocent victim.

286
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,920
 Mother, suppose we do this tonight.

287
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:47,920
 Suppose I split my grouse with Homer.

288
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:48,920
 - Is it? - Sure.

289
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,320
 I wouldn't mind doing without my drumsticks.

290
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,720
 Now, just a moment, dear.

291
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,120
 I don't want you to think I'm being stubborn.

292
00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:01,280
 But if neither of my children has the courage to get rid of Homer in a nice polite way, then I guess I'll have to.

293
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:01,920
 You, other?

294
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,580
 The time has come to be direct.

295
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,040
 Homer!

296
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,200
 Oh boy.

297
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,000
 Oh my goodness.

298
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:07,680
 What's wrong?

299
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,120
 If you're here, Henry and I'm here, who's facing?

300
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:10,780
 Homer?

301
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:13,120
 Mrs. Aldrich, I finished testing in books.

302
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,680
 Is there something else I can do?

303
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:15,400
 No, dear.

304
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,800
 Sit down, please.

305
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,560
 That's something I want to say to you.

306
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,880
 Sure, Mrs. Aldrich.

307
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:20,600
 Homer?

308
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,520
 Yes, Mrs. Aldrich.

309
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,540
 Erm...

310
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:24,600
 Homer.

311
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,600
 I'm going to tell you a little story.

312
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,600
 You are?

313
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,600
 Yes, dear.

314
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,600
 And I hope you get the point.

315
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,600
 Oh, I will, Mrs. Orwich. I'm usually pretty good at story.

316
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,600
 Good.

317
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,600
 Now, this is a story about a nice boy.

318
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,600
 And this nice boy could be anyone.

319
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:46,600
 He could be you, he could be Willie Marshall or anybody.

320
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,600
 He could.

321
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,600
 Willie Marshall?

322
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,600
 Yes, dear.

323
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,600
 Now, we all like this boy. We like him very much.

324
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,840
 and we'd like very much to have him to dinner.

325
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:00,000
 It's just a question of his being invited.

326
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,160
 You see what I mean, Homer?

327
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,800
 - Sure. - You do?

328
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,800
 Well, my goodness.

329
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,400
 - Do you mind if I use the phone? - Of course not.

330
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:13,600
 And I do hope this boy understands that we really like him very much.

331
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,600
 - Yeah, I hope so. - And you sure have a big heart, Mrs. Aldrich.

332
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:22,000
 - Thank you, Homer. - I'll operate it. Give me your 997.

333
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 Thank you.

334
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 Home, dear.

335
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 Yes, Mrs. Aldrich.

336
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 When you threw on the phone, why not come out here in the kitchen and have a piece of cake?

337
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 Gee, thanks.

338
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 Hello, Willie Marshall.

339
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 Willie, this is Homer.

340
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 I've got good news for you.

341
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 You're invited to dinner tonight at the Aldrich.

342
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 [Music]

343
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 And now getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldrich.

344
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 Homer has invited himself to Mr. Aldrich

345
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 a special dinner of Canadian Grouse Alapierre.

346
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 So far the efforts of Henry and his family to get rid of him

347
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,500
 have met with phenomenal failure.

348
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,800
 The scene opens in the Aldrich Hallway.

349
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,500
 It's later than afternoon.

350
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,500
 Hello, is that you, Henry?

351
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,000
 No, Alice, this is Sam.

352
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 Has Mary put the walnuts in the grouch yet?

353
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 I think so.

354
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:24,500
 Hi.

355
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,000
 And Sam, I'm glad you called.

356
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,300
 I've been wanting to talk to you.

357
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,500
 Where are you?

358
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,900
 In the President's office.

359
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,000
 The President?

360
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,300
 Of the Emporium.

361
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:33,800
 What are you doing there?

362
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,300
 Having tea.

363
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,900
 Meanwhile, Sarah is trying to get in touch with the company

364
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,400
 that might carry fennel speed.

365
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,500
 What seed?

366
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,500
 Alice, I'm not going to start that with you.

367
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,580
 What do you want to talk to me about?

368
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:46,540
 It's Henry, he's disappeared.

369
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:47,040
 What?

370
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,900
 Without doing a thing about Homer.

371
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:49,900
 That's a fine thing.

372
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:52,100
 Why can't Mary tell him to go home?

373
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,640
 Dear, she refused this point,

374
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,740
 Blanks has speak to him.

375
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:56,580
 Mary, well, Alice, then there's just one thing to do.

376
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,500
 You will have to be firm with Homer yourself.

377
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,740
 I?

378
00:15:59,740 --> 00:15:59,740
 Yes.

379
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:01,480
 But, Sam, I've already...

380
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:04,580
 Dear, have you ever noticed his eyes?

381
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:05,740
 What about them?

382
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,260
 They look at you.

383
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:12,560
 No, that's... we can't have Homer for dinner, and that's fine.

384
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,860
 There simply aren't enough grouse to go around.

385
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:16,960
 I know, dear, and I thought of that.

386
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:19,060
 Why don't I throw in some spaghetti?

387
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:21,460
 Spaghetti? With my wild grouse?

388
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,560
 It would be silly.

389
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,060
 How is we couldn't? What would Pierre say?

390
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,260
 Does he have to know?

391
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:31,260
 And Mary's gone over to tell Willie Marshall not to come, so at least we won't have him on our head.

392
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:33,460
 Willie Marshall, how are he gettin' included?

393
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:35,260
 Why, Homer invited him.

394
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:35,860
 What?

395
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:37,760
 Now, do you control yourself?

396
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:39,460
 Sam?

397
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:41,460
 Sam, have you hung up?

398
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:43,460
 No, Alice. I haven't hung up.

399
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:45,460
 Are you angry?

400
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:47,460
 I should I be angry.

401
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:50,860
 I don't mind Homer's coming to dinner and eating my grouse.

402
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:53,860
 That's something I could get over, eventually.

403
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:56,860
 But why, no one in my own family can do a simple thing.

404
00:16:56,860 --> 00:17:01,060
 Like telling the boy he hasn't been invited is something I cannot understand.

405
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:02,460
 - But, dear... - All right, Alice.

406
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:05,460
 If no one else is capable, I'll just have to handle them out of myself.

407
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:07,060
 - You mean you'll tell Homer? - Yes.

408
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,500
 Good, I'll put him on.

409
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:12,260
 No, I mean, Alice, right now I have to track down some fennel seeds.

410
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:13,260
 Some what?

411
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:16,260
 Never mind, and don't worry, I'll take care of Homer in my own way.

412
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,260
 Goodbye.

413
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:20,260
 This is all Richard, I finished chopping her wood.

414
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:22,260
 Is there anything else you'd like me to do?

415
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:26,260
 No, dear, and hope I can't just stand around with idle hands.

416
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:28,260
 When I give the windows upstairs are going over.

417
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:31,260
 Homer, I really don't feel you should do any more.

418
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:32,260
 See, I don't mind.

419
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:35,260
 That's the least I can do for a couple of grouse's.

420
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:37,840
 (upbeat music)

421
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:46,020
 - Oh my goodness, Hemi, this is a surprise, come here.

422
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,220
 - Thanks Agnes, do you?

423
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:48,620
 'Cause that dinner I smoke cooking.

424
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:49,460
 - You are.

425
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:51,540
 - Agnes, your mother always makes plenty, doesn't she?

426
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:53,740
 I mean, that is, there's always room for one more,

427
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:54,580
 isn't there?

428
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:55,420
 - Sure why?

429
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:56,260
 - No reason.

430
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:59,260
 Did I mention I saw you in gym yesterday.

431
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:00,260
 - You did, I did.

432
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:01,260
 - You did.

433
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:04,660
 - Hemi, I look terrible and now's off a gym blowman.

434
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:06,660
 You look pretty good to me.

435
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:07,660
 I did.

436
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:09,660
 You sit on him, you old kid.

437
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,660
 You're a candy chair.

438
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:12,660
 I have time.

439
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,660
 And the reason I came, you know, I always felt

440
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,660
 if there was one person you could count on

441
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:18,660
 when you had a problem was good old Agnes.

442
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:19,660
 You've got a problem.

443
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:22,660
 Well, you see, my father's cooking a special dinner tonight.

444
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:23,660
 Your father's dinner?

445
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:24,660
 Sure.

446
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:25,660
 And you have to eat it?

447
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:26,660
 Sure.

448
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:28,660
 But you have got a problem.

449
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:30,660
 Yeah, so I was wondering, I was wondering--

450
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,660
 Don't say another word, honey.

451
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:33,660
 I'd be glad to.

452
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:36,660
 - Glad to work. - Naturally, I'll have to ask my mother first.

453
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:40,660
 - No, no, no, no, no, no! - Agnes, wait! I haven't explained about Homer!

454
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:52,660
 Hello, Stair Sam! Well, I hope you don't mind my dropping in your office like this, will.

455
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:55,660
 Not at all. Homer tells me he's having dinner at your house tonight.

456
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:57,660
 - Yes, good. - Well, at least night came over.

457
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:00,660
 Now, before you go into that, Sam, there's something I have to take care of in the outer office

458
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,660
 that makes you self-comfortable.

459
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:03,920
 Do you mind if I use your phone?

460
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,120
 Go ahead, Sam.

461
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,120
 Number, please.

462
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,720
 Abbott City, 2200.

463
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,960
 Abbott City, 2200.

464
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,360
 Oh, please.

465
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,000
 Will, it's a long distance call.

466
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:12,960
 That's OK, Sam.

467
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,160
 Merry Christmas.

468
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:14,760
 Right.

469
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:15,360
 Thanks.

470
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,560
 Same to you.

471
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,360
 Hello.

472
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,880
 Abbott City groceries, supply companies.

473
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,720
 Oh, how do you do?

474
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,960
 The Emporium in Santa Fe suggested that I phone you.

475
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,720
 I'm on the trail of some fennel seed.

476
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,680
 I beg your pardon.

477
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,400
 A fennel seed.

478
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:25,880
 Oh, look.

479
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,400
 It's sort of an herb, you see.

480
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,200
 Oh, yes, sir.

481
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,080
 Hold on, please.

482
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:29,560
 What's that?

483
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,160
 Now, wait a minute.

484
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:30,920
 I haven't finished.

485
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:31,320
 Hello.

486
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:31,820
 Hello.

487
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:32,000
 Hello.

488
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 Who is this?

489
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 This is her.

490
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 Who?

491
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 Her?

492
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 The channel for me?

493
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 Look, I'm trying to put my hand on some fennel seed.

494
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 F-E-N-N-E-L.

495
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 Fennel.

496
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 Oh, fennel seed.

497
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 Now I get you.

498
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 You mean you have some?

499
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 Yes, sir.

500
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 Syrian or Arabian.

501
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 What's the difference?

502
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 Well, want some Syrian.

503
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 The others are Arabian.

504
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 Oh, well, you don't want to be fine.

505
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 Could you wrap some up for me?

506
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 I'll get into my car and drive right over.

507
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 Well, yes, sir.

508
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 What quantity?

509
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 Oh, about 25 cents.

510
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 Where should be enough?

511
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,300
 I'm afraid you don't understand, Mr. This is a wholesale establishment.

512
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,000
 Yes, I know.

513
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,300
 Some of the orders we place from the site, $10,000.

514
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:08,000
 Yes, I know.

515
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,800
 Well, very well, Mr. I'm going to see you on order.

516
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,800
 Never mind now. We'll decide that when I get there.

517
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,800
 Goodbye.

518
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,800
 Okay, Sam, what's on your mind?

519
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,000
 Why, uh, it's...

520
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 Above Homer coming to dinner tonight.

521
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,300
 Sam, I want you to know how grateful we are.

522
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:20,800
 Grateful?

523
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,000
 Yes. If you hadn't taken Homer off our hands,

524
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 Elizabeth and I wouldn't have been able to accept the Ferguson's invitation to their barbecue tonight.

525
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,200
 But, but, well, that's just it.

526
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:28,700
 What is?

527
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,400
 I'm afraid we can't have Homer tonight.

528
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,400
 I'm afraid not.

529
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,400
 You mean you're having other companies?

530
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,400
 No.

531
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,400
 The Alice Shake?

532
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,400
 No.

533
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,400
 What is it then, Sam?

534
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,400
 Well, you see...

535
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,400
 Well, you see...

536
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,400
 Yes, I do see!

537
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,400
 And why don't you like Homer?

538
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:55,400
 Mother, how much longer do these crowds have to cook?

539
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,400
 I really don't know, Mary.

540
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,400
 And must you base with two hands?

541
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,900
 - Mother, I said we don't have the strength to do it one hand.

542
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,600
 It's a fear it isn't lady life.

543
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05,800
 - Hey, suppose Henry isn't what are we gonna do about Homer?

544
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:08,000
 - Mary, I refuse to even think about it.

545
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,500
 This whole thing is giving me a splitting headache.

546
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,300
 - Oh!

547
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:13,400
 - Thank goodness in the kitchen, Sam.

548
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,400
 - I'm sorry, Auntie.

549
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,200
 I'll have the ground.

550
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,400
 - Fine, Father.

551
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,900
 - Sam, what's that under your arm?

552
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,500
 - Goodbye, Fennel's seat, Alice.

553
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,400
 It's an herb to put on the ground.

554
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,400
 - Sam, a whole cake?

555
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,900
 - Well, I got it wholesale, Alice.

556
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:25,900
 It was dirt cheating.

557
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,900
 - It's Santa to take us years to use it out.

558
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:30,500
 Now, listen, thing like fennel seed gets used up in no time.

559
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,500
 Now, stand back while I sprinkle some on the grouse.

560
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,700
 Yes, sir.

561
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:35,500
 There.

562
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,300
 How do you hardly drop in free grain?

563
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:38,700
 Mary, all it needs is a pinch.

564
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,300
 But how are we ever going to use up a whole keg

565
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:43,100
 if you go fooling around with pinches?

566
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,700
 Just smell that grouse.

567
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:45,700
 Yes, sir.

568
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:48,900
 There's nothing that tastes better than a meal you've cooked yourself.

569
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:49,600
 What?

570
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,600
 Now, Mary?

571
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,900
 Father, does this mean the grouse are done?

572
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:53,700
 Yes, Mary.

573
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:54,600
 There are more vegetables to peel,

574
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,900
 no more walnuts to craft, no base.

575
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,200
 No, no, it's finished.

576
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,800
 Thank goodness. Where are you going?

577
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,300
 Back in my room and collapsed.

578
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:01,800
 But Mary, it's time to eat them.

579
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,700
 Mother, I never want to look at another grass as long as I live.

580
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:05,900
 Mrs. Aldrich.

581
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,000
 Yes, Homer?

582
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,400
 You're thinking of calling me into dinner.

583
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,800
 I'm in the dining room.

584
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,300
 I'm calling him.

585
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:14,600
 Sam, what are you going to do about Homer?

586
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,900
 I'm going to get rid of him.

587
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:18,600
 If Will Brown thinks he's going to eat barbecue at the Ferguson's

588
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,000
 while we're having his son, he's got another thing coming.

589
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 But, Alice, I have as much right to enjoy my dinner as Will has.

590
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,100
 Mrs. Aldrich, did you know the phone's ringing?

591
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,100
 Yes, dear.

592
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:31,100
 And as soon as I answer it home and I want to have a little talk with you...

593
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,100
 Hi.

594
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,700
 Sam, I think I'll join Mary.

595
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:34,600
 But dinner's ready.

596
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,100
 I'm afraid this headache is ruined my appetite.

597
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:40,700
 I'll take the grouse into the dining room, then I'm going upstairs and lie down.

598
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:43,900
 You mean Henry and I will have to split the grouse between us?

599
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:44,400
 Hello.

600
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,500
 Hello, Father.

601
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,500
 Henry, where are you?

602
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,500
 Good at Agnes's.

603
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,300
 Henry, I've got good news for you.

604
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:51,700
 You and I are having two grouse apiece.

605
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:52,500
 Who are you?

606
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,700
 Yes, to come on home.

607
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,800
 But that's the whole thing, Father.

608
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,880
 I think I'm having dinner over here.

609
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,400
 What? Why?

610
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,600
 I think I talk too much.

611
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,200
 But Henry, what about my wild grouse?

612
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,960
 Don't remind me, Father.

613
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:09,000
 We're having baked macaroni over here. Goodbye.

614
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,600
 But-but-but...

615
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,200
 Well...

616
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,880
 Mr. Aldrich, I'm still in the dining room if you want to speak to me.

617
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,600
 What? Oh, yes.

618
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:19,080
 Is there something wrong, Mr. Aldrich?

619
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,200
 Sit down, Homer.

620
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,000
 Sit down?

621
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,400
 Yes, sir.

622
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,800
 About dinner tonight?

623
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:24,800
 Yes.

624
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:27,100
 About the...

625
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:31,600
 Homer, I've got good news for you. We're having two grouse-a-peas.

626
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,300
 - We are. - We'll have the time of our lives, just the two of us.

627
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:40,100
 Gee, I never imagined you felt that way toward me, too, Mr. Aldrich.

628
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:42,800
 - What way? - Do I warm your heart?

629
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,800
 I wouldn't go that far.

630
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,400
 Well, we're supposed to eat.

631
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,300
 Just look at those grouse over.

632
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:52,600
 Oh, gee, whizzer, those grouse.

633
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,400
 Of course!

634
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,100
 They look just like chickens.

635
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:55,700
 What?

636
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:58,000
 And Mr. Orle, which I don't like chickens.

637
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,400
 So if you'll excuse me, I'm going home.

638
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,800
 Now, just a minute.

639
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,800
 Over you sit down and eat.
