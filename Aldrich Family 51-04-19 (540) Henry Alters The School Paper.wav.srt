 [Music]

00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,500
 Henry!

3
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,000
 Henry!

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 Come on, are they?

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 [Applause]

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,500
 Yes, it's the oldest family based on characters originated by

7
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:30,500
 by K

8
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,500
 and now for the Aldrich family.

9
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:46,500
 They say that when you grow out of the teenage group it's like being expelled from paradise.

10
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,500
 You can't ever go back. But you can recall that time in your life in the

11
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:55,360
 misadventures of Henry Albridge. It's early evening and the scene opens in the

12
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,180
 Albridge living room.

13
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:00,460
 Boy, that's rich.

14
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:02,260
 Let's hear it.

15
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:03,760
 And we go and read some.

16
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,260
 And the father is trying to read his paper.

17
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:08,020
 Oh, I'm sorry, Father.

18
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:13,260
 That's all right. I'm sure my paper isn't as amusing as whatever it is you and Homer are reading.

19
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,860
 We're reading Willie's column in the school paper.

20
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:19,740
 Yeah, the Senate bill high, low down.

21
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:22,140
 - Would you care to hear a couple of items, Father?

22
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:23,260
 - No, thank you.

23
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:25,460
 I just struggled along with my own paper,

24
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:26,700
 doll as it is.

25
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:27,540
 - Yes, sir.

26
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:30,580
 - And please try to be a little more quiet, boys, won't you?

27
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:32,060
 - Oh, yes, Mrs. Aldrich.

28
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:33,740
 We'll read to ourselves, Mother.

29
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:34,580
 - Good.

30
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:36,820
 (laughing)

31
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:39,580
 What is it, Homer?

32
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:41,100
 - Listen to this, him.

33
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:45,180
 What boy was seen with what girl on what day?

34
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:48,740
 Having soda at what drug store?

35
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:52,740
 I like that. That's the third time this week Willie's mentioned me.

36
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,740
 [audience laughter]

37
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:57,740
 Oh, Homer, Willie's mentioned you too.

38
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:58,740
 He does. Let me see.

39
00:01:58,740 --> 00:01:59,740
 Right here.

40
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:05,740
 Yesterday, most of the students in Mr. Miller's manual training class finished their coffee tables.

41
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:08,740
 Homer Brown is still working on a breadboard.

42
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:10,740
 [audience laughter]

43
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:11,740
 Some mention.

44
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:15,740
 Hey, here's some real dirt. Flash.

45
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:19,740
 George Bigelow and Natalie Bishop have...

46
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,740
 They have actually...

47
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:25,740
 It says here they...

48
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:29,740
 Please, please, I'm trying to light my cigar.

49
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:31,740
 Oh, sorry, Tommy.

50
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:34,740
 Boys, if I were to take your paper out on the front porch...

51
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:35,740
 Never mind, I was...

52
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:37,740
 If you'd rather we left, Father...

53
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,740
 Oh, no, no, there's nothing in my paper but news.

54
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:41,740
 Nobody has...

55
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:43,740
 ...if anybody.

56
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:45,740
 [audience laughing]

57
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:48,740
 - Hey, here, here's something about Gladys Prennett.

58
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:49,740
 - No kidding.

59
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:52,740
 - Is it that I'm taking you to the baseball game Saturday?

60
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:53,740
 - Oh.

61
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:54,740
 - Not exactly.

62
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:55,740
 - Did I take her to the class dance?

63
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:56,740
 - No.

64
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:57,740
 - Well, what does it say?

65
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:59,740
 - You better read it yourself, him.

66
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:00,740
 - Let's see.

67
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:05,740
 A very cozy twosome these days is Gladys Prennett's and...

68
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:07,740
 George Bigelow.

69
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:12,740
 They can be seen almost any time at the Haven's drugstore.

70
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:16,740
 Oh, this is nothing more or less than the old journalism.

71
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:18,740
 It's just a gossip column.

72
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,740
 There's no excuse for printing lies.

73
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:21,740
 Come on, homie.

74
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:22,740
 Where are you going?

75
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:23,740
 Where are you going?

76
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,740
 You'll find it.

77
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:28,740
 It looks like George Bigelow is spoiling Henry's dinner.

78
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:31,740
 The speaking of the Bigelow's hand there coming over for Bridge.

79
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:33,740
 Well, not this evening, I hope.

80
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:34,740
 Yes, dear.

81
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:37,740
 Oh, as I just wanted to relax and take it easy tonight.

82
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:38,740
 Sam, I had to ask them.

83
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:41,740
 We've been to their house for Bridge the last three or four times.

84
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:46,740
 I wouldn't mind so much, but the way Frank plays bridge is so annoyed.

85
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:49,740
 The overbids play the wrong cards, forgets the rules.

86
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,740
 But he always wins.

87
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,740
 That's what's so annoyed.

88
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:56,740
 Now, this isn't the some way we could get out of it gracefully.

89
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,740
 Dear, I don't know how.

90
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:01,740
 Frank's a good friend and client, and I don't want to offend him, but...

91
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,740
 I'm sure you can think of something.

92
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:08,740
 All right, Sam, but if I make some excuse, I don't want them to catch us at home.

93
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:09,740
 We'll go to the movie.

94
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:14,900
 go to the movie the movies no I will not go to the movie tonight very well then

95
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:21,220

 Cheers.

103
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:06,660
 Homer, I just happened to think I don't remember our English assignment for homework.

104
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:08,660
 I'd better call somebody and find out.

105
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:09,660
 I know what it is.

106
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:12,500
 It's page 140 to 150 of Ivan.

107
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,340
 Oh, I'll just say my better calling makes sure.

108
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:17,940
 Operator, please give me Elm 6354.

109
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:20,140
 Well, that's George Bigelow.

110
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:21,140
 I call him.

111
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:22,940
 He never does his English homework.

112
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:25,780
 Homer, that doesn't mean he doesn't know what it is.

113
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:26,780
 Hello?

114
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:28,380
 Can I speak to George?

115
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:30,380
 Oh, he isn't?

116
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:33,380
 Well, do you know where he is, Mrs. Bigelow?

117
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:36,380
 The Haven's drugstore?

118
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:39,380
 Oh, somebody called him and he went out?

119
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:42,380
 Some fella, I suppose.

120
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:45,380
 Oh, it was a girl, huh?

121
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:47,380
 Thank you.

122
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,380
 Goodbye.

123
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:53,380
 Homer, I think I'll go out for a walk.

124
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:55,380
 Okay, and I'll go along with you.

125
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,380
 I feel like a soda, too.

126
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:06,020
 [Music]

127
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:08,620
 What are you looking for here, do you see anything?

128
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:10,220
 Homer, I'm not looking for anything.

129
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:12,460
 And besides, there's nobody here.

130
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:13,660
 Nobody here?

131
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:15,300
 The drugstore is faulty.

132
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,140
 It was just a figure of speech.

133
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:17,800
 Oh.

134
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,100
 And look, there's Windbag, Willie Marshall.

135
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,020
 Do you know what I've got a good mind to do?

136
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:22,580
 Why?

137
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:23,580
 Come on.

138
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:24,620
 Listen, Willie.

139
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:27,420
 No father meat fellas, I'm working against the deadline.

140
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,420
 Oh, what are you writing, Willie?

141
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:32,120
 I'm reviewing a new movie that opened at the B-shoot tonight.

142
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,520
 I'm giving it four bells.

143
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,120
 The picture was that good?

144
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,820
 No, but I got in for nothing.

145
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:39,720
 Why should I bite the hand that gave me a pass?

146
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:43,820
 Listen, Willie, you ought to be careful about the lives you prick in your column.

147
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:47,620
 Oh, yeah? Any lies you say in my column happen to be the truth?

148
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:48,920
 Is that so?

149
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:52,620
 Didn't you say that George and Gladys are always here in the drugstore?

150
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,020
 Sure, and it's true.

151
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:56,380
 That's funny. I don't see him anyplace. Do you?

152
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:57,380
 Not me.

153
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:58,380
 Oh boy.

154
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:00,300
 Well, for your information, they were just here.

155
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,220
 As a matter of fact, they were right in the next booth.

156
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:03,860
 Oh, sure, Willie.

157
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:04,860
 But they were.

158
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,540
 No, Willie. We know.

159
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:11,260
 Listen, you guys, I tell you, George and Goddess were sitting right in that booth not over five minutes ago.

160
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:14,300
 Well, if you didn't have to make things up just to be important...

161
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,300
 Hey, Hank.

162
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,300
 What, Homer?

163
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,820
 Willie's half right.

164
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,580
 Here's George's algebra book.

165
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:20,940
 Let's see.

166
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,820
 That's George's algebra book, all right?

167
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:25,820
 I'd know that touch of stain anywhere.

168
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,580
 You see, I was telling the truth.

169
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:30,300
 But it all proves, well, I mean,

170
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,460
 proves that just George was here, not glad.

171
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:33,620
 Hey, Henry, be careful.

172
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,300
 You dropped something out of the book.

173
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,300
 What's he?

174
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,300
 Oh, what?

175
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,420
 He looks like a girl's writing.

176
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:41,380
 Well, I'm surprised that you know it's not

177
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:43,220
 right to read somebody else's mail.

178
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:45,740
 Newspaper men are supposed to read personal mail.

179
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:47,180
 It's a matter of principle.

180
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:47,740
 Just the same.

181
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:48,980
 I don't think you ought to read it.

182
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:51,780
 Henry, doesn't it look familiar to you?

183
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:54,380
 Homer, if you think I think Gladys wrote it, you're wrong.

184
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:58,100
 And besides, lots of girls use green ink on purple paper.

185
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:02,780
 Boy, is this hot? Listen.

186
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:06,460
 - Well, I don't think you should. - Please believe me.

187
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:09,300
 This whole thing is just a misunderstanding.

188
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:13,220
 No matter who I go out with, it's always you I'm thinking of.

189
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:15,540
 Boy, I mean that Gladys.

190
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:18,020
 As for that party you may have seen me with,

191
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:22,180
 I just want you to know that that party means nothing at all to me.

192
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:23,700
 In fact, less than nothing.

193
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:26,340
 Did you hear that, Henry?

194
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,420
 So what, Homer?

195
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:32,140
 Gladys is old enough to make up her own mind about who she wants to go out with.

196
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:34,380
 What an item this will make for my column.

197
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,500
 Willie, I won't let you print that letter.

198
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,220
 Give it to me.

199
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:39,140
 I won't let him put something in here.

200
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:41,180
 Put something in here.

201
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:42,500
 Let go of the company.

202
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,500
 You guys.

203
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,100
 Hello, George.

204
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:46,700
 Here you are, Henry.

205
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,340
 You can have it.

206
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:48,340
 Wait a minute, will we?

207
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:50,340
 I did I leave my algebra book around here?

208
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:52,340
 Ah, algebra book?

209
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,340
 What kind?

210
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:55,340
 The kind you're holding in your hand.

211
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:56,340
 Let's have it.

212
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:57,340
 Hey Gladys, here it is.

213
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:58,340
 I found it.

214
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,340
 Oh, I'm glad George.

215
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,340
 Hello, boys.

216
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,340
 Oh, Gladys.

217
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:03,340
 Boy, am I glad I found this book.

218
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:05,340
 There's something pretty important in it.

219
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:06,340
 Hey, Gladys.

220
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:07,340
 I should say.

221
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:08,340
 That's Gladys.

222
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,340
 It isn't here.

223
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,340
 Well, are you sure?

224
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,340
 My goodness, George.

225
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:13,340
 Don't tell me you've lost it.

226
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:16,340
 Oh, I put it right here in the chapter on binomial theorems.

227
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:20,340
 Henry, is that my letter here holding this?

228
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:22,340
 Well, what do you know?

229
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:24,340
 [audience laughing]

230
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:26,340
 So it is.

231
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:28,340
 Come on Homer, not so fast.

232
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:30,340
 This letter's been opened.

233
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:32,340
 I'm gonna punch you right in the nose, Henry.

234
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:34,340
 Henry, you opened a personal letter.

235
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,340
 Gladys, I never--

236
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:36,340
 That's the lowest thing I ever heard.

237
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:37,340
 You don't understand, I don't think--

238
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:39,340
 I think I do understand.

239
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:40,340
 You do?

240
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:43,340
 Yes, and you can just go to the baseball game without me.

241
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:44,340
 Come on, June.

242
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:45,340
 Gladys, if you'll just listen--

243
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:47,340
 Oh, just listen, Gladys!

244
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:49,340
 Oh, boy.

245
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:52,340
 Well, he went to tell George you were the one who read the letter.

246
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:55,340
 Oh, or how could I? You know what a temper George has.

247
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:58,340
 You could have told him it was a matter of principle.

248
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:01,340
 It was also a matter of principle to keep from getting slogged.

249
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:04,340
 I hope I can remember how that letter went.

250
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:06,340
 Well, you're not going to print that letter.

251
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:08,340
 Well, sure I am, and with a head loss.

252
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:10,340
 Listen, will he? Why involve innocent people?

253
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:11,340
 By who?

254
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:13,340
 Well, like Gladys.

255
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:16,740
 I don't think I'm going to kill a big story like this, do you? I owe it to my reader.

256
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:17,340
 Look, Willie.

257
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:19,340
 Nothing doing. It's my duty to print it.

258
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:22,340
 I suppose you know George wouldn't like it.

259
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:23,040
 George?

260
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,040
 Sure.

261
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,840
 It's his personal mail you're making public.

262
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,640
 Henry, add a friendship to you, I'll sit on the story.

263
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,640
 You will?

264
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,840
 Gee, thanks, Willie.

265
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,140
 But you'll have to do me a favor.

266
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,340
 Anything you say, Willie?

267
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:36,040
 Just name.

268
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:39,740
 Well, I have to go over to Abbott City early tomorrow to cover the Teacher's Convention.

269
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:43,300
 I want you to deliver my column to the print shop at school tomorrow.

270
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:43,900
 Is that all?

271
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,460
 Consider it done, Lily.

272
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:47,300
 OK, here's a column.

273
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,540
 Either way.

274
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:49,300
 Yes, Lily?

275
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,500
 Supposed to be there at 7.30.

276
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,260
 What in the morning?

277
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,380
 7.30.

278
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:56,140
 Don't forget, we made a bargain.

279
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:58,420
 I don't know if it was such a bargain.

280
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:01,300
 OK, Lily, it'll be there at 7.30.

281
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,460
 Well, I'll see you guys.

282
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:04,620
 Be sure it's there on time.

283
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,140
 Boy, Henry.

284
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:08,100
 I'll admit it's pretty early in the morning.

285
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:12,420
 morning it's the middle of the night. Homer it won't kill you to get up early

286
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:17,340
 one morning. Maybe not but it shouldn't do me any good. Well Willie thinks he's such

287
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:22,940
 a big shot with his column. Look at this Homer he can't even spell. Why? What do

288
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:29,020
 you spell success? S-U-C-C-E-S-S.

289
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:33,020
 And he calls himself a journalist.

290
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:35,020
 Go on and change it, him.

291
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:37,020
 Cross out a seat.

292
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:41,020
 Homeless success is supposed to have two seats.

293
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:44,020
 But it's not supposed to have two wesses on the end.

294
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:46,020
 Are you sure?

295
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:48,020
 Are you?

296
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:52,020
 Why don't we play safe and cross out a C and a Niss?

297
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:55,020
 Good idea.

298
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,020
 There.

299
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:59,780
 There. Yeah, it looks much better.

300
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:04,220
 It does it that. Charlie Clark's success.

301
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:09,300
 A bunch of the boys gathered at Charlie's house to watch him shave.

302
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:12,620
 This is the second time this semester.

303
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:17,940
 Charlie has high hopes of a mustache in the near future.

304
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:21,860
 Pretty sensation.

305
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:24,860
 But do you know what I have a good notion to do with Willie's column?

306
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:25,360
 Why?

307
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,860
 Let everyone know how...

308
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:30,360
 Well, let them know the kind that Guy George Bigelow is.

309
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,860
 But you might not like it.

310
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,860
 That's the point, Homer. That's the point.

311
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:35,860
 Hand me that pencil.

312
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:46,860
 You hear your egg, Sam?

313
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:47,860
 Mm-hmm.

314
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:48,860
 Oh, thank you, Ollie.

315
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:52,860
 Sam, you know my rule about reading the morning times at the table.

316
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:55,860
 This is yesterday's Centerville High Lowdown.

317
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:59,860
 I was just reading Willie Marshall's column in the school paper.

318
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:02,860
 By the way, Sam, Frank Bigelow called you. He wants you to call him right back.

319
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:04,860
 All right, Alice, in just a minute.

320
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,860
 Listen to this, will you?

321
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,860
 Names in the news.

322
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:11,860
 President Truman and General MacArthur.

323
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,860
 What else did he say?

324
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:14,860
 That's all.

325
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,660
 I guess that's Alice.

326
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:21,780
 What Centivell High student with the initials G.V.

327
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:24,620
 who recently with Natalie Bishop

328
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:28,100
 is now being seen in the company of what unsuspecting girl

329
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,180
 does she know she's taking a chance of being

330
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,380
 tossed aside like an old shoe tree?

331
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:34,140
 (laughing)

332
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:35,940
 Oh, this is priceless.

333
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,820
 The popular Centivell citizen Will Brown

334
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,660
 and father of popular Homer Brown

335
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:40,860
 has been raising the question

336
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:43,060
 with his popular wife Mrs. Brown

337
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:45,700
 over the matter of too much starch in his college.

338
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:50,700
 No! I'd give a million dollars to see Wilboff's basement he meets.

339
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,700
 Oh, Alice, I'm in here. You are?

340
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:59,700
 Yeah, listen. Mr. Orrit's popular centerville lawyer and father of the popular Henry Orrit.

341
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:04,700
 Attended a movie yesterday evening with his wife the popular Mrs. Orrit.

342
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,700
 What's so funny about that?

343
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,700
 Oh, now where's your sense of humor, Alice?

344
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,700
 Oh, I'm glad it starts you, Ms. Orrit's.

345
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:13,700
 I just hope the Bigelow's enjoy it when they read it.

346
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:14,940
 The Bigelow.

347
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,940
 Yes, Sam, the Bigelow's.

348
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,940
 Good heavens, I forgot about that.

349
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:20,740
 And I told him you had to work.

350
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:21,740
 You didn't.

351
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:26,180
 Maybe you can convince Frank that it's a habit of yours taking work to the movies.

352
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:30,820
 Things have come to a pretty pass when a person can go to a movie without the whole town knowing about it.

353
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,020
 Oh my goodness, Sam.

354
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:33,020
 What is it, Alice?

355
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:35,620
 Do you think that's what Frank Bigelow's been calling you about?

356
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:38,660
 Frank would never read the school paper.

357
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:40,060
 I don't think.

358
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:42,860
 Don't forget Joy's probably brought the paper home.

359
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:44,260
 What am I going to say to Frank?

360
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:45,860
 I don't know, dear.

361
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:48,360
 How did Willie find out we were at the movies?

362
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,360
 Who?

363
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,360
 Edward!

364
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,860
 Sam, don't blame Henry.

365
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,360
 Willie was at the movies, too.

366
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,360
 Were you calling my father?

367
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:00,360
 I was just about to leave for school if that's what's on your mind.

368
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:03,860
 It was nothing, Henry, and answer that on your way out.

369
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:07,360
 Is that it possible that Frank won't see the paper?

370
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,360
 Hello?

371
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,360
 Hello, Henry?

372
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,360
 Oh, hello, Gladys.

373
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,860
 Is Willy there?

374
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:13,360
 Willy?

375
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:13,860
 Yes.

376
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:14,360
 No.

377
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:14,860
 Oh.

378
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:16,360
 What do you want him for?

379
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,860
 Did you see his column in yesterday's paper?

380
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:19,860
 Why you have--

381
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:22,360
 I just like to give him a piece of my mind.

382
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:27,360
 I've been working my fingers to the bone, trying to help George make up with Natalie Bishop.

383
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,360
 You heard?

384
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:28,860
 Sure.

385
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:32,360
 She was angry because he heard that George was running around with other girls.

386
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:32,860
 Oh.

387
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:37,860
 I even helped him write a perfectly wonderful letter that couldn't help but bring them together again.

388
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:40,860
 And now Willy is going and spoiled the whole thing.

389
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:42,180
 You got Gladys.

390
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:44,020
 Poor George.

391
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:45,420
 Poor George?

392
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:47,820
 Well, I'll have to hang up now, Henry.

393
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,100
 What's your hurry, Gladys?

394
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,620
 I've got to go find George.

395
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:53,260
 At a time like this, he needs someone.

396
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:54,460
 Henry.

397
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:55,420
 Listen, Gladys.

398
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:56,620
 Goodbye, Henry.

399
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:58,060
 [COUGHING]

400
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,060
 Hey, Henry.

401
00:15:59,060 --> 00:15:59,740
 Hi, Homer.

402
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:01,540
 About those things we put in Willie's car.

403
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:03,180
 No, I just ran into George Bigelow,

404
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:04,740
 and I thought you better know.

405
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:05,540
 So?

406
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:07,980
 George says that he personally single-handed

407
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:10,380
 will make hand burger out of whoever wrote that thing

408
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:17,380
 in the car. Oh boy. And we got looking for Willie Marshall right now.

409
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:36,380
 And now getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldrich. It's later the same morning and

410
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:44,800
 the scene opens in Mr. Olridge's office. Hello. Hello. Can I please speak to Mr.

411
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:51,560
 Olridge? Oh, chew Alice. Hello. I couldn't say I didn't recognize your voice. Maybe we had a bad connection.

412
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,720
 I'm sure he's seen that thing in the paper.

413
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,040
 Did he sound angry?

414
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,440
 Well, he was a little excited.

415
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,920
 What are you going to say to him?

416
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:12,320
 I think I'd better give him a little time to cool off.

417
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:15,280
 I don't know why you don't call him right away and get it over.

418
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,920
 Alice, I hope you don't think I'm afraid of Frank Bigelow.

419
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,120
 Dear, I didn't say that.

420
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,280
 Because after all, I haven't done anything criminal.

421
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:21,800
 I know.

422
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,960
 But if you think I have any fear of speaking to him,

423
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,240
 I'll certainly call him.

424
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,960
 When said?

425
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,440
 First thing in the morning.

426
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:38,440
 [Music]

427
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,440
 Are you sure he didn't get past your home?

428
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:45,440
 I haven't been watching the entrance for 40 minutes. He can't be in school unless he can't early.

429
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,440
 Were you to the print shop?

430
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:51,440
 Yeah, he hasn't been there yet. We'd better make sure we get a hold of Willie before George does.

431
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,440
 Gladys is looking for Willie too.

432
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,760
 Boy if Gladys finds out I had anything to do with that column

433
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:02,340
 She'll never look me in the face again. And if George finds out she won't recognize your face

434
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:07,080
 Why don't think George is really that sore do you

435
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:15,040
 Do you I know is that George hit Toby Smith once and Toby was out of school for three days?

436
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:18,720
 He was and George like Toby

437
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,360
 Homer will you quit exaggerating

438
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:28,800
 There's only one thing for us to do get transfer to Abbott City High. We have to get rid of Willie

439
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,520
 get rid of him you mean

440
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:35,040
 For good no

441
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:39,880
 No, we've got to keep him out of sight for a few days till George and Natalie make up

442
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:45,640
 How are you gonna do that? I don't know I'll have to think about it. Hi fellas. Willie how

443
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,720
 How was the convention yesterday?

444
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:52,960
 Pretty dull. How would you like to spend the whole day with teachers?

445
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,320
 We did.

446
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,120
 Not the same thing.

447
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,720
 You guys turned my column in on time yesterday?

448
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,320
 Sure. How did it look?

449
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,720
 It certainly did, Willie.

450
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,320
 Well, I guess I'll go down on the print shop and look at a copy.

451
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,000
 The print shop will... Willie...

452
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,120
 You don't want to do that. I don't.

453
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,120
 How did I turn?

454
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,320
 - Well, Willie. - Well, thanks.

455
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,920
 Come on, you guys, quick problem. Let me pass.

456
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,720
 Guys, Willie, who's crowded?

457
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,720
 You are. No over will you?

458
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,080
 Willie.

459
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,080
 Why?

460
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,720
 How do you feel?

461
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,880
 I feel fine.

462
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,960
 I think he looks a little pale.

463
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,840
 I do? Oh, it's probably nothing.

464
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:35,880
 I don't know him. There are all kinds of things floating around that a person could catch.

465
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,800
 You guys think it's a little warm?

466
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,200
 No, as a matter of fact, it's a little chilly.

467
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,840
 Gee, maybe I got a fever.

468
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,720
 He was a little flushed.

469
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,520
 He just said I was pale.

470
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,200
 Fastest change I ever saw.

471
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:53,200
 I don't feel so good.

472
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,200
 Maybe I'd better see the nurse.

473
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,200
 That's a slow idea, Willie.

474
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,200
 And we'd better hurry while you're still able to walk.

475
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,200
 Well, I feel terrible.

476
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,200
 And?

477
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,200
 Yes, Willie.

478
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,200
 Can I lean on you?

479
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:14,200
 Uh-huh.

480
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:17,120
 Look all right, Willie. What's the matter with you?

481
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,960
 I've got symptoms, Miss Fox.

482
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,640
 Symptoms? What kind?

483
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,120
 Well, that's the frightening part. I don't know.

484
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,880
 Oh, that's the most dangerous kind.

485
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,000
 It is? Oh, boy.

486
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,960
 Hey, Ray, Homer. Are you also victims of this rare malady?

487
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,240
 Oh, no, Miss Fox.

488
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,640
 No, we just helped Willie tear off.

489
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,680
 I see. Stick out your tongue, Willie.

490
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,880
 Stick it out.

491
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,840
 Eh.

492
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,480
 Oh, dear me.

493
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,480
 Ah.

494
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,280
 Have you had any cold lately?

495
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,980
 Ah.

496
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:48,980
 How about headaches?

497
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:50,080
 Do you have had them?

498
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,280
 Ah-hah.

499
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:54,080
 Very well, Willie.

500
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,980
 You might put your tongue back now.

501
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:56,780
 Ah-hah.

502
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:59,680
 Thanks, Miss Fox.

503
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,280
 What do you think I have?

504
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,080
 Willie, I think you have a very severe case

505
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,080
 of the ancient history.

506
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:06,880
 What?

507
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,780
 Patients with symptoms like yours usually have that melody.

508
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:12,180
 I beg your pardon?

509
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:16,180
 We also get quite a few algebra cases and some Spanish cases.

510
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:18,180
 So what class have you got?

511
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:20,180
 I got study.

512
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:23,180
 Well, maybe I better send you home.

513
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:36,180
 Oh my goodness, isn't anyone going to get the phone?

514
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:38,180
 I've been answering it all day.

515
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:41,180
 Frankly, whether I'm not expecting any calls.

516
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:43,580
 I don't think anyone will be calling me.

517
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:45,580
 I suppose I'll have to answer it.

518
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:47,580
 I'm sure it isn't for me.

519
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:50,380
 Henry, I really think one of us should have taken the phone.

520
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:50,880
 Yes, sir.

521
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,980
 I guess I should.

522
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:53,080
 Who?

523
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,080
 Bigelow?

524
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,680
 Oh, just a moment.

525
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,680
 George.

526
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:59,580
 You see, I told you it wasn't for me.

527
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:00,880
 A mother, Alice.

528
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,880
 It's for you, Sam.

529
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,280
 Frank Bigelow.

530
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,380
 Well, I suppose I might as well get it over with.

531
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:08,380
 Sammy, you haven't spoken to him yet?

532
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:10,580
 It kept slipping my mind, Alice.

533
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:13,580
 I wouldn't blame him if he were angry now.

534
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:15,580
 Hello Frank.

535
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:18,580
 Hello Sam. Good heavens, I haven't tried to get all of you French.

536
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:23,580
 I know Frank, I'm awfully sorry. Look Frank, why don't we get together for bridge tonight?

537
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:24,580
 What?

538
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:27,580
 And maybe make a weekly game of it. It's always a pleasure to play with you.

539
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:29,580
 Well thanks, Sam. I like that.

540
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:30,580
 Good?

541
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:37,580
 And listen, Sam, there isn't even calling you. I had a rush deal to develop a completely new corporate setup.

542
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:43,080
 It was a big job and since I couldn't get all of you, I had to call in Anderson.

543
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,880
 Oh, sorry Sam, but I couldn't wait.

544
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,480
 Oh, that's... alright Frank.

545
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,680
 We'll see you about seven for bridge seven.

546
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:54,580
 Sure, let's get an early start so we can have a nice long evening.

547
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:56,580
 Oh, sure Frank.

548
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:59,480
 Oh, by the way it's Henry there. Henry, your son.

549
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,680
 Oh, of course.

550
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:03,280
 Will you put him on the phone George wants to talk to us.

551
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,280
 Alright Frank.

552
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,280
 Henry, fella whole.

553
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:09,880
 - Telephone father, Pry? - Yes, George Bigelow.

554
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,080
 George?

555
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:14,480
 Well, she was father, couldn't you say I'm sick, or not home, or that I--

556
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,880
 - Nonsense, Henry. I don't know what's happening with you and George,

557
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:21,080
 but I can tell you if you have a disagreeable job to do,

558
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,880
 get it over at once. That's my motto.

559
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,380
 [laughter]

560
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:28,280
 - And now on. - Yes, sir.

561
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,080
 - Here's the phone.

562
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,480
 - Hello, George. - Listen, Henry, over.

563
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:37,100
 I found out about the whole thing and let me tell you what's going to happen to you wise guy. Oh, yeah

564
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:41,960
 Yeah, I'm going to come over and put you right in the nose. All right, George. All right

565
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:47,700
 Come on over. Let's make it a nose and I'll put your right back

566
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:52,460
 I'm pretty mad myself after what you did to me and glad it

567
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:56,420
 Let me tell you a thing or two about now

568
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:03,260
 You can't tell me a thing about Gladys.

569
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:05,260
 What about her?

570
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:14,260
 I'm leaving, Mother.

571
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:15,260
 Where are you going?

572
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:17,260
 In the baseball game, remember?

573
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:19,260
 Oh, who are you going with, Gladys?

574
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:20,260
 No, Mother.

575
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:22,260
 Gladys is going with Homer.

576
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:23,260
 Oh, Natalie?

577
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:25,260
 Then Natalie's going with Willie.

578
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:27,260
 Then who are you going with?

579
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:29,260
 Well, I...

580
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:31,260
 Excuse me mother

581
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:33,260
 Hot in there!

582
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:35,260
 I'm in the right window, George!

583
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:37,260
 I mean, right when is yours?

584
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:38,260
 George!

585
00:24:38,260 --> 00:25:06,260
 [Music]

586
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:13,260
 The Eldridge family can view through the worldwide facilities of the United States Armed Forces Radio Service.

587
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:16,020
 (dramatic music)

588
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:18,600
 (upbeat music)

589
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,360
 (dramatic music)

590
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,940
 (lively music)

591
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:26,520
 (lively music)

592
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:29,100
 (upbeat music)

593
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:31,680
 (upbeat music)

594
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:58,680
 (music)
