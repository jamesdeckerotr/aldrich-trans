1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 The Oldridge family based on characters originated by Clifford Goldsmith and starring Ezra Stone as Henry with Jackie Kalk as Homer.

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,500
 Henry! Henry Oldridge!

3
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:18,500
 Coming, mother!

4
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:21,480
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

5
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:33,140
 And now for the Olridge family.

6
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:35,640
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

7
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:54,220
 The phrase "never a dull moment" certainly describes a day in the life of a typical teenage American boy like Henry Ulrich.

8
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:59,220
 And it more than describes what happens to everyone who comes in contact with him.

9
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:03,220
 The scene opens in the Ulrich front hall. It is late afternoon.

10
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:06,220
 You! Anybody here?

11
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:09,220
 Hello, Otter! Sam! What are you doing, Ho?

12
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:11,220
 I finished early at the office. Where have you been, Otter?

13
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:14,220
 Why, out. Just out.

14
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:17,220
 - Do you have a good time? - Lovely.

15
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:20,220
 As soon as I take my hat off, dear, I'll make us a cup of tea.

16
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:22,220
 That'll be nice.

17
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:24,220
 Was... what, anyone with you?

18
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:26,220
 Where, dear?

19
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:30,220
 - Out. - No. No, I was all by myself.

20
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:33,220
 Oh. Not that I care where you went, Alice.

21
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:37,220
 Naturally, your time is your own, but you look a little funny.

22
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:40,220
 I do. Well, Sam. - Yes?

23
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:43,220
 That is... did you have an interesting day, dear?

24
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:46,220
 - That's good. - Did you?

25
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:50,220
 Oh, yes, I had the most... I'll go and make the tea.

26
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:52,220
 Alice, where were you?

27
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:57,220
 Well, Sam, I wasn't going to tell you just yet, but I'm so excited I'd been to an auction sale.

28
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:59,220
 I hope you didn't buy anything.

29
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:02,220
 Now, do you know perfectly well I bought something?

30
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:04,220
 Oh, right, let's have it.

31
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:06,220
 Well, they're sort of chairs.

32
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:07,220
 What kind of chairs?

33
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:11,220
 They're the kind that they'd be just grand in our...

34
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:14,520
 Grand in our... well, any place we put them.

35
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,520
 How many chairs?

36
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,720
 How many?

37
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:21,620
 Sander, genuine early American, and it sounded as though they went back to 1840.

38
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:22,420
 They went where?

39
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:26,820
 And they were awfully cheap, dear, and there's a good deal of wood on them, I know that.

40
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:27,520
 I see.

41
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,720
 But, dear, before you set your heart on them, they may not be chairs.

42
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,720
 What?

43
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,620
 Sam, I was way at the back of the hall and there was a woman with a feather right in front of you.

44
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,220
 So, I'm not quite sure what I bought.

45
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:39,220
 What?

46
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:41,220
 In the living room, Henry.

47
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,220
 Oh boy, have you heard about the Browns?

48
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:44,220
 Have you heard about the Browns?

49
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,220
 What Browns?

50
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:47,220
 The Homer Browns, gee, was guess what happened to them?

51
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:48,220
 What happened?

52
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:49,220
 I don't know.

53
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,220
 What?

54
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:56,220
 I just ran into Willie Marshall and he said something practically unbelievable happened to them.

55
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:57,220
 And he didn't say what it was?

56
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:58,220
 He doesn't know either.

57
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:02,220
 But boy, it's all over town, so somebody ought to know, I'm going to phone in!

58
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:06,220
 That's odd. I had lunch with Will Brown today, he didn't mention anything.

59
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:08,220
 - Whatever's happened to them must have...

60
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:11,220
 Oh my goodness, is that a truck pulling into our drive?

61
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,220
 - It looks like it. - Send that must be my chairs.

62
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:16,220
 - Alice, walk, don't run! - Come and see them, dear!

63
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:21,220
 - 117 Elm Street, all rich. - That's right. Just set them right down here.

64
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:25,220
 Oh, my, are they beautiful?

65
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:30,220
 - All right, Alice, what are they? - Looks, and they are chairs, ladder backs.

66
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:34,220
 - Wow, here, lady, sign here. - Yes, of course.

67
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:36,220
 - Thanks. - Good-bye.

68
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:38,220
 And thank you.

69
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:42,740
 Sam, look, five dining room chairs.

70
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:46,740
 Genuine antiques. Aren't they beautiful?

71
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:50,380
 - Grand? Just grand? - I'm so glad you like them, dear.

72
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:52,380
 Oh, I do, I do.

73
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:55,380
 They're just one small point I'd like to bring up.

74
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:56,460
 Yes?

75
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:59,060
 We already have a set of dining room chairs.

76
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:01,060
 Now, isn't that just like a man?

77
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:02,300
 It is.

78
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:05,380
 Need in all kinds of places we can use them.

79
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:06,380
 Such as?

80
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:07,380
 Such as...

81
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:11,380
 And besides, Sandy's chairs are really a wonderful investment.

82
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:12,380
 Oh, they?

83
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:13,380
 Of course they are, dear.

84
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:17,380
 Antiques always have a high resale value, didn't you know?

85
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:20,380
 And you always said, "I don't have a good head for business."

86
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:22,380
 But Alice, come on, dear.

87
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,380
 Let's go in the living room and take a look around.

88
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,380
 Oh, four.

89
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:27,380
 Maybe there's something we can get rid of to make room for the chair.

90
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:30,380
 Alice, we're not going to start throwing out my favorite furniture.

91
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:32,380
 No kidding, Agnes.

92
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:34,380
 Oh, boy.

93
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:36,380
 Well, goodbye, Agnes.

94
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:40,380
 She was the way Agnes understands it's Homer's uncle who died.

95
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,380
 Oh, that's too bad.

96
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:46,380
 No, it isn't. He left a will or something. Agnes says she hears the Browns of inherited a couple of fortunes.

97
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,380
 Henry, aren't you being rather mercenary?

98
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:50,380
 I know, but...

99
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:52,380
 Well, she was, do you realize what that means?

100
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:54,380
 Dear, you're entirely too excited.

101
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:58,380
 The mother, don't you agree it's pretty wonderful when your best friend suddenly becomes successful?

102
00:04:58,380 --> 00:04:59,380
 I'll answer the phone.

103
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:01,680
 Henry, I want you to go and comb your hair.

104
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,680
 Comb my hair?

105
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,180
 Just when Homer's falling into some money?

106
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,380
 Hello?

107
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,180
 Hello, Sam. This is Will Brown.

108
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,480
 Well, I just heard the news.

109
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,480
 Which brother was it?

110
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,380
 What's that?

111
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:13,580
 Or was it your uncle?

112
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:14,680
 Who's uncle?

113
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,180
 Is this Sam Aldrich?

114
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:18,780
 Will, didn't you just come into some money?

115
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:19,680
 Well, yes.

116
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,680
 And I want you to know how sorry I am.

117
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,380
 Sam, what are you talking about?

118
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:25,880
 There's nothing new wrong with my brother.

119
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,780
 Oh. Then what's the story that's going around town?

120
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:30,540
 How should I know you tell me?

121
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:31,540
 Never mind.

122
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:34,860
 Look, Sam, why don't you and Alice join us for dinner at the mansion house tonight?

123
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:35,820
 The mansion house?

124
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,220
 Hana, Sam, hana.

125
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:38,540
 That sounds like a good idea.

126
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:40,420
 That is provided I can reserve a table.

127
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:43,180
 Well, Alice and I can provide the chairs.

128
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:45,860
 That's funny you should mention chairs, Sam.

129
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:47,580
 That's where we picked up some money today.

130
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:48,300
 Oh?

131
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:52,260
 Elizabeth unloaded an old set of chairs on some sucker at an auction sale.

132
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:56,420
 Well, now, well, isn't that...

133
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:58,620
 Well, what was that again?

134
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:02,620
 The five old chairs, eh, that we got stung on 15 years ago,

135
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,920
 and they've been kicking around in our attic ever since.

136
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,820
 Uh, well...

137
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:08,620
 Some fella told us they were genuine entities.

138
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:11,120
 Well, what exactly did these chairs look like?

139
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,120
 I'm short of early American ladder bag jobs with straw seats.

140
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,620
 And knobs all the way up the legs?

141
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:18,620
 [chuckles]

142
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:21,120
 I'll give you a stage every song.

143
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,120
 Yeah.

144
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:22,620
 [laughter]

145
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:26,120
 I'd sure like to see the expression on the face of the poor guy that got him.

146
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,620
 Well, I don't think we'll be able to make it for dinner tonight after all.

147
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:30,620
 No, I'm not.

148
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:34,120
 Frankly, I suddenly don't have much of an appetite.

149
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:49,120
 Henry, never mind making whirlpools with the cream. Just eat your cereal.

150
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,120
 Sure, Father. I'm eating it. Only, frankly, I'm a little worried about Mother.

151
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,120
 What about me?

152
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:57,120
 Ever since last night, you've been looking kind of sad.

153
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,120
 Henry, finish your breakfast. You'll be late for school.

154
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,120
 No, I won't, Mother. There's plenty of time before Homer gets here.

155
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,120
 Homer's coming over?

156
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,120
 Sure to call for me. Mother, look.

157
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,120
 Are you worried about something I've done?

158
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,120
 Of course not, Henry.

159
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:13,120
 Henry, will you run upstairs and get me a handkerchief?

160
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,120
 Isn't that a handkerchief there in your coat, Parker?

161
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,120
 Please get me another one.

162
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,120
 You want to, handkerchief?

163
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,120
 I feel a cole coming on.

164
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,120
 But, Father, please go!

165
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,120
 But please go!

166
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,120
 I don't want Henry to know a thing about those chairs.

167
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,120
 He doesn't think...

168
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,120
 And I don't want Homer to know about them either.

169
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,120
 You've shot straight back to Will with the news.

170
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,120
 Now, Sam...

171
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,120
 Don't you understand I'll never be able to look

172
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,120
 Will Brown in the eye again.

173
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,120
 Is that why you hid the chairs down in the coal bin?

174
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,120
 Yes.

175
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,120
 I want you to get rid of them today, do you understand?

176
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,120
 But, Sam, have you looked at it this way?

177
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,120
 The longer you keep antiques, the more valuable they become.

178
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,120
 But Alice, those chairs are not antiques.

179
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,720
 They will be if we keep them long enough.

180
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,920
 Alice.

181
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,220
 Here's your handkerchief father and some aspirin.

182
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:55,120
 Aspen, what's off?

183
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,020
 She was your cold.

184
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,320
 Here, I'll pour you a glass of water.

185
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,320
 Henry, I don't need any water.

186
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,320
 You mean you just swallow them straight?

187
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,320
 Hey, Henry.

188
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,920
 I'll be right there, and I'll--

189
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,920
 --come by everybody.

190
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,520
 Henry, come back here.

191
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,320
 Well, what is it, Father?

192
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:12,220
 Henry, naturally, if you're walking to school with Homer,

193
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:13,720
 you'll be talking to him.

194
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,120
 Sure.

195
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,020
 Well, then remember this.

196
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:19,140
 If he asks you any questions about the family, you know nothing.

197
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,400
 Absolutely nothing.

198
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,000
 About what?

199
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,500
 Nothing.

200
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,300
 Nothing?

201
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,500
 Father, is something wrong?

202
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,780
 No, of course not, Henry.

203
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:28,820
 But no matter what, Homer asks you, just don't answer it.

204
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,820
 Hey, Henry, we're going to be late for school.

205
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:31,700
 I'm coming, Homer.

206
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:32,740
 Goodbye, everybody.

207
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:34,300
 Don't forget your books.

208
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,140
 I want Mother.

209
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:35,940
 Goodbye.

210
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:36,900
 Bye, Henry.

211
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,980
 Have a good life.

212
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:40,980
 Homer, are you asking me?

213
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:43,060
 Because of you all, I know nothing.

214
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:43,940
 About what?

215
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:44,580
 Never mind.

216
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:45,180
 Let's have a good life.

217
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:48,180
 Hey, you don't have to take the whole word.

218
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:50,180
 But look at the size bag you have.

219
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,180
 Boy, that's nothing.

220
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:53,180
 Will you see what I've got in my pocket?

221
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,180
 Yeah.

222
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:56,180
 Look, licorice, bubblegum, cigars.

223
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:57,180
 Cigars?

224
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:58,180
 The street.

225
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,180
 Cigars?

226
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:01,180
 Sure, they're solid chocolate.

227
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,180
 Boy, what happened?

228
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:05,180
 Although my father said your uncle didn't die after all.

229
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:07,180
 He didn't, but we had a windfall just the same.

230
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,180
 This morning my father called me and said,

231
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:13,180
 Homer, how about stepping up your allowance this week?

232
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:14,180
 He did?

233
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:17,780
 And listen, why don't you ask your father to do the same thing?

234
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:20,780
 Now wait Homer, what are you trying to pump me about?

235
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:21,780
 Pump you?

236
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:22,780
 How?

237
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:24,580
 I've noticed, I've noticed.

238
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:26,780
 All you've done is ask me questions.

239
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:29,380
 Why doesn't my father increase my allowance?

240
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:30,980
 Will I have a gumdrop?

241
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:32,380
 Shall we cross the street?

242
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:34,980
 Exactly what is it you're driving at?

243
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:36,780
 Are you crazy?

244
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,780
 See that, there's another question.

245
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:42,780
 Well let me tell you, my folks told me to keep my mouth shut

246
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:48,540
 shot and I'm going to you mean it's that bad. Homer if you'll change that from a

247
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:53,220
 question to a statement I'll tell you otherwise you'll just have to wonder okay

248
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:57,740
 things at your house are pretty bad aren't they I mean things are bad boy

249
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:01,980
 they sure are do you know what I overheard my mother tell my father last

250
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:06,540
 night she said she wouldn't ask him for one cent to run the house on for the next

251
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:11,500
 six weeks yeah and she said she had a good head for business too why'd she say

252
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,500
 I don't know anything like that.

253
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,500
 Maybe she's going to help my father out.

254
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,500
 She may be I ought to find a way to help out too.

255
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,500
 Henry, you're the very guy I want to talk to.

256
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,500
 How'd you like to go into business with me?

257
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,500
 What business?

258
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,500
 Look, I'm not asking you this. I'm telling you.

259
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,500
 Did you know there's a terrific demand for secondhand furniture in John?

260
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,500
 Huh?

261
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:35,500
 Whatever you can dig up, somebody is darn full enough to pay money for.

262
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:39,500
 Homer, since you're not asking me what I like to go into business with you,

263
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,500
 is yes I would.

264
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:53,500
 If you'll just come with me, Mr. Smith.

265
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,500
 Uh-huh.

266
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,500
 The chairs are right here in the cold bin.

267
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,500
 There they are.

268
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,500
 Uh-huh.

269
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,500
 As you see, they're ladder backs.

270
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,500
 Uh-huh.

271
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,500
 And quite old, I believe.

272
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,500
 Uh-huh.

273
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:10,500
 This is what I'll be perfectly honest with you. I paid $25 for them.

274
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,500
 Well, you got a good buy. These are valuable chairs.

275
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,500
 What?

276
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,500
 Yes, ma'am.

277
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:21,500
 You don't say, "Wait until my husband hears that. He insists I have no business sense."

278
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,500
 Uh, where's the sixth chair?

279
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,500
 I only have size.

280
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:28,500
 Oh, too bad. If you had the set of six, I could pay you $65 for them.

281
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,500
 You would as much as that.

282
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,500
 If you had six.

283
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,500
 Oh, my goodness.

284
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,500
 Five are worthless.

285
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,500
 Worthless.

286
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,500
 To me, they are.

287
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,500
 Oh, uh-huh.

288
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:44,500
 Now, wait. It just occurred to me, Mr. Smith, as the slightest possibility I might be able to get the other one.

289
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,500
 Yes?

290
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:50,500
 The couple who used to own the might have it kicking her. That is lying around.

291
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:03,100
 Homer, are you sure that auction sale is going on for two more days?

292
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:29,240
 Hi,

293
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,240
 Of course it was hand carved.

294
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:34,240
 Yeah, but the only thing carved on your bed is your initials.

295
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,240
 So why?

296
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:39,240
 Somebody might come along with the same initials and be crazy about it.

297
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:43,240
 But supposing you did get $100 for the darn thing, what would you sleep on?

298
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,240
 Who'd want to sleep?

299
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,240
 I know, but...

300
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:50,240
 And he decides, Henry, are we trying to raise money to help your folks?

301
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,240
 Yeah. Okay then.

302
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:55,240
 After all they've done for me, the least I can do in return is sleep on the floor.

303
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,240
 a floor.

304
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,240
 My father will certainly appreciate it.

305
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,240
 Henry, who's that out in the hall?

306
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,240
 I don't see anyone.

307
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,240
 There was a woman of some kind.

308
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,240
 She was sort of tiptoeing along.

309
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:08,240
 All of a sudden she slid into my mother's bedroom.

310
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,240
 She suppose it's a cleaning woman?

311
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,240
 Here she comes out again.

312
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,240
 Well, hello, boys.

313
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,240
 Is that you?

314
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:16,240
 Father and I have not been for a little visit with the browns.

315
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,240
 My, but a lovely room you have here, Homer.

316
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,240
 Well, my goodness.

317
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,240
 What's an animus' all, Rich?

318
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:27,240
 Homer, that little stool with a straw seat over there in the corner, it looks like...

319
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:30,240
 That's the seat part of an old chair we used to have.

320
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,240
 What?

321
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,240
 Well then, what's the matter?

322
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,240
 Homer, where's the rest of it?

323
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,240
 The back part?

324
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,240
 My father uses it for a pipe rack.

325
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,240
 You don't say...

326
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,240
 Oh, my...

327
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:46,240
 Homer, I... I suppose you're quite attached to that lovely little stool?

328
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,240
 No.

329
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:50,240
 She was, I only used it to rest my foot on when I'm shining my shoes.

330
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,240
 Really?

331
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,640
 Sure. How did they ever do that?

332
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:56,280
 Oh, that was wonderful.

333
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,580
 I wish my mother took that attitude.

334
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:01,420
 And the back of the chair is your father's typewriter?

335
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:03,380
 Sure. Well...

336
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:06,880
 Will you excuse me, boys? I'm going downstairs and speak to your father.

337
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:12,020
 Henry, do you think you're a folks have lost their home and they're moving in here with us?

338
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:14,220
 Gee, whiz.

339
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,420
 Gee.

340
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:17,560
 Homer, you're putting that old stool in the back?

341
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,860
 Sure. We're gonna sell it at the auction.

342
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,500
 - Matt Darnfett? - Why not?

343
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,740
 If it looked good to your mother,

344
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:24,340
 it might look good to somebody else.

345
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:26,620
 - You're crazy. - Now listen, Henry,

346
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:29,380
 do you really wanna help your folks, or don't you?

347
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:31,960
 (upbeat music)

348
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:37,800
 (audience applauding)

349
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:47,460
 (upbeat music)

350
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:53,700
 Yes, getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldrich.

351
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:59,380
 Alice and Sam Aldrich discover that the five antique chairs she had bought at auction were

 worthless without the sixth, which they are now trying to get from the Browns.

353
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:10,180
 As a result, Henry and Homer believe Henry's parents are in financial difficulties.

354
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,540
 The scene opens at the Browns.

355
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:14,060
 It is a little later the same day.

356
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:17,420
 I was saying, "Well, I've certainly become attached to that pipe rack of yours."

357
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:18,500
 "That darn thing?"

358
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,060
 "Yes, it sort of grows on you.

359
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:21,500
 Why, it was only five minutes ago.

360
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,860
 I first laid eyes on it."

361
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:25,180
 "It took fifteen years for it to grow on me."

362
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:26,220
 "Is that right?"

363
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,740
 "I certainly wish it were mine."

364
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:29,340
 "Well, Sam, you smoked cigars, don't you?"

365
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:31,260
 "Oh, I've suddenly taken up pipes."

366
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:32,460
 "I'm going here now."

367
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:34,620
 "I thought pipes made you deathly sick."

368
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:37,260
 "Well, they used to, but not anymore, Will."

369
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,380
 "Well, in here.

370
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,740
 And let me make your present."

371
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:40,220
 "What?"

372
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:41,900
 "Here's a pipe I've never touched.

373
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,180
 My wife's brother said it to me.

374
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:45,180
 I wouldn't smoke it with a ten-foot pole.

375
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:46,080
 But, well...

376
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,380
 It's your, Sam.

377
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:49,480
 And here's some new tobacco picked up.

378
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,880
 Yeah, fill it up for you.

379
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,780
 But you see, well...

380
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:56,180
 Sam, would I ever give you anything if I really wanted it?

381
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:58,080
 Yeah.

382
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,380
 I hope I haven't packed the tobacco into tight.

383
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:00,880
 Oh.

384
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,380
 Here's a light.

385
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:05,380
 Thank you, Will.

386
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:07,280
 Thank you very much.

387
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:10,780
 Now, there's a smoke with authority.

388
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:13,040
 (laughing)

389
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:18,320
 The only thing is, now I really need a place to keep this pipe.

390
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,560
 - What, Sam?

391
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,820
 - I'll buy that pipe rack from you, Will.

392
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:22,660
 - Well...

393
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:24,160
 - Sam, did you...

394
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,420
 Will, what are you two so busy talking about?

395
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,360
 - Why, we're simply...

396
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,260
 - Sam, I never saw you smoke a pipe before.

397
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:33,100
 - You didn't?

398
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,860
 Well, you're seeing me do it now.

399
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:35,700
 (laughing)

400
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:36,540
 - What are they now?

401
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:37,700
 Is that in the kitchen with a little bit?

402
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:40,300
 - No, I just went back upstairs to...

403
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,900
 Sam, do you feel well?

404
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,560
 Yes, I feel...

405
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,800
 Isn't it just a little close in here?

406
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,040
 No, you don't notice it too.

407
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,140
 Let me go open the front door for a minute.

408
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:50,640
 Sam, it's gone.

409
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,640
 What's gone?

410
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,980
 The stool up in Homer's room,

411
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,740
 the other half of that pipe rack.

412
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:56,240
 It is?

413
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,240
 Yeah, don't you even care?

414
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,240
 Yeah.

415
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,740
 Sam, I'll tell you what.

416
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:04,980
 If you want that dog gone pipe rack so much, I'll sell it to you.

417
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:05,980
 Yes, sir.

418
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:08,980
 Give me a $10 bill and we'll call it square.

419
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,380
 Sam?

420
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,220
 Sam?

421
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:14,140
 Sam, speak to me.

 [MUSIC PLAYING]

423
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:25,420
 So sold for $0.25 to the boy with a lady in the sailor fan.

424
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:26,420
 She went.

425
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,700
 Now, just wait a minute while we get the next few items up

426

 on the track.

427
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:32,240
 Boy, Henry, did you see that $0.25

00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,900
 from my old left roller skater?

 Imagine aren't people done.

430
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,740
 Oh, say boy, they'll buy anything.

 Now we come to this very interesting item.

 Homer, it's your school.

433
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:43,540
 The one my mother was so crazy about.

434
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:46,780
 We have here folks a very valuable looking, uh...

435
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:49,220
 Well, it might make a fine milking stew.

436
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:50,980
 Or for shining shoes.

437
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:52,180
 Did I hear a bit of two?

438
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:53,620
 No, she was, I just said.

439
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:54,620
 Homer, keep quiet.

440
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,060
 He didn't say so.

 Who I have? Who'll make it three?

00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,420
 Oh, boy.

 Do I hear $3?

 Who'll make it three dollars?

446
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:04,260
 Sure, who'll make it three?

447
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:05,860
 You will find $3 I had.

 No!

00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:11,860
 - What are you doing? - $3 I'm bid for this unique and fascinating little item here.

 - Give me what I do. - No one says $4.00?

 - For me? - Going for $3.00?

 - Then it's costing me $3.00. - Oh, he finds my own stool.

 - What's happening? - We're the gentlemen who just came in, please find a seat.

457
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:34,860
 Perhaps he'd like to bid on this object.

458
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,860
 - Yeah. - Can't me somebody wants to buy it.

 The bid stands at $3.00. - Red, red, red, red.

 - What? - That's more like it.

 I can't see back that far.

 happened to know my father was having financial difficulties.

 No, Mr. Horridge.

00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:28,060
 It is.

 Now, can you take this too, brother?

00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:08,620
 Well, that reminds me of a chair I fixed once for my Aunt Hepsa bar.

00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:15,860
 Thank you.

530
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:19,220
 And that leaves me a clear profit of $40.

531
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:23,060
 And Sam, even you'll have to admit that's a very good business to you.

532
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:25,940
 Exactly how do you figure you cleared $40?

533
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:27,620
 That's simple arithmetic, dear.

534
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:31,340
 Twenty-five from sixty-five is forty, isn't it?

535
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:36,260
 Well, how about the ten dollars I paid will for the pipe rack?

536
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:37,620
 Oh, that.

537
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:41,100
 And the ten dollars I paid at the auction for the stool.

538
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:44,140
 My goodness, you mean I owe you twenty dollars more?

539
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:46,060
 Simple arithmetic, dear.

540
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:47,900
 Very well, here you are.

541
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:50,980
 That still leaves me a twenty dollar profit.

542
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:54,980
 Did I mention it cost twelve dollars to have that six chair repaired?

543
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:58,220
 $12. That leaves you eight.

544
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:03,720
 Well, eight dollars profit is eight dollars profit.

545
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:06,920
 I must get a cost to have the chairs carted up here to the house.

546
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:11,620
 Well, not very much, just four dollars and forty cents.

547
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:15,420
 You mean all I have left is three dollars and sixty cents?

548
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:17,120
 I'm afraid so, Alice.

549
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,920
 Perhaps after this you'll leave business to me.

550
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:23,360
 Sam, I have a clear profit of three dollars and sixty cents,

551
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,700
 and any business that doesn't operate in the red is a good business.

552
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:29,360
 Henry, where have you been?

553
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,000
 Henry, you're a little business, Steel.

554
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,860
 You're in, boy. Did we clean now?

555
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:33,740
 You too.

556
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:35,700
 And Henry has something to say to you.

557
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,040
 No, Mother.

558
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:40,300
 Homer had something to say. It was his idea. Go ahead, you say.

559
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,200
 Hey, you're a folks, Henry. You say?

560
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,400
 No, you.

561
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,040
 Well...

562
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:46,340
 Go on, Homer. Don't be bashful.

563
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:47,040
 Well...

564
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:51,680
 You've always been pretty nice to me, Mrs. Aldrich.

565
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:54,920
 Mr. Aldrich, you've been nice to me too.

566
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,420
 At times.

567
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:58,920
 And now that you've had some high luck

568
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,160
 and we've had some good luck,

569
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,760
 we'd like to give you half of what we've made.

570
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,460
 Homer, what are you talking about?

571
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:06,860
 Mother, I caught on.

572
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:09,260
 You didn't think you could keep it from me, didn't you?

573
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:10,500
 Keep what from you, Henry?

574
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,500
 Mr. Aldrich, Henry and I are in kids.

575
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,500
 We can read between the lines.

576
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,600
 Didn't we just see a whole load of your furniture

577
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,100
 being hauled away?

578
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:20,040
 Yes, dear. We sold it to Mr. Smith.

579
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,440
 That's what I mean.

580
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:25,540
 Gee, if you need money that bad, here, take this.

581
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:28,540
 Five dollars and twelve cents. Half of what we took him.

582
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:30,540
 Homer, we won't do anything of the kind.

583
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:32,540
 But, Father, that's the way Homer wants it.

584
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:36,540
 That's why he sold a valuable stool right out of his bedroom.

585
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,540
 What?

586
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:38,540
 Sure.

587
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:42,540
 Dear, that's very generous of you. Thank you very, very much.

588
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:47,540
 You're welcome, Mrs. Orridge. And I hope you don't have to sell any more of your stuff.

589
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:48,540
 Come on, Homer.

590
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:51,300
 But if you do, will you let us handle the deal for you?

591
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:54,240
 I think we could do a lot better than you could.

592
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,840
 Sam.

593
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,240
 And I thought I'd live to see everything.

594
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,340
 Sam?

595
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:01,340
 Oh, Alice, don't cry.

596
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:04,840
 Dear, I never knew boys could be so wonderful.

597
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:05,940
 Think of it.

598
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:08,840
 Sharing what they made 50/50.

599
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:09,940
 Yes.

600
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:12,980
 Dear, under the circumstances, don't you

601
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:15,440
 think we should do exactly as much for them?

602
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,740
 You mean give them half of your profit?

603
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:19,700
 Half of just 360?

604
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:22,780
 Oh, no, Sam, half of all the money we got for the chairs.

605
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:24,860
 What, Alice? What about our expenses?

606
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:27,300
 Sam, did the boys did up their expenses?

607
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:30,500
 Sometimes, dear, I think you don't know the first thing about business.

608
