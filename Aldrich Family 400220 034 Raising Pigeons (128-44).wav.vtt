 The Aldrich family,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
 starring as Reston,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 written by Clifford Goldsmith,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 brought to you by the makers of those

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
 delicious new desserts

00:00:47.000 --> 00:01:10.520
 putting. In the month of February you know, fall the birthdays of two great American presidents.

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.100
 We don't know, of course, whether Henry Aldrich will ever become president, but as the scene

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:21.100
 opens tonight in the Aldrich family living room, Henry has a birthday and other things on his mother.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:27.340
 Mother, if you could choose anything in the world for your birthday, what would you take?

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.820
 A million dollars. No mother, be reasonable. I can't give you as much as that.

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:38.860
 What would you like? Right at the moment, Henry, your mother would like a mink coat. A mink coat,

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:46.500
 father a mean coat how much would a thing like that cost how much do you have

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:53.020
 two dollars and thirty five cents oh but that's not important father no not at

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.460
 all but it isn't I've got a scheme all worked out I'll be able to get anything

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:02.500
 mother wants really dear it isn't anything more than you deserve mother could

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.100
 you loan me could you loan me two dollars there which one of us are you

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.820
 speaking. Oh not to you father. I realize I've stretched you to the breaking point as it is.

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:18.460
 I'm glad you're aware of that. How about it mother? How about what, dear? In case you don't

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:23.420
 know it, Alice, you're about to be stretched to the breaking point. What is it you want the two

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:29.100
 dollars for? To put with the money I have. I'm making an investment. I read a pamphlets see.

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:36.220
 It's got the easiest way I ever heard of to make money. What is it? Rabbits. I make up on. Raising

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:42.220
 rabbits. They'll double your money overnight. You don't say so. But they will, father, you can't lose.

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:47.100
 Where would we keep rabbits? In the basement. Well, we're not keeping rabbits in our basement.

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:53.020
 Read the pamphlet, mother. One fella started with just four rabbits, and in two years, he had 700.

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:59.100
 And do you think we're going to have 700 rabbits running all over our basement? Well, I'd make

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:04.300
 pens for them. And how would I get into the basement? You remember Henry that stray dog that stayed

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.300
 I had to ask you to feed her every day she was with us.

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:08.300
 But that was just one mother.

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.300
 I certainly wouldn't forget to feed 700.

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:12.300
 [laughter]

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.300
 Incidentally, who's going to pay for the feed for 700?

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.300
 Oh, they pay for it themselves.

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.300
 Oh, I see. Out of their own pockets?

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.300
 Father.

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.300
 Everything I suggest you take lightly.

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:26.300
 Oh, if you think I'm taking this lightly, you're quite mistaken.

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.300
 You're not going to spend any money on rabbits.

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.300
 But that's not what I want it for.

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.300
 I thought that was what you did want it for.

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:33.140
 - What was that?

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:34.900
 - Feeding pans for the rabbits.

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.220
 - For what rabbit?

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.940
 - For my rabbits, the ones I've got down in the cellar.

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.780
 (audience laughing)

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.020
 - You have 700 down there?

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.020
 - No, Father, just four.

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:46.180
 I'm only beginning.

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.620
 They're beauties, too.

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:49.620
 - Where did you get them, dear?

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.060
 - Happy Taylor game to me.

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.380
 - How did the Taylor Boy happen to do that?

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:54.460
 - I don't know.

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:56.460
 His folks just seemed to think we'd like them better

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:57.300
 than they would.

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.140
 (audience laughing)

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.980
 - I don't know.

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.020
 (audience laughing)

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:04.060
 - Yes.

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:05.620
 - How would you like to be generous, dear,

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.500
 and give them back to happy Taylor?

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.460
 - Mother, don't you want a birthday present?

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:11.540
 - Not as much as I want a home.

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:12.780
 - Well, if I give those back,

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.260
 I won't have anything at all.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:15.740
 - How about your dog?

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:16.740
 - He left.

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:18.660
 - Because of the rabbits?

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:19.820
 - But, Father, don't you want me

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:23.220
 to develop responsibility, so I'll take care of things

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:24.340
 and feed them?

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.380
 - Henry, we are not opposed to your developing

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.460
 all the responsibility you want to,

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.540
 But you'll have to find someone to take those rabbits.

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:32.500
 - Who is there?

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.020
 - Well how about Tommy Walsh?

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.820
 He has a much larger house than we have.

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:38.760
 - Well, could I give him the rabbits,

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.220
 but let him keep them here?

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:42.260
 (audience laughing)

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.820
 - And your mother and I could live with the wolves, is it?

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.940
 - My father, you have no idea how I've planned on this.

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:50.540
 It's supposing you go to the phone, dear,

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:53.580
 and see whether Tommy wouldn't like to have them now.

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.780
 - Henry, if you want a rabbit for a pet, that's one thing.

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.980
 But you're not going to raise rabbits in our basement for the purpose of making money.

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:02.380
 Now, please call the waltchers.

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:03.780
 No phone number.

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:05.780
 I hope they are an inn.

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:09.780
 Well, Alice, in one year we would have had rabbits in every room in the house.

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:12.580
 Sam, don't you think we might at least get Henry a dog?

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:14.780
 Alice, by tomorrow you'll have forgotten the whole thing.

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:15.780
 Perhaps.

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:18.780
 You never has kept it anything for more than 24 hours.

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:20.780
 Well, just the same, he might have kept it this.

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:23.180
 You mean you want him to raise rabbits?

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:25.480
 Well, as he says, it would develop character.

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:27.480
 Alice, let's have an understanding right now.

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:32.080
 Which do you want Henry to have character or a father a father, dear?

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:36.620
 What do you suppose that can be at the door probably mr. Hubbard I'll let him in

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:46.360
 Well, oh there, but evening what is it you want prepared? Oh the troubles out in the kitchen pipe under the sink

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:52.060
 No, Henry, will you take mr. Hubbard out and show him where that leak is sure thing

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:54.960
 Tell me what I'll say about the rabbit.

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:59.480
 His folks weren't in, but he'd be very glad to take the mother.

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:00.680
 This way, Mr. Hubbard.

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:02.380
 Yes, sir.

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:04.760
 You raised rabbits?

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:06.160
 I was going to.

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.560
 Here you are.

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:10.080
 There's the pipe that's dripping.

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:14.000
 Oh, on the weather of a ranch that'll fit that or not.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.920
 Want me to look in your bag for you?

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:17.680
 Yeah, no, thank you.

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:21.600
 It's a good thing you're getting out of this rabbit business.

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:22.840
 Don't you recommend it?

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:26.080
 I'd be a rich man now, but worn for rabbits.

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:27.040
 - What happened?

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:30.120
 - By the time it was over, even my wife left me.

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:31.120
 (audience laughs)

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:31.960
 - Yeah?

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:34.400
 But do you want me to hold a screwdriver for you?

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:37.360
 - Yeah, will you just put it down, please?

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:38.360
 - Sure.

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:42.400
 - I raised beavers once too.

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.120
 - Make a lot of money on them?

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:46.880
 - That was the second time my wife left me.

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:50.080
 - Well, did she ever come back?

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:52.560
 - She did, and she got even with me.

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:53.400
 How?

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:56.200
 She went in for raising turkeys.

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:57.720
 She make a lot of money?

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:59.200
 That was when I left her.

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:00.760
 (audience laughs)

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:04.320
 I see, well, tell me, did you ever raise silver foxes?

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:06.480
 Just for one winter.

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:08.400
 Now there was an experience.

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:09.760
 Yeah?

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:12.800
 If you want to make money real quick though,

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.520
 the thing to do is raise pigeons.

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:16.360
 Pigeons?

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:19.760
 Yeah, that's what I'm gonna put every cent I've got into.

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:20.680
 Is that right?

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:25.680
 Yes, sir. Once I get it going, I'm giving up plumbin'.

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:27.680
 Want me to hold that nut?

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:29.680
 Uh, just leave your hands over.

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:31.680
 Yes.

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:36.680
 I figured out there's 300 cent profit in every pigeon you raise.

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:40.680
 As much as that? What do you sell them for? Eating purposes?

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:45.680
 Don't raise that kind. I tried them once. I had to eat them all myself.

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:49.680
 Well, what kind do you raise?

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:52.120
 - Carriers. - Carriers?

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:53.120
 Is that right?

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:54.480
 - Oh.

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:57.160
 - The kind that get back home no matter where you take them, huh?

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:59.520
 - Yeah, there's my hammer.

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:00.720
 - Oh, let's see.

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:02.160
 Oh, here it is.

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.200
 - Leave it there, I'll pick it up.

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:07.600
 (audience laughing)

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:10.560
 - I knew fella once that raised carrier pigeons

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:12.200
 and sold them to the army.

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:13.480
 - Is that what you're going to do?

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:15.240
 - Yeah, and put them in races.

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:17.560
 That's where you make the real money.

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:20.720
 Sometimes you win as much as five or ten dollars.

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:24.840
 Gee whiz, I didn't know anything like that was going on.

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:27.440
 Oh, what is it you're looking for, Mr. Hubbard?

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:30.920
 And pair of pliers, just let me look for myself.

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:34.840
 Do you mind if I point to them?

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:35.760
 Where are they?

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:39.640
 Oh, yeah, I am.

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:42.960
 Gee, there's a business I'd like to go in.

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:44.160
 What's stopping you?

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:48.000
 Well, do pigeons take up very much room in the cellar?

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.760
 What are you going to keep them in the cellar for?

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:51.520
 Why don't you keep them in your attic?

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:53.840
 Gee, how do they get along in an attic?

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:56.720
 All you got to do is fix up some hoops

00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:59.280
 and be sure the windows are left open.

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:01.520
 I wonder why I didn't think of that myself.

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:03.600
 Want your two-world bag, Mr. Hubbard?

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:06.400
 Uh, put it right back where it was.

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:08.400
 Yes.

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:11.520
 How much would it cost to go into the pigeon business, Mr. Hubbard?

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:13.920
 - Get your head out of the way.

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:15.820
 (audience laughs)

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:16.660
 - Is that better?

00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:18.020
 - Yeah, just keep it out.

00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:21.260
 - I guess you don't need any expensive equipment

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:22.420
 like you do for rabbits.

00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:25.260
 - All you need is some secondhand coops.

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:26.620
 - Where could I get those?

00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:29.500
 - Any reason you couldn't advertise in the morning paper?

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:30.940
 - You mean advertise?

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:33.420
 I just say I want some secondhand pigeon coops,

00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:34.260
 and that's all.

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.020
 - What else would you suggest?

00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:37.700
 - Sure, and I'd save money.

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:40.540
 Unless of course nobody answered.

00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:47.420
 But then the way I look at it, you've got to take a gamble at anything if you want to

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:48.420
 make money.

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:50.420
 Isn't that the way you look at it, Mr. Hubbard?

00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:51.420
 Well, I...

00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:53.420
 What are you doing out here?

00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:56.820
 Well, I'm helping Mr. Hubbard find his tools, Mother.

00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:59.780
 Could you please stand back so you don't cast a shadow on him?

00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:00.780
 Oh, my goodness.

00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:04.220
 The way you've been talking out here, I thought you'd have all the problems of the world settled.

00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:05.220
 Have you heard us?

00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:08.340
 Well, I haven't heard what it was about.

00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:10.260
 What time does the center of Olgazette close?

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:11.460
 - No, I have no idea.

00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:14.180
 - They're open till pretty late.

00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:15.020
 - They are?

00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:16.340
 - Why do you ask, dear?

00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:17.340
 - Oh.

00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:18.660
 - No reason.

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:20.900
 I was just wondering how long they stay open.

00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:23.940
 - His father around in the living room, any place?

00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:25.500
 - Your father went out.

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:27.020
 - Is everyone right?

00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:27.860
 He went out?

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:29.500
 - Mr. Hubbard, will I be in your way here?

00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:30.380
 - No, ma'am.

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:32.660
 - Well, goodbye.

00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:33.980
 - Where are you going, Henry?

00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:35.860
 - I'm just in the living room.

00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:36.700
 Look around.

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:41.700
 [ Laughter ]

00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:45.700
 Operator. Operator, could you get me the son or vogue as that please?

00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:46.700
 Yes, ma'am.

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:48.700
 Hi, Ray. Are you in the living room?

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:50.700
 I think I am, mother.

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:53.700
 Mr. Hubbard wants to know whether you picked up his screwdriver.

00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:56.700
 Tell him he'll find it in his left hip pocket.

00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:57.700
 Thank you.

00:10:57.700 --> 00:10:58.700
 Hello?

00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:01.700
 Well, how do I put in an advertisement?

00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:03.700
 Coaps.

00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:06.700
 Just ordinary pigeon coops.

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:07.700
 Yeah.

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:09.700
 Yeah, that sounds good.

00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:12.700
 Sign at Henry W. Aldridge.

00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:13.700
 Yeah.

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:15.700
 About how much will that be?

00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:18.700
 As much as that?

00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:21.700
 Well, would it be cheaper if I left the W out?

00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:23.700
 [laughter]

00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:26.700
 Well, supposing I leave the Henry out?

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:27.700
 Okay.

00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:31.700
 Just say reasonable prices pay for old pigeon coops.

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:41.300
 Sign at Aldridge. Yes sir. Yes sir. Goodbye. Henry, would you see this at the door please?

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:48.100
 Yes mother, I'd be very glad to help you mother. Gee whiz Tommy, you over here already?

00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:54.500
 I came over to get my rabbits. Yeah, come on in. Did you ask your folks whether it'd be alright?

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:59.400
 I don't know why it wouldn't be alright. Why should I worry them about a little thing like that?

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:01.400
 Yeah, well come on down the cellar stairs.

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:03.400
 Why don't you want them Henry?

00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:06.400
 My folks would rather I raise pigeons.

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:07.400
 Pigeons?

00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:09.400
 Sure, I've become a pigeon fancier.

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:10.400
 Yeah?

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:13.400
 Sure, I may even raise pigeons for the army.

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:14.400
 Big money in it Tommy.

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:15.400
 Yeah?

00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:16.400
 Mm-hmm.

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:18.400
 For the Department of Interior Communications.

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:19.400
 Yeah?

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:23.400
 Your rabbits are around here on the other side of the Preserve Closet.

00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:24.400
 Oh, you showed them Tommy.

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:27.400
 Now listen, before I let you see them,

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:31.600
 them. When do I get that who's it? You promised me on the telephone.

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:34.840
 Oh, tomorrow Henry. I couldn't bring it over tonight.

00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:37.640
 Okay. Oh, here they are in this box.

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:39.040
 Look at them.

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:43.240
 That's what I say. Can you beat that?

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:45.800
 Well, what's the matter? They're right here.

00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:48.640
 Can you imagine that?

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:50.640
 What all I want is for?

00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:51.800
 You got to take eight.

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:55.760
 I haven't got room for eight. I'm going to have trouble keeping just four in my

00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:59.720
 closet. Well you should have gotten here sooner Tommy. Well they certainly isn't my

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:07.680
 fault. Yes mother that's Tommy. Is he taking all four of the rabbits? Yes mother.

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:12.920
 I'm certainly glad to hear that dear. Tommy, Tommy when we go up don't say

00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:17.440
 anything about the four I'm keeping. Why not? Maybe I can surprise my mother

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:22.160
 after all. Boy am I gonna make money. Rabbits in our basement and pigeons in

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:29.160
 in our attic.

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:39.560
 Our scene shifts for the next moment, ladies and gentlemen, to a department store, where

00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:41.800
 we clear up the mystery of the lady...

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:42.800
 Good evening...

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:45.080
 ...and the gong.

00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:49.720
 Behind a counter on the fifth floor, lamps China curtains, drapes, rugs, house furnishings,

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:54.400
 and so forth, there stands a clerk approaching him is the lady who says,

00:13:54.400 --> 00:14:00.100
 "Last week I bought a piece of merchandise in this department. I have it here with me. It's a dinner gong."

00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:00.760
 "Yes, madam?"

00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:06.160
 "You see, I used to have a lot of trouble every night getting my husband and the children to the dinner table.

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:12.000
 They'd keep right on reading the paper or listening to the radio or whatever else they were doing when I called them.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.120
 So I bought this gong."

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:15.420
 "An excellent idea, madam."

00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:18.240
 "But now I want to return it if I may."

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:20.120
 Well, is anything wrong with it, Madam?

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:21.400
 Let's have a look at it.

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:22.880
 Sounds alright to me.

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:24.640
 Oh, the gums are alright.

00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:26.400
 But recently I've been serving

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:28.520
 Jello Chocolates pudding for dinner.

00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:30.720
 Now when I start to ring the gums,

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:32.920
 my husband and the children are sitting at the table

00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:35.400
 before I get a chance to hit it.

00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:37.840
 And the very delicious moral to that story

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:39.200
 is, ladies and gentlemen,

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:41.200
 folks certainly do get to the table

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:42.800
 and get there in a hurry when they know

00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:45.480
 there's Jello Chocolates pudding for dessert.

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:47.120
 Because, friends, it's a grand treat

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:48.120
 that everybody loves.

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:53.040
 young and old alike. Nothing can compare with its rich, creamy smoothness and its

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:56.880
 thrilling chocolate flavor. And you'll be simply delighted to find how quickly

00:14:56.880 --> 00:15:00.720
 and easily you can prepare jello chocolate pudding, how inexpensive it is,

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:05.280
 and how many different and delicious desserts you can make with it. So try it

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:08.800
 tomorrow, why don't you? Start right away to treat the folks at your house to

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:14.520
 this new family favorite. Well, luscious, easy-to-eat, jello chocolate pudding.

00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:29.520
 [Music]

00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:33.020
 Now getting back to the problems of Henry Aldrich.

00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:37.520
 Without telling his parents, Henry is inserted an advertisement in the town paper

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:40.020
 and signed it with the name Aldrich.

00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:44.020
 Vassine opens the following day in his father's office.

00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:48.020
 Miss Thompson, I don't have a great deal of time. Will you take a letter in a hurry, please?

00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:49.020
 Yes, I still have a letter.

00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:52.020
 To the Brown Realty Company.

00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:58.020
 There, Mr. Brown, this is to advise you that unless steps are taken at once...

00:15:58.020 --> 00:16:01.020
 Mr. Aldrich is over.

00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:03.020
 Yes?

00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:05.020
 Yes?

00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:09.020
 No, sir, you must have the wrong number, I'm afraid.

00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:10.020
 No number?

00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:11.020
 Yes, sir.

00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:14.100
 Now then you just started a letter to the Brown Realty Company.

00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:18.380
 Dear Mr. Brown, this is to advise you that unless debts are taken as wise.

00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:19.380
 Yes.

00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:24.020
 This is to advise you that unless steps are taken as wise.

00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:27.020
 Mr. Ulrich is open.

00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:28.020
 What was this?

00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:31.020
 I don't understand you.

00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:33.020
 Say that slowly, please.

00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:34.020
 One moment.

00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:38.020
 Mr. Ulrich, somebody wants to talk to you about something.

00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:39.460
 Let me have it.

00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:43.860
 Samuel Oritt speaking, what number are you calling?

00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:47.020
 Pigeon coops.

00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:49.860
 Did you say pigeon coops?

00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:51.660
 My name is Oritt.

00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:56.500
 I'm the only Orittian town, but I don't buy pigeon coops.

00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:57.900
 Who is this talking?

00:16:57.900 --> 00:17:00.300
 Charlie?

00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:02.300
 Or you can't fool me, Charlie.

00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:04.420
 Now listen, Charlie, I'm busy as the deuce right now.

00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:05.700
 I'll give you a call later.

00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:06.580
 Don't bother me.

00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:07.980
 Goodbye.

00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:11.320
 Charlie Goslin would try to be funny just when I'm trying to get my work done

00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:14.720
 Try to make me think his name was Tony Vichito

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:19.200
 Be quite honest, Mr. Old, I never did like Mr. Goslin.

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:21.200
 Well, we get a lot of business from him

00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:22.800
 Now then, where were we?

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:26.920
 This is to advise you that unless steps are taken at once

00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:28.440
 Is that all the farther we got?

00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:29.440
 It is

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:31.440
 Unless steps are taken at once

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:34.600
 What did I was going to say?

00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:36.600
 I have no idea

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:41.700
 Now I remember, toward improving the property occupied by my...

00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:44.000
 Let me answer that.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000
 Sam already speaking.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000
 Who?

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000
 Yes, Charlie.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000
 They're selling pigeon coops?

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000
 I will take all 15.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:01.000
 Yes, deliver them right to our house.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000
 I don't care where you put them.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000
 Put them in the living room.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000
 Yes, and don't bother me anymore.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.000
 Just because Charlie Goshen happens to be a client.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000
 How far are we?

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000
 Right where we were.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000
 Yes.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:23.000
 You know, it would be just like Charlie to go and find 15 pigeon coops and deliver them to our house.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000
 I remember one other practical joke he tried to play off.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000
 Miss Thompson, please answer that.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000
 If it's Charlie again, tell him I've gone for the day.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000
 Hello?

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.000
 Yes, sir.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:39.000
 Mr. Olrit, Mr. Olrit, it's a centerville feed company.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.000
 They want to know whether they may supply you with cracked corn.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000
 (audience laughing)

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.000
 For what?

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.000
 One moment.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.000
 Hello?

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:52.000
 Mr. Olrit wants to know what he would use cracked corn for.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000
 No, Mr. Olrit has not changed his business.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000
 He's still practicing law. Goodbye.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000
 Cracked corn?

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.000
 Cracked?

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000
 Did that sound like Charlie Gosling?

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.000
 My suspicion is that was Mr. Gosler.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:10.000
 No, no, he probably phoned the Centerville Feed Company and told them to call here.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:15.000
 Now, unless steps are taken, it was to him. Who's at the door?

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000
 You Mr. Orrids?

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.000
 I am.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000
 How many pigeon coops do you want?

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000
 I beg your pardon?

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.000
 How many did you want?

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000
 Did you say pigeon coops?

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.000
 Pigeon coops.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.000
 A pork and what you have all you need up to sixty.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:30.000
 May I ask who sent you here?

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.380
 sent you here. I don't know my poor just told me to come up here. Where is your

00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:39.240
 poor? Down in front. Had a parked double. We got all 60 down there. You have 60

00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:43.380
 pigeon coops down in front for me. Sure you want to brought up here to the

00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:49.660
 office? No. It also fixed you up with 60 feet and pray. Now then young man may I

00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:54.180
 ask how your father happened to come here. I don't know. Do you know a gentleman

00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:59.220
 but the name of Charles Goslin? Never heard of. But here's what you're to do.

00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:04.220
 You're to deliver your confounded goops to Mr. Gosland's residence at 12 Church Street.

00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:05.220
 All 60?

00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:08.220
 All 60 and all 60 feeding trays.

00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:09.220
 Who paid for them?

00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:11.220
 Send the bill to Mr. Gosland.

00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:12.220
 Sure.

00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:13.220
 Take them over right away.

00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:14.220
 That's fine.

00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:17.220
 Mrs. Aldrich. Mrs. Aldrich is on the phone.

00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:18.220
 What does she want?

00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:22.220
 There's a gentleman by the name of the Cheeto at your house and loading pigeon coops.

00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:25.220
 You can piss the final leaving them in the living room.

00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:27.220
 Now I know it was Charlie.

00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:29.820
 This is all she says he had nothing to do with it.

00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:31.420
 Well then the fella must be insane.

00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:33.020
 That's why she says you ought to come over.

00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:37.420
 Yes, yes, where's my hat and coat right in the middle of the busiest day I ever had.

00:20:37.420 --> 00:20:39.820
 If anyone else calls Miss Thompson I've left.

00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:40.820
 Hello, Father.

00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:41.320
 Hello.

00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:42.820
 Can I speak to you just a minute?

00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:43.320
 You may not.

00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:44.320
 Good bye.

00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:46.320
 Well what do you know about that?

00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:49.920
 Miss Thompson is he in a hurry over something?

00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:50.920
 He is.

00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:54.320
 And if I were you, I wouldn't follow him.

00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:56.320
 Miss, Miss Thompson could...

00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:58.320
 I've got access to it.

00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:00.320
 Where's Sam Alridge?

00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:01.320
 He just went out.

00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:04.320
 I've got exactly what he wants outside on my truck.

00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:05.320
 What is it?

00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:09.320
 Aye, it's of the darlinest pigeon coop you ever put your two eyes on.

00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:11.320
 Well, Gee whiz, could you hold him over to my house?

00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:12.320
 And why not?

00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:14.320
 Well, I don't think anyone's home.

00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:18.320
 Oh, now you take the coops, and I'll give you a dozen fine birds to go with them.

00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:19.320
 You will?

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:20.320
 I will not.

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:23.320
 Gee whiz, I'll be getting an even better start than I thought I would.

00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:24.320
 Let's go!

00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:46.320
 For the last time, please put the rest of your coops on your wagon and get away from the front of my house.

00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:47.320
 You know, out of a tise?

00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:49.320
 I did not advertise.

00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:52.320
 The ladies, she know out of a tise?

00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:56.320
 I did not advertise. No one in this house advertised. We couldn't have.

00:21:56.320 --> 00:22:00.320
 That's a funny thing. My wife is she's a reader to me after love.

00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:03.320
 What you probably did was to misunderstand the name.

00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:04.320
 What's your name?

00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:05.320
 Aldrich.

00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:08.320
 Aldrich, that's all right. I'm a telephoner.

00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:11.320
 He's a show show. So bring on me 50th in the coals.

00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:16.320
 All right, I'll admit that I'm the one who answered the phone, but...

00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:18.320
 I thought you were somebody else.

00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:19.320
 I'll meet to his price.

00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:22.760
 [audience laughing]

00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:26.120
 No, I thought you were a friend by the name of Charlie.

00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:29.320
 Alice, what's a Charlie got to do with it?

00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:31.560
 Now listen, my friend, for the last time,

00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:34.040
 put that final crate on your wagon and get away from here.

00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:37.000
 All right, all right, time to go home and rid the air.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.000
 You sure you know one of these acupes of chips?

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:39.640
 Get out!

00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:41.800
 All right, all right, give me a please.

00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:44.920
 Bye, maybe I see you tomorrow.

00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:45.880
 No!

00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:48.120
 Well, thank goodness he's gone.

00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:50.760
 You know Alice, I honestly believe the fellow's crazy.

00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:51.600
 Did you hear it?

00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:53.920
 Me practically insisted that we advertise.

00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:55.760
 Father, take a look.

00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:56.760
 What did it, Henry?

00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:59.360
 And what I've got right here in this truck, pigeon coops.

00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:00.960
 [LAUGHTER]

00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:02.360
 Where did you get those?

00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:03.360
 They're from my pigeons.

00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:05.200
 How are you, sir, Maldridge?

00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:06.640
 Could you give me a hand to him, everybody?

00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:07.200
 Sure.

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:08.200
 One minute.

00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:10.040
 Henry, are you unloading those here?

00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:10.600
 Sure.

00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:11.800
 Oh, don't with them, me son.

00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:13.480
 Hey, wait before you unload that.

00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:15.440
 Oh, it's not too heavy, Father.

00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:17.440
 Oh, there we are.

00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:19.440
 What's that I hear?

00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:23.440
 No, for three years I've been wanted to show you me gratitude, Sam.

00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:26.440
 Mulligan, I'm sorry, but we have no place here for those pigeons.

00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:29.440
 But father, they aren't costing us a cent. We're getting them absolutely free.

00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:30.440
 What do you mean?

00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:35.440
 Mr. Mulligan has very kindly consented to credit the coops toward a Bill Heo's father.

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:36.440
 What was that?

00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:38.440
 Don't you think that's fair, father?

00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:42.440
 Henry, will you and Mr. Mulligan please put that crate back on the truck?

00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:44.440
 You mean you don't want them?

00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:48.880
 I do not. Oh, but, but, but, but it's three years I've been owning and that builds Sam.

00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:51.640
 Don't you think it's about time it was paid? Sam?

00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:55.340
 If you take those crates away I'll call the whole thing paid.

00:23:55.340 --> 00:23:59.440
 Oh, now, now that's very decent of you, Sam. Give me a hand, me boy.

00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:00.920
 But father, I need them.

00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:04.940
 Hey, Ray. Do you want me to put that on for you? I'll help him.

00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:08.240
 Ah, you're a gentleman, Sam Aldrich.

00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:12.440
 And the next time I come into town I'll bring your son a present.

00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:14.740
 But not pigeons or pigeon cook.

00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:16.840
 Oh no, no, no, or not pigeons.

00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:20.940
 I'll bring him a fine white nanny goat I have.

00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:22.140
 You will?

00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:24.440
 You will not?

00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:25.440
 Good.

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:27.940
 Good day to you all.

00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:29.540
 She was.

00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:32.540
 Now I've even lost what I paid for the ad.

00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:33.640
 For the ad?

00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:34.940
 For what ad?

00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:37.640
 For coops, didn't I tell you?

00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:40.240
 Let's go into the house, Enry.

00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:42.240
 I want to have a talk with you.

00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:44.440
 I know what you're gonna say.

00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:47.640
 I wouldn't cry right out here on the sidewalk, Henry.

00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:48.840
 I'm not crying.

00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:50.440
 Who's crying?

00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:54.440
 You're a disappointed dear, but the next time you do anything like this, you must tell us.

00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:55.440
 Of course.

00:24:55.440 --> 00:25:02.140
 We may not have room for pigeons any more than we had for rabbits, but we'll find something you can have.

00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:05.740
 The only thing is I need pigeon coops. I need them bad.

00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:09.640
 Oh, today you need them, but by tomorrow you'll have forgotten all about them.

00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:11.440
 Sam, what's that?

00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:12.640
 What was what?

00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:14.840
 Something just flew out of our attic window.

00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:16.640
 Out of which window?

00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:18.440
 That was one of my pigeons.

00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:19.840
 What of what pigeons?

00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:21.340
 That Mr. Hubbard gave me.

00:25:21.340 --> 00:25:23.340
 That he gave you? How many did he give you?

00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:26.040
 Just six. Two of them are up there setting.

00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:27.440
 In our attic?

00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:29.640
 It would be all right if they had a coop, Father.

00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:31.240
 Henry Aldrich.

00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:33.240
 Henry, could I see you all minute?

00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:34.440
 What about Tommy?

00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:35.940
 What have you got in the box there?

00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:37.040
 Your rabbit.

00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:39.340
 My mother and father won't let me keep them.

00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:41.340
 What are you doing returning all four of them?

00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:42.340
 All four of them.

00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:43.340
 There are ten of them.

00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:44.340
 Can you imagine?

00:25:44.340 --> 00:25:46.840
 Henry, we can't possibly take those.

00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:49.840
 But mother, the ones I have don't bother you any, do they?

00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:50.840
 The ones you have.

00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:52.340
 Yeah, the ones in the Preserve Club.

00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:53.340
 Henry!

00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:57.340
 Look! Look who's coming! It's Touser!

00:25:57.340 --> 00:26:00.340
 Oh, my old dog Touser will jee-wiz!

00:26:00.340 --> 00:26:04.340
 And where are you going to keep him, Henry?

00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:05.840
 Oh, he can sleep at the foot of my bed.

00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:06.840
 Listen, Henry.

00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:09.640
 I want my who's it back that I gave you for the rabbits.

00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:11.240
 Oh no, that was a bargain, Tommy.

00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:12.440
 You've got to give it back.

00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:13.340
 Give what back?

00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:14.140
 My snake.

00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:15.140
 What's that?

00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:19.240
 No, he gave me that snake.

00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:21.440
 Henry, why should you want an old dead snake?

00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:23.040
 From mother it isn't dead, it's alive.

00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:24.040
 What?

00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:26.640
 Where is it?

00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:27.440
 Where is it?

00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:27.940
 Yes.

00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:29.740
 It's in my top, you're a drawer.

00:26:29.740 --> 00:26:31.240
 Henry, open it!

00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:41.240

00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:44.800
 - You know, Tommy, I just had a big idea.

00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:45.720

00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:47.600
 - We can make some money on these pigeons.

00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:48.800
 We can clean up.

00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:52.360
 Wow, all we have to do is put another rat in the paper.

00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:56.120
 The only trouble is though, we'll have to put it in in your father's name.

00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:57.120
