00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
 [Music]

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
 And now the Jell-O family presents the Aldrich family.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 Henry! Henry Aldrich!

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
 Coming, mother.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.000
 Yes, it's the Aldrich family based on characters

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
 originated by Clifford Goldsmith

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
 and starring Ezra Stoners Henry with Jackie Kelka's Homer.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 And yes, it's the Jell-O family with its three famous desserts.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 Jell-O in those sex-delicious flavors,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 Jell-O puttings without old-fashioned homemade flavors,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 and Jell-O tapioca puttings,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
 a miracle of goodness, a marvel of speed.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 Everyone's a Jell-O good fellow, a very good Jell-O good fellow,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.800
 So rich, so tempting and mellow

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.200
 J-E-L-L-O

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.600
 And now for the All-Rich family

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:21.000
 A boy is a boy, and that's all there is to it

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.800
 He gets into difficulty somehow and he gets out of them somehow

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.800
 But what happens in between is usually unforgettable.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.100
 The scene opens at the telephone in the Aldrich Front Hall.

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.600
 It is early evening.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.000
 You did, Homer. You really got them?

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.500
 I'll say I have them right here in my hand.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.100
 Gee.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.600
 And Charlie Clark didn't mind loaning them to you?

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.400
 No, I just had a promise we take good care of them.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:44.800
 And boy, you should...

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:45.800
 Just a minute, Homer.

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:46.800
 Yes, mother?

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:47.800
 Where are you?

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.100
 Why, I'm just sort of on the phone.

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.300
 I'm up to the hang up and start your studying before we leave.

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.740
 Sure mother in just one second. Hello Homer.

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.020
 You should see the notes. There's everything important we learned all last month.

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.020
 Oh boy.

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.940
 Once we get these ten pages under our belt, we can write that French exam tomorrow blindfold.

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:07.940
 Well hang on to them Homer, I'll be right over.

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.660
 Okay you better hurry though. Charlie's going to the movie.

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.900
 You mean he has all his studying done?

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:18.100
 Yeah but you know Charlie. He's smart. Sure. But what else has he got?

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.220
 You're right Homer.

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.620
 And he has to have his notes back as soon as he gets out.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.380
 Just a second, Homer. Yes, Father?

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.020
 Did you hear your mother tell you to get started on your homework?

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.780
 Yes, sir. The only thing is...

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.380
 Well, this fella Homer and I know is going to the movie scene.

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.620
 Henry, hang up right now. You're not going to the movies tonight.

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.620
 No, no, Father. It's only that we have to give something back to him. Very important.

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.420
 And you're not going to run any errands. Now, please put down that receiver.

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:41.220
 But, Father...

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.620
 Hey, Ray! Hello, Homer. Goodbye.

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.120
 What?

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.220
 I've got to explain something to my father. I'll call you back.

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.820
 Henry, you're not calling Homer back.

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.320
 You have a French examination tomorrow.

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.500
 And every night this week you thought up a different excuse to get out of studying.

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.260
 Sure, Father, I agree with you.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:56.960
 And would you like to know why?

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:57.620
 Indeed I would.

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.420
 Because I've been saving all my strength up for tonight.

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.340
 Boy, I'm gonna roll up my sleeves and tighten my belt

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.500
 and digest the whole French language.

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.340
 That's fine. And would you please guess the word?

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.660
 The only thing is, Father, I know you'll think it sounds unreasonable,

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.660
 but I just have to go over to Homer's.

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.760
 And me, your mother and I are rushing off to a bridge game,

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.060
 and I have it much time.

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.740
 But I'd like to make one thing clear.

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:18.380
 Yes, Father.

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:19.540
 Just this.

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.440
 You are not under any circumstances to go anywhere near Homer's house this evening.

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.940
 But father...

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.580
 You will stay home by yourself and concentrate on your French.

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.140
 But father, won't you please let me explain something.

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:30.540
 Henry, let me explain something to you.

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:31.140
 Yes, sir.

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:36.140
 Son, I don't think you realize how important a solid foundation is.

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.740
 And sure, but...

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:37.640
 Now you take a bridge.

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:38.440
 A bridge?

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.240
 When someone builds a bridge, they hire the best engineers.

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:42.640
 They spend years on it.

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.240
 And when it's finished, it may be the best-looking bridge in the world.

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.940
 Gee!

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.340
 But suppose, Henry...

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.940
 Suppose that bridge has a weak foundation.

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:51.740
 A truck runs over it and where is it?

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:52.340
 In the water?

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.940
 The truck?

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:53.940
 Everything.

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.440
 And it's the same with life.

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:56.540
 You understand?

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:57.840
 I think so, Father.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:58.540
 Fine.

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.440
 Now then, please get to work on your foundation.

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.540
 - You wouldn't but Father-- - I know more excuses.

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:03.540
 Oh, excuse me, Mary.

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:04.540
 It's certainly Father.

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.340
 Henry, did I hear Father say someone ran over someone on a bridge in a truck?

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.640
 - No, Mary. Gee, what-- - Was it anyone we know?

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.140
 It wasn't anybody, Mary.

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:14.940
 And listen, would you be willing to speak to Father for me?

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.240
 - What about? - He just misunderstood the whole thing.

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:23.240
 All I want to do is go over to Homer's house because Charlie Clark has these notes saying he's going to the movies.

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.240
 - Oh, Larry? - No, Charlie, so would you please, Mary?

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.240
 - Certainly, Father. - Yes, Father.

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.240
 Henry wants to know if he can go to the movies with Charlie Clark.

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.240
 - What? - No, Mary, no.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.240
 She was, can't you understand French? I didn't mean English.

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:41.240
 - Hey, man, come in here. - Now look what you've done, Mary.

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.240
 - Oh, my goodness, that's the last favor I'll ever do for you.

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.240
 - Now, if I can just stay here, let me speak to Henry.

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.240
 Mother, can I please explain something to you?

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:50.240
 Certainly, dear.

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.240
 Well, you see, it's like this.

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.240
 Henry, your father and I would love to let you go to the movies tonight, but...

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.240
 Mother, you don't understand. I don't want to go to the movies.

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.240
 You don't?

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:03.240
 No, gee whiz. Movies are the farthest thing from my mind.

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.240
 All I want to do tonight is study.

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.240
 Really?

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.240
 Over at Homer's house.

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.240
 Well, then, what's everybody so excited about?

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:14.240
 Sam, all he wants to do is go over to the Browns along with us.

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.640
 Alice Henry is not going over to Homer.

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.840
 Henry, you are not going over to Homer's.

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.040
 For mother!

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:23.440
 Dear your father and I both feel that tonight you should study at home.

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.240
 For mother, you don't understand!

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:26.240
 Are we going to be late?

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.440
 I'm coming, Sam and Henry.

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:29.240
 Yes, mother.

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.040
 If you work real hard and pass that French exam,

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.840
 you can go to the movies tomorrow night.

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:43.440
 Let me help with the table cover well.

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:46.840
 It's all set, Sam, and have I been looking forward to tonight?

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:48.640
 We haven't played bridge for a whole week.

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:50.840
 Alice, you and I can start shopping the cards.

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:51.440
 All right.

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.840
 And I was saying, well, it's all a matter of discipline.

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.040
 Shuffling cards, raising a son.

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:56.840
 Oh.

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:58.040
 Yeah, you're right, Sam.

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.240
 It's quite a job.

00:05:59.240 --> 00:05:59.840
 Who deals?

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.040
 And now, Sam, let's not talk about Henry.

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:04.440
 I feel badly enough about the whole thing already.

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:05.640
 What happened, Dallas?

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:09.240
 Honestly, Elizabeth, I wish you could have seen Henry's face when we lived.

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:10.040
 Henry's face?

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:11.240
 What about it?

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.480
 He was salting because I made him stay home and study.

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:15.200
 First he wanted to go to the movies.

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:16.880
 Then he had to give Charlie Clark something.

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.280
 Anything to get out of the house.

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:19.980
 Well, I'll tell you frankly, Sam,

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:21.540
 when Homer wants to get out of the house,

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:22.820
 I'm inclined to let him go.

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:25.880
 It will even go so far as to encourage him.

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:27.180
 Isn't that nice?

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:29.720
 You mean you encourage him to neglect his studies?

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:31.020
 Nobody has to do that.

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:32.220
 Who steals it?

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:34.920
 Although, will I wish you'd made him stay home tonight?

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:35.560
 Oh?

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:36.820
 Homer's gone out?

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:37.460
 Yes.

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:40.060
 Homer, hit me, phoned him before you got get out of his hand.

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:41.440
 Henry phoned him.

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:42.500
 Whose deal is it?

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:46.900
 Yes, and then homophoned the Beijou Theatre to find out what time the picture.

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:47.400
 Picture?

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:48.300
 Alice, did you hear that?

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:50.100
 Sam, I'm sure there must be some mistakes.

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:51.000
 Who deals?

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.100
 Will do you realize those boys are off to a movie when they should be studying?

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:55.900
 And after I expressly forbid Henry...

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:58.100
 Relax, Sam. What harm can they do?

00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:59.500
 Who deals?

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:02.000
 Well, you don't understand unless we do something about this right now.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.100
 Sam, you can't possibly do anything tonight.

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:05.300
 Oh, yes, I can.

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:07.000
 Come here, please sit down and play a break.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.100
 Whose deal is it?

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:10.100
 Will, get your coat off.

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:10.600
 What?

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:14.100
 You and I are going down to the V-U Theater and catch Henry and Homer red-handed.

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:25.100
 [MUSIC]

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:29.100
 Just sweet, just sweet to A.

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:30.100
 Hey Henry.

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:31.100
 We Homer?

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:32.600
 Hey me and Apple, what are you?

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:37.100
 Now listen Homer, I thought we decided to speak nothing but French while we're studying.

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:40.100
 No, but well, don't anymore.

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:42.100
 Un...

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:43.100
 Un...

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:44.100
 Conde-terre.

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:45.100
 A potato?

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:46.100
 No.

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:48.100
 What is French for Apple?

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:49.100
 Apple?

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:50.100
 I don't remember.

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:52.100
 How about banana?

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:54.100
 Uh, let me see.

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:56.100
 Well, J.F.M.

00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:58.100
 hand me something out of that bowl.

00:07:58.100 --> 00:07:59.100
 Here's an RN.

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:00.100
 Thanks.

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:01.100
 I'm in their seat.

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:05.100
 And listen, Homer, let's stop fooling around with our stomachs and get to work.

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:07.100
 Charlie's movie gets out at 10 o'clock.

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:09.100
 We only have an hour and a half.

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:12.100
 Tarn it all. Now I have to waste time answering the phone.

00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:15.100
 Why not answering French and kill two birds with one spell?

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:17.100
 That's an idea.

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:18.100
 Bonsoir?

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:19.100
 What's that?

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:21.100
 Cascassette Cabo Dazerie?

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:23.100
 I'm sorry, I must have the wrong number.

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:25.100
 Hey, is that... Hello?

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:28.100
 Hey Homer, that was my father.

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:30.100
 He was. Does he want me to go home?

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:31.100
 I don't know. He hung up.

00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:33.100
 You mean he's still mad at you?

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:38.100
 Listen Mary, I'm not speaking to you. Besides, we've got a lot of studying to do.

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:44.600
 You know Henry, if we got notes like these off Charlie years ago, today you'd be in Princeton and I'd be in Spartan Tech.

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:47.100
 Henry, he's down at the Beazew Theatre with Mr. Brown.

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:49.100
 Mr. Brown, that's my father.

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:51.100
 Mary, you're crazy. They're playing bread.

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:55.100
 No, they are Henry. I just passed them at the Beazew and they said they were waiting for you and Homer.

00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:56.100
 You mean that's why he phoned?

00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:58.100
 Oh, I know Henry, is that they're expecting you?

00:08:58.100 --> 00:08:59.100
 Gee, that's funny.

00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:02.100
 Homer, maybe we'd better dash right down there and see what they want.

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:04.200
 We only have an hour and a half left to study.

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:06.340
 And my brain's just limbering up.

00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:08.980
 We can take our notes along with us and study on the way.

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:11.420
 But Henry, it's snowing, and I promise, Charlie,

00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:12.700
 we wouldn't let them get down.

00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:14.740
 Well, look, we can put them back in this comic book

00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:15.940
 so they won't get all away.

00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:16.780
 Let him know.

00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:17.820
 Homer, come on.

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:20.300
 My father wants to see me down at the Beijou Theater.

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:20.640
 Sure.

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:22.660
 And after all the trouble I've had this week,

00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:24.540
 I'm playing it safe from now on.

00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:27.540
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:33.540
 (music)

00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:34.540
 Any luck, Mr. Allridge?

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:35.540
 I've afraid not, Mr. Harris.

00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:38.040
 We've been up and down your aisle twice, and there's no sign of the boys.

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:40.040
 I told you I didn't remember selling them a ticket.

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:42.040
 Sam, let's get back to our bridge game.

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:45.040
 Hey, look, Mr. Harris, you wouldn't consider putting the house lights on for a minute, would you?

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:47.040
 But, Sam, how could we look at the picture?

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:48.040
 Well, we're looking for the boy.

00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:49.040
 Oh, Mr. Harris?

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:50.040
 Yes, sir?

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:51.540
 -Loj, Ockle. -Oh, it's you.

00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:52.540
 Yes, sir.

00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:54.040
 If you gentlemen will excuse me...

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:55.040
 Certainly.

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:56.040
 Now, look.

00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:58.040
 I'm not interested in a demonstration.

00:09:58.040 --> 00:09:59.040
 Come on, Will.

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:00.040
 Mr. Harris, won't you see what the...

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:01.040
 Thanks for your help, Mr. Harris.

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:03.040
 Okay, Sam, let's go.

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:04.040
 Let's go where?

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:05.040
 Back home and play bridge.

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:08.040
 We'll be going to wait outside the theater here until Henry and Homer show up.

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:10.040
 But, Sam, they won't show up.

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:11.040
 I think they will.

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:14.040
 Aren't there times when you know exactly what's going on in your son's mind?

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:17.040
 There are times when I'm sure something's going on.

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:20.040
 If we let them get away with this, do you realize where it'll lead?

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:21.040
 Well...

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:23.040
 Boy grows up and gets a job in the first thing you do.

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:23.760
 Where to lead?

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:24.240
 Well...

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:27.960
 Boy grows up and gets a job and the first thing you know, he's bucking out and going to a movie.

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:28.460
 Yeah?

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:30.000
 And the next thing you know is fire.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.460
 With a wife and children to support, he's in the bread line.

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:33.880
 Sam, that's terrible.

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:35.680
 Wait till I get my hands on Homer.

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:38.040
 I'm sorry, I just don't have the time.

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:40.800
 But Mr. Harris, I have a wife and children to support.

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:42.440
 As a good example, will it what I mean?

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:43.040
 Yeah?

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:46.320
 I think you'll find that that chap didn't worry enough about his foundation.

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:47.080
 Is what?

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:48.200
 Foundation will.

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:49.760
 What good is a bridge without one?

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:52.040
 You're right, Sam. Let's go home and play bridge.

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:56.600
 Well, here they come. What did I tell you?

00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:00.800
 Well, I'll be done. And buried in a comic book.

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:03.920
 Henry! Hello, Father. Hi, Father.

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:07.660
 Well, Henry. Well, home up. Father, could you tell me what it is you wanted?

00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:10.520
 We're kind in a hurry. You kids are pretty cool, aren't you?

00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:17.000
 Well, it's snowing, Father. I don't suppose you recall that you're supposed to be at home studying.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.880
 Oh, we've been studying, Father. We've been studying all the way down here.

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:21.480
 Sure, you see this Kermit book?

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:22.920
 I see it. Let me have it, please.

00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:23.600
 Father, wait.

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:24.600
 Let me have it.

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:25.320
 Thank you.

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:26.960
 But we have to give that back to Charlie.

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:28.800
 He's right here in the movie, see?

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:31.120
 Homer, that's a pretty poor excuse.

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:31.520
 Why?

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:34.000
 Henry, I don't want to attract attention by dealing with you now.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.640
 Dealing with me, Father, in one way?

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:37.280
 I'll attend to the matter tomorrow morning.

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:38.840
 Father, what have I done now?

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:40.520
 There's a streetcar stopping over there.

00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:41.720
 I want to see you get on it.

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:44.080
 Father, listen, we've got to have that Kermit book.

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:46.400
 Homer, get on that streetcar and go home with Henry

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:47.440
 and finish your studying.

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:48.800
 But Father, what about Charlie?

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:49.480
 Henry!

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:50.480
 Come on, huh?

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:52.480
 But she wish him what about our nose?

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:58.480
 Well, that wasn't the pleasant thing to do, Will, but some day those boys will thank us for it.

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:09.480
 Mary, speak louder, I can't hear you.

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:12.480
 You don't say.

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:15.480
 You don't say, Mary.

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:17.480
 You don't say.

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:23.400
 Here's your father now. You tell the boys to come over here to the Browns and not to worry about a thing.

00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:24.800
 Come on, Sam. On with the bridge.

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:25.800
 Goodbye, dear.

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:27.440
 Well, Alice, I was right.

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:28.960
 Oh, you were, Sam?

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:32.360
 I sure have to hand it to Sam. He certainly understands boys.

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:34.640
 Well, I work hard at trying to understand them, Will.

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:37.520
 Well, Sam, you have to work a little harder in the future.

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:38.000
 What's that?

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:43.680
 It so happens that Mary just phoned me and said, "Henry and Homer have practically gone to pieces over what you did to them."

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:44.720
 But all we did...

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:47.280
 All you did was take their French notes away from them.

00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:49.380
 Alice, all we took from them was a comic book.

00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:51.180
 Sam, they were studying their notes.

00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:52.180
 At the movies?

00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:54.480
 Mary told them you wanted to see them down there.

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:57.280
 No, Alice, I've heard a lot of stories, but I hope you don't believe that one.

00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:01.080
 Sam, the boys had their French notes inside that comic book.

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:03.480
 And now they have to return them to Charlie Clark.

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:04.880
 What's that? What did you say?

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:08.380
 Sam, I told you not to toss that comic book into the trash bin.

00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:09.180
 No, wait.

00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:11.880
 The trash bin? Sam, all right.

00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:21.880
 [Music]

00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:24.580
 Here, Homer, head to the glass of ginger ale.

00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:25.480
 She thinks.

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:27.380
 The only thing is Homer, what time is it?

00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:30.080
 And now, Henry, you just have another cookie and stop worrying.

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:32.880
 But Mother Charlie will be getting out of that movie any minute now.

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:34.680
 And I promised him this notes back.

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:36.380
 I'm sure your father will be right back with him.

00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:38.380
 Oh, excuse me while I answer the phone.

00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:41.680
 Listen, Homer, while we're waiting, why don't we go over a few verbs?

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:48.040
 You know verbally sure why not oh, that's a wonderful idea and mother would you please help us over a hump?

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:54.840
 Certainly what is it you want to know Henry the first person plural future tense of the verb to be to be what there?

00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:58.680
 Just you know

00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:00.440
 to be

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:02.440
 Etra sure oh

00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:09.120
 That that's French isn't it there sure yes, I was pretty sure it was French

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:14.320
 Well, let's see now. First person plural, future thing.

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:19.120
 Boys, wouldn't it do you more good if you figured it out yourself?

00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:20.120
 [Laughter]

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:21.320
 We don't remember!

00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:23.720
 Alice, guess who that was on the phone?

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:24.720
 Sam and Will.

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:27.720
 And boys, I'm afraid they're going to be a little delayed.

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:28.520
 Delayed?

00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:29.520
 Elizabeth, what happened?

00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:33.720
 Well, they got down to the Beijou Theater and it seemed the cracks been, had been emptied.

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:34.320
 And empty?

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:36.520
 But they said you haven't any worry about boys.

00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:38.320
 They're going to keep right on looking.

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:40.320
 Oh boy!

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:44.320
 (music)

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:52.320
 (applause)

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:58.320
 And now while Henry's waiting, it's a good time to listen to Meredith Wilson and his talking people.

00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:01.320
 Hey! It's intermission!

00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:02.320
 Intermission!

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:04.320
 Okay, everybody knows it's intermission.

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:05.320
 How do they know?

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:07.320
 Because you're not Homer and I'm not Henry.

00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:08.320
 Henry.

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:10.320
 Well you certainly have Mrs. Aldrin.

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:11.320
 Oh my God.

00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:13.320
 Mead Diamere's your chance to shimmer.

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:15.320
 Mike Dello, America's favorite gelatin dessert?

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:16.320
 Yes sir.

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:17.320
 In all six delicious flavors?

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:20.320
 In all six delicious locked in flavors.

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:22.320
 It would be a pleasure.

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:24.320
 Starting with strawberry, we we we we.

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:26.320
 Transparent, cherry, we we we.

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:31.320
 Orange, lemon, lemon, lemon, lemon.

00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:33.320
 Jake, eat, oh, oh.

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:36.320
 Oh, there's a big red letter that's spelled jello.

00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:41.480
 and jello smells a treat. It sure does because that rich fruit-like flavor is

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:45.260
 locked right in there by a special process so it can't get up to your first

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:51.000
 electable spoonful. Delectable. And the whole jello family is delectable. For ease

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.960
 and speed and variety, get the jello family. Don't say dessert say jello.

00:15:55.960 --> 00:16:02.300
 Jello puddings. Don't say dessert say jello. Jello tappy oka puddings. Yup, the

00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:05.740
 a jello family of desserts if you don't want to say it sing it

00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:07.500
 j-e-t-o-kout

00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:08.860
 oooooooh

00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:15.860
 and now back to the Aldrich family

00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:21.260
 yes getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldrich

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:25.020
 in his effort to discipline his son mister Aldrich has inadvertently lost the

00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:27.340
 french notes he ordered Henry to study

00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:30.460
 notes which the boys promised to return to charlie clark

00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:32.700
 The scene opens in the brown's front hall.

00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:34.220
 It is later that evening.

00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:35.220
 Hello?

00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:36.220
 Hello?

00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:37.220
 Is that Mr. Prescott?

00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:39.820
 Who teaches French at Central High?

00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:40.820
 That's right.

00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:41.820
 Who's this?

00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:43.500
 Well, Mr. Prescott, this is Mrs. Oldridge.

00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:44.500
 Henry's mother?

00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:45.500
 Henry.

00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:46.500
 Henry Oldridge.

00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:48.340
 The nice-looking boy with the colleague.

00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:49.740
 He's in my French class?

00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:52.900
 Yes, and frankly, he's having quite a bit of trouble.

00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:53.900
 Trouble?

00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:55.660
 Oh, yes, I know the boy.

00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:59.580
 You see, he started in studying his French this evening, and he was buckling right down

00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:04.860
 and taking a real interest in it. You don't say. Yes. And this gives me did you say Henry

00:17:04.860 --> 00:17:11.660
 Aldrich? Yes, that's right. He's taken an interest in French. Yes, of course. How did

00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:16.020
 that happen? What's that? Is this Mr. James Prescott?

00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:29.820
 Ouch! Well, what you mind looking where you're going?

00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:32.740
 But the snow's blinding me! I can't see a thing!

00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:34.740
 Where are we anyway?

00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:36.440
 Somewhere behind the visual theater.

00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:39.440
 Sam, are you sure this is where Mr. Harris dumps his waste paper?

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:40.940
 Frankly, I'm not sure of anything.

00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:42.540
 Sam, the whole thing is hopeless.

00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:46.140
 How are we going to find a comic book out here in the dark with all this snow?

00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:47.640
 We'll just have to keep looking.

00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:49.140
 But we'll be here all night!

00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:53.140
 You know, Sam, if we stayed home and played bridge in the first place, none of this would have happened.

00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:54.140
 Now, we'll...

00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:55.140
 Whoop!

00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:58.140
 I'm sorry, Sam. I guess I stepped on you again.

00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:00.140
 No, you didn't. I stepped on something.

00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:02.140
 Hey, let me have that flashlight.

00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:05.140
 Here. Sam, look.

00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:07.140
 We'll get your foot out of that bucket.

00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:10.140
 The only thing is, I can't get it out.

00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:12.140
 All right, Will, let's not lose our heads.

00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:16.140
 Out in. Lift your foot. Lift it so I can get hold of the bucket.

00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:19.140
 All right, Tom. Race yourself. Take it easy, Sam.

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:22.140
 He will stop dancing around.

00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:26.140
 Now then, now pull! Pull yourself!

00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:28.140
 Is it starting to give?

00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:30.140
 No! Not yet!

00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:34.140
 Sam, where are you?

00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:36.140
 Sam, where'd you disappear to?

00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:37.140
 Sam!

00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:50.140
 Homer, isn't that the fastest you can walk in?

00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:50.980
 - You can warm up.

00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:52.780
 - But look, and hold your head back

00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:55.300
 so you let the snow blow right into your face.

00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:56.140
 - Homer.

00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:58.300
 - Better still open your mouth.

00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:00.540
 - Homer, can't you keep your mind on your foundation

00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:01.740
 for five seconds?

00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:02.900
 - It's on my wife.

00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:05.180
 - Look, suppose you're building a bridge, son.

00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:07.020
 - And I'm not going in for building bridges

00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:08.340
 on a night like this.

00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:09.540
 - Just suppose you were a Homer,

00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:11.140
 and you had a weak foundation,

00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:13.780
 and then a truck runs over you, and where are you?

00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:14.600
 - Where?

00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:16.620
 - Flowing around the water with a whole bridge

00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:18.100
 on top of you.

00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:19.700
 - And do you feel all right?

00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:22.420
 Hey, this is Mr. Prescott's house, isn't it?

00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:23.420
 Let's see.

00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:25.640
 97, yeah, this is it.

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:28.340
 Henry, you're sure your mother knows what she's talking about?

00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:29.340
 Sure, Homer.

00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:31.400
 Mr. Prescott said all we had to do was come over here,

00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:33.300
 and he'd loan us a whole set of French notes.

00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:34.300
 Boy.

00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:36.140
 They'll be much better than Charlie's notes, Homer.

00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:38.620
 I think they're Mr. Prescott's own personal ones.

00:19:38.620 --> 00:19:40.220
 Boy, imagine.

00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:43.380
 Straight from the horses now.

00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:46.340
 And all we had to do is make one copy for us

00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:47.340
 and one for Charlie.

00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:48.340
 And ring the doorbell.

00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:49.460
 Sure.

00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:52.260
 and Homer don't forget to take your hat off when we get in the hall.

00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:54.060
 I'm not wearing a hat.

00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:56.960
 Then brushless snow off your hair.

00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:58.960
 Well, good evening Henry, Homer.

00:19:58.960 --> 00:19:59.960
 Good evening Mr. Prescott.

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:01.460
 Good evening Mr. Prescott.

00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:02.460
 I've been expecting you.

00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:02.960
 Come in.

00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:04.260
 Thank you Mr. Prescott.

00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:05.960
 Thank you Mr. Prescott.

00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:08.560
 Henry, if I got it all off my hair.

00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:09.860
 I mean the snow.

00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:11.760
 Sure Homer, come on.

00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:16.660
 Well boys, I want to tell you that I got one of the most pleasant surprises of my life this evening.

00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:17.660
 Uh-huh.

00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:18.860
 Let me have your coat Henry.

00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:19.860
 I know, but...

00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:21.060
 Thanks, I'll hang it up here.

00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:25.100
 Yes, sir, Henry, when your mother told me how seriously you were taking your French lessons,

00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:29.060
 I said to myself, "Presscott, you were all wrong about those boys."

00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:30.060
 Gee!

00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:31.060
 And Gee!

00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:32.060
 Now your coat, Aunt Homer.

00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:35.260
 Well, the only thing is, we're sort of in a hurry.

00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:37.660
 Homer, Mr. Prescott wants your coat.

00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:39.860
 Oh, oh, my coat.

00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:41.060
 There, right.

00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:43.160
 Now, come on into the living room, boys.

00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:45.460
 I'll have the French notes for you any minute now.

00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:46.460
 Any minute?

00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:47.460
 Here, sit down.

00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:48.460
 Well, thank you.

00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:51.860
 You see, I loan my notes to another student, Charlie Clark.

00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:53.660
 Charlie Clark!

00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:55.660
 Yes, and he promised faithfully.

00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:57.660
 Have them back to me by ten o'clock.

00:20:57.660 --> 00:20:59.660
 Oh boy.

00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:00.660
 Oh boy.

00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:03.660
 What he phoned only a few minutes ago to say he'd been slightly delayed.

00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:04.660
 Oh, Henry.

00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:05.660
 Oh, is anything wrong?

00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:06.660
 Wrong.

00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:09.660
 Oh no, did he yes and no!

00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:11.660
 I want you boys to take good care of those notes.

00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:13.260
 They're a rather valuable set.

00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:14.260
 Mr. Prescott.

00:21:14.260 --> 00:21:15.260
 Yes, Homer?

00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:16.260
 That is...

00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:18.860
 See this is a nice place you've got here.

00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:23.260
 Thanks. See, while we're waiting, could I offer you boys a glass of ginger ale?

00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:26.060
 Ginger ale? No thanks.

00:21:26.060 --> 00:21:28.660
 We couldn't drink a drop of anything.

00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:40.060
 Mr. Harris, are you sure Henry and Homer didn't show up?

00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:40.860
 Positive, Charlie.

00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:43.060
 Oh, but she is after ten o'clock and boy.

00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:45.760
 Boy, what am I gonna do? I promise Mr. Prescott...

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:49.360
 Well, if you want to wait around another five minutes, Charlie, here's something you might like to read.

00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:49.860
 What?

00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:50.860
 This comic book.

00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:52.460
 Adam, smash your comics.

00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:55.060
 I fished it out of the trash bin there earlier this evening.

00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:55.560
 Here.

00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:57.360
 No thanks, Mr. Harris. I've read it.

00:21:57.360 --> 00:21:58.260
 Oh, Mr. Harris.

00:21:58.260 --> 00:21:59.760
 Oh, no, not again.

00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:01.960
 Look, Mr. Harris, let's be reasonable, huh?

00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:03.760
 You aren't busy this time of night.

00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:05.760
 Look, what is it you're trying to sell me?

00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:07.760
 It's one of our new machines, sir.

00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:10.260
 And if I could just give you a quick demonstration.

00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:12.060
 All right. All right.

00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:14.560
 Where is all in my car? I'll be right back.

00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:15.760
 Say Mr. Harris.

00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:16.520
 Yes, Charlie.

00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:18.960
 If you see, Henry or Homer, will you tell him to phone me?

00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:19.900
 OK, Charlie.

00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:21.560
 It's a matter of life and death.

00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:22.240
 Excuse me, Sonny.

00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:23.240
 I'm sorry, Mr. Harris.

00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:25.440
 Now then, Mr. Harris, you see this?

00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:27.880
 Well, it looks just like an ordinary vacuum cleaner to me.

00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:29.360
 That's where you're wrong.

00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:32.320
 This is a special vacuum cleaner special for theaters.

00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:32.960
 You don't say?

00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:34.320
 Yes, sir.

00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:37.000
 Now, if we can just find some old scrap paper

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.040
 or anything I can demonstrate with,

00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:41.920
 oh, how about that Adam Smasher comic book?

00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:42.920
 Yeah, thank you.

00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:44.280
 Well, what are you going to do with it?

00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:47.580
 I'm going to tear it into bits into tiny bits.

00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:51.260
 And then we'll scatter the pieces all around like this.

00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:52.420
 Quite a mess, isn't it?

00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:53.260
 It sure is.

00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:56.460
 And then we'll tear up a few of those chocolate bar apples.

00:22:56.460 --> 00:22:59.220
 Mm, chocolate drip into tiny little pieces.

00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:00.500
 Now take it easy.

00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:02.660
 If anybody comes out of the theater and sees this mess--

00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:03.620
 Oh, Mr. Harris!

00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:05.740
 Mr. Eldridge, what happened to you?

00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:07.060
 You were all wet.

00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:08.260
 Frankly, I'm ashamed to tell you.

00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:09.580
 He fell into a snow drift.

00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:11.540
 Now, if you gentlemen would like to watch it--

00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:13.700
 Mr. Harris, did you have any sort of a floodlight

00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:17.740
 We can borrow a flood line. We can't see a thing out here and back here.

00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:20.100
 Alrighty, Mr. Harris, here we go.

00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:27.700
 Something very important that we have to find a certain fine spot, Mr. Hat, on we tell you, turn that thing off.

00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:31.700
 What did Mr. Harris watch any of these sprouts of paper?

00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:36.700
 Did you ever see a vacuum cleaner eat a paper like that?

00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:40.700
 Mr. Harris, have you seen anything of a comic book I threw in your trash bin?

00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:43.200
 A comic book? It's a matter of life and death.

00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:46.600
 Mr. Orridge, I know exactly why you'll find it.

00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:56.800
 [Music]

00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:59.200
 Henry, are you sure you're copying it down right?

00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:00.500
 Sure, keep going Homer.

00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:02.500
 Lay Duke's doorlings.

00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:05.000
 Lay Duke's the UCKS.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.000
 Henry, not Doc's Duke's.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.300
 Oh, sure, Duke's, okay, what about him?

00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:12.600
 Sonton Famil, they plume no bill.

00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:17.440
 Or is it mobile is it what mobile you know is in Memphis?

00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:22.280
 How would I know what comes after that that's the end of the page well stay here

00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:24.800
 I'll see if they pasted the next one together father

00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:30.160
 Father's the next page ready yet

00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:39.240
 I'm using it just have to go on this small piece okay, but oh yeah, had me the magnifying glad he was father

00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:41.500
 It's almost midnight and we promise trial.

00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:42.900
 All right, Henry, relax.

00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:45.480
 Your French exam doesn't start to land in the morning.

00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:47.340
 Mr. Prescott, we'll have his notes by then.

00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:48.000
 I know, but--

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.540
 Here, here's your next page.

00:24:49.540 --> 00:24:50.940
 It's pretty messy, but--

00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:51.820
 Thanks, Father.

00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:53.100
 I've got it, Homer.

00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:55.020
 Sam, there's one thing I still don't understand.

00:24:55.020 --> 00:24:55.780
 Now, let's be careful.

00:24:55.780 --> 00:24:57.620
 You're blowing the pieces all over the living room.

00:24:57.620 --> 00:25:00.620
 Sam, do you have a scrap that would fit this space?

00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:03.020
 Well, I've got enough trouble putting together my own pieces.

00:25:03.020 --> 00:25:05.180
 There, was it absolutely necessary for you

00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:07.420
 to buy that vacuum cleaner?

00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:12.420
 Now, Alice, an extra vacuum cleaner is very handy thing to have around.

00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:17.420
 Sure. And besides, this one's different. It's especially for theaters.

00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:19.420
 Will.

00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:22.420
 Henry, Henry, you can't be finished with that page already.

00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:25.420
 No, but we just copied out the first sentence and Gee whiz.

00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:28.420
 What's wrong with you? Mother, does this make sense to you?

00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:30.420
 Le premier d'you chocolate drip?

00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:31.420
 What's that?

00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:35.420
 The a la Adam Smasher Walla.

00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:42.420
 No, wait a minute.

00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:51.420
 Now listen, Homer.

00:25:51.420 --> 00:25:53.420
 Listen, I mean, uh, kabool-a-book.

00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:55.420
 Well, anyway, who you kidding?

00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:56.420
 Kidding, kidding, me kidding.

00:25:56.420 --> 00:25:58.420
 I mean, more.

00:25:58.420 --> 00:25:59.420
 Sure, huh.

00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:03.420
 How can you bet me 30 cents will pass this French exam when I happen to know you haven't

00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:04.420
 got 30 cents?

00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:06.420
 What's the beautiful part of him?

00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:07.420
 What is?

00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:09.420
 When I win the bet, I'll have 30 cents.

00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:10.420
 Miss Pa?

00:26:10.420 --> 00:26:12.420
 Well, here's a sure bet for you ladies.

00:26:12.420 --> 00:26:14.420
 And that's the hit you make with the family

00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:16.420
 when you serve jello puddings for dessert.

00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:18.420
 Yes, jello puddings.

00:26:18.420 --> 00:26:20.420
 Chocolate, butter, scotch, and vanilla.

00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:22.420
 Creamy, rich, and luscious smooth.

00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:24.420
 Chuck full of old-fashioned homemade goodness.

00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:27.420
 Now, sure, jello puddings are nourishing made with milk.

00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:29.420
 And sure, they're quick and easy.

00:26:29.420 --> 00:26:31.420
 Cook in about five minutes.

00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:35.100
 The great thing about jello puddings is they taste sasuel.

00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:39.500
 And you know that name jello is a trademark, the property of general foods, and it tells

00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:42.460
 you you're getting a genuine jello product.

00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:46.860
 Remember that when you look on your grocery shelf tomorrow for jello puddings, and remember

00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:53.940
 more people buy jello puddings than any other prepared puddings in the world.

00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:59.180
 The Olrich family starring as Rustona's Henry with Jackie Calcas Homer is written by Patricia

00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:03.560
 Jaudrey and Del Dinsdale with music by Jack Miller. Mr. and Mrs. Aldrich are

00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:08.400
 house Jameson and Katherine Roth and this is Dan Seymour in New York saying

00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:13.880
 the Aldrich family is brought to you by the Jell-O family.

00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:26.880
 Everyone's a jello good fellow, a very good jello good fellow, so rich, so tempting and now, oh, J-E-L-L-O!

00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:39.880

00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:46.300
 (bells ringing)

00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:49.040
 (bells ringing)

00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:51.040
 (chime)
