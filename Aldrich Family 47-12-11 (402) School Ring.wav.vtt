 [Music]

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
 Jello Pudding's present.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
 Henry! Henry O'Brien!

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 Coming, Mother.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
 [Applause]

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
 The O'Brien family, based on character originated by Clifford Goldsmith,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
 and starring as the stone that's Henry with Jackie Calcuss-Homer,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
 Brought to you by Jello Pudding.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 Just a taste of Jello Pudding's and believe me you will know

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 They are made by famous J-E-L-L-4

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 Yes, Jello Pudding's those old time, all time favorites you've always known and loved.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 All three so rich and distinctive, so creamy smooth with an old-fashioned homemade goodness.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
 There's Jello chocolate pudding rich, dark and luscious.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 There's buttery brown sugar butterscotch and creamy rich vanilla, a trio of treats.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 They're made with milk and nourishing.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
 They cook to perfection in just about five minutes.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 And all three jello puddings are so gloriously good,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 you'll say you never tasted anything better.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:17.000
 And now for the Aldrich family.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 There's something about a teenage boy that makes all of us laugh

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
 And remember and live again the days of our yours.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 And if he's a typical teenager like Henry Aldrich,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 it's always a pleasure to join him in the joys and misadventures

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 that were ours when we were young.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 It's evening. The scene is the Aldrich living room.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 Father me, I just point out one thing.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
 What? It's only 750.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 And do you realize how much a new suit of clothes would cause?

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 You want a new suit of clothes?

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 No, sir. I'd rather have a school ring.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 Henry, for the last time, I'm not buying you a school ring.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 I'd like to read my paper.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
 But father, everybody in school is getting one.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 All the kids I know just went home and asked for money, and their father said, "Sure,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
 Gee whiz, you're welcome to it," and just walked over.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 I see.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 But I appreciate you being economical, father.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 Gee, if you didn't pinch pennies around here, you wouldn't have any bank account at all.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 Well, I'm glad you realized that.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
 You've built up quite a nice bank account that way, haven't you, father?

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000
 I have.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
 So you really wouldn't miss 750, would you?

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.280
 Henry, if you think I'm going to hand over 750 for a ring that you wind up giving to some girl.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.680
 Father, whatever gave you an idea like that.

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.540
 See, the rings are solid gold with our school crest on them, and two colors.

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.760
 Why would I give a thing like that to a girl?

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.500
 I don't know, son, but we all do.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.220
 You mean you once gave a ring to a girl?

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.600
 Henry, I'm trying to read my paper.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.120
 Ah, but Father, I haven't told you why I really need it.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.840
 You haven't?

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.000
 You see, the teachers all feel that we need something to keep up our morale.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.040
 Just imagine you're sitting in history class and your board's stiff.

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.480
 And you just happen to glance down at your ring.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.100
 And it's got your good old school crest on it.

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.320
 And boy, you want to stand up and cheer.

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:03.960
 That's very interesting, go on.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.600
 And then you think of how much central high means to you.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.280
 And it all comes back that you're there to get an education.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.780
 Yes.

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.280
 So you pile into your history like a ton of bricks and you wind up first in your class.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.880
 Everybody winds up first?

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.680
 No sir, just me.

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:18.680
 Oh.

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.780
 So can I please have a school ring?

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.280
 No.

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.780
 Father, have you thought of this?

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:24.780
 Henry, have you thought of this?

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.880
 If I bought you that ring, you wouldn't have it a week before it would be lost.

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.080
 Lost father? Lost?

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:30.880
 How could I lose it when it's on my finger?

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.880
 What about that fountain pen I bought you last month?

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.480
 You wanted to know how you could lose that when it was clipped to your jacket?

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:36.880
 Well, I didn't lose that pen, Father.

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:37.380
 No.

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:38.680
 I just lost the jacket.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.080
 I see.

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.680
 And I couldn't very well lose my finger.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.680
 Henry, I'm not going to argue. The point is, until your memory improves, I'm not buying you another thing.

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.080
 Oh, my memory, Father. Is that all that's worrying you?

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.180
 Is that all? Henry, do you realize how important memory is?

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.380
 Sure, Father. And from now on, you're going to see a big change in me.

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.880
 Good.

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.680
 Boy, I'm going to remember every single thing I can lay my mind on.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.980
 For instance, do you know what year the Battle of Waterloo was for?

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:06.680
 What year?

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:07.980
 I'll go and look it up.

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:08.880
 [audience laughter]

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:09.880
 You wait there, Father.

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.180
 Henry, look at how...

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:12.680
 Gee, I'm sorry, Mother.

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:13.680
 Did I knock you over?

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:14.680
 Not quite.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:15.680
 My goodness, Sam.

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.680
 What are you so excited about?

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.780
 Alice, I'm supposed to be a good lawyer, but I'd hate to come up against Henry and

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:21.780
 Court.

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.280
 He does have a way with him, doesn't he?

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.280
 He does indeed.

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.280
 It's about that school ring.

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.320
 Sam, why don't you get it for him?

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.880
 I am going to get it for him for a Christmas present.

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.680
 Oh, but I'm not sure I'll be able to hold up that long.

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.260
 (upbeat music)

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:46.600
 - May I have the toast please, mother?

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:47.600
 - Yes, dear.

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:48.700
 - Some more coffee, Sam?

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:50.240
 - That's half a cup, please.

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:51.600
 Why isn't Henry down for breakfast?

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:52.960
 - You'd be right down.

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.160
 My isn't this a lovely morning.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.920
 - Mother, is there anything we can do

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:58.520
 about Henry this evening?

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:59.640
 - How do you mean, dear?

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.720
 - Well, with Joe Graham coming and everything,

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.080
 I don't want Henry coaxing for that ring all through dinner.

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.680
 I think we haven't got a cent.

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.880
 Well, if Joe's interested only in your money,

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.380
 you might as well find it out right now.

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:11.680
 Oh, Father, anyway, Mary, about that ring.

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:12.680
 Your father's decided--

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:13.480
 Alice!

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:13.980
 What do you--

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.980
 Mary, will you, uh, please run out to the kitchen

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:17.080
 and fry me another egg?

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.480
 All right, Father.

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:20.280
 Sam, what's the matter?

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:21.680
 I don't want Mary to know.

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.380
 I'm getting Henry that ring.

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:25.080
 She's sure to let the cat out of the bag.

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:25.680
 Oh, yes, dear.

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.080
 Perhaps you're right.

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:30.280
 My-- I can't wait to see Henry's face on Christmas morning.

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.080
 The only thing is--

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.680
 Have you any idea how we can get his finger signed?

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:38.480
 Sam, I thought you were going to measure his finger last night when he was asleep.

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.080
 I did, but something went wrong.

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.180
 What happened here?

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.380
 Well, I got the string nicely knotted around his finger,

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:45.380
 and just as I went to cut it, he rolled over.

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:46.580
 On the scissors?

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:47.980
 No, Alice, on the string.

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:50.280
 His hand disappeared under his chest someplace,

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:52.680
 and every time I tried to get it, he just giggled.

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:53.780
 Sam.

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:55.480
 Here he comes.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.780
 Alice, this was a grand breakfast.

00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:58.680
 Good morning, Mom.

00:05:58.680 --> 00:05:59.580
 Good morning, dear.

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:00.480
 Good morning, Father.

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:01.480
 Good morning, Henry.

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:03.380
 Well, goodbye.

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:05.080
 Henry, what do you mean goodbye?

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:06.180
 What about your breakfast?

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:07.780
 I don't feel like any breakfast mother.

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:08.680
 - Edward, don't be silly.

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:09.780
 - I could need a bit, father.

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:11.480
 I honest, I'm too.

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:12.680
 I'm not hungry.

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:14.680
 - Hey Henry.

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:15.880
 - I'm coming Homer.

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:17.880
 - Henry, you can't go to school without eating.

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:19.580
 - I'll eat an apple on the way.

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:22.480
 - Why Henry, you don't eat an apple right in front of me?

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:23.480
 - Come on.

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:26.080
 Boy, am I worried.

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:27.680
 - Well, don't worry about it.

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:29.080
 If you haven't got two apples,

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:30.680
 see y'all understand.

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:35.080
 Homer, do you remember me saying anything about something my father asked me to do?

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:35.880
 Why?

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:38.280
 You see the string tied on my finger?

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:43.080
 Well, I woke up this morning and there it was and I can't remember what I tied it on there for.

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:46.980
 So that's easy, Henry. You wish to remind you to do something?

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:48.480
 Sure it was.

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:50.580
 But I can't remember why.

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:52.980
 I can't even remember tying it on.

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:54.980
 Henry, you're in bad shape.

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:56.180
 I'll say.

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:59.280
 And right on top of my father lecturing me about my memory.

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:01.880
 Was it something I had to do for somebody else?

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:02.680
 Yeah.

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:04.780
 Must have been something for my father.

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:07.080
 He's the only one I was talking to last night.

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:08.080
 Hernson trade.

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:09.380
 Henry, Hernson trade.

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:10.680
 I'll say.

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.580
 Gee whiz, if I can't remember what it is,

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:14.780
 my father will never buy me that ring.

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:18.280
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:27.880
 Henry, didn't your father say anything at dinner

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:28.980
 about you not doing it?

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:32.180
 No Homer, that's the awful part of it. He just looked at me.

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:33.180
 He did.

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:34.280
 Well that's terrible.

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:37.380
 All through dinner tonight, when he wasn't talking to Joe Graham,

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:39.480
 he just kept staring at me.

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:40.880
 At my hands.

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:41.880
 Your hands?

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:42.680
 Sure.

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:45.680
 He's so mad he can't look me straight in the eye.

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:47.480
 I wish I could help you out him.

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:49.180
 Say, maybe you could.

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:51.480
 My father's in the living room with Josie.

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:54.880
 Suppose you go in and ask him if there's anything he'd like you to do.

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:57.380
 Henry, are you crazy? What if there is?

00:07:57.380 --> 00:08:01.940
 Well, he might ask you to do the thing I'm supposed to remember to do, then I'll do it.

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:04.180
 Well, okay, you stay here.

00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:05.940
 Don't act suspicious though, Homer.

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:06.740
 Hi, Womb.

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:08.980
 Oh, my work's going just fine. Thank you, Mr. Aldrich.

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:11.220
 I'm glad to hear it, though. Oh, Homer.

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:16.340
 Oh, by the way, Mr. Aldrich, is there any little thing you'd like me to do?

00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:17.460
 No, thank you.

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:18.660
 You can't think of a thing?

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:21.460
 Not a single thing?

00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:22.180
 That's for me.

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:26.500
 And now, Homer, I have something I'd like to discuss with Joe here.

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:30.500
 Sure, Mr. Eldridge, and if you think of anything, I wish you let me know.

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:32.000
 Nice boy. Yes.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
 Now, Joe, here's what I want to ask you.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.500
 I'm getting Henry a school ring for a Christmas present.

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:39.000
 I want to make sure I get it before they're all gone.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.500
 Yes, but here's the catch. It has to be picked up in person at the school,

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:44.500
 and I don't want Henry or any of his friends to see me down there. They might suspect something.

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:45.500
 Well, I understand, Mr. Eldridge.

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:49.500
 And I wanted to show if you'd mind running over to Central High tomorrow and getting one of those rings for me.

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:50.500
 Oh, no, sir. I wouldn't mind a bit.

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:51.500
 Oh, that's fine.

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:54.500
 Another thing. I'd rather you didn't mention this to Mary.

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:56.860
 Mary I want to be sure Henry doesn't find out.

00:08:56.860 --> 00:09:01.220
 Don't let me disturb you Mr. Aldrich.

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:02.580
 Omar what are you doing?

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:06.980
 Wait I tell you I just thought I'd straighten this plant a little.

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:09.860
 Go right on with what you were saying Mr. Aldrich.

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:12.980
 Omar I don't want to seem rude but can't you please run along?

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:14.260
 Sure Mr. Aldrich.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:18.100
 Just as soon as I tie my shoe lights you just forget I'm in the room.

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:19.460
 How can I do that?

00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:22.140
 I'll tie it real quietly.

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:23.820
 Oh, will you just...

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:24.820
 Homer, will you please leave?

00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:25.820
 Oh, gee, you will.

00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:26.820
 I'd be glad to.

00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:27.820
 Now then, Mr. O...

00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:28.820
 Oh, wait a minute, Jo.

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:29.820
 Oh, wait a minute, Jo.

00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:30.820
 Oh, boy.

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:31.820
 Did you find out Homer?

00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:33.820
 Did you find out what they were talking about?

00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:34.820
 Oh, I hear Henry.

00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:35.820
 It's your father unreasonable.

00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:36.820
 I mean, he's mad.

00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:37.820
 I'll say.

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:40.820
 Oh, I could find out if she's asking Jo to do something for him.

00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:41.820
 He is?

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:42.820
 Oh, boy.

00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:44.820
 That means he's really mad.

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:45.820
 Homer, you stay here.

00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:47.820
 I'll get Mary to help me.

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:48.820
 Mary!

00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:50.820
 I'm in the dining room, Henry, and please don't bother me.

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:52.820
 I'm trying to get these dishes cleared away.

00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:55.820
 Mary, you've got more influence with Joe Graham than I have.

00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:58.820
 Won't you please ask him a simple question for me?

00:09:58.820 --> 00:09:59.820
 What question?

00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:03.820
 Just call them in here and ask them what father's been talking to them about.

00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:05.820
 My goodness, is father talking about me?

00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:06.820
 About you?

00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:09.820
 Henry hasn't been showing Joe that photograph album, has he?

00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:10.820
 Why you...

00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:11.820
 Oh my goodness, Joe!

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:12.820
 I'll wait out here in the hall.

00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:13.820
 Did you call me Mary?

00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:14.820
 Yes, I am.

00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:17.820
 I thought you might like to keep the company while I wash the dishes.

00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:21.220
 I guess I could. The only thing is your father and I were...

00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:22.420
 What, Joe?

00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:23.620
 Nothing.

00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:26.320
 Joe, you started to say something. What were you and Father talking about?

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:28.820
 I'm sorry, Mary. I'd like to tell you, but I can't.

00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:30.020
 You mean it's a surprise?

00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:31.020
 Yeah, that's what it is.

00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:33.920
 I do, isn't that sweet? I just love surprises.

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:34.420
 What's that?

00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:35.420
 Oh, go!

 Yes, Mr. Aldrin.

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:39.620
 Oh, one more thing about that ring, about getting the size.

00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:40.620
 Oh, Mary.

00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:42.120
 Father, did you say...

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:42.920
 Did you say...

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:44.220
 Mary, just forget what I said.

00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:46.020
 Of course, Father. I didn't hear a thing.

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:51.360
 - Yes, Joe, you just go on,

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:54.720
 and my goodness, you talk as long as you want about--

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:55.800
 - Thanks, Mary.

 I can hardly believe it!

 - Believe what?

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:13.080
 - My goodness, after all these years,

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:14.640
 I thought it was never going to happen.

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:17.140
 Hey, hold on, are you talking?

00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:18.500
 Mary, no.

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:19.400
 Mother, yes.

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:20.240
 What?

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:21.080
 Did Joe bring him?

 Of course not, dear.

 Mary, I want you to know how happy I am for you.

 Come right back, mother.

 I know, dear, but since you'll be buying a house eventually,

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:02.920
 you should get an idea of the market

00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:14.540
 She was definitely interested in looking in a small house with about five rooms.

00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:15.100
 What?

00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:17.700
 And I found a little jewel for only 12,000.

00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:20.900
 Oh, look, Mr. Crawford, suppose I got in touch with you.

00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:21.600
 You'll do that?

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:22.300
 Yes.

00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:23.300
 One way or the other.

00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:24.300
 All right, sir.

00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:26.600
 Well, Sam, what's happened?

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:27.900
 Is it bad news?

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:29.500
 Alice is out looking at houses.

00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:30.300
 What for?

00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:33.600
 But she's been saying she didn't think she could stand our old house without Mary.

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:35.600
 But I didn't think she meant it literally.

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:38.280
 Well, you just said you have a nice bank account.

00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:39.200
 Not that night.

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:51.560
 Famous favorites for years.

00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:54.800
 And no wonder, because you never tasted anything better.

00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:56.400
 That's jello puddings.

00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:58.920
 Jello chocolate, butterscotch, and vanilla pudding,

00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:01.320
 with that old-fashioned homemade goodness.

00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:05.560
 Yes, a trio of treats, smooth as cream, rich and distinctive,

00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:08.640
 with a full-bodied flavor that's luscious and satisfying.

00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:11.120
 Treat the folks to Jello Vanilla Pudding tomorrow.

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:13.480
 Dress it up with sparkling maraschino cherries,

00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:16.360
 a combination to tempt both the eye and the appetite.

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:19.800
 Jello Vanilla Pudding, with this enticing rich vanilla delicacy,

00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:21.880
 always calls for second helpings.

00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:23.800
 And there's Jello Butterscotch Pudding.

00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:26.920
 How the kids go for that smacking good buttery brown sugar

00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:30.560
 taste, or Jello Chocolate Pudding with an exciting, true

00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:31.800
 chocolatey flavor.

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:34.440
 All three Jello Puddings are nourishing, made with milk,

00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:37.520
 and they cooked to creamy perfection in just about five minutes.

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:41.640
 So asked for jello puddings, chocolate, butterscotch, and vanilla.

00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:43.880
 You'll never taste it anything better.

00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:45.880
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:55.600
 And now getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldrich.

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:58.160
 Hoping to get a school ring, Henry is desperately trying

00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:00.640
 to remember something his father asking to do.

00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:03.040
 Mr. Aldrich, however, has already sent Joe Graham down

00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:06.280
 of the school to get the ring as a Christmas present for Henry.

00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:10.120
 And Mary believes Joe is buying her an engagement ring.

00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:14.520
 It's the next day in the scene opens in the Aldrich backyard.

00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:17.320
 Henry, where are you?

00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:19.040
 I'm in the backyard, Homer.

00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:20.240
 Where did you disappear to?

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:22.400
 I've been around in front resting on the porch.

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:22.960
 Resting?

00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:23.640
 Sure.

00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:27.280
 Don't you think I get tired watching you do all this work?

00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:28.800
 Well, and you better go away again, Homer,

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:30.840
 because I'm going to finish beating these rugs.

00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:34.280
 If you ask me, Henry, you're gonna kill yourself doing all this work.

00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:35.480
 But don't you get it, Homer?

00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:39.720
 If I do all the things my parents usually ask me to do, I'm sure to do it.

00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:40.440
 Do what?

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:42.840
 He was the thing I can't remember to do.

00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:43.880
 Stand back.

00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:45.560
 For him, yeah, I've got some news for you.

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:47.400
 Something I just found out from Willie.

00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:47.960
 What?

00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:51.000
 Well, you know how Willie's in charge of selling school rings?

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:51.560
 Yeah.

00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:54.840
 Well, your father just bought one for Joe Graham.

00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:56.040
 Homer, you're crazy.

00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:57.000
 I am not.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000
 Joe went down to the school today and got a ring.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.900
 And he gave William a check from your father.

00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:03.560
 He did?

00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:06.840
 Well, well, see, what's wrong with that?

00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:08.680
 Joe used to go to Central High, didn't he?

00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:09.680
 Well, sure.

00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:12.140
 Well, see, that's only natural.

00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:13.480
 Joe's going to be a part of the family.

00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:16.320
 My father has a perfect right to buy in the school room.

00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:17.960
 Instead of buying one for you?

00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:18.800
 Sure.

00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:21.120
 It isn't every day a family gets a new son.

00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:22.400
 Gee.

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:26.200
 Do you suppose Joe will be moving into your room?

00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:28.120
 You think so?

00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:30.120
 Well, you certainly welcome to it.

00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:33.320
 Look, Kent, there's lots of room over at my house.

00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:34.320
 No, thank you, Homer.

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:36.720
 I wouldn't think of forcing myself on anybody.

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:38.120
 Henny, where are you going?

00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:39.720
 Don't worry about me, Homer.

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:41.120
 I'll be all right.

00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:42.620
 Boy.

00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:44.420
 Boy, am I mad.

00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:46.420
 Where's that carpet beater?

00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:58.420
 [Music]

00:17:58.420 --> 00:18:00.920
 Yes sir. May I show you something in snow shovels?

00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:03.420
 No thank you I was wondering if you carried pear trees.

00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:08.420
 Oh yes indeed. The Emporium carries everything and if we don't we can get it for you.

00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:11.920
 Oh well that's fine. Can you send six pear trees up to my home right away?

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:14.420
 Right away? Yes my wife's been wanting some for years.

00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:15.420
 But this is December.

00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:18.420
 Well, I thought this was as good a time as any to get them in.

00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:21.420
 They'll keep until spring if I cover them over with Earth.

00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:22.420
 They will?

00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:23.420
 Of course they will.

00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:26.420
 Although you know that pear trees are quite expensive.

00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:28.420
 They cost considerably less than $12,000.

00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:30.420
 Oh, yes, considerably.

00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:32.420
 Oh, and do you have paint in this department?

00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:33.420
 Yes, sir.

00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:34.420
 How much would you like?

00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:36.420
 Uh, enough to paint a house.

00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:37.420
 Oh, what kind of a house?

00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:38.420
 Well, it's quite a large one.

00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:40.420
 And very comfortable.

00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:42.420
 As a matter of fact, I'm very attached to it.

00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:43.420
 Oh, is that so?

00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:44.820
 I just thought of something else she's been wanting.

00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:45.820
 Yes?

00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:46.820
 I'll be back in a minute.

00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:48.820
 Oh, first, could you direct me to the RUB department?

00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:51.820
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:18:51.820 --> 00:19:01.320
 And as soon as I can, Homer, I'm going to send back

00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:03.620
 this suitcase to my father.

00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:06.020
 Will you hand me that pile of socks on the dresser, please?

00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:07.120
 Oh, I have a mind.

00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:07.620
 I'll get them.

00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:08.620
 Never mind.

00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:09.120
 Never mind.

00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:09.820
 Here they are.

00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:11.320
 Thank you.

00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:13.320
 One of them needs mending.

00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:16.320
 I'll just throw in a needle and some thread.

00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:18.320
 Might as well get used to doing my own mending.

00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:20.320
 Henry, why run away now?

00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:22.320
 Why not at least wait till after Christmas?

00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:25.320
 No, Homer, my mind's made up.

00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:27.320
 I'm leaving just as soon as I have dinner.

00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:30.320
 Henry, have you any idea how tough it is on the road?

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:32.320
 I won't be begging, Homer.

00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:33.320
 I'll be working my way.

00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:34.320
 Working?

00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:35.320
 What I?

00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:37.320
 I'll find something.

00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:39.320
 At least I have an education.

00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:41.720
 Yeah, and I'm not a child, you know.

00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:44.120
 Your suitcase is getting pretty full.

00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:46.120
 That's what I was thinking.

00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:50.320
 I guess I'll have to throw out my rock collection.

00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:54.320
 You're throwing your rocks away?

00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:56.820
 Hope you don't think I'm gonna leave 'em around for Joe Graham.

00:19:56.820 --> 00:20:00.020
 Henry, did I tell you that I'm pretty interested in rocks?

00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:00.820
 You are?

00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:03.320
 Well, that is, if you're running away.

00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:05.120
 In that case, Homer, here.

00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:06.320
 They are yours.

00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:07.520
 Gee, Henry.

00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:09.020
 You're giving them to me?

00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:10.620
 Gee, you shouldn't.

00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:12.020
 Nothing of her.

00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:14.020
 Can you reach up on the wall there, please, Homer,

00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:16.020
 and hand me Kathleen's picture?

00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:17.580
 Look at her, Henry.

00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:19.500
 Look at her smiling at you.

00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:21.020
 Just hand it to me, Homer.

00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:22.780
 Look what she's written on it.

00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:26.660
 To Henry, yours truly, Kathleen Anderson.

00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:29.300
 Just think of how she's gonna feel.

00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:31.020
 Think of the spring prom, Henry.

00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:32.460
 Now listen, Homer.

00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:33.340
 Is that our door, Bill?

00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:34.180
 Sure.

00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:36.020
 But why should you worry about it?

00:20:36.020 --> 00:20:37.380
 I guess I'll answer it, though.

00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:40.180
 At least I can do for my family on my last night.

00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:42.820
 Can I start taking my rocks out of your suitcase?

00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:44.460
 Sure. Help yourself.

00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:50.100
 Oh, hi, Henry.

00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:52.500
 She was Joe. I haven't even left yet.

00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:53.580
 I beg your pardon?

00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:55.820
 Well, come on in.

00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:57.540
 Thanks.

00:20:57.540 --> 00:21:02.340
 And I just want to say, Joe, no hard feelings about what?

00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:04.460
 You know, everything.

00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:05.500
 Oh.

00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:07.300
 Well, no hard feelings here, either.

00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:11.620
 naturally. Is your father around? I think I heard him come in a little while ago.

00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:14.260
 Go, Brian! That you? Hello, Mr. Eldritch.

00:21:14.260 --> 00:21:18.180
 Well, well, it's nice to see you. I'll just go on back up, Steve.

00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:21.540
 Here, have to take your coat, Joe. Thank you, sir. Mr. Eldritch, I, uh,

00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:26.420
 I thought I'd drop over with Henry's ring. Oh, good. Thank you. I guess you'll be buying one or

00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:30.900
 two more before long, eh? What's that? Eh, suppose we go into the living room and have a little chat.

00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:36.460
 All right. Well, well, sit down, son.

00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:43.100
 Thank you, sir. Well, well, well, well, Joe.

00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:44.700
 [audience laughter]

00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:47.840
 Yes, Mr. Aldrich? Oh, just call me.

00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:50.340
 Well, no, there's no point in rushing things, I guess.

00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:52.980
 No, no, there isn't.

00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:54.260
 Rushing what, sir?

00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:55.580
 Let me put it this way.

00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:58.900
 Mary's a fine girl, Joe, a fine girl.

00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:01.220
 Oh, yes, I like her very much.

00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:02.220
 Naturally.

00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:05.520
 Well, I guess I'll be running along now.

00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:07.720
 Oh, nonsense, Joe. We'll be having dinner in a few minutes.

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:09.920
 You're just in time. But I was here for dinner two nights ago.

00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:13.320
 Well, things are a little different now. Aren't they, son?

00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:14.520
 They are?

00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:17.720
 Now, let me give you a word of advice, Joe.

00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:21.720
 You and Mary will get along fine as long as you remember a few simple rules.

00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:22.820
 We get along, all right?

00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:25.620
 Yes, but wait until you see how she ironed your shirts.

00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:26.220
 What's that?

00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:29.320
 It runs in the family, Joe. They just can't iron shirts.

00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:31.920
 Now you take my advice and send them out to the laundry.

00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:34.320
 But my mother irons my shirts.

00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:35.620
 Oh and that's another thing.

00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:37.320
 Don't ever mention your mother.

00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:38.020
 No?

00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:39.920
 Your mother can't do a thing, remember that.

00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:41.720
 She can't cook, she can't mend.

00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:43.220
 And above all she can't keep up.

00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:45.620
 Mr. Roaldrich, my mother's a fine woman.

00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:47.520
 Well yes, Joe and so is mine.

00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:49.520
 But you'll have to choose between them.

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:50.220
 I will?

00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:52.020
 Uh-uh.

00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:54.220
 And not about covered it.

00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:55.120
 Oh.

00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:58.320
 But I just like to say, Joe, I'm not losing a daughter.

00:22:58.320 --> 00:22:58.820
 Mother!

00:22:58.820 --> 00:22:59.820
 Oh yes, Mary.

00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:00.820
 What is this dinner is all my...

00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:01.820
 Oh.

00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:02.820
 Hello, Mary.

00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:03.820
 Wait.

00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:04.820
 Hi, Joe.

00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:05.820
 Hello, Joe.

00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:06.820
 Hi, goodness.

00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:07.820
 Yes, Mary?

00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:12.820
 Joe, I want you to know that I'm starting cooking school on Monday, and I'm also very

00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:13.820
 good at dining socks.

00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:14.820
 You are?

00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:15.820
 Yes, indeed.

00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:18.820
 You'll never have to worry about your socks in the future.

00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:20.820
 You mean Mary's going to dorm them?

00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:21.820
 Of course, Joe.

00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:23.820
 But my goodness, here I am doing all the talking.

00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:26.820
 Oh, before you forget, Joe, where's the reading?

00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:27.820
 Oh, here it is, Mr. Olga.

00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:32.620
 Oh, thank you, Joe. I really didn't want you to know about it, Mary, but now that you and Joe,

00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:36.420
 well, it's a Christmas present for Henry. Don't you think you like it?

00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:41.720
 Let's go run. Joe, is that what you and Father were talking about the other night?

00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:44.820
 Well, sure. Oh, oh my goodness.

00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:46.020
 Is something wrong, Mary?

00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:47.820
 No, I still got hurt you in here.

00:23:47.820 --> 00:23:49.620
 Oh, good evening, Mrs. Oldich, how are you?

00:23:49.620 --> 00:23:52.620
 I'm fine, thank you. And isn't it nice having you?

00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:53.220
 Joe, come on.

00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:53.620
 Where?

00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:54.820
 Anyway, just come on!

00:23:54.820 --> 00:23:57.220
 Mary, have you been saying anything about my mother?

00:23:57.220 --> 00:23:59.860
 (audience laughing)

00:23:59.860 --> 00:24:03.300
 - Alice, does it strike you, Mary's acting very strangely?

00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:04.740
 - I hadn't noticed.

00:24:04.740 --> 00:24:07.300
 What I'm wondering about is that phone call.

00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:08.140
 - What phone call?

00:24:08.140 --> 00:24:10.540
 - From the Emporium, a man phoned a while ago

00:24:10.540 --> 00:24:13.180
 and asked if I wanted the rugs delivered tomorrow.

00:24:13.180 --> 00:24:16.460
 - Oh, Alice, I've been meaning to speak to you about that.

00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:18.700
 I ordered those new rugs you've been wanting

00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:20.340
 for the living room in front hall.

00:24:20.340 --> 00:24:21.420
 - You what?

00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:23.500
 - Also six pear trees and enough paint

00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:25.260
 to do the whole house inside and out.

00:24:25.260 --> 00:24:26.100
 - What's that?

00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:28.700
 I thought we might redecorate the upstairs the way you wanted.

00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:30.060
 Sam, you darling.

00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:31.060
 You're pleased, Alice.

00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:31.860
 Please.

00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:35.020
 I've never been so surprised and happy in my whole life.

00:24:35.020 --> 00:24:37.460
 You mean you'll reconsider about the new house?

00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:38.940
 What new house?

00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:40.340
 By the one you've been looking at.

00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:42.580
 Here, I never wanted a new house.

00:24:42.580 --> 00:24:43.100
 What?

00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:43.900
 Well, now look.

00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:46.020
 And excuse me, I want to call the Emporium

00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:47.460
 and tell him to send those rubs.

00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:48.220
 Alice, wait.

00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:48.820
 Well, of course.

00:24:48.820 --> 00:24:49.660
 I'm sorry, Henry.

00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:50.740
 Did I knock you over?

00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:52.660
 Not entirely.

00:24:52.660 --> 00:24:54.260
 Listen, father.

00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:58.660
 I started thinking about the spring prom and a few things and then I smelled the

00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:02.920
 stew mother's cooking for supper and I'd like to make you a proposition father.

00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:03.920
 A proposition?

00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:04.920
 Yes sir.

00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:08.940
 From today on I'll polish the car twice a week and I'll get up at six o'clock every morning

00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:09.940
 to stoke the furnace.

00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:10.940
 You know what?

00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:13.860
 And besides I'll shovel all the walks and carry out the ashes.

00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:15.380
 What would you think of that?

00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:17.380
 I think I was dreaming.

00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:19.380
 Well it's a deal father, shake.

00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:20.380
 Shake.

00:25:20.380 --> 00:25:21.380
 Shake.

00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:24.980
 Henry, while this was supposed to be a Christmas present,

00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:28.380
 under the circumstances, I think I'd like you to have it now.

00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:31.880
 Father, my school rings.

00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:33.380
 You like it, son?

00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:35.380
 Like it! Boy!

00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:38.880
 And Father, I finally remembered what you wanted me to do, I think.

00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:40.380
 I wanted you to do something?

00:25:40.380 --> 00:25:42.880
 Sure, you wanted me to burn that pile of bushes in the backyard.

00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:43.380
 What?

00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:44.880
 And it's all taken care of.

00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:46.880
 Henry, my pear tree!

00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:56.880
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:59.600
 Mr. Wiest, Mr. Wiest, do you want to know something?

00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:00.640
 Well, sure.

00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:04.040
 Well, I'd like to tell you about my favorite brunette.

00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:06.200
 Ah, one of those true glamour girls,

00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:09.640
 I'll bet, with rich, dark tresses and glorious dark eyes.

00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:11.520
 No, no.

00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:14.340
 I'm talking about my favorite brunette dessert,

00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:17.280
 that rich dark jello chocolate pudding.

00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:19.500
 Why, of course, jello chocolate pudding.

00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:21.420
 You never tasted anything better

00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:23.720
 with that marvelous true chocolate flavor,

00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:26.900
 especially made by the famous Walter Baker chocolate people.

00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:29.260
 All three jello puddings, chocolate, vanilla,

00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:31.780
 and butterscotch are rich and distinctive,

00:26:31.780 --> 00:26:34.700
 with real old-fashioned homemade goodness.

00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:36.900
 Jello vanilla pudding, smooth the cream,

00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:38.780
 with that tempting vanilla delicacy.

00:26:38.780 --> 00:26:41.420
 Jello butterscotch pudding, with that buttery brown sugar

00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:43.660
 taste, and say all three jello puddings

00:26:43.660 --> 00:26:47.460
 cooked to perfection in just about five minutes and they're nourishing made with

00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:48.100
 milk

00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:52.300
 so when you go to your groceries asked for jello pudding you never tasted anything

00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:53.700

00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:56.020
