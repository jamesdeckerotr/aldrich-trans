 A typical teenage boy has always scampered across the American scene.

8
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:52,280
 First came Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn and then Penrod, and nowadays there's Henry Aldrich.

9
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:56,840
 And Henry adds his own individual flavor to every mishap he bumps into.

00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,480

 Yes, Henry! Come on in!

 Could you come out in the hall, please?

00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,380
 I want to speak to you about something important!

00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:14,380
 Henry, don't you realize Muriel Watson is in the living room and she wants to say hello to you?

18
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:17,180
 Listen, Mary, I'm in no condition the bother with Muriel Watson.

 Yeah, something's just come up and I'm awfully sorry, Henry.

38
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:28,960
 Well, that's all right, Kathleen. As a matter of fact.

39
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,960
 You can come over tomorrow night though, I think.

40
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,960
 Oh, well, that's not an idea.

41
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:37,960
 Henry, if you're going to the movies with Homer, why don't you ask Kathleen to go along?

42
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,960
 Mother, do you want everybody to hear you?

43
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,960

 Henry, you mean you're going over there?

50
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,960
 Why, I tell you, mother, well, it's sort of a coincidence.

51
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,160
 Huh.

 Why? I tell you, Henry. I don't think I can go to the movies tonight.

 What's that?

70
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:21,920
 Well, something else just came up that I don't have any control over.

71
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,820
 That's what I was just gonna call you about.

72
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:26,920
 I know, but Homer, you can't do a thing like that.

73
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,620
 You did the same thing last night.

74
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:31,320
 Henry, can I help but if something came up last night too?

75
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,220
 But she will.

76
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:34,020
 I've gotta go now. I'll see you tomorrow.

77
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:34,720

00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,220

00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:37,520
 She will.

 Oh, me?

00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,220
 Well, what did you want?

87
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:50,220
 Nothing in particular. I just thought maybe you'd like to talk, wouldn't...

88
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,220
 Are you upset about something?

89
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,420

 My best friend Homer Brownie just busted a date with me.

91
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:59,620
 Oh, yes, I remember. Homer's going over to Catholic this night, isn't he?

92
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:01,220
 - Who, Homer? - Yes.

93
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:04,120
 - She said he was over there last night, too. - Who, Homer?

94
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,020
 Yes.

 You've got it all mixed up.

 Homer runs around with Agnes.

99
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:12,420
 With Agnes?

100
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:15,020
 Why are you supposed to tell me a thing like that?

101
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,620
 She didn't. She didn't.

102
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,420
 She probably said that Agnes told her that...

103
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:20,220
 Excuse me while I answer the phone.

104
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,820
 Well, I don't know how I could have made a mistake like that though.

105
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:26,220
 Well, frankly, Muriel, I think you ought to be a little more careful.

106
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:28,220
 Henry, are you being rude to Muriel?

107
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:29,220
 Who, I'm Muriel?

108
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:32,620
 She was. When a person goes around saying it's Kathleen, when it's Agnes,

109
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,020
 and I know perfectly well...

110
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,220
 Hello?

111
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,420

 and break a date with her and change it to tonight?

139
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,160
 - I know, but I...

140
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,160
 I decided I'd just stay home and get acquainted with the family for a change.

 Mother, will you tell me something?

144
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,160
 I mean, will you tell it to me frankly?

145
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,160
 I'll try to.

 Well, yes, Henry, of course.

 Only why do you ask, did I like her?

149
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,160
 No reason. Only I was just wondering...

150
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:52,160
 Gee, did you ever notice when she used to go down the street how she'd always be smiling?

151
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,300
 Here is something happened to Kathleen.

152
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,460
 Happened to her?

00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:57,460
 No, not especially.

 But do you know how I'll always think of her?

155
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,380

 Henry, you talk as though Kathleen Anderson were dead.

 Well, so far as I'm concerned she is.

162
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:17,220
 She's a thing of a past.

163

 My boy's just dropped the subject.

164
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:21,180
 Please don't even mention Kathleen anymore.

00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:26,600

 And I should open and see Homer Brown standing there. I'm all off it. I'm all off it. Oh boy

167

 Yeah, wasn't that the doorbell? Yes, mother. I'll answer it Henry. Please at least un-cringed your fit

 I'll go upstairs and tell Mary you're here. All right, Mrs. Aldrich boy Henry. I'm off the glad you're home boy

176
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,080
 Oh, yeah.

177
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,520
 What's the matter, Henry?

178
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,520
 I'm Muriel.

179
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:26,520
 Would you be willing to drop into Kathleen's on your way home and deliver a note for me?

180
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,520
 Oh, Kathleen.

181
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,120
 That isn't fucking fine, the darn thing.

182
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,960
 Is it very personal, Henry?

183
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,920
 No, no, gee whiz.

184
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,560
 Do you mind if I dump out my pocket here on the sofa beside you?

185
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,560
 No, of course not.

186
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,560
 Why don't you sit down here next to me?

187
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,360
 What are you supposed to have...

188
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,920
 What do you suppose I could have done with that note?

189
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,800
 I remember distinctly writing it in Latin class today.

190
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:52,360
 And then, and finally, do you mind if I tell you something I've always wanted to tell you,

191
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,920
 but never felt I knew you well enough before, too?

192
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,920
 What?

193
00:07:55,920 --> 00:08:00,800
 Well, I think you've just been throwing yourself away on Kathleen.

194
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,120
 Really?

195
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:05,400
 You know, maybe it was a good thing I lost that nose.

196
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,800
 Of course.

197
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,200
 As a matter of fact, I think it was terrible have heard of breakup a beautiful friendship

198
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,480

199

200
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:17,320
 I'm going to have a talk with Homer and tell him how awful you feel.

201
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:22,820
 Oh, well Henry, do you mind if I fix that lock of hair that's standing up in the back of your head?

202
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:27,820
 Oh, geez, that up again? Somebody ought to follow you around just all day long.

203
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:28,820
 There.

204
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,020
 Is it down now?

205
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:32,820
 I went so busy, I'd be glad to follow you around.

206
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:36,820
 Gee, was, can you imagine that? I never even noticed it before.

 Well, gee, I'm glad you feel that way.

 Yes, you're in Latin. She's a darn good-looking teacher.

231

 Oh, I goodness. Wait, will I tell her more there?

 That's the news in the morning paper.

 Well, dear, first there's several things I'm anxious to talk to you about.

238
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:50,920
 Yes?

239
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,620
 Dear, while you were out last evening, a phone call came.

240
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:56,420
 And, Sam, I don't think I've ever been so upset in my life.

241
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:57,620
 Who was the call from?

242
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:00,220
 It was from Henry's Latin teacher. Her name is Miss Elliot.

243
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:03,620
 Alice, I've always told you Henry would never be any good at languages.

244
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:07,620
 Now, wait, Sam, because even when I tell you, you're not going to believe me.

245
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,220
 You mean he's leading the class?

246
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:12,620
 Now, remember, dear, I'm only telling you what Miss Elliot told me.

247
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:15,120
 When Henry handed in his Latin paper yesterday,

248
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:20,280
 to be he enclosed with it a note a note yes I'm a note to Miss Elliott well don't

249
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:24,360
 you understand here Henry thinks he's in love with his Latin teacher what's that

250
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:28,600
 now wait a minute Sam I knew Henry was upset he hasn't eaten for two days now

251
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:32,200
 but I suppose it was always some trouble he was having a cat Lee what do you say

252
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:36,240
 in the nose the usual thing why don't you pay any attention to me what have I

253
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,680
 done that's offended you and things like how much he wants to be with her yeah

254
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,680
 well and here's what we decided Miss Elliott should do she's going to ask

255
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,800
 Henry to come into her classroom this afternoon and have a little talk with it.

256
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,060
 Yeah. Come to think of it, Alice.

257
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:52,360
 Didn't Henry take Latin on the row, Miss Dudley, at the beginning of this term?

258
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,940
 Yes, and then he suddenly switched.

259
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:55,260
 Yes? To Miss Elliot?

260
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:59,720
 Yes, Sam. That only goes to show you never know what's going on in a side of boy's head.

261
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:02,940
 Mother, yes, Henry. Is Brett was ready?

262
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,800
 Oh, her father. Hello, Henry.

 No, thank you, Sam. I can't eat a thing.

 Oh yes, I'm looking forward to it.

 Only Henry, do you mind if Homer goes with us?

287
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:01,140
 What's that, Henry? Homer felt so bad about everything.

288
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:04,140
 I thought the least I could do was to ask him about what's the dinner.

289
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,140
 For dinner at your house?

290
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:08,140
 No, I'm not sure. Glad you didn't send that note to Kathleen.

00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:31,020
 My goodness.

349
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:33,920
 And gee, I thought I was doing fine.

350
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,220
 She didn't even call me all during class today.

351
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:37,220
 Really?

352
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:40,020
 Henry, have you seen Homer the last day or so?

353
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:40,520
 No.

354
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,320
 He's going to the movies with Muriel tonight.

355
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,920
 He is with that Muriel Watson?

356
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,220
 Yes, but I'm not going with him.

357
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:46,420
 You can rest assured of that.

358
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:48,520
 Well, my goodness, if that isn't--

359
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,220
 If that isn't--

360
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:49,720
 Henry.

361
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,720
 Oh, she was--

362
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,020
 Yes, Miss Elliott?

363
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:54,320
 You hadn't forgotten that I wanted to see you, had you?

364
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,020
 And no, ma'am.

365
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,120
 I'll be right there.

366
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:56,920
 Goodbye, Henry.

367
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:59,120
 I'll wait and walk on part way with you if you want me to.

368
00:16:59,120 --> 00:16:59,720
 OK.

369
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:02,280
 I want to ask your advice about something.

370
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,840
 No, then Henry.

371
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,160
 Yes, Miss Elliott.

372
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,480
 Would you mind leaving the door open, please?

373
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,880
 Oh, you want it open?

374
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,120
 I think it might be best.

375
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:13,080
 Yes, Miss Elliott.

376
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,800
 Henry, frankly, I don't know how to begin

377
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,440
 this little conversation.

378
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,920
 Yes, Miss Elliott.

379
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,440
 I've been criticized in the past for conducting

380
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,400
 my classes a bit informally.

381
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,240
 But I always thought they should be fond in a way

382
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,000
 between the students and the teacher.

383
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,800
 Well, Gee, I'm glad to hear you say that, Miss Elliott.

384
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:34,800
 Because that's why I'd rather take Latin from you than with from a step, Dudley.

385
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,900
 But that's just the point.

386
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:40,800
 I didn't realize, Henry, that things were going quite so far.

387
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,900
 You mean about being informal?

388
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:46,900
 I refer especially to that paper you handed me yesterday.

389
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,700
 Oh, that, Miss Elliott.

390
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:49,800
 Didn't you like it?

391
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:53,800
 Well, Henry, after all, Gee, I'm certainly sorry about that.

392
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:57,100
 When I started to write it the other night, I couldn't get going.

393
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,360
 You know what I mean?

394
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,820
 So I went to bed.

395
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,700
 And then I started to think about how you'd feel

396
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,060
 if I didn't finish it.

397
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:05,340
 So I got up and got the darn thing off my mind.

398
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:06,180
 - Oh.

399
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:08,500
 - And you know, the minute I finished it, I felt swell.

400
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,540
 And I went back to bed and went right to sleep.

401
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:13,620
 - But Henry, don't you realize it was all wrong?

402
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:15,220
 - All wrong?

403
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,740
 The whole thing?

404
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:19,980
 - Well, maybe it was because I was tired.

405
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:21,800
 - Well, I can say as I was never quite

406
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,660
 so mortified and all my life.

407
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:24,980
 - Well, I want you to know, Miss.

408
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:26,040
 I can do better.

409
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:29,980
 Henry, do you realize how old you are?

410
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:32,660
 Yes, Michelle, you're...

411
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:34,780
 You're still just a very young man.

412
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,460
 Yes, Michelle, you're...

413
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:39,520
 Then under the circumstances, don't you think it would be best if we...

414
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,580
 face the facts and just drop this whole thing?

415
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,860
 You mean... for good?

416
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:45,900
 Yes.

417
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:48,740
 I haven't even got a chance if I go on with it?

418
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:50,220
 No, Henry.

419
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:51,420
 Boy.

420
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:54,620
 And, gee, I thought I was just beginning to get somewhere.

421
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,420
 Henry, you weren't!

422
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:57,060
 Not at all.

423
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,460
 No, not at all.

424
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:02,260
 Don't you think we better end the whole thing?

425
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:03,700
 Yes, Miss Elliott.

426
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:04,220
 There.

427
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:06,140
 Now, don't you feel better already?

428
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:10,460
 Well, frankly, it has been sort of praying on my mind.

429
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:11,500
 Of course it has.

430
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,500
 And let's not ever even mention it again.

431
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,380
 OK.

432
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:18,300
 As a matter of fact, my father's been against it from the start.

433
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,580
 Naturally, he has.

434
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:20,860
 Goodbye.

435
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:21,740
 Goodbye.

436
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:24,260
 Do you want me to close the door as I go out?

437
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:26,020
 Yes, please. I'd like to be alone.

438
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:27,500
 Henry!

439
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,620
 - Hi, Agnes. - What a medallion at once.

440
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:32,660
 Why, she said I was too young for Latin.

441
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:33,420
 You are?

442
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:34,260
 Yes.

443
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:36,780
 Or else she's too old to teach it to me.

444
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,460
 I couldn't figure out which.

445
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:55,740
 Alice, how long before dinner will be ready?

446
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,020
 At least an hour, Sam.

447
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:57,860
 Yes?

448
00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:00,420
 Sam, I think you ought to have a hard talk with Henry.

449
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:02,180
 A talk with Henry about Miss Elliot?

450
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:02,940
 Yes, dear.

451
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:05,580
 Now, Alice, if I were you, I'd forget the whole business.

452
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:06,940
 But Sam, I can't forget it.

453
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,500
 I've been worrying about it all day.

454
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,820
 And I say, let's not get mixed up in it.

455
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:14,020
 Every boy has to go through what he's going through.

456
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:14,900
 Did you?

457
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,220
 Of course.

458
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:18,300
 Only I didn't wait for my Latin teacher.

459
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,500
 I fell in love with my first grade teacher.

460
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,260
 Her name was Miss Sutherland.

461
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:23,820
 She had light brown hair.

462
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:25,660
 I used to follow her home every afternoon.

463
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:28,260
 Sam, that was an entirely different situation.

464
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:28,900
 What way?

465
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:31,620
 In the first place, dear, a phone call came this afternoon.

466
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:32,140
 From whom?

467
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:33,740
 That Muriel Watson.

468
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:35,380
 And Sam, I didn't know she and Henry

469
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:36,820
 had had some kind of falling out.

470
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:38,260
 A falling out?

471
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:39,700
 I didn't even know he was interested in her.

472
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,100
 Well, that's what surprised me.

473
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,300
 And Sam, the girl, was all broken up.

474
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,660
 She kept saying that she hoped Henry would understand.

475
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:46,780
 Understand what?

476
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,140
 I don't know, dear.

477
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:50,380
 But I know sooner got to talking with her in the doorbell

478
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:51,820
 rang, and who do you suppose that was?

479
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:52,260
 Who?

480
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:53,660
 Kathleen Anderson.

481
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:56,460
 She stood there in the front hall and was practically in tears.

482
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:57,320
 Over Henry?

483
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,220
 Over Henry.

484
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:59,700
 Well, that's a fine thing.

485
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:02,060
 Our only son falls in love with his Latin teacher

486
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:04,540
 and with two of her students at the same time, mind you.

487
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:05,380
 What you saying, Father?

488
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:06,420
 Why is it that Henry's done?

489
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:07,940
 Not a thing, Mary, not a thing.

490
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:09,220
 You mean it's that awful?

491
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:11,660
 Now, dear, please don't let your imagination go to work.

492
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:13,020
 Go see who's at the front door.

493
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:13,700
 All right.

494
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,580
 Holly, would you like to have me tell you something more?

495
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:16,380
 No, thank you.

496
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:18,500
 We would not.

497
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,220
 Hello.

498
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:20,060
 Hello, Aunt Harry.

499
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:23,020
 I was just passing by, and I thought I'd drop in.

500
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:25,100
 - Where are your mother and father? - They're in the living room.

501
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,700
 - Talking about Henry. - Yes.

502
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,900
 - Well, I just saw him downtown. - You did?

503
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:31,700
 With Agnes Lawson into Haven's drugstore.

504
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,940
 - Alice. - Oh, come on in, Harriet.

505
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:36,140
 - How's everything? - Well, fine.

506
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:38,980
 Fine. At least as well as can be expected.

507
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:41,860
 - Oh, has something gone wrong? - No, Harriet, not at all.

508
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:43,820
 Now, Sam, what on earth has happened?

509
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:45,100
 Harriet, it isn't anything.

510
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:47,620
 We were just talking about a young woman here in town that Henry--

511
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:48,900
 Oh, that.

512
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,740
 Oh, you upset over that.

513
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:52,620
 What? You mean you know about it?

514
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:55,220
 Why, goodness, everybody in town knows about it.

515
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:56,180
 What's that, Harry?

516
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:58,900
 Yes. I just saw them down town together.

517
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,860
 In fact, I loan Henry some money.

518
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:02,140
 They're downtown together.

519
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:04,780
 They're sitting in the Haven's drugstore holding hands.

520
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:07,500
 Henry is sitting in the Haven's drugstore holding hands?

521
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,340
 Holding hands with--

522
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:09,980
 Yes, Sam.

523
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:11,700
 You don't think I'd make it up, do you?

524
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,060
 Alice, maybe you're right.

525
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:14,300
 I will have a talk with him.

526
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:17,300

529
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,520
 - Yes, Henry.

530
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,700
 - Listen, Mary, could you do something for me?

531
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:30,520
 - What is it?

532
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,960
 - Has father seen you?

533
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:32,800
 - Father?

534
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:33,920
 - He wants to see me.

535
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,920
 - Yes, Henry, and you might just as well know now

536
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,520
 he's terribly upset.

537
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,680
 - He is?

538
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,600
 - Well, look, could you please help me out?

539
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,600
 - Henry, have you gotten into some more trouble?

540
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,280
 - Mary, all I want you to do is deliver

541
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,720
 a note to Agnes Lawson, see?

542
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,160
 - Henry, I'm not going out tonight.

543
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:50,420
 I mean the first time you go by Agnes's house could you give it to her?

544
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:51,720
 Isn't that strange?

545
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,680
 What's the matter?

546
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,960
 Oh, I wrote it over to Anne Harry.

547
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:56,320
 It's a few minutes ago when I was paying her back.

548
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,520
 A panger.

549
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,040
 I wonder why I could have put it.

550
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,080
 And you mean you're running around with Agnes?

551
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,800
 Mary, walk for an idea like that in your head.

552
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,920
 And just because you happen to be walking down the street

553
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,960
 with a girl and you go into Haven's drug store

554
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,440
 and you think, well gee, I might as well

555
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,800
 buy the poor kid a Sunday is no reason for her

556
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:13,800
 to jump to a conclusion.

557
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,000
 Think I'm-- and think it.

558
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 She wins.

559
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:17,920
 Where can I put that?

560
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,420
 No.

561
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:19,200
 What's that?

562
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,240
 I remember distinctly.

563
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,240
 I put it in here.

564
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,560
 I paid in here at the money.

565
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,080
 Paid in here for the money.

566
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,440
 And when I went into our kitchen and set down at the table

567
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,200
 and started right--

568
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,200
 Are you home?

569
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:29,680
 Are you home?

570
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,520
 Yes, Father.

571
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,240
 Say where you are.

572
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,320
 I'll be right down.

573
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,440
 Oh, boy.

574
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,240
 What are you supposed to see?

575
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,240
 Is this been a day?

576
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,240
 Candy, I certainly feel sorry for you.

577
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,280
 Don't tell anybody, Mary, but I just

578
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,680
 got kicked out of water today.

579
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,680
 Honestly?

580
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,560
 And Muriel.

581
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,840
 Do you know what Muriel did to me?

582
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,440
 What?

583
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,940
 And you know what Kathleen did.

584
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:47,780
 - Henry.

585
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:49,220
 - Yes, father.

586
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:51,500
 - Mary, would you mind leaving the room for a few minutes?

587
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,580
 - No, father, if you'd rather I wouldn't stay here,

588
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:54,580
 why naturally?

589
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:56,860
 - Henry.

590
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:58,500
 - Yes, father.

591
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:01,660
 - Son, I don't know how to begin.

592
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:03,180
 - Yes, father.

593
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:06,380
 - Naturally, every young man, that is, at least,

594
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:08,660
 almost every young man,

595
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:10,820
 at least every young man that's--

596
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:11,660
 - Yes, father.

597
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:13,020
 - Well, what I mean to say is that

598
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:14,900
 it isn't always our fault.

599
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,900
 Actually, sometimes it's...

600
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:17,900
 What's that?

601
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:20,900
 But in your case, Henry, in your case, I'm afraid I can't...

602
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,900
 Frankly, I can't see your point of view.

603
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,900
 My point of view, Father?

604
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:25,900
 Yes, that's one way of putting it.

605
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:28,900
 Yes, I think I know what you mean.

606
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:31,900
 In fact, I've been a little worried about myself myself.

607
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:34,900
 Henry, Homer Brown is at the front door.

608
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,900
 Homer Brown is...

609
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:38,900
 Father, please just speak to Homer for one second.

610
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:39,900
 Yes, go on.

611
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:40,900
 And I'll be right back.

612
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:41,900
 No, Father.

613
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:42,900
 Henry, did you hear me? Homer's here.

614
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:46,900
 I heard you Mary. Where's my baseball bat? Where's my baseball bat?

615
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:48,900
 Listen Henry, what's the big idea?

616
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:51,900
 What do you mean what's the big idea? And will you please close our front door?

617
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:55,900
 I'll close it when I go out. I know all about you're trying to cut me out with Agnes.

618
00:24:55,900 --> 00:25:00,900
 And Henry, she's my girl. Oh my what are you talking me like that for? I never even thought of Agnes.

619
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:03,900
 And how about you and Kathleen? What do you mean by a thing like that?

620
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:09,900
 Last night and the night before. Man, she whiz. Listen Henry, don't you realize why I was taking out Kathleen?

621
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:13,900
 No, I don't it was to make Agnes jealous. What's that sure?

622
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:20,500
 She wish she was beginning to take me for granted. She was sure and then you had a buyer ascend the and spoil a whole thing

623
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,300
 I know her but

624
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:29,800
 You mean Kathleen wasn't wasn't boy. Are you dumb now? Wait a minute. Oh, what about Muriel? Oh, that was just a coincidence

625
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:37,380
 What oh who's that Kathleen? I'm out here on the front porch. May I command sure she was I mean

626
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:42,980
 Hello, I just happened to be passing by and I saw your front door was open and I was just wondering Henry

627
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:47,620
 If you wouldn't like to come over tonight for me. Oh sure. I mean, yes

628
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:52,440
 Oh my goodness. What's going on here? Oh hello Aunt Harriet. What's the front door open for?

629
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:57,500
 Henry, where's your mother? Why I guess he's out in the kitchen at Harry. I've got to see her right away

630
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:02,860
 Now if Henry, what have you got the baseball back for? Oh, why are you putting it away for the wincer?

631
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:04,620
 Are you in the kitchen?

632
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:06,420
 Yes, Harry. I'm out here with Sam.

633
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:08,060
 Oh, so that's that, Alice.

634
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:09,580
 And Sam, you're a good talk with him?

635
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:11,660
 Yes, Alice. I've got him all straightened out.

636
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:14,580
 Alice, what do you think happened? You won't believe it.

637
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:17,340
 What is it? I'm going to lose my ice man.

638
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:19,140
 What? Yes, Alice.

639
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:21,300
 And I don't know whether it's a good thing or not.

640
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,620
 How do you know you're going to lose him?

641
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:25,260
 I just found this note in my icebox.

642
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:27,100
 And Alice, I didn't dream.

643
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:29,220
 I didn't dream he felt that way.

644
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:31,500
 May I see it? Here it is.

645
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:35,500
 I think it would be better if we did not go on any longer this way.

646
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,820
 Harriet, what does he mean this way?

647
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:39,780
 Delivering ice to me, I suppose.

648
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:41,900
 Go on, read the rest.

649
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:47,500
 Now that I have cooled off, I realize that neither one of us could have been really happy.

650
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:50,380
 Harriet, just how far are this gone?

651
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:52,060
 Well, not so very far, Alice.

652
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:54,500
 I'd given him a piece of pie now and then.

653
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:58,220
 But I never dreamed he was going to take it seriously.
