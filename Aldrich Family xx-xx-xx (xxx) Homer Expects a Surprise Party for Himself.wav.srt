00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 [Music]

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 You don't need to tie a string around your finger in order to remember to the teenage boy you want you or want worse.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 Any boy will bring back those memories, especially if he's Henry always.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 The scene opens in Homer Brown's house.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 The time is early afternoon.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 Elizabeth, is the coast clear?

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 Yes, yes.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 Homer that's clear as me.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 Good. Give me a hand with these things.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 My goodness, will all these pucks and brushes

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 set the place of the room, Woodward?

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 I'm not so loud. You want Homer to hear?

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 Wait, Henry, coming over.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 You should be here in a minute now.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 Well, I can understand why you don't want Homer around when you paint.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 I'm just thinking of you, Elizabeth.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,160
 He's just got me in a pot of paint and he'll crank up your whole house.

18
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,460
 And what makes you think so?

19
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:02,760
 He's Homer, isn't he?

20
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,600
 [Laughter]

21
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,500
 If you couldn't make an exception, is he one?

22
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,800
 After all, it seems Thursday, next week.

23
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,800
 I know, and I bought him a ukulele. That's enough for any boy.

24
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,200
 [Muffled]

25
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,500
 Does that sound like Homer?

26
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,900
 The little, but don't be foolish. I'd be painting.

27
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,600
 [Muffled]

28
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,300
 The quicker pieces, this stuff I'm so spending on time.

29
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:23,600
 He is. Oh, my goodness, you're not behind the sofa.

30
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,400
 [Muffled]

31
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:35,400
 Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. I'm calling. I'm... what's that sticking out from behind the sofa? Who do you think? He thought of missing the phone, though I didn't recognize you.

32
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,400
 (Laughter)

33
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:49,400
 Did you lose something? No. Oh. You're fixing the sofa? No. Doing exercises? No. Well, I'm saying how you speak. With mother? No. Who's there?

34
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,400
 Oh my.

35
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,400
 Do you have a few walks to meet the captain's central?

36
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,400
 Oh, yeah.

37
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,400
 Did you see my chemistry, sir?

38
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,400
 Your chemistry, sir?

39
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,400
 Oh, all right.

40
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,400
 Here I am, ready to start the biggest experiment of my life, and this disappears.

41
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,400
 It's on the bottom-side of the pantry.

42
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,400
 I bothered it to base that chocolate greek the other day.

43
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,400
 You want to eat it with my chemistry, sir?

44
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,400
 No wonder I felt so peculiar.

45
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,400
 Yeah, you felt peculiar because you ate five pieces.

46
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,400
 All right, I bothered with your sodium bicarbonate.

47
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,400
 This is famous baking soda.

48
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,400
 It is.

49
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,960
 Yeah, now go get it.

50
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,040
 Sure, father.

51
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,560
 But you think it's very fine,

52
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,560
 because I'd like to put anything on a chemistry set

53
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,800
 to convey for a take with it.

54
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,600
 Now, let's see.

55
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,280
 I think this is the right price.

56
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,200
 I mean, look, you won't get home a take, too.

57
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,640
 I think you could've used the way to eat

58
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,000
 the heat out of the house before you start.

59
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,960
 I'm not starting, but it can't hurt to test the color.

60
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,840
 And I'll stand back.

61
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,880
 Come on.

62
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,880
 Mother!

63
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,240
 You're so smuggly!

64
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,800
 I'll never make it back to the cold cold cold cold.

65
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,280
 I'll give you a little.

66
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,480
 Stand in front of me.

67
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,960
 Is it all right if I borrow a few things from a kitchen?

68
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,200
 - And then what more? - An experiment.

69
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,400
 If you can use chemistry to take one advice first,

70
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,240
 then very well, if you promise to return everything,

71
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,560
 then you can borrow what to need.

72
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,040
 - I already have.

73
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,080
 And mother, yes, she is.

74
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,240
 - You're looking for father.

75
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,800
 He's under the piano.

76
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,640
 (audience laughs)

77
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,960
 - Oh, I'm going to a piano room.

78
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,120
 - Stay under there, father, I'm going.

79
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,440
 - Wheel of browns just look.

80
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,640
 You've got green paint all over everything.

81
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,600
 - Elizabeth, it isn't all over everything.

82
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:16,240
 Just a few spots on the wall and a little on the ceiling.

83
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,500
 Henry, come in here.

84
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,500
 Hi, Mr. Brown.

85
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,500
 Hi, Mr. Brown.

86
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,000
 You started painting yet?

87
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 Henry, quiet.

88
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,200
 Homage right upstairs in his room.

89
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,800
 Oh, was I raising my voice?

90
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,040
 I'm a crazy wordy.

91
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,640
 Henry, are you sure you have everything straight?

92
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,640
 Sure.

93
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,940
 I'm to get Homer out of the house and not bring him back until you're through fooling

94
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:34,940
 around with the woodwork.

95
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:36,840
 Henry, I'm not fooling around.

96
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,840
 Oh.

97
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,080
 Do you think you'll have any trouble getting Homer out of the house?

98
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,920
 Sometimes he's as stubborn as a mule.

99
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:42,920
 You're brown.

100
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,880
 It's tough as when you get something in his mind.

101
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,380
 I'm trying to find it hard getting it out.

102
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:48,220
 You don't have to worry, Mr. Brown.

103
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:51,220
 All I have to do is smile at Homer and he was,

104
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:53,360
 I can get him to do anything I want.

105
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,620
 Excuse me.

106
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:57,460
 Homer, what are you going to do about those green spots?

107
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:59,460
 Oh, God, just hand me the seven-five.

108
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:01,140
 Homer?

109
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,140
 Homer, are you having your room?

110
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,900
 I have a little room.

111
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:08,380
 Say, say, Homer, what are you saying with me?

112
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:12,380
 He was, what are you making with that chemistry fest, money?

113
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:14,180
 Homer, that's against the law.

114
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:16,380
 - Well, I don't mean I'm making a money tournament.

115
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:18,220
 You're inventing a hair grower.

116
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:19,060
 - What for?

117
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,420
 - To grow hair.

118
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:21,260
 - I'm what?

119
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:23,100
 - Hey, he is.

120
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,540
 (laughing)

121
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:27,660
 - But a homer, you've already got more hair than you need.

122
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:28,500
 - I know.

123
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,860
 - He looks like a head of lettuce now.

124
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,940
 - And I'm not making it for myself.

125
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:33,780
 - No?

126
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:36,580
 - No, it's just as human beings in general.

127
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:38,580
 There's an article in this magazine that says,

128
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:41,300
 "The guy who finds something like that will make a fortune."

129
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,140
 - No kidding.

130
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:44,140
 I'm going to stand back while I put in some leaves.

131
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:45,140
 Yeesh!

132
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:48,140
 It would make cakes rise and make you the same things as the hair.

133
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:55,140
 A whole year old-timer, going full around with things like hair restore.

134
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:58,140
 When we could be outside, doing really important things.

135
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:59,140
 Like what?

136
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:00,140
 Well, I...

137
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:01,140
 Well...

138
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:05,140
 Did you know they're starting to rip up Main Street today?

139
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:08,140
 They are, sure, from Burch to Ticamor.

140
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:12,140
 You see the kind of important things that are going on in the outside world?

141
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:14,140
 Well, growing hair is important.

142
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:15,140
 It's true.

143
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:20,140
 Homer, did I mention I was planning on our going to a movie too?

144
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:21,140
 On May.

145
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:22,140
 No saying.

146
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:23,140
 Plus a soda afterwards.

147
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:24,140
 I'm not interested.

148
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:26,140
 Well, how about now?

149
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:29,140
 But Homer, look, I'm smiling.

150
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:32,140
 Homer, something stubborn is a mule.

151
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,140
 the mule.

152
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:39,140
 (music)

153
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:46,140
 Can I, will you please stop driving when Homer the fresh air is good for again.

154
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:49,140
 That is so good for me. Why are you forcing me to go to the movie?

155
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,140
 I'm not forcing you.

156
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:53,140
 Then let go of my arms.

157
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:55,140
 Look, Homer, old timer.

158
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:59,140
 Just give me one good reason why you don't want to go to the movie.

159
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:01,140
 I've seen the picture.

160
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:05,140
 I know, but give me one other good reason.

161
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:08,140
 Why should I go to the movie when I could be making a million dollars?

162
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:11,140
 And helping myself a man to go home.

163
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:12,140
 I'm going home.

164
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:14,140
 Homer, you can't go home, and that's that.

165
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,140
 Why now?

166
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:18,140
 Homer, please don't ask me. Why not? You just can't.

167
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:20,140
 Oh.

168
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:22,140
 What do you mean by a remark like that?

169
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:24,140
 Oh.

170
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:26,140
 Oh.

171
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:28,380
 Can we answer me one question?

172
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,780
 Did my parents tell you to keep me away?

173
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:31,780
 Your parents?

174
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:33,940
 Homer, you have no right to ask that.

175
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:35,780
 Oh!

176
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:38,260
 Look, Homer, I'm gonna get y'all whole bag of sour bowls.

177
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:39,420
 Who over yourself?

178
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:40,420
 Sour bowls.

179
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:42,320
 I'm the only two happy to go in the candy kitchen

180
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,260
 here and buy you some on me.

181
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:45,700
 Now don't you move, Homer.

182
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,220
 Say right, then.

183
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:49,260
 Your hand, old timer.

184
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:51,220
 Anything we say.

185
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:53,100
 Oh, that new one, huh?

186
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,420
 Oh, hi, Lily.

187
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,300
 Why are you standing around with them like that?

188
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,300
 Like why?

189
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,500
 Like you're looking, but your mouth hanging open and everything.

190
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,540
 Oh, are you willing?

191
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:02,100
 Have I been a school?

192
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,820
 I know, but why do it in public?

193
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:04,780
 [LAUGHTER]

194
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:05,780
 Know what, Lily?

195
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:08,740
 I'm doing a surprise party tonight.

196
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:11,100
 You're all sure my parents even have family

197
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,660
 trying to keep me away from their house

198
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,260
 while they're getting everything ready?

199
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:15,180
 Oh.

200
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,740
 You don't want to know?

201
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,980
 Why do you suppose they're throwing you today?

202
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,780
 My birthday isn't so next week.

203
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:22,020
 I don't know.

204
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,660
 Oh, now that I've seen something,

205
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:27,060
 My father did mention something about going out of town next week.

206
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,060
 Sure.

207
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:30,460
 Sure, well, have a good time, Homer.

208
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:31,260
 What do you want to know?

209
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,060
 Nothing.

210
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:34,560
 Happy returns of the day and all that sort of stuff.

211
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,660
 Well, what's the matter?

212
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:36,760
 Oh, nothing, Homer.

213
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,760
 I guess your mother's just inviting your closest friend.

214
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,060
 You know, we weren't invited.

215
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:41,860
 Oh, well, that's OK.

216
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:43,160
 Homer, don't give it another thought.

217
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,060
 Well, I don't mind.

218
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,060
 Well, I'm not hurt.

219
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,060
 Well, I love it, old work.

220
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:50,460
 Well, you never see a messaged somewhere.

221
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:51,800
 It was my social noise.

222
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,160
 Is anybody I wanted my party is you.

223
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,360
 You mean that homeless?

224
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,060
 You are.

225
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,060
 I'm not personal.

226
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,060
 I'm not.

227
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,560
 Here comes Henry.

228
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,060
 I don't want him to know I've caught on.

229
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:02,060
 Oh, sure.

230
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:03,060
 Here, no.

231
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,260
 We're a whole bag of sour balls.

232
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:06,260
 Different colors.

233
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:07,260
 Oh, hi, Willie.

234
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:07,760
 Hi, Henry.

235
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,860
 Well, it's the long home.

236
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:09,460
 We're all the--

237
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:10,460
 You know when.

238
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:11,460
 You know where.

239
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,460
 You know where.

240
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:13,860
 We'll be talking about.

241
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:14,960
 Oh, nothing.

242
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,460
 Hand all the time.

243
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:17,460
 Well, come on.

244
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:18,460
 Let's go.

245
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:18,960
 Go where?

246
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:19,960
 To the movies.

247
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:23,760
 Even though it's a terrible picture, I certainly wouldn't surprise you.

248
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,260
 Well, do you?

249
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:27,260
 And I'll tell you what else, him.

250
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:28,760
 This time, it's on me.

251
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,760
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

252
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:38,360
 And where did you say you were, Henry?

253
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,160
 At the movies, Mrs. Brown, I'm fine with you there.

254
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,360
 You got home where to go?

255
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,360
 Oh, I got him to go, all right.

256
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,860
 Oh, that's fine.

257
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,360
 And Mr. Brown still has half of it.

258
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,560
 But it's in your world, and it's stealing to do.

259
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,720
 I thought he was just doing the woodwork.

260
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,120
 - Well, his best dad had once it twice more,

261
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,720
 so he decided to do a complete job,

262
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,200
 so keep her away as long as possible.

263
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,840
 - Well, about that,

264
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,720
 if you haven't heard from Homer

265
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,800
 in the past 15 minutes, have you?

266
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,560
 - Tell me, you haven't lost him, have you?

267
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,320
 - No, no, I haven't lost him.

268
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,280
 He's just a little misplace, that's all.

269
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,760
 - Oh, I've missed him.

270
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,240
 - Got up to go for drink of water, see him?

271
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,920
 He whiz, and you know how terrible he is on direct.

272
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,920
 We probably just went back to the wrong street.

273
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:21,920
 Elizabeth.

274
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:22,920
 Oh, here we are.

275
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,920
 Henry, Mr. Bonnaby, Betty, I've said it.

276
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:25,920
 Homer, 10's up here now.

277
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,920
 Mr. Sure, Mrs. Brown.

278
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:29,920
 I'll go over to the theater with a fine-tilt comb.

279
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,920
 Goodbye.

280
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:31,920
 Goodbye.

281
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,920
 Elizabeth, are you still with the phone?

282
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:33,920
 Oh, no.

283
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,920
 I've got to call the hardware store. We'll need some more paint.

284
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,920
 But will you have plenty of that for the living room?

285
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,920
 Yes. But I was thinking, if we do the living room,

286
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,920
 think how shabby the hall will look by contrast.

287
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,920
 Will Brown, you mean you've started again?

288
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:57,920
 (music)

289
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,920
 Hi Mr. Trissel.

290
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:00,920
 Oh, my...

291
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,920
 Are they really as soon as I get these jelly rolls in the window?

292
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:03,920
 Take your time.

293
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:08,920
 Boy, if there's one thing I like to stand around and smell, it's a bakery.

294
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:09,920
 Eh...

295
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,920
 Ah, what can I do here?

296
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,920
 What?

297
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,920
 I'm just sort of picking up on...

298
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,920
 What? Oh boy.

299
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:19,920
 What's wrong?

300
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,920
 I think that looking at grass case here.

301
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,920
 Oh, those are my special orders.

302
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,920
 That's taken back. The one with pink icing.

303
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,920
 What does that letter in say?

304
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,920
 Happy anniversary to Virgy and Fred.

305
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:29,920
 It does.

306
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,920
 You know, upside down, Virgy looks something like Homer.

307
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,920
 What is it you're after, Oliver?

308
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,920
 I look like I'm after something.

309
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:39,920
 Yep.

310
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,920
 Mr. Sky, so I don't want you to give away any secrets.

311
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,920
 Did my mother place an order today?

312
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:50,320
 Yes, it is. Oh boy. I've got it written down here.

313
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,320
 "Rive brave, half a dozen rolls and some donuts."

314
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,320
 That's all? Yep.

315
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,320
 You couldn't be in a safe home, could you?

316
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,320
 He suppose my mother could avoid a case that said Happy Birthday, Homer.

317
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,320
 And he thought he said Happy anniversary, hurry, he and Fred.

318
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,320
 Oh, she ordered with donuts.

319
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:14,320
 Oh. Well, when I think of it, I am pretty fond of donuts.

320
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:19,320
 I guess they are more practical for a party who don't have to fly some parties.

321
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:22,320
 Now that I think of a donut here perfect.

322
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,320
 Oh, but these donuts can't be for a party.

323
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,320
 Why not?

324
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,320
 Not right, it's a pretty small party.

325
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,320
 You mother just ordered six.

326
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,320
 Six.

327
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,320
 You want one, two, three, four, five, six?

328
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,320
 Yeah.

329
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,320
 Mr. Fiverr, you must be wrong.

330
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,320
 Wrong.

331
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,320
 You must have had six dozen.

332
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,320
 Six dozen?

333
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,320
 Sure.

334
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:43,320
 He was how far would six donuts go with a mob that's coming to my house tonight?

335
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,160
 - How can I?

336
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,920
 (dramatic music)

337
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:54,740
 - As the fleet seems proudly out

338
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:57,360
 under the Golden Gate Bridge for their spring maneuvers.

339
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:02,060
 - Homer, Homer, are you in this row?

340
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:02,900
 Homer?

341
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,760
 - Young man, would you mind moving?

342
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,600
 - Yes, sir.

343
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,000
 - You're blocking the United States fleet.

344
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,640
 - Oh, excuse me.

345
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,960
 Homer!

346
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:15,560
 the battle line seems like great people to the imaginary enemy

347
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:20,800
 young man with you please be quiet but lady could you please tap that fellow

348
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,520
 sitting next to your mask him if he's home or brown that's not home a brown

349
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,360
 it looks just like him that's my copy bag

350
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:34,680
 I was sure I recognize his hair that's not hair that's ahead of neck it

351
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:40,620
 I'm moving off yes ma'am besides I think I see him down front anyway now the

352
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:42,740
 Please let's go to the Burnt Soundwell at the enemy.

353
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:44,660
 - Come on, Burnt.

354
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:47,000
 Oh, I'm going to run along to run along the street.

355
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,960
 Let's go now on. - No, I'm going to park him home.

356
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,520
 I'm going to let go of you, sexy.

357
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,040
 - And what I thought. - I'm going to.

358
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,700
 - I'm going to run along. - I'm going to run along.

359
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,900
 - I'm going to run along. - I'm going to run along.

360
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:59,700
 - I'm going to run along the street. - I'm going to run along the street.

361
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:05,880
 - I'm going to run along the street. - I'm going to run along the street.

362
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,960
 - Donnie, would you please stay behind that street?

363
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,940
 - I guess you want to see how you were coming along

364
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:15,380
 with my pants. I'm after first point in just a few minutes. Yeah. I'm supposed to

365
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:20,900
 stay away from home until supplicing in a way. Yeah. I'm being surprised you know.

366
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:26,980
 That's fine. That's how I happen to get caught with my pants on press. You don't

367
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:31,620
 happen to have a door open do you? No why? No reason I just thought I told a

368
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:36,700
 draft. I thought I used your phone. All you need is a nickel son. It's a

369
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:41,140
 pay for them. Hey what's it there. I'm showing again.

370
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:46,060
 Suppose I wrap this over code around my way. OK but be careful with

371
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:48,180
 facing on a public street you know sure.

372
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:53,580
 I'm nine one one.

373
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:55,220
 Yes ma'am.

374
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:57,580
 I'm a sir. What is this now?

375
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:00,700
 Did you press those hands so I was a little taller.

376
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,500
 How could I do a thing like that?

377
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,620
 Well I know I'm no tailor.

378
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:17,300
 a miracle man. Is this Adney? Yeah. I just called ask if your cousin Eloise is still visiting you.

379
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:23,300
 You're a what? No reason. But if you want to bring her along tonight, it's perfectly alright.

380
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:27,300
 Say your what? You know Adney. You know.

381
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:30,300
 Sir, do anything weird you should have had around in Paul's house.

382
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,300
 Oh sure you were.

383
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,300
 Listen on the what's up.

384
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:36,300
 Adi, don't tell my mother, but I know.

385
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,300
 No what?

386
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:39,300
 About my surprise party tonight.

387
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,300
 You're having a party?

388
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:42,300
 You were invited, either?

389
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,300
 No.

390
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:46,300
 She was my mother showing all the pieces on this thing.

391
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:49,300
 Look, Adi, if you're definitely to come.

392
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,300
 Adi, Adi.

393
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,300
 Sure, and Eloise too.

394
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,300
 How are you, doll? How are you?

395
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,300
 I'm going to have a shot in the way.

396
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,300
 Where are you wearing?

397
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,300
 All right, Mel.

398
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,300
 No, no, no.

399
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,300
 Wait, what are you doing here?

400
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,300
 where only I'll be correct.

401
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,860
 Why is he gone? I haven't been following him.

402
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,300
 He's calling past me.

403
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,300
 Hey, homo.

404
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,300
 Come on.

405
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,300
 What's up, Lily?

406
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,300
 Oh, I kept running.

407
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:13,300
 Homo, do you know you have that over-cold on roll?

408
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,300
 It's a never mind, Lily.

409
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,300
 Oh.

410
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,300
 Well, the reason I've been looking for you,

411
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,300
 Charlie Clark and Toby Smith are pretty upset

412
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:20,300
 about nothing uninvited.

413
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:23,300
 And two, listen, Lily, would you give them up

414
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:25,300
 and tell them it's a mistake and they're definitely the term?

415
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,300
 Okay.

416
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,300
 Maybe you better stop by the bakery on your way

417
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:31,300
 in order to ignore dozens of what donuts

418
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:34,300
 with all these extra people coming, we're gonna need them.

419
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:37,300
 Okay, and you happen to have five nickels for a quarter.

420
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:40,300
 I better pick up and see who else my mother forgot to invite.

421
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:50,300
 And now getting back to the troubles of Henry Olgre.

422
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,300
 When Henry reveals to let him go home,

423
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:57,300
 Homer jumps at the conclusion that his parents were throwing him at the prize party.

424
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:03,300
 And while he's been checking on all the preparations, Henry has been trying desperately to locate him.

425
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:06,300
 The scene opens in a phone booth at the movie house.

426
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,300
 Mother, are you still there?

427
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:12,300
 Yes, dear. Your father's coming to the phone now. Are you in some kind of trouble?

428
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:15,300
 Trouble, Mother? Huh? She was what my giving him in trouble?

429
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,300
 What is he, your father?

430
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,300
 Hello.

431
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,300
 Boy, father, am I in trouble?

432
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,300
 What's happened now?

433
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:29,300
 Why, it's sort of hard to explain, but could you come right down to the colonial theater and testify to your son's character?

434
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,300
 Go, "Parachts"?

435
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:38,300
 Yes, sir. And explain to the manager that I'm usually very well behaved in that I've never molester the lady in my life.

436
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:49,300
 He had to be able to be kicking walls out as he was sexy-canded.

437
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,900
 I thought Will was just doing the living room woodwork.

438
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:53,500
 That's the way it started.

439
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,100
 And thank goodness he's about to,

440
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,900
 all the assu-cinnages are that poor.

441
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,900
 Come on, goodness, what happened?

442
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,900
 He overlapped.

443
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:01,900
 He walked?

444
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:02,900
 He overlapped.

445
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,300
 From one room to the other.

446
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:06,100
 Oh, Alice, don't you know what that's to do?

447
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,500
 Why not?

448
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,500
 He overlapped with that too.

449
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,700
 I found the bottom.

450
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:15,700
 In the kitchen, I mentioned from I was actually a terrible figure

451
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:19,200
 perfectly powerful saying here what happened well my cousin

452
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,780
 always didn't make me have a strength to do it alone

453
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:22,700
 say you do what

454
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:26,460
 hold half you don't see a body two-boy cap and then falling off a bike over the

455
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:30,500
 house and have a play guy go now don't you think if you rule that tell him to stay

456
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,460
 home tonight

457
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:32,700
 I suppose it would

458
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:33,700
 I suppose it would

459
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:34,300
 a good

460
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:34,700
 a good

461
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:34,920
 a

462
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,300
 fine

463
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,100
 bring them where

464
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,700
 yeah don't worry it's a fine party that you're growing far

465
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:40,380
 but I'm

466
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:41,380
 that I am

467
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:42,980
 - This is a new thing to tell me.

468
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,180
 - Maybe I shouldn't tell you this.

469
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:45,820
 This is bound by Homer, no.

470
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:48,300
 But he might have caught on when Henry tried

471
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,340
 to keep more of him than a house all day.

472
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:51,940
 - Oh my goodness.

473
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:53,940
 - And Elizabeth, you suck down on that soon.

474
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,420
 - How about tell, how long we just okay?

475
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:56,500
 - But I should go to the party.

476
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,380
 - I didn't have any answer to come in.

477
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,380
 - Oh yes.

478
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:00,380
 - What the hell is what I'm gonna do?

479
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:02,020
 What's the surprise party?

480
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:03,640
 If you mean you didn't know,

481
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,140
 I've never been so surprised in my life.

482
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:06,980
 - Oh, there.

483
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:09,100
 - I'll never be able to get to these Eddie and Ty.

484
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,540
 You're gonna have the party anyway.

485
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:12,300
 - The moment it's second or last, you would be great.

486
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,700
 You thought if I didn't, well, look, Elizabeth.

487
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,900
 It probably won't be many, young students.

488
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:19,620
 Why not get a few bottles of ginger ale and some cookies,

489
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:21,140
 and they'll have a love later.

490
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:22,180
 - It's all right.

491
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:23,180
 I need a phone, Alice.

492
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:24,020
 - Who are you gonna call?

493
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:26,460
 - It's Isaac, basically, and double my order of donut.

494
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:29,040
 (upbeat music)

495
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:39,060
 - All right, Homer, now how do you want your haircut?

496
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:45,060
 Well Mr. Latham, you notice when you look in my hair in a certain way, it reminds you of a head of leather?

497
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:47,060
 Well now that you mention it.

498
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:50,060
 Could you just sort of look more like a head of a fabric?

499
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:53,060
 Uh, no, dry. I hope so.

500
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:54,060
 Yes, sir.

501
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:57,060
 So, you're having a surprise, buddy.

502
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:59,060
 Yes, sir.

503
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:00,060
 Don't move.

504
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:04,060
 Mr. Latham, should I mention I'm inventing a hair restore?

505
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:06,060
 Yes, what for?

506
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:12,300
 We saw hair. When I get it perfected, would you be interested in trying it out on some of your customers?

507
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:15,580
 When you get it perfected, I'd be interested in trying it out of myself.

508
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,420
 Oh sure.

509
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:21,180
 Yes, uh, Barbara with a bald head, great poor recommendation.

510
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:24,620
 Who's that tapping on the window?

511
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:25,580
 Oh, hi, Henry.

512
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:28,060
 Hey, who is the home owner of you, Ben?

513
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:28,940
 What are you mad about?

514
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:32,860
 What am I mad about? What am I mad about? Where did you go for that drink of water?

515
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,620
 - For tonight, I have a fool.

516
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:35,460
 (audience gasps)

517
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:36,560
 - Oh, the bakery.

518
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,560
 - What?

519
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:40,220
 - Homer, it's still, isn't it, a tick-free shop.

520
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,940
 - It might interest you to know, Homer,

521
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,900
 that you owe me for a box of cocklets.

522
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:46,300
 My father had a bar for that lady in the theater.

523
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:47,140
 - What lady?

524
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:47,980
 - Never mind.

525
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:49,620
 - How do you want me to cut the sides, Homer?

526
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,140
 Close the floor.

527
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:52,860
 - Which of a faster than me?

528
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:53,980
 - A card to sell.

529
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:57,860
 - Well, make one side close and one side close.

 What sort of game?

 Out in the backyard. He wanted a fitting cigar door before he soaked his brushes.
