00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.000
 The Oldridge family based on characters originated by Clifford Goldsmith and starring Ezra Stone as Henry with Jackie Kalk as Homer.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.500
 Henry! Henry Oldridge!

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:18.500
 Coming, mother!

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.480
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:33.140
 And now for the Olridge family.

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.640
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:54.220
 The phrase "never a dull moment" certainly describes a day in the life of a typical teenage American boy like Henry Ulrich.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:59.220
 And it more than describes what happens to everyone who comes in contact with him.

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:03.220
 The scene opens in the Ulrich front hall. It is late afternoon.

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.220
 You! Anybody here?

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.220
 Hello, Otter! Sam! What are you doing, Ho?

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.220
 I finished early at the office. Where have you been, Otter?

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.220
 Why, out. Just out.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.220
 - Do you have a good time? - Lovely.

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.220
 As soon as I take my hat off, dear, I'll make us a cup of tea.

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.220
 That'll be nice.

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.220
 Was... what, anyone with you?

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.220
 Where, dear?

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.220
 - Out. - No. No, I was all by myself.

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.220
 Oh. Not that I care where you went, Alice.

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.220
 Naturally, your time is your own, but you look a little funny.

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.220
 I do. Well, Sam. - Yes?

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.220
 That is... did you have an interesting day, dear?

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.220
 - That's good. - Did you?

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.220
 Oh, yes, I had the most... I'll go and make the tea.

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.220
 Alice, where were you?

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:57.220
 Well, Sam, I wasn't going to tell you just yet, but I'm so excited I'd been to an auction sale.

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.220
 I hope you didn't buy anything.

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.220
 Now, do you know perfectly well I bought something?

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.220
 Oh, right, let's have it.

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.220
 Well, they're sort of chairs.

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:07.220
 What kind of chairs?

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.220
 They're the kind that they'd be just grand in our...

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.520
 Grand in our... well, any place we put them.

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:15.520
 How many chairs?

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:16.720
 How many?

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.620
 Sander, genuine early American, and it sounded as though they went back to 1840.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:22.420
 They went where?

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.820
 And they were awfully cheap, dear, and there's a good deal of wood on them, I know that.

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:27.520
 I see.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.720
 But, dear, before you set your heart on them, they may not be chairs.

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:32.720
 What?

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.620
 Sam, I was way at the back of the hall and there was a woman with a feather right in front of you.

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.220
 So, I'm not quite sure what I bought.

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.220
 What?

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.220
 In the living room, Henry.

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.220
 Oh boy, have you heard about the Browns?

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:44.220
 Have you heard about the Browns?

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.220
 What Browns?

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.220
 The Homer Browns, gee, was guess what happened to them?

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.220
 What happened?

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:49.220
 I don't know.

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.220
 What?

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.220
 I just ran into Willie Marshall and he said something practically unbelievable happened to them.

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.220
 And he didn't say what it was?

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:58.220
 He doesn't know either.

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.220
 But boy, it's all over town, so somebody ought to know, I'm going to phone in!

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.220
 That's odd. I had lunch with Will Brown today, he didn't mention anything.

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.220
 - Whatever's happened to them must have...

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.220
 Oh my goodness, is that a truck pulling into our drive?

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.220
 - It looks like it. - Send that must be my chairs.

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.220
 - Alice, walk, don't run! - Come and see them, dear!

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:21.220
 - 117 Elm Street, all rich. - That's right. Just set them right down here.

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.220
 Oh, my, are they beautiful?

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:30.220
 - All right, Alice, what are they? - Looks, and they are chairs, ladder backs.

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.220
 - Wow, here, lady, sign here. - Yes, of course.

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.220
 - Thanks. - Good-bye.

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.220
 And thank you.

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.740
 Sam, look, five dining room chairs.

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:46.740
 Genuine antiques. Aren't they beautiful?

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:50.380
 - Grand? Just grand? - I'm so glad you like them, dear.

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:52.380
 Oh, I do, I do.

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.380
 They're just one small point I'd like to bring up.

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:56.460
 Yes?

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:59.060
 We already have a set of dining room chairs.

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.060
 Now, isn't that just like a man?

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.300
 It is.

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:05.380
 Need in all kinds of places we can use them.

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:06.380
 Such as?

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:07.380
 Such as...

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:11.380
 And besides, Sandy's chairs are really a wonderful investment.

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:12.380
 Oh, they?

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:13.380
 Of course they are, dear.

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.380
 Antiques always have a high resale value, didn't you know?

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.380
 And you always said, "I don't have a good head for business."

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.380
 But Alice, come on, dear.

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.380
 Let's go in the living room and take a look around.

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:25.380
 Oh, four.

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.380
 Maybe there's something we can get rid of to make room for the chair.

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:30.380
 Alice, we're not going to start throwing out my favorite furniture.

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.380
 No kidding, Agnes.

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:34.380
 Oh, boy.

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.380
 Well, goodbye, Agnes.

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.380
 She was the way Agnes understands it's Homer's uncle who died.

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:41.380
 Oh, that's too bad.

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:46.380
 No, it isn't. He left a will or something. Agnes says she hears the Browns of inherited a couple of fortunes.

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.380
 Henry, aren't you being rather mercenary?

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:50.380
 I know, but...

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:52.380
 Well, she was, do you realize what that means?

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.380
 Dear, you're entirely too excited.

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:58.380
 The mother, don't you agree it's pretty wonderful when your best friend suddenly becomes successful?

00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:59.380
 I'll answer the phone.

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:01.680
 Henry, I want you to go and comb your hair.

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:02.680
 Comb my hair?

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.180
 Just when Homer's falling into some money?

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.380
 Hello?

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.180
 Hello, Sam. This is Will Brown.

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:10.480
 Well, I just heard the news.

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:11.480
 Which brother was it?

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:12.380
 What's that?

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:13.580
 Or was it your uncle?

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:14.680
 Who's uncle?

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.180
 Is this Sam Aldrich?

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:18.780
 Will, didn't you just come into some money?

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:19.680
 Well, yes.

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.680
 And I want you to know how sorry I am.

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.380
 Sam, what are you talking about?

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:25.880
 There's nothing new wrong with my brother.

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.780
 Oh. Then what's the story that's going around town?

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:30.540
 How should I know you tell me?

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:31.540
 Never mind.

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:34.860
 Look, Sam, why don't you and Alice join us for dinner at the mansion house tonight?

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:35.820
 The mansion house?

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:37.220
 Hana, Sam, hana.

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:38.540
 That sounds like a good idea.

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:40.420
 That is provided I can reserve a table.

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:43.180
 Well, Alice and I can provide the chairs.

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:45.860
 That's funny you should mention chairs, Sam.

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:47.580
 That's where we picked up some money today.

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:48.300
 Oh?

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:52.260
 Elizabeth unloaded an old set of chairs on some sucker at an auction sale.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:56.420
 Well, now, well, isn't that...

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:58.620
 Well, what was that again?

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:02.620
 The five old chairs, eh, that we got stung on 15 years ago,

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:04.920
 and they've been kicking around in our attic ever since.

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:05.820
 Uh, well...

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:08.620
 Some fella told us they were genuine entities.

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:11.120
 Well, what exactly did these chairs look like?

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:15.120
 I'm short of early American ladder bag jobs with straw seats.

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.620
 And knobs all the way up the legs?

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:18.620
 [chuckles]

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:21.120
 I'll give you a stage every song.

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:22.120
 Yeah.

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:22.620
 [laughter]

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:26.120
 I'd sure like to see the expression on the face of the poor guy that got him.

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:29.620
 Well, I don't think we'll be able to make it for dinner tonight after all.

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:30.620
 No, I'm not.

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:34.120
 Frankly, I suddenly don't have much of an appetite.

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:49.120
 Henry, never mind making whirlpools with the cream. Just eat your cereal.

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:53.120
 Sure, Father. I'm eating it. Only, frankly, I'm a little worried about Mother.

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:54.120
 What about me?

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:57.120
 Ever since last night, you've been looking kind of sad.

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:59.120
 Henry, finish your breakfast. You'll be late for school.

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:02.120
 No, I won't, Mother. There's plenty of time before Homer gets here.

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:03.120
 Homer's coming over?

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:06.120
 Sure to call for me. Mother, look.

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:08.120
 Are you worried about something I've done?

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:10.120
 Of course not, Henry.

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:13.120
 Henry, will you run upstairs and get me a handkerchief?

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:15.120
 Isn't that a handkerchief there in your coat, Parker?

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:16.120
 Please get me another one.

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:17.120
 You want to, handkerchief?

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:18.120
 I feel a cole coming on.

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:19.120
 But, Father, please go!

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:21.120
 But please go!

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:25.120
 I don't want Henry to know a thing about those chairs.

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:26.120
 He doesn't think...

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:28.120
 And I don't want Homer to know about them either.

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:30.120
 You've shot straight back to Will with the news.

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:31.120
 Now, Sam...

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:32.120
 Don't you understand I'll never be able to look

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:33.120
 Will Brown in the eye again.

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:36.120
 Is that why you hid the chairs down in the coal bin?

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:37.120
 Yes.

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:40.120
 I want you to get rid of them today, do you understand?

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:42.120
 But, Sam, have you looked at it this way?

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:45.120
 The longer you keep antiques, the more valuable they become.

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:48.120
 But Alice, those chairs are not antiques.

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:50.720
 They will be if we keep them long enough.

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:51.920
 Alice.

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:54.220
 Here's your handkerchief father and some aspirin.

00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:55.120
 Aspen, what's off?

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:56.020
 She was your cold.

00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:57.320
 Here, I'll pour you a glass of water.

00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:58.320
 Henry, I don't need any water.

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:00.320
 You mean you just swallow them straight?

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:01.320
 Hey, Henry.

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:03.920
 I'll be right there, and I'll--

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:04.920
 --come by everybody.

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:06.520
 Henry, come back here.

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:08.320
 Well, what is it, Father?

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:12.220
 Henry, naturally, if you're walking to school with Homer,

00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:13.720
 you'll be talking to him.

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:15.120
 Sure.

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:16.020
 Well, then remember this.

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:19.140
 If he asks you any questions about the family, you know nothing.

00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:20.400
 Absolutely nothing.

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:21.000
 About what?

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:21.500
 Nothing.

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:23.300
 Nothing?

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:24.500
 Father, is something wrong?

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:25.780
 No, of course not, Henry.

00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:28.820
 But no matter what, Homer asks you, just don't answer it.

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:30.820
 Hey, Henry, we're going to be late for school.

00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:31.700
 I'm coming, Homer.

00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:32.740
 Goodbye, everybody.

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:34.300
 Don't forget your books.

00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:35.140
 I want Mother.

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:35.940
 Goodbye.

00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:36.900
 Bye, Henry.

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:38.980
 Have a good life.

00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:40.980
 Homer, are you asking me?

00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:43.060
 Because of you all, I know nothing.

00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:43.940
 About what?

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:44.580
 Never mind.

00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:45.180
 Let's have a good life.

00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:48.180
 Hey, you don't have to take the whole word.

00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:50.180
 But look at the size bag you have.

00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:51.180
 Boy, that's nothing.

00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:53.180
 Will you see what I've got in my pocket?

00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:54.180
 Yeah.

00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:56.180
 Look, licorice, bubblegum, cigars.

00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:57.180
 Cigars?

00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:58.180
 The street.

00:08:58.180 --> 00:08:59.180
 Cigars?

00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:01.180
 Sure, they're solid chocolate.

00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:02.180
 Boy, what happened?

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:05.180
 Although my father said your uncle didn't die after all.

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:07.180
 He didn't, but we had a windfall just the same.

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:09.180
 This morning my father called me and said,

00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:13.180
 Homer, how about stepping up your allowance this week?

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:14.180
 He did?

00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:17.780
 And listen, why don't you ask your father to do the same thing?

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:20.780
 Now wait Homer, what are you trying to pump me about?

00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:21.780
 Pump you?

00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:22.780
 How?

00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:24.580
 I've noticed, I've noticed.

00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:26.780
 All you've done is ask me questions.

00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:29.380
 Why doesn't my father increase my allowance?

00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:30.980
 Will I have a gumdrop?

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:32.380
 Shall we cross the street?

00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:34.980
 Exactly what is it you're driving at?

00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:36.780
 Are you crazy?

00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:38.780
 See that, there's another question.

00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:42.780
 Well let me tell you, my folks told me to keep my mouth shut

00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:48.540
 shot and I'm going to you mean it's that bad. Homer if you'll change that from a

00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:53.220
 question to a statement I'll tell you otherwise you'll just have to wonder okay

00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:57.740
 things at your house are pretty bad aren't they I mean things are bad boy

00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:01.980
 they sure are do you know what I overheard my mother tell my father last

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:06.540
 night she said she wouldn't ask him for one cent to run the house on for the next

00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:11.500
 six weeks yeah and she said she had a good head for business too why'd she say

00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:13.500
 I don't know anything like that.

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:16.500
 Maybe she's going to help my father out.

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:19.500
 She may be I ought to find a way to help out too.

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:21.500
 Henry, you're the very guy I want to talk to.

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:23.500
 How'd you like to go into business with me?

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:24.500
 What business?

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:27.500
 Look, I'm not asking you this. I'm telling you.

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:30.500
 Did you know there's a terrific demand for secondhand furniture in John?

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:31.500
 Huh?

00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:35.500
 Whatever you can dig up, somebody is darn full enough to pay money for.

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:39.500
 Homer, since you're not asking me what I like to go into business with you,

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:41.500
 is yes I would.

00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:53.500
 If you'll just come with me, Mr. Smith.

00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:54.500
 Uh-huh.

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:56.500
 The chairs are right here in the cold bin.

00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:58.500
 There they are.

00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:00.500
 Uh-huh.

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:01.500
 As you see, they're ladder backs.

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:02.500
 Uh-huh.

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:04.500
 And quite old, I believe.

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:06.500
 Uh-huh.

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:10.500
 This is what I'll be perfectly honest with you. I paid $25 for them.

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:13.500
 Well, you got a good buy. These are valuable chairs.

00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:14.500
 What?

00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:15.500
 Yes, ma'am.

00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:21.500
 You don't say, "Wait until my husband hears that. He insists I have no business sense."

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:23.500
 Uh, where's the sixth chair?

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:24.500
 I only have size.

00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:28.500
 Oh, too bad. If you had the set of six, I could pay you $65 for them.

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:30.500
 You would as much as that.

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:31.500
 If you had six.

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:32.500
 Oh, my goodness.

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:33.500
 Five are worthless.

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:34.500
 Worthless.

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:35.500
 To me, they are.

00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:37.500
 Oh, uh-huh.

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:44.500
 Now, wait. It just occurred to me, Mr. Smith, as the slightest possibility I might be able to get the other one.

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:45.500
 Yes?

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:50.500
 The couple who used to own the might have it kicking her. That is lying around.

00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:03.100
 Homer, are you sure that auction sale is going on for two more days?

00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:29.240
 Hi,

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:31.240
 Of course it was hand carved.

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:34.240
 Yeah, but the only thing carved on your bed is your initials.

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:35.240
 So why?

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:39.240
 Somebody might come along with the same initials and be crazy about it.

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:43.240
 But supposing you did get $100 for the darn thing, what would you sleep on?

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:45.240
 Who'd want to sleep?

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:47.240
 I know, but...

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:50.240
 And he decides, Henry, are we trying to raise money to help your folks?

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:51.240
 Yeah. Okay then.

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:55.240
 After all they've done for me, the least I can do in return is sleep on the floor.

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:56.240
 a floor.

00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:58.240
 My father will certainly appreciate it.

00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:00.240
 Henry, who's that out in the hall?

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:01.240
 I don't see anyone.

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:03.240
 There was a woman of some kind.

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:05.240
 She was sort of tiptoeing along.

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:08.240
 All of a sudden she slid into my mother's bedroom.

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:09.240
 She suppose it's a cleaning woman?

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:11.240
 Here she comes out again.

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:12.240
 Well, hello, boys.

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:13.240
 Is that you?

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:16.240
 Father and I have not been for a little visit with the browns.

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:19.240
 My, but a lovely room you have here, Homer.

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:21.240
 Well, my goodness.

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:23.240
 What's an animus' all, Rich?

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:27.240
 Homer, that little stool with a straw seat over there in the corner, it looks like...

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:30.240
 That's the seat part of an old chair we used to have.

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:31.240
 What?

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:32.240
 Well then, what's the matter?

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:34.240
 Homer, where's the rest of it?

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:35.240
 The back part?

00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:37.240
 My father uses it for a pipe rack.

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:39.240
 You don't say...

00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:41.240
 Oh, my...

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:46.240
 Homer, I... I suppose you're quite attached to that lovely little stool?

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:47.240
 No.

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:50.240
 She was, I only used it to rest my foot on when I'm shining my shoes.

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:51.240
 Really?

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:53.640
 Sure. How did they ever do that?

00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:56.280
 Oh, that was wonderful.

00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:58.580
 I wish my mother took that attitude.

00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:01.420
 And the back of the chair is your father's typewriter?

00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:03.380
 Sure. Well...

00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:06.880
 Will you excuse me, boys? I'm going downstairs and speak to your father.

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:12.020
 Henry, do you think you're a folks have lost their home and they're moving in here with us?

00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:14.220
 Gee, whiz.

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:15.420
 Gee.

00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:17.560
 Homer, you're putting that old stool in the back?

00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:19.860
 Sure. We're gonna sell it at the auction.

00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:21.500
 - Matt Darnfett? - Why not?

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:22.740
 If it looked good to your mother,

00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:24.340
 it might look good to somebody else.

00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:26.620
 - You're crazy. - Now listen, Henry,

00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:29.380
 do you really wanna help your folks, or don't you?

00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:31.960
 (upbeat music)

00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:37.800
 (audience applauding)

00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:47.460
 (upbeat music)

00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:53.700
 Yes, getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldrich.

00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:59.380
 Alice and Sam Aldrich discover that the five antique chairs she had bought at auction were

00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:04.820
 worthless without the sixth, which they are now trying to get from the Browns.

00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:10.180
 As a result, Henry and Homer believe Henry's parents are in financial difficulties.

00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:11.540
 The scene opens at the Browns.

00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:14.060
 It is a little later the same day.

00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:17.420
 I was saying, "Well, I've certainly become attached to that pipe rack of yours."

00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:18.500
 "That darn thing?"

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:20.060
 "Yes, it sort of grows on you.

00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:21.500
 Why, it was only five minutes ago.

00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:22.860
 I first laid eyes on it."

00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:25.180
 "It took fifteen years for it to grow on me."

00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:26.220
 "Is that right?"

00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:27.740
 "I certainly wish it were mine."

00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:29.340
 "Well, Sam, you smoked cigars, don't you?"

00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:31.260
 "Oh, I've suddenly taken up pipes."

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:32.460
 "I'm going here now."

00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:34.620
 "I thought pipes made you deathly sick."

00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:37.260
 "Well, they used to, but not anymore, Will."

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:38.380
 "Well, in here.

00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:39.740
 And let me make your present."

00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:40.220
 "What?"

00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:41.900
 "Here's a pipe I've never touched.

00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:43.180
 My wife's brother said it to me.

00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:45.180
 I wouldn't smoke it with a ten-foot pole.

00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:46.080
 But, well...

00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:47.380
 It's your, Sam.

00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:49.480
 And here's some new tobacco picked up.

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:50.880
 Yeah, fill it up for you.

00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:51.780
 But you see, well...

00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:56.180
 Sam, would I ever give you anything if I really wanted it?

00:15:56.180 --> 00:15:58.080
 Yeah.

00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:00.380
 I hope I haven't packed the tobacco into tight.

00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:00.880
 Oh.

00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:02.380
 Here's a light.

00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:05.380
 Thank you, Will.

00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:07.280
 Thank you very much.

00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:10.780
 Now, there's a smoke with authority.

00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:13.040
 (laughing)

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:18.320
 The only thing is, now I really need a place to keep this pipe.

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:19.560
 - What, Sam?

00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:21.820
 - I'll buy that pipe rack from you, Will.

00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:22.660
 - Well...

00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:24.160
 - Sam, did you...

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:27.420
 Will, what are you two so busy talking about?

00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:29.360
 - Why, we're simply...

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:32.260
 - Sam, I never saw you smoke a pipe before.

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:33.100
 - You didn't?

00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:34.860
 Well, you're seeing me do it now.

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:35.700
 (laughing)

00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:36.540
 - What are they now?

00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:37.700
 Is that in the kitchen with a little bit?

00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:40.300
 - No, I just went back upstairs to...

00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:41.900
 Sam, do you feel well?

00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:43.560
 Yes, I feel...

00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:45.800
 Isn't it just a little close in here?

00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:47.040
 No, you don't notice it too.

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:49.140
 Let me go open the front door for a minute.

00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:50.640
 Sam, it's gone.

00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:51.640
 What's gone?

00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:52.980
 The stool up in Homer's room,

00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:54.740
 the other half of that pipe rack.

00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:56.240
 It is?

00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:58.240
 Yeah, don't you even care?

00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:00.240
 Yeah.

00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:01.740
 Sam, I'll tell you what.

00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:04.980
 If you want that dog gone pipe rack so much, I'll sell it to you.

00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:05.980
 Yes, sir.

00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:08.980
 Give me a $10 bill and we'll call it square.

00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:10.380
 Sam?

00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:12.220
 Sam?

00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:14.140
 Sam, speak to me.

00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:16.140
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:25.420
 So sold for $0.25 to the boy with a lady in the sailor fan.

00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:26.420
 She went.

00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:28.700
 Now, just wait a minute while we get the next few items up

00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:29.540
 on the track.

00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:32.240
 Boy, Henry, did you see that $0.25

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:33.900
 from my old left roller skater?

00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:35.500
 Imagine aren't people done.

00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:37.740
 Oh, say boy, they'll buy anything.

00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:39.980
 Now we come to this very interesting item.

00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:41.340
 Homer, it's your school.

00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:43.540
 The one my mother was so crazy about.

00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:46.780
 We have here folks a very valuable looking, uh...

00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:49.220
 Well, it might make a fine milking stew.

00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:50.980
 Or for shining shoes.

00:17:50.980 --> 00:17:52.180
 Did I hear a bit of two?

00:17:52.180 --> 00:17:53.620
 No, she was, I just said.

00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:54.620
 Homer, keep quiet.

00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:56.060
 He didn't say so.

00:17:56.060 --> 00:17:57.420
 Who I have? Who'll make it three?

00:17:57.420 --> 00:17:58.420
 Oh, boy.

00:17:58.420 --> 00:17:59.620
 Do I hear $3?

00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:01.460
 Three is bid? Three is bid? Three is bid?

00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:02.460
 Who'll make it three dollars?

00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:04.260
 Sure, who'll make it three?

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:05.860
 You will find $3 I had.

00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:06.860
 No!

00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:11.860
 - What are you doing? - $3 I'm bid for this unique and fascinating little item here.

00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:14.860
 $3 is bid. I'm bid $3.00. $3.00, who make it for?

00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:17.860
 - Give me what I do. - No one says $4.00?

00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:19.860
 When it looks as if the young man in the front row was in luck.

00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:21.860
 - For me? - Going for $3.00?

00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:24.860
 - Then it's costing me $3.00. - Oh, he finds my own stool.

00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:28.860
 - It's going for... - Hey, what's the commotion back there?

00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:32.860
 - What's happening? - We're the gentlemen who just came in, please find a seat.

00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:34.860
 Perhaps he'd like to bid on this object.

00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:36.860
 - Yeah. - Can't me somebody wants to buy it.

00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:38.860
 The bid stands at $3.00. - Red, red, red, red.

00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:40.860
 - No. - I can't accept the 50-cent ray, sir.

00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:41.860
 Why not?

00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:43.860
 There's a young fella here in the front row

00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:45.860
 who's very eager to have this too.

00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:47.860
 No, no, no, no, no. - $10.00?

00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:49.860
 - What? - That's more like it.

00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:52.860
 So, for $10.00 to the gentleman without a seat in the rear.

00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:54.860
 [laughter]

00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:57.860
 Boy, who wants to block the stool?

00:18:57.860 --> 00:18:58.860
 I don't know.

00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:00.860
 I can't see back that far.

00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:02.860
 See, you know, if I didn't happen to know my father

00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:05.860
 happened to know my father was having financial difficulties.

00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:07.780
 I swear it sounded like him.

00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:18.380
 Oh, excuse me.

00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:19.620
 Could you help me right away, please?

00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:21.980
 I want to have this chair.

00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:23.580
 Why Gus?

00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:25.260
 No, Mr. Horridge.

00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:27.020
 I thought this was the cabinet makers.

00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:28.060
 It is.

00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:28.780
 But Gus--

00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:30.860
 I'm the new apprentice.

00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:31.580
 A apprentice?

00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:32.420
 Yeah.

00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:35.680
 You know, they take on young fellas and teach them the trade.

00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:38.020
 But just last week you were an exterminator.

00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:39.480
 Yeah, I'd give it up.

00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:40.220
 Is that so?

00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:41.300
 Yeah.

00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:45.100
 There I'd be and there a poor little aunt would be.

00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:46.060
 I'd give a--

00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:47.560
 [WISH]

00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:50.000
 There I'd be and the little aunt wouldn't be.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.100
 [LAUGHTER]

00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:53.460
 I'd give it up, Miss.

00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:54.580
 I see.

00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:56.600
 Went against my nature.

00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:57.860
 Well, um, uh, got you.

00:19:57.860 --> 00:19:59.820
 See this chair?

00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:01.020
 Is that what--

00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:02.420
 Well, it used to be.

00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:04.420
 Now, can you take this too, brother?

00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:08.620
 Well, that reminds me of a chair I fixed once for my Aunt Hepsa bar.

00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:09.620
 What a wreck.

00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:10.620
 It was?

00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:12.020
 You know, she was.

00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:16.020
 But, Gus, look, the chair wasn't really damaged.

00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:17.220
 Wasn't any?

00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:18.620
 Oh, yes, it was.

00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:21.020
 My Uncle Horace, he went clear through it.

00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:24.020
 The back part was used for a pipe rack, you see.

00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:26.820
 No, no, couldn't have been used for that.

00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:28.820
 'Cause Aunt Hepsa bar, she never smoked.

00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:29.620
 What's that?

00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:31.220
 Least way is not a pipe.

00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:33.620
 - Now look, Gus. - Although her mother...

00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:35.300
 ...great-and-jesible,

00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:36.900
 '96 she was,

00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:39.100
 she wouldn't be caught without a concord.

00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:40.860
 Now, wait a minute, Gus.

00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:42.860
 [music playing]

00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:55.700
 Well, Sam, there go the chairs.

00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:58.420
 Thank goodness I hope I've seen the last of them.

00:20:58.420 --> 00:20:59.700
 You look tired, dear.

00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:05.420
 Alice, do you realize I went through three generations of Gus's families to get that chair glued together?

00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:09.940
 Well, let's go in the living room and sit down and count by $65.

00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:11.380
 Your $65?

00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:15.300
 Naturally, dear, I'll give you the 25 I paid for the chairs in the first place.

00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:15.860
 Thank you.

00:21:15.860 --> 00:21:19.220
 And that leaves me a clear profit of $40.

00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:23.060
 And Sam, even you'll have to admit that's a very good business to you.

00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:25.940
 Exactly how do you figure you cleared $40?

00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:27.620
 That's simple arithmetic, dear.

00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:31.340
 Twenty-five from sixty-five is forty, isn't it?

00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:36.260
 Well, how about the ten dollars I paid will for the pipe rack?

00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:37.620
 Oh, that.

00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:41.100
 And the ten dollars I paid at the auction for the stool.

00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:44.140
 My goodness, you mean I owe you twenty dollars more?

00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:46.060
 Simple arithmetic, dear.

00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:47.900
 Very well, here you are.

00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:50.980
 That still leaves me a twenty dollar profit.

00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:54.980
 Did I mention it cost twelve dollars to have that six chair repaired?

00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:58.220
 $12. That leaves you eight.

00:21:58.220 --> 00:22:03.720
 Well, eight dollars profit is eight dollars profit.

00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:06.920
 I must get a cost to have the chairs carted up here to the house.

00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:11.620
 Well, not very much, just four dollars and forty cents.

00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:15.420
 You mean all I have left is three dollars and sixty cents?

00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:17.120
 I'm afraid so, Alice.

00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:19.920
 Perhaps after this you'll leave business to me.

00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:23.360
 Sam, I have a clear profit of three dollars and sixty cents,

00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:26.700
 and any business that doesn't operate in the red is a good business.

00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:29.360
 Henry, where have you been?

00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:31.000
 Henry, you're a little business, Steel.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:32.860
 You're in, boy. Did we clean now?

00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:33.740
 You too.

00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:35.700
 And Henry has something to say to you.

00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:37.040
 No, Mother.

00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:40.300
 Homer had something to say. It was his idea. Go ahead, you say.

00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:42.200
 Hey, you're a folks, Henry. You say?

00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:43.400
 No, you.

00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:44.040
 Well...

00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:46.340
 Go on, Homer. Don't be bashful.

00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:47.040
 Well...

00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:51.680
 You've always been pretty nice to me, Mrs. Aldrich.

00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:54.920
 Mr. Aldrich, you've been nice to me too.

00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:56.420
 At times.

00:22:56.420 --> 00:22:58.920
 And now that you've had some high luck

00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:01.160
 and we've had some good luck,

00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:03.760
 we'd like to give you half of what we've made.

00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:05.460
 Homer, what are you talking about?

00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:06.860
 Mother, I caught on.

00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:09.260
 You didn't think you could keep it from me, didn't you?

00:23:09.260 --> 00:23:10.500
 Keep what from you, Henry?

00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:12.500
 Mr. Aldrich, Henry and I are in kids.

00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:14.500
 We can read between the lines.

00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:16.600
 Didn't we just see a whole load of your furniture

00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:18.100
 being hauled away?

00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:20.040
 Yes, dear. We sold it to Mr. Smith.

00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:21.440
 That's what I mean.

00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:25.540
 Gee, if you need money that bad, here, take this.

00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:28.540
 Five dollars and twelve cents. Half of what we took him.

00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:30.540
 Homer, we won't do anything of the kind.

00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:32.540
 But, Father, that's the way Homer wants it.

00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:36.540
 That's why he sold a valuable stool right out of his bedroom.

00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:37.540
 What?

00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:38.540
 Sure.

00:23:38.540 --> 00:23:42.540
 Dear, that's very generous of you. Thank you very, very much.

00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:47.540
 You're welcome, Mrs. Orridge. And I hope you don't have to sell any more of your stuff.

00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:48.540
 Come on, Homer.

00:23:48.540 --> 00:23:51.300
 But if you do, will you let us handle the deal for you?

00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:54.240
 I think we could do a lot better than you could.

00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:55.840
 Sam.

00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:58.240
 And I thought I'd live to see everything.

00:23:58.240 --> 00:23:59.340
 Sam?

00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:01.340
 Oh, Alice, don't cry.

00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:04.840
 Dear, I never knew boys could be so wonderful.

00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:05.940
 Think of it.

00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:08.840
 Sharing what they made 50/50.

00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:09.940
 Yes.

00:24:09.940 --> 00:24:12.980
 Dear, under the circumstances, don't you

00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:15.440
 think we should do exactly as much for them?

00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:17.740
 You mean give them half of your profit?

00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:19.700
 Half of just 360?

00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:22.780
 Oh, no, Sam, half of all the money we got for the chairs.

00:24:22.780 --> 00:24:24.860
 What, Alice? What about our expenses?

00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:27.300
 Sam, did the boys did up their expenses?

00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:30.500
 Sometimes, dear, I think you don't know the first thing about business.

00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:52.500

 Listen again next week, same time, same station, for another sparkling half hour with your favorite youngster, his family and his pals.

00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:04.500
