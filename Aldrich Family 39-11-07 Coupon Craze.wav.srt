 They say the happiest year is a black with the teeth,

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 but I know one person who has his sons, Henry Always,

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 Henry has all the problems and growing pains that most boys

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 on our ice-cream days for Henry is that Ted McMillan are in the morning.

00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 To see an open from the Orbridge kitchen, the time is Saturday morning.

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,500
 What mother? Why won't you? Because we can't afford it in me.

11
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:16,500
 We can't afford just eight cents. I'm sorry, but that is the condition the family is in.

12
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,000
 We can't afford eight cents for what, mother?

13
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 Believe it or not, Mary, we can't afford just eight cents worth of breakfast food.

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,360
 You mean father's loss is lost, I think?

15
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,840
 Your father has not lost his law practice.

16
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,960
 That age this would be only the beginning.

17
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:30,960
 Of what?

18
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,840
 Well, busy and I are saving breakfast food to Ponsmary

19
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,000
 to get an off-board motor for a robo.

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,200
 And all I'm doing is asking mother to stock up.

21
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,120
 Yes, dear.

22
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:43,080
 And you might also explain that all you need is 12,000--

23
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,720
 But we don't, mother.

24
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,240
 We've already got quite a few.

25
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,960
 All we need now is 11,200 and 14.

26
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,960
 Well, we are not stocking up with any 11,214 packages, but...

27
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,960
 I'm not asking anything so ridiculous, Mother.

28
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,960
 At the most, I'm just asking you to buy 200 packages.

29
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,960
 Well, at one Henry?

30
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,960
 Sure, we can use that in a year, easy.

31
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,960
 Henry, I don't want to hear anything more about it.

32
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:08,960
 No, sorry.

33
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,960
 Has Mr. Sutherland called this morning?

34
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,960
 Not that I know, well, how could he be filling for me?

35
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,960
 Noting, Mother. Just something I asked him to call me about.

36
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,960
 If any of you have Sunday school teacher Henry?

37
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:24,200
 Yes, Mary. Mother, have you tried looking at it from this way?

38
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:29,360
 If I were asking you to buy chilling them or candy, it might be different, but breakfast

39
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,360
 food.

40
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,160
 Think of all the nourishment there'd be in 200 boxes.

41
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,640
 And where would we keep 200 boxes?

42
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,440
 I'd hear in the kitchen where they'd be handing.

43
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,000
 And where would I cook?

44
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,240
 All right. You'll cook here in the kitchen, and I'll give over my room for the breakfast

45
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,240
 food.

46
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,520
 And then you can send all your time up there eating it.

47
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,660
 All right, Mary.

48
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:49,080
 Ridicule me today.

49
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,360
 We'll wait until you look out on a late Sunday

50
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,200
 and see me in a rowboat with a two and a half horsepower

51
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,520
 outboard motor on it.

52
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,600
 Then maybe you won't think I'm so humorous.

53
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,360
 Won't I?

54
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,200
 I'll ask her to phone.

55
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,480
 Mother, as soon as Mary is through with that call,

56
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,240
 do you mind if I phone Father's office?

57
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,080
 I don't know, dear.

58
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,280
 Well, I want to remind him to get the folks of his office

59
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,280
 saving coupons.

60
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,040
 Ten minutes.

61
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,680
 I don't like to discourage every suggestion you make,

62
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,800
 but I have to know that your father is extremely busy

63
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,360
 preparing a case to be tried and put.

64
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,280
 But mother, this wouldn't take 10 seconds.

65
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,320
 And if I can get everyone at his office eating good breakfast,

66
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,000
 maybe his whole practice will pick up.

67
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,760
 You are not going to bother him there.

68
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,480
 And incidentally, your father does not

69
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:32,120
 want you to bother Judge Thompson's family anymore either.

70
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,760
 I haven't been bothering the termsons.

71
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,360
 You've been trying to get Mrs. Thompson to save coupons

72
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,200
 for you.

73
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,200
 Then your father finds it quite embarrassing

74
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,560
 when he has to try cases before Judge Thompson.

75
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,440
 But Judge Thompson ought to be grateful.

76
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,240
 In what way?

77
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,880
 I'm employing his son.

78
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,720
 - Have they given you?

79
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,040
 - Sure, didn't I tell you?

80
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,200
 Freddy works for me.

81
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,040
 - Doing pot.

82
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,200
 - Eating breakfast food?

83
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,120
 - I pay him.

84
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,360
 - And who pays for the breakfast food?

85
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,800
 - Judge Thompson.

86
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,000
 - But Freddy's thought he'd eat something, hasn't he?

87
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,320
 - And he might as well eat this

88
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,880
 and have a cow toward something.

89
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,680
 - Henry, Mr. Sutherland just phoned him.

90
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,000
 That's a message for you.

91
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,840
 - For me?

92
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,120
 - Yes, Henry.

93
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,720
 He said that he considered your proposition

94
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,840
 and he didn't think it would be ethical.

95
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,200
 - It wouldn't be ethical.

96
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,200
 It wouldn't be ethical.

97
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,200
 Can you imagine that?

98
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,200
 What did you ask him to do?

99
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,200
 If that isn't the most absurd thing I ever heard of.

100
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,200
 What did you ask him to do?

101
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,200
 The most simple thing in the world.

102
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:32,200
 What I asked him to do was to suggest a Sunday school that the class led me again and eat my kind of breakfast food.

103
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,200
 Henry Oldridge!

104
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,200
 I don't blame it for feeling that way, Mother.

105
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,200
 It wouldn't have hurt him to ask him.

106
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,200
 And I would have been perfectly willing to give him a commission.

107
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,200
 I will leave this.

108
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,200
 Well, you know what I'm going to do?

109
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,520
 I'm going to change my church.

110
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,160
 Oh, no, you're not Henry.

111
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,080
 Oh, yes, I am.

112
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:51,560
 Oh, if you ask me, I don't think Mr. Sutherland has a Christian like attitude.

113
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,640
 Will one of you see him?

114
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,040
 Is it the front door, please?

115
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,720
 I'll go, Mary.

122
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,560
 Why not?

123
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,640
 My father wants to buy a car.

124
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,300
 Once I got to go, whether he needs the money.

125
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:19,560
 A campaign to good money, but look at what you're paying.

126
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,640
 50 cents for every 500 coupons.

127
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,120
 All right, if you keep on saving,

128
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,320
 I'll give you an interest in the motorboat too.

129
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,680
 You still don't think my folks can afford it.

130
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,320
 Why don't you ask them which they'd rather have a car

131
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,960
 or a motorboat, but my father can't go to the courthouse

132
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,600
 in a motorboat, can he?

00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,120
 Freddie, I'm not sure, but I think I just had an idea.

134
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,120
 Yeah, what else have I got to eat?

135
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:42,620
 No.

 Where's your father buying the car?

138
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:50,760
 I heard him mention Johnson's automobile agency.

 Oh, if Johnson wants your father's business,

142
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:59,300
 they ought to be willing to cooperate a little, shouldn't they?

 Come on, Freddy.

 Okay, Mr. Johnson.

151
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,300
 Hi.

152
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,300
 What can I do for you?

153
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,300
 How do you do?

154
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,300
 We're just looking.

155
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:28,300
 It has some very nice cars here.

156
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:30,300
 Are you buying a car?

157
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:33,300
 Well, we are in exactly, but a friend of ours is?

158
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,300
 He is.

159
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:41,340
 Yeah, and he asked us to sort of look around for him. What's his name? Well, I'm not sure

160
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:47,180
 he'd want his name mentioned just now. He just wants your fight. Yes, sir. How much is that car?

161
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:52,640
 795. That's a kind of considered. How much is that sedan over there?

162
00:06:52,640 --> 00:07:00,460
 2840. 2840? Yes, sir. Is that FOV or delivered? FOV.

163
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:03,460
 How many spare tires does that include?

164
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:04,460
 Two.

165
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:05,460
 Only two.

 Well, we would like to see what it's like.

 You sit in the back, Jimmy.

171
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:16,460

178
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:29,460
 It shows every button you've bought.

179
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:32,460
 Oh, geez. I must have hit it.

180
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,460
 Don't touch anything in there.

181
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:36,460
 No, sir. Not a bad dish, Freddie.

182
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:38,460
 I don't like it as well as last year's Henry.

183
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,460
 Yeah, well, is that the speedometer?

184
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,460
 That's the clock. That isn't the right time, though.

185
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:45,460
 It isn't even running.

186
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:48,460
 What's this here? That's an ash receptacle.

187
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:50,460
 Would your mind putting it back, please?

188
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:53,460
 Gee. You broke right off.

189
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:55,460
 I guess you're not the puppet.

190
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:58,460
 I know, but it shouldn't break like that.

191
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:01,460
 Well, what do you know about that human?

192
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:03,460
 I understand that either of your hair.

193
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,460
 $2,800 in your pocket?

194
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,460
 I have.

195
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:08,460
 You have it between you?

196
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:09,460
 No, sir.

197
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:13,460
 Well, were you step real carefully like out of the car?

198
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:16,460
 Oh, wouldn't you be interested in our making an offer?

199
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:17,460
 Well, this job?

200
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,460
 Well, it's a proposition for any car.

201
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:20,460
 No.

202
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:22,460
 Well, you know somebody that's fine.

203
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,460
 Oh, but you're all...

204
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:27,460
 Well, do you mind if I ask what you eat for breakfast?

205
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:34,660
 What's that got to do with it wouldn't hurt to tell us with it with his mind getting out of this and out of his showroom?

206
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:42,000
 Sure, I will get out gladly. I guess he doesn't know who your father is Freddy. How do I care?

207
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:49,460
 Oh, he is what is it told just a couple of wanderers? I guess I guess you don't want his father to buy his car here, huh?

208
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:56,660
 Who is this hot judge Thompson? Your judge Thompson's boy? I sure am. Well, it'll certainly glass a no idea, man

209
00:08:56,660 --> 00:09:03,660
 Thank you. How do you do? I'm the son of Sam Alders. Sam Alders, well you look just like him.

210
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:08,660
 Yes, sir. What everybody says is make yourselves a home. Yes, sir.

211
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:11,660
 Do you want to see a friend's room? I'll let you teeny scratch.

212
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:15,660
 Oh, if there are any questions you'd like to ask boys, just begin to show.

213
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:19,660
 Yeah? What kind of breakfast food do you eat? What's that? You made them.

214
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:23,660
 Yeah, you see, we're saving coupons and we thought maybe it's a time they're a coupon.

215
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:26,660
 I've got one right here in my pocket.

216
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:27,660
 Here it is.

217
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:33,660
 We don't eat that bag right now, but I'll certainly speak to my wife about it, you will.

218
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,660
 How did you try it someday?

219
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:38,660
 You couldn't get her to start tomorrow morning, could you?

220
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:42,660
 Well, Joe, see this coupon?

221
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:45,660
 Getting tomorrow morning, you get your wife to save these.

222
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:48,660
 You mean I gotta give up cinnamon guns?

223
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,660
 Yeah, we're going to help these boys out.

224
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:53,660
 Tell the public how to shop there to eat this too.

225
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:56,660
 Oh gee, that's pretty nice of you.

226
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:58,660
 Here's what you could do for me.

227
00:09:58,660 --> 00:09:59,660
 It's judged, believe it or not,

228
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:02,660
 just thinking of buying one from the yellow arrow people.

229
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:05,660
 It's a good car, if you don't want to drive a train car.

230
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:09,660
 The yellow arrow and your teller about art on it.

231
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,660
 Oh sure.

232
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:14,660
 Which model here do you think your dad would like pretty?

233
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:16,660
 I like that $2800 job.

234
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:19,660
 Yeah, here that job, the boys have paid.

235
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:24,020
 So now then, when would you like to have a Senate demonstration car over for you?

236
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:24,860
 To ride in?

237
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:25,860
 Sure!

238
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:28,740
 Gee, are you doing anything next week Henry?

239
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:31,500
 Not that I planned next week again.

240
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:36,740
 Now here boys, before you go I've got something for you.

241
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:39,500
 Right here, and this table is two brothers for you.

242
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,180
 Young men and two brothers for you.

243
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:44,540
 Well Gee, where's Waller being next?

244
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:46,180
 You'll find this new creature right.

245
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:47,180
 Mr. Johnson.

246
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,180
 What?

247
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,180
 Judge Thompson, of course, the street.

248
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,180
 Judge Thompson?

249
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,180
 So it is.

250
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:53,180
 You like to have me call him?

251
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:55,180
 I don't think y'all are bothering right now.

252
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:57,180
 He's probably in a rush someplace.

253
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:59,180
 And let's call him Eddie out.

254
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:02,180
 Well, he may not like to be pushed into a sale.

255
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:03,180
 Well, tell him--

256
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,180
 Hey, Judge.

257
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:06,180
 I'd tell you to come back here for a show in a minute.

258
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:08,180
 I would probably talk right now.

259
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:10,180
 Acting with everybody.

260
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:12,180
 And he wanted me to look at something.

261
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:14,180
 Oh, Billie, come on.

262
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:17,180
 It's too bad he isn't going to come in.

263
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:19,180
 Yeah, it is.

264
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:23,180
 Well, I guess we better be dying ourselves.

265
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,180
 Goodbye.

266
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:25,180
 Goodbye.

267
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:26,180
 Goodbye.

268
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,180
 What do you know about it?

269
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:28,180
 Come on, Freddie.

270
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,180
 We've got to hurry.

271
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,180
 Where are we going now?

272
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,180
 Where do you think?

273
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:33,180
 Why just stop at Mr. Johnson's?

274
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:36,180
 Let's get the yellow arrow company eating for us too.

275
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:37,180
 Come on.

276
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:46,180
 [music]

277
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:48,180
 Well, Henry doesn't miss a trick, does he?

278
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:52,180
 And while he's trying to persuade the yellow arrow company to do a little eating for him,

279
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:54,180
 I'd like to mention something about eating myself.

280
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:57,180
 Something I've had all of you ladies will agree with.

281
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:59,180
 It's simply this.

282
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:03,180
 The real spice and charm the family suffers is in variety.

283
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,180
 Something new and different all the time.

284
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:07,180
 Lots of good desserts at your fingertips.

285
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:08,180
 There's the trick.

286
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:12,180
 And jello puddings are one mighty swell answer.

287
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:15,180
 Or you can have in from the variety easily and inexpensively.

288
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:20,900
 For instance, serve jello vanilla pudding, the juicy raisins added, or a covering of lovely

289
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:24,100
 coconut or fold in some tempting top dates.

290
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:29,140
 Jello vanilla pudding has a metal bland flavor that combines perfectly with fruits or coconut

291
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:31,980
 and gives you a new treat every time.

292
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:37,140
 Then dry jello chocolate pudding, rich and dark and luscious, and the jello butter starts

293
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:43,300
 pudding as mouth watering as golden taffy candy with a wonderful smooth richness.

294
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:46,100
 All three jello puddings are quicker to flash to make.

295
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,300
 Simple directions aren't every package.

296
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:51,820
 And when you pride these three brand new desserts,

297
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:54,420
 you know why every day more and more people

298
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:57,620
 are saying to their grocers, give me jello puddings

299
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:00,220
 in all three luscious flavors.

300
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:02,800
 (lively music)

301
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:09,300
 From Henry Elders' activity over the day,

302
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:13,100
 last few days, his coupons should be arriving in truckloads.

303
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:18,100
 You're thinking of now as he is counting with Freddie in Judge Thompson's home.

304
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:26,100
 Two thousand four hundred and sixty-five, two thousand four hundred and sixty-six.

305
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:34,100
 I'm getting tired, Freddie. Don't tell me you want to stop. Maybe, maybe it's because I don't like to do anything that's wrong.

306
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:36,100
 Go on and Kenney.

307
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,100
 Okay.

308
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:41,100
 Two thousand four hundred and sixty seven

309
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,100
 to listen to Eddie.

310
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,100
 Do you think that what we've been doing

311
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,100
 resembles bribery?

312
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,100
 Bribery.

313
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,100
 My father thinks it does.

314
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,100
 How does he even know about it?

315
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:53,100
 In an unguarded moment I told him.

316
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,100
 Everything or just one or two of the

317
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,100
 highest plus.

318
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,100
 And he says we ought to go to your

319
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,100
 father and confess or get it.

320
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:02,100
 All we've done is ask somebody to save

321
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:06,860
 to save a few breakfast food to find. Sure. That's the way I think I'll look at it.

322
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:12,300
 And besides Mr. Johnson hasn't even given all of us yet. That's what I say.

323
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:21,700
 Well, 2,468, 2,000. No matter what you say, Freddie, I'm going to tell your father.

324
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:25,580
 And me, you'll want to make the mistake of your life, but it was the last Saturday that

325
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:31,420
 we did it. I haven't slept since. Well, don't move down to the courthouse, you can confess

326
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:33,820
 You mean it would make it legal if I did it down there?

327
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,320
 He doesn't like to be bothered.

328
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,420
 He's very straight about saying like that.

329
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:38,920
 Hello, Fred.

330
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:39,920
 Hey.

331
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,420
 Where do you come from?

332
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:43,420
 How old is that of the afternoon at home?

333
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:44,420
 What the hell?

334
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:45,420
 She's out someplace.

335
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:46,420
 You sat in there with me.

336
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:47,420
 Just Henry.

337
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:47,920
 Where?

338
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,420
 At Judge Thompson, can I speak to you with you a minute?

339
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:52,420
 Henry, you're only going to have sayings.

340
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:55,420
 That's as if I take my boat off and put these factors on.

341
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:59,420
 If they're telling me, he's going to look at it from a purely technical point of view.

342
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:02,660
 You know, my father's trying to case in front of him.

343
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,660
 He says, "I've got to get things straightened out

344
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:06,920
 "but you don't know what you're walking into.

345
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:09,000
 "Father can't stand crying.

346
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,060
 "Crying.

347
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:11,900
 "Here, help me take these coupons out."

348
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,660
 - Superins are your shirt.

349
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,760
 I'll put some in mind what we ought to have

350
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,000
 to vacuum clean.

351
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,400
 - Well, Henry, okay.

352
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,200
 What is it, the thought nearby?

353
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,240
 - Judge Thompson.

354
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,840
 My father asked me to tell you something.

355
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,080
 - All right, Henry.

356
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:28,920
 What was he?

357
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:34,760
 Well, I just wanted to say, is it true you're buying in the automobile?

358
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,560
 I have been thinking of it.

359
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,860
 Oh, right.

360
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:39,840
 I think that's a very good idea.

361
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:45,160
 That reminds me, there are several packages here that are left in my name at the courthouse.

362
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:48,200
 I wonder whether you boys would know anything about them.

363
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,080
 Packages, Dutch Thompson's own right.

364
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:53,200
 Father, that's the curious part of it.

365
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:57,920
 This first package was left by some representative from the Johnson automobile agency.

366
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,800
 It contains several breakfast foods to find.

367
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,960
 Isn't that strange?

368
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,360
 It certainly is.

369
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,040
 Another package is from the Yellow Arrow Agency.

370
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,720
 And here is one from the center field.

371
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,040
 You will try and bought it.

372
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,320
 All containing coupons, Father.

373
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,320
 All containing coupons.

374
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,880
 Do you suppose they're giving breakfast food to Pons

375
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,480
 with cars this year?

376
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:20,320
 You boys aren't by any chance saving breakfast

377
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,840
 food to Pons, are you?

378
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,960
 Saving them?

379
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:23,960
 I hope they know what it is.

380
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,520
 Now things that I have reached the age were high savings.

381
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,780
 I should think that.

382
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:29,480
 At first I was afraid you'd go,

383
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,220
 you might be taking advantage of the fact

384
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:33,120
 I was considering a car.

385
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,020
 But knowing you as I do,

386
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:37,620
 I am sure that bribery was either the last thing

387
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:39,420
 either of you would stupid.

388
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:40,520
 Yes, sir.

389
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,520
 If there's one thing that's terrible,

390
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,320
 it's bribery.

391
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,920
 It certainly is.

392
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,320
 And it's one thing I never told her it.

393
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,520
 Yes, sir.

394
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,920
 I'll tie these up again.

395
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,820
 You mean they're going to return them?

396
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:54,520
 I certainly don't know why I should keep them.

397
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:57,520
 But let's get back to what you were going to tell me.

398
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,920
 Why, uh...

399
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,120
 Freddie, do you remember what it was?

400
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,020
 It certainly skipped my memory.

401
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:06,620
 I had it right on the tip of my tongue, Judge, doesn't it?

402
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:08,720
 I couldn't tell you now if I had to.

403
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,320
 Freddie, what in the world do you have wanted up inside this shirt?

404
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:15,520
 Oh, that might be my underwear.

405
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,120
 What do you do? Just tell me it then?

406
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,320
 I see Henry's does the same thing.

407
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,120
 He here.

408
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,720
 Mine keeps slipping down.

409
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,060
 I'll answer the phone call.

410
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:26,840
 I'll answer thank you.

411
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,960
 And take it upstairs to maybe the call.

412
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,960
 I'm sorry.

413
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,520
 Freddie, Freddie, take a look out the window.

414
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,020
 Her foot.

415
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:33,080
 Coming up the wall.

416
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,080
 It's Mr. Johnson.

417
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:34,640
 That's fine.

418
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,880
 Time for him to come.

419
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,720
 I'm going to tell you I should have confessed.

420
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,880
 I certainly didn't stop you.

421
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,120
 You go to the door, Henry.

422
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,000
 You go yourself.

423
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,240
 This is your house.

424
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,240
 Hey, hey.

425
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:44,800
 You too.

426
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,080
 It isn't the car, please.

427
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:46,840
 Oh.

428
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:50,040
 Is somebody there?

429
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,120
 Here I am, boys.

430
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,240
 As good as my word.

431
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,120
 Yes, sir.

432
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,920
 Mr. Johnson, we don't feel we should be of any more trouble to you.

433
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,320
 How old you worry about that?

434
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,040
 The car is right out in front.

435
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,040
 Either way, here are some old bladders for you.

436
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,960
 - Ready? - Yes, Father.

437
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:07,560
 - Who was that to throw up? - A man with um, bladders.

438
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,680
 Wasn't that your dad with cold?

439
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,640
 - Yes, sir. - Ask him to come along with us.

440
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,840
 - I don't think he'd have time, Mr. Johnson.

441
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:17,640
 - I'm so good to get out for a ride. - I don't think we'd better even bother him.

442
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,040
 Let me step into next to you.

443
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:19,840
 - Ready?

444
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,400
 - Am I going to my door?

445
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,560
 I'll be the crowd up here.

446
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:26,560
 See how nervous he is and if we light the car, that's all it counts with him.

447
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:31,560
 Well, okay. You wait in the car and we'll be with you just as soon as we get everything you're summer.

448
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,560
 Okay. Pre-yup, and you get your coat. You gotta get out of here.

449
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,560
 Right. You take a look out the window. Why?

450
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:39,560
 There are two women coming up with walk, and they both got cars out by the curb.

451
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:44,560
 They're crazy. There are four cars out there, and two station laggons are just throwing out.

452
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:47,560
 Let's go out the back door and leave him there with my father.

453
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,560
 Well, I don't want them.

454
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:54,360
 You suppose we can get a Mr. Johnson's car until all the rest of the follow and what?

455
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,360
 And give them each a try along the way.

456
00:18:56,360 --> 00:19:00,560
 Sure, have a demonstration of nine cars all at once, I suppose.

457
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:04,560
 How do you do?

458
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,560
 I was sent up here from the Marvel car.

459
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,560
 Can I agency?

460
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,560
 I'm from the Honors Building Company.

461
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:12,560
 Yes, sir. We'll be right out as soon as we get a coat.

462
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:15,560
 And could you please tell the others to wait in their cars?

463
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:22,200
 And that would you mind by asking about how many cars your father is buying just one and just one?

464
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:26,720
 Yeah, but he's going to be very open-minded about it sure. I can see that

465
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,680
 I'll say come on

466
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:34,500
 Oh, yes, sir. I was in table about the window out the back window

467
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:37,860
 Those are about there

468
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:42,720
 Brain so and maybe it's a traffic cam. I

469
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,680
 I wonder who that could be.

470
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,480
 I didn't see anyone come up the walk.

471
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,960
 - As opposed to that need over the door.

472
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,480
 - Oh, I just assumed answer attached, Thompson.

473
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,480
 - No.

474
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,720
 - Hey, where you bump into a chair?

475
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,560
 - I'll pick it up.

476
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,640
 - And I will go to the door.

477
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,320
 - Well, Freddy, here's where everything's box open.

478
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,440
 - And all because of an idea you had.

479
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,080
 - I didn't think of all of it.

480
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,840
 We didn't think of this part.

481
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,160
 - Well, how cool.

482
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,000
 - How you doing, darling?

483
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:08,840
 - Hand me.

484
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,000
 - Is Mrs. Thompson here?

485
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:10,840
 - It's your mother.

486
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,000
 - I'm just passing by.

487
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,640
 I wonder if she might be here.

488
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,680
 Would you like to have me go home with the mother?

489
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,880
 Wait a minute.

490
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,240
 You're not going to leave me with all the Jane out there.

491
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,080
 But my mother may want some help.

492
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:21,580
 He may.

493
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:22,680
 I don't need any help.

494
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,240
 I am sorry.

495
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:23,880
 Is it Thompson?

496
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:24,560
 Is it Oh?

497
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,640
 Perfectly all right, Judge Thompson.

498
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,640
 My goodness, Henry, let me fix your shoes.

499
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,440
 I can fix your--

500
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,480
 All right, thank you.

501
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,360
 What did they do there?

502
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,000
 Shrink?

503
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,360
 That's the way they wear them this year.

504
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,480
 By the way, Henry, this isn't fire drop in.

505
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,800
 But have you seen your father's humidor around the house

506
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,920
 any place?

507
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,360
 Is humidor?

508
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,680
 You mean that big sort of a mahogany block?

509
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,680
 Yes.

510
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:48,000
 I wonder whether that's the same one that's up under my bed.

511
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 I hope, Henry, you're ever taken through, smoking your father's cigar?

512
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 Oh, no, Judge Thompson.

513
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,400
 I've just been using it to keep my coupons in.

514
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,400
 Your coupons?

515
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,400
 Did I say coupons?

516
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,400
 Yes, Henry.

517
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,400
 You said coupons.

518
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,400
 Well, that's why I mean coupons.

519
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,400
 So coupons, Henry.

520
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,400
 Yeah, so coupons.

521
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,400
 That's so cute.

522
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,400
 Why, uh...

523
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,400
 I'm wondering if I could be.

524
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,400
 Could I answer that door please?

525
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,400
 There I am, where you are son?

526
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:19,400
 Yes dear. Never open a door that belongs to somebody else.

527
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,400
 How do you do that?

528
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:25,400
 Judge Thompson, about how much longer is it going to be?

529
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,400
 For what? Right, for the demonstration.

530
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,400
 You're planning a demonstration? A political demonstration?

531
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,400
 How a demonstration? What the car can do?

532
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:46,400
 No, no, no, no, no. Of course, maybe there's a mistake someplace that you don't have two boys here, do you? Two boys. Yeah. I'll tell me I've been eating breakfast food three times a day just for nothing.

533
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:55,400
 Boy, you want us, Father? Oh, there you are. Pretty good. There's a man here to give us a demonstration, I guess.

534
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,400
 Hello there.

535
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,400
 You boys are buying a car?

536
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,400
 Well, not for ourselves.

537
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,400
 We're just looking into it for somebody.

538
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,400
 You're so mean, yeah.

539
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,400
 For my Sunday school teacher, Mr. Sutherland.

540
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,400
 Are you coming?

541
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,400
 Goodbye, Father.

542
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,400
 Goodbye.

543
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,400
 Oh, goodbye, Mother.

544
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,400
 Goodbye.

545
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,400
 Isn't it funny?

546
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,400
 Your father didn't say more.

547
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:21,400
 Now, listen, is your dad buying a car or isn't he?

548
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,400
 Just what I was going to ask, sure.

549
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,400
 He's going to buy a car.

550
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:29,200
 car. I assure, because my family's eaten enough breakfast food in the last week to

551
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:33,400
 use up the commission on free cars. There's trouble is, my father's sending all the

552
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:38,400
 coupons back to you. Good, that's just fine. And until he buys a car, we kick them.

553
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,400
 [Singing]

554
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:45,400
 And you can thank yourselves for that noise. Don't you think we better chill off?

555
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:49,400
 You want me to go home and we'd know, Freddy, I've got a swell idea. Another one.

556
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:53,120
 Let's get Mr. Johnson's car until the rest of follow them.

557
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,120
 Where it's out to the edge of town, all of them.

558
00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:02,560
 Sure. And on the way, Mr. Johnson, would you mind driving me by my girl's house over on Walnut Street?

 [MUSIC]

560
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:20,040
 Now listen boys, you've timed all nine of us in first gear.

561
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,760
 You've timed all nine of us in second gear.

562
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:25,800
 You've even timed all nine of us in reverse.

563
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,800
 There isn't anything more that I can do.

564
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,720
 There's just one thing more Mr. Johnson.

565
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,200
 There is, sure.

566
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,840
 This is a peach of a road, and there's hardly any traffic on it.

567
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:39,200
 How about an old line of you line up and we'll have a race?

568
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,160
 A race?

569
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:43,520
 Nine cars have a race and a public highway?

570
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,400
 Or a not?

571
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,520
 Are you crazy?

572
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,820
 And any other odd nine of us anymore.

573
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:49,060
 - A property came of the rest.

574
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:50,540
 They'd given up breakfast food

575
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:52,700
 and have gone back to their normal life.

576
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,780
 You leave the sailors between us too?

577
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:56,100
 - It is.

578
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:59,380
 Well, why can't we see you two, Rakes?

579
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:00,220
 - Oh no.

580
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:01,060
 - You're afraid to.

581
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:02,380
 - What do you mean I'm afraid to?

582
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:03,660
 - Certainly looks it.

583
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:06,020
 - I wouldn't be a race, I believe in so far behind.

584
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:07,300
 - That's who I do.

585
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,420
 - Well, nine of them.

586
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:09,420
 - You will race?

587
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:11,820
 - If it's speed you want, we'll give it here.

588
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:13,180
 - How fast is Judge Thompson?

589
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:14,020
 You'll drive a car.

590
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:16,260
 Oh, quite fast as the rule.

591
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:19,020
 He does? Well, then, this is the car for him.

592
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:21,380
 Oh, here he is.

593
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:22,380
 All set?

594
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:24,500
 He's already him, we.

595
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,500
 All start him.

596
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,300
 Oh, no, no, no, like me, Starcon.

597
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,860
 It was my idea, Freddy.

598
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:29,860
 Okay.

599
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:31,860
 Get on your mark.

600
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:33,700
 Get set, caught on Mr. Johnson.

601
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,700
 I ain't got her. Go!

 Ain't quite a girl.

 Hand you, hand you, hand just wanna open your mouth, Mr. Johnson.

605
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:46,020
 - It's open.

606
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:47,660
 - Yeah, but he's way ahead.

607
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:50,100
 We have been around two to the corner.

608
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,660
 - Look at her, heck up.

609
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:53,100
 - Where's the happening?

610
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,020
 - Where's that?

611
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:56,140
 - Keep her open, keep her open, Mr. Johnson.

612
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:57,300
 - He's just ahead.

613
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:59,140
 - I haven't even started to go.

614
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:03,900
 - What could that be?

615
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:06,060
 - Maybe there's a fire someplace.

616
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:07,460
 - It's a policeman.

617
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:09,260
 - Yeah, he's right here, too.

618
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:11,260
 - I'm in the hole, baby.

619

 (cheering)

620
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:18,000
 - You mean, we can't finish the race?

621
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,360
 - I'll race, they're every, what is this, anyhow?

00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,360
 - Oh, we were just racing officer.

623
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,240
 That's going to be a big help.

624
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,840
 - You know what the law permits?

625
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,080
 - Yes, sir.

626
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,840
 - All right, I'll be back to town.

627
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,240
 - We're gonna have an escort.

 Well, over to one side, let this college come and go by.

 Oh, it's my father.

 You got your new card, Dad.

635
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:54,680
 I bought it, but, eh, it was delivered just after you left.

636
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,680
 It was?

637
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,680
 The typewriter.

00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,680

00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,680
 You all should take $10 from both of these men.

 We don't like to think, ladies and gentlemen,

654
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,320
 the general police could ever create what

655
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:46,200
 might be termed a domestic situation.

656
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:49,520
 But just listen to our latest letter of the week.

657
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,680
 The author, Mr. Rodman Paul of San Francisco,

658
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,920
 is here in our Hollywood studio right now

659
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:56,000
 in drawing a visit to the city of stars

660
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,360
 as a guest of those star desserts, general police.

661
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,800
 And I'm going to ask him if he'll just read as well he won't.

662
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,200
 Mr. Paul.

663
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,440
 My favorite general putting is chocolate.

664
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:10,440
 and used to be that when my wife served it, she always made my days a bit harder than the rest.

665
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:17,440
 Well, I started trouble right away. First, my daughter gave me a big hug and kiss, and wanted to trade dishes with me.

666
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:22,440
 Next week, my son offered me a free copy of the magazine he sells if I had trade with him.

667
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:27,440
 So now we always make up two packages for each meal instead of warm.

668
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:34,440
 And we all have extra big dishes. My wife doesn't mind because it's as easy to prepare two boxes as one.

669
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:37,440
 in this way everybody's happy.

670
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,440
 So everything's all right, my own is fine.

671
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,440
 Tell her to say, "I don't know where it is or not."

672
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,440
 There's some talk about three pages for each meal,

673
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:47,440
 and we may end up with four, one for each of us.

674
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,440
 It has when it comes to yellow footage

675
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:53,440
 about the only word my family seems to know is "more."

676
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,440
 Well, that just proves that you folks know a good thing

677
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,440
 when you taste it, and speaking of more,

678
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,440
 more and more families every day are discovering

679
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:02,440
 the smooth, mellow delight of yellow chocolate pudding,

680
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:06,440
 They're explaining over its rich old-fashioned chocolatey flavors.

681
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:09,440
 They like Joe Bonilla, one of the first guys putting too.

682
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,440
 And they're drawing them off because they're easy and economical to serve.

683
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:16,440
 So try these three delicious new gel-footings yourself, ladies and gentlemen.
