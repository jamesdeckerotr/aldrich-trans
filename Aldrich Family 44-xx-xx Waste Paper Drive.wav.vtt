 A teenage boy has his own way of looking at the world.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 To Henry Aldrich, things always look rosy, and then suddenly, spots begin to appear before his eyes.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.400
 trouble spots. The scene opens at a neighbor's front door.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:00.060
 Can we want you to please listen to me? Don't you realize if we stopped here we

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.840
 Of course. Only my husband forgot all about it.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:20.640
 He did.

 Oh clothes?

 Homer, what would you think?

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.560
 Well, would you think old clothes would come

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.600
 under the jurisdiction of waste paper?

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.440
 I have but if you could use them.

 Oh, well look.

 Have your husband put those sort of to one side.

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.380
 Oh, the government doesn't pay for use of it.

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:51.080
 Right.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.580
 The government will get them all right.

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.480
 I just want to sort them out first.

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.080

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.980
 Algebra.

 Well, Gee, I don't mind being a couple of minutes late to that.

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:04.880
 Hey, Homer, wait!

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:05.880
 What's the matter?

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.380
 Can't you see what's happened to me?

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.180
 The couple of my trousers caught my wheels' pocket.

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.980
 She was, Henry.

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:12.680
 How did you do that?

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.580
 Push your right leg around real slow, Henry, and then reverse.

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.180
 You want me to break my leg?

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.780
 I've got you, Henry. I've got you.

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.180
 Now, get off very slow.

 Well, wait.

 Which side do you think I ought to try?

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:24.580
 You can only swing one leg.

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:25.580
 Henry, use your head.

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:26.580
 Easy, Homer.

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.580
 Do you want me to try these good trousers?

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.580

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.580
 Okay. Easy now.

 Hurry up and turn it.

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.080
 I can. I can't. The darn thing is stuck.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.580
 Well, turn it backwards.

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.080
 Look, Henry, let's be sensible.

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.740
 Let's just lay the bicycle down on its side, and you sort of lie down on top of it.

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.200
 Right in the middle of the street?

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.860
 Well, alright.

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.120
 But easy, Homer, easy.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.260
 I'm laying it down easy.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.160
 I can't.

 Let go of my necktie.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.100

 I wonder what became of Henry's good trousers.

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:28.020
 He asked me before breakfast to mend a small hole in them,

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:30.180
 and I told him I wouldn't, and I forgot all about it.

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.260
 Well, it certainly is naving to worry about, mother.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.180
 I know, dear, but I did promise Henry.

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:35.860
 I'd fixed it before he left the school,

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:37.740

 I think we should all learn to talk on our feet.

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:46.820
 Will you please stand?

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:48.820
 Yes, ma'am.

00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:52.820
 Well, the government makes shelf containers out of paper,

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:55.820
 and they make food containers, and stuff for other things,

00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:59.080
 And they also when they do have to lean against your desk like that

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:03.100
 Wow, you haven't anything to be ashamed of just stand right up

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:06.720
 Take your hands behind your back. Yes, ma'am

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:11.580
 In fact, why don't you come down here in front of the class where we can all sue you and explain matters now?

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:14.920
 Remember you have a very important message

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:20.460
 Just off a paper clip

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:21.300
 - He is.

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:22.620
 (audience laughs)

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:23.460
 - Did I just pick it up?

00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:24.980
 - Oh well, I'll tell you.

00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:25.900
 - No.

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:28.300
 Why should I put another just to pick up a paper clip?

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:30.060
 - I'll get it for him, Ms. Sutherland.

00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:32.260
 - Henry, may I ask why you're sitting down again?

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:33.140
 - For me?

00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:34.900
 - Oh, I thought I'd explain everything.

00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:36.100
 - But you haven't said anything.

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:36.940
 - Oh, well.

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:40.820
 - Crap, could you let me say something to you alone?

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:43.980
 Henry, there's no excuse for any such display of shine.

00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:45.820
 - But I want to whisper something in your ear.

00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:46.820
 (audience laughs)

00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:49.780
 - It's serious, Ms. Sutherland, you better go to one.

00:08:49.780 --> 00:09:00.580
 [Music]

00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:03.780
 Mother! Yes Mary? Mother! All the brownies are in the song!

00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:06.080
 And what's the next something? What does he want here?

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:08.980
 Well first I thought it was that mysterious voice again but it wasn't.

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:11.780
 He says he's fighting from the high school. Well the year what does he want?

00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:16.780
 He sounds awfully excited and the only thing I can make out is that they're having some kind of drive or something

00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:19.080
 They want to know whether we'd like to bring some clothes over.

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:20.580
 - Clothes? - Yes, Mother.

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:21.980
 It has nothing to do with Henry.

00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:23.280
 I guess he's helping him in the drive.

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:24.480
 And it's very urgent.

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:26.180
 We'll be a go back to the phone and tell Home,

00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:27.280
 but we're very much interested,

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:29.280
 but neither one of us can take anything over today.

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:31.580
 - Yes, Mother. - Later in the week, perhaps we can get a bundle over.

00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:34.480
 All right. And time to tell Henry not to be so impatient.

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:36.380
 He knows very well how busy I am.

00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:38.380
 - Yes, Mother. - Hello.

00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:40.980
 - Well, you too, tell Homey we'd be very glad to cooperate,

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:42.780
 but we're too busy to do anything today.

00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:44.480
 - What's that? - Goodbye. It's up to go.

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:45.880
 - What way? What age?

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:47.880
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:59.800
 Homer, won't you please come along the corridor with me

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:01.080
 and just walk behind me.

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:02.720
 Henry, I have to go to chemistry.

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:04.920
 And she listed my phone in the house for you.

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:05.420
 Sure.

00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:06.960
 And what good did it do?

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:08.880
 You didn't mention the fact that this was my best suit.

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:09.680
 I'd go and did jump.

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:11.280
 Henry, when I got two, your sister

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:13.480
 didn't even know what I'd been talking about.

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:14.720
 And listen, I'm kind of girl.

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:17.320
 But can't you just call me until I get down to the faculty room?

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:18.720
 What are you going down there for?

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:20.120
 Miss Sutherland told me to.

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:22.620
 She's gone to the girl's sewing room to get a needle and thread,

00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:24.220
 and I'm the wait in the faculty room.

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:25.720
 Now come on, get behind me.

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:26.720
 Nobody's gonna see you.

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:28.720
 Hand me to there's anybody in the corridor.

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:31.020
 And I'm gonna be the longest to do so, Mr. Nell.

00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:32.220
 But she wins!

00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:32.720
 Come on, man.

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:33.720
 Oh, what's up?

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:35.120
 Oh, come on, Miss Shea.

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:38.720
 May I ask why you find it necessary to walk down this whole sideways

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:40.220
 with your back against the wall?

00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:41.720
 Oh, I tell ya.

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:44.620
 I was just looking at those paintings on the other wall over there.

00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:45.620
 I wanted it.

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:46.620
 Very nice.

00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:48.620
 Don't you have a class this period?

00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:49.620
 Yes.

00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:54.620
 But Mr. Sutterland didn't think I would go to it in my present condition.

00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:55.620
 You have a headache?

00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:56.620
 Well, no.

00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:58.620
 No, it's not exactly up there.

00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:11.620
 Hello, Samuel always speaking.

00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:12.620
 Sam, this is Harriet again.

00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:13.620
 Yes, Harriet?

00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:17.620
 Sam, I don't want a man to think that it's my business, but did you see this morning's paper?

00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:19.320
 Yes? What is it? Something about me?

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:21.120
 No, it's an ad for boy and suits.

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:23.620
 Now Harriet, I am not buying Henry in his suit.

00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:27.220
 If you're going to brood about that, I'm sorry, but the one he has is quite good enough.

00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:29.020
 Sam, that's all, Sam. Good night.

00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:31.020
 But Harriet, why take it that way?

00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:32.520
 Hello?

00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:34.520
 That's a fine thing.

00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:36.320
 Hello, Harriet.

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:38.020
 Hello, hey, this is George.

00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:39.020
 It is? Who is this?

00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:40.820
 And if it's Mrs. Jones, it's George.

00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:41.520
 I beg your pardon?

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:43.520
 And Mrs Jones, over on Maple Street.

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:46.020
 When Henry stopped at my house on his way to school this morning,

00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:49.020
 I asked him whether he could use a couple of old suits of Mr Jones.

00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:51.520
 - What's that? - And I have the mighty end of the door, Rich.

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:53.020
 The only thing is, I'm going out now,

00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:55.520
 and I've wondered if Henry could come over this evening and get them.

00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:58.520
 - Mr Jones, did Henry ask you for those suits?

00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:01.520
 - No. He just occurred to me when I saw him this morning,

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:03.020
 but he might be able to use them.

00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:06.020
 - For Mrs Jones, Henry will not have any use for those suits.

00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:08.020
 And I don't see why you should jump to the conclusion that--

00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:11.020
 - I've been no fun. - That's nothing I appreciate your calling, Mrs Jones.

00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:14.380
 Jones but so far as I'm concerned Henry looks quite all right and what he has.

00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:26.460
 Oh I beg your pardon.

00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:29.660
 Excuse me Mr. Bralley but I'm it but am I in your way at all?

00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:32.460
 Henry may I ask what you're doing here in the faculty room?

00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:34.460
 Miss Sutherland said I didn't have to go to class.

00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:37.100
 She said I... here's what happened.

00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:37.660
 Yes?

00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:40.780
 I'm on the waste paper committee singing and this morning I was collecting

00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:46.780
 Henry, collecting waste paper is important, but you have plenty of time after school to worry about a thing like that.

00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:49.780
 And there is no waste paper here in the faculty room.

00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:50.780
 Yes, Mr. Bradley.

00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:52.780
 Now, would you mind leading me alone in here, please?

00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:54.780
 Yes, Mr. Bradley. But the only thing is...

00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:56.780
 Henry, I'd like to be alone.

00:12:56.780 --> 00:12:58.780
 Yes, sir. I'll go.

00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:01.780
 Hello, Mr. Bradley.

00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:05.780
 Mr. Bradley, home but round. It's here in the main office. He says he's supposed to see you.

00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:07.780
 Home of Brown. What about?

00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:10.880
 Well, he was late to chemistry again, and Mr. Nelson told him to come in here.

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:12.880
 Miss Shea, I can't see him now.

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:15.080
 Tell him to come back to the office at three o'clock.

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:15.780
 Yes, Mr. Baddie.

00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:17.680
 And if anyone wants me, I'm not to be disturbed.

00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:18.780
 Yes, Mr. Baddie.

00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:19.280
 Goodbye.

00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:22.780
 Uh, who's there? Come in.

00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:25.780
 It's Miss Dublin. I won't come all the way in.

00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:27.080
 Are you all right in there?

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:27.780
 What's there?

00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:29.780
 Just take all your towels, but please, and hand them to me.

00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:30.480
 I'm in a house.

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:31.480
 What's there?

00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:31.980

 Now getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldrich.

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:20.120
 As the result of a bicycle accident,

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:25.120
 Henry has had to go to school with his trousers ripped most of the way up the back.

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:27.120
 The scene opens in the Aldrich front hall.

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:29.120
 Henry says to Mary is speaking.

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:32.120
 Just a minute now, tell my mother you're here.

00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:34.120
 Okay, sure.

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:39.120
 Mother! There's a man at the front door who says Henry asked him to come and give an estimate on some waste paper that he's collected.

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:42.120
 Mary, I had no condition to talk to anyone about waste paper.

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:47.120
 Mother Henry's going to give her money to the Red Cross, and don't you think one of us thought of taking down at the basement and letting see the paper?

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:50.120
 I don't know. I just had the most embarrassing thing happen.

00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:51.120
 What do you think?

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:53.120
 As long as I live, I'll never get over it.

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:54.120
 Mother said what's happened?

00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:56.120
 I just had a phone call from Mrs. Smith.

00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:57.120
 Yes.

00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:58.120
 And what do you think she said?

00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:01.120
 She apologized, Mary, for not being in this morning.

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:04.120
 When Henry stopped to borrow a needle and spread to fix his trousers.

00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:07.120
 Henry, what? She said all her husband was able to give in was a symbol.

00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:12.120
 And by the time he'd gotten there that little hole, I'd forgotten to fix it apparently ripped right down the scene.

00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:15.120
 And he was in such an awful condition he had to wrap himself in Homer's windbreaker.

00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:18.120
 Oh my goodness, in public! Oh, then what would people say?

00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:23.120
 I'm going to die, Mary, I'm just going to die. It's going to go all the time, it was all my fault.

00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:31.500
 [Music]

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:34.240
 Listen, Henry, what are you doing here in this math room?

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:36.880
 Homer, I came in here because I got put out of the faculty room.

00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:38.680
 What's the reason any classes, you know?

00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:40.040
 Have you seen Ms. Sutherland?

00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:41.720
 You mean she hasn't sold you up yet?

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:42.480
 No.

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:45.120
 Well, do you suppose we could do anything with glue?

00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:46.120
 With glue?

00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:48.720
 Sure, maybe some quick drying stuff.

00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:51.480
 Henry, old rich man, I asked where you've been.

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:52.680
 Oh, hello Miss Sutherland.

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:54.180
 Henry, if I'm willing to try to help you,

00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:55.980
 it seems to me the least you can do is cooperate

00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:57.580
 and wait until I... well, I tend to see you.

00:17:57.580 --> 00:17:59.280
 But Miss Sutherland, I tried to.

00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:00.580
 Are you ready to go to work on me?

00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:01.580
 I was ready.

00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:03.580
 I was already to show you, and then something happens

00:18:03.580 --> 00:18:05.880
 when I knocked on the door of the faculty room and I...

00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:07.280
 Well, I dropped the needle and thread,

00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:09.480
 and I certainly had no time left to go back and get enough.

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:12.480
 Oh, do you think I could go back and find it for you in the Sutherland?

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:15.280
 If I were you, hold on, I wouldn't go near the faculty room.

00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:16.280
 And Henry.

00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:17.280
 May I ask...

00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:18.280
 May I ask you...

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:19.680
 Are you looking for something with Sutherland?

00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:23.180
 Yes, I'm trying to find yesterday's examination paper so that I can correct it.

00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:24.980
 Oh, were they in this room?

00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:27.680
 Yes, did you see them when you're seeing the place out yesterday?

00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:28.680
 You mean...

00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:29.880
 Oh, what's that?

00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:34.680
 Yes, they didn't you ask me whether they weren't some stats of old papers in this classroom that you could have?

00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:35.680
 Yes, ma'am, I got them.

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:36.180
 I helped them.

00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:37.680
 Sure, you said you wanted them out of your way.

00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:41.680
 That may be true, but did you realize that you carried off the exam paper?

00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:42.380
 What's that?

00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:44.680
 She was using the papers the whole class to just hand it out.

00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:45.680
 I do.

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:48.680
 Henry, how did you happen to do a thing like that?

00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:51.280
 And Henry, I couldn't help you now if I had to.

00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:54.680
 I've got to go down to the office and have a brand new set of questions, Ty.

00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:57.080
 You mean we have to take these damn over, Ms. Sutherland?

00:18:57.080 --> 00:18:58.080
 I do.

00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:00.880
 And I shall explain to the class who's called it is.

00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:02.880
 Oh boy!

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:03.880
 Oh boy!

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:04.880
 Henry, all this is that you in there?

00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:05.880
 Why, Ms. Shae?

00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:07.080
 Are you looking for me?

00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:09.080
 I've been looking all over for you.

00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:10.880
 Here's a bundle, your sister left for you.

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:11.680
 A bundle?

00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:12.680
 A bundle?

00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:14.480
 She said she had time to bring it over after all.

00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:16.080
 Oh, my look, I'm all fixed!

00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:17.480
 Can't you come here and get it?

00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:20.600
 I'll take it to a mache. He's sort of saving himself.

00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:22.200
 And thank you very much, mache.

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:23.200
 That's quite all right.

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:25.640
 Homer, didn't I tell you my mother would come to the rescue?

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:29.320
 Do you realize, Henry, that I got every question right in that exam yesterday?

00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:31.400
 No, I have to take the whole darn thing over.

00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:32.920
 Homer, which is more important.

00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:36.120
 And algebra exam, or the fact that I at least have some pants to take it in.

00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:37.800
 Listen, Homer.

00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:38.680
 Now what's the matter?

00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:39.480
 Did mache say...

00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:41.480
 Homer, look at what my mother said to me.

00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:42.000
 What?

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:42.760
 A skirt.

00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:44.280
 And a step night down.

00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:45.080
 What's that?

00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:46.200
 How about you, Hope?

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:48.200
 Listen Homer, didn't you mention pants?

00:19:48.200 --> 00:20:00.200
 Really? Is that all you could possibly pay my brother for all these papers here in this basement?

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:01.200
 That's all lady.

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:03.200
 Even when he's giving the money to the Red Cross?

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:05.200
 Well, I'm helping Red Cross too lady.

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:09.200
 But look at the quality of this paper. Look at these examination papers.

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:11.200
 My goodness, that isn't just ordinary.

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:14.200
 Oddly, you don't find paper like that just any play.

00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:15.240
 That's all I can give you.

00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:16.640
 All right, you can have it.

00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:17.960
 The government certainly needs it.

00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:18.960
 Sure, lady.

00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:19.800
 I can have it.

00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:20.300
 Yes, sir.

00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:21.600
 Mary, are you down, seller?

00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:22.320
 Yes, Father.

00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:23.360
 I'm just coming up.

00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:24.320
 Are you home already?

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:25.360
 I am.

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:25.960
 Where's your mother?

00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:27.680
 She's upstairs lying down, I think.

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:29.560
 She had some awful news come this afternoon.

00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:30.720
 She got a terrible headache.

00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:31.440
 What happened?

00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:32.320
 I'm right here, Sam.

00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:33.200
 What is it you want?

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:34.720
 That is what happened that gave you a headache.

00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:36.280
 Sam, I'd rather not go into it.

00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:37.400
 Since we're about Henry.

00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:38.840
 Now, Alice, if you're going to start talking

00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:40.180
 about Henry's appearance, I'd first

00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:41.400
 like to explain something.

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:42.440
 Sam, have you heard about it?

00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:44.040
 Yes, it seems to be all over town.

00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:49.540
 Well, before you say anything more, I think you should know I do have a great many things on my mind running a house this side.

00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:51.540
 And it's very unfair of you to put the blame on me.

00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:53.040
 Alice, when did I do anything like that?

00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:54.540
 You're certainly just insinuated.

00:20:54.540 --> 00:20:58.140
 Alice, all I'm asking is why you ever let the boy go out like that.

00:20:58.140 --> 00:21:01.540
 I'm reasonable, Alice. I'm reasonable. You don't have to force me into something.

00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:03.940
 Sir, Margaret, you mean you think I did it on purpose?

00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:06.440
 Well, Alice, after all, when Alice, where are you going?

00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:07.440
 Back to bed!

00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:09.880
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:18.640
 Now, hold still, Henry.

00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:19.880
 Hold still.

00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:21.280
 Why don't you want me to help you?

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:22.920
 I'm holding still, Homer.

00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:25.040
 I was just trying to see how far you'd sold me.

00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:26.320
 Well, I still.

00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:28.080
 I'll let you know when I finish you.

00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:30.240
 Oh, the only thing is, did you ever

00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:33.520
 try lying on a desk that has a railing around the top of it?

00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:36.160
 And boy, when I get home this afternoon,

00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:37.660
 But you know why that's gonna happen?

00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:38.160
 Why?

00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:41.160
 I bet my father will cut off my allowance for all the rest of this year.

00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:42.460
 She was, you will?

00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:44.460
 Has he ever done anything like that, Henry?

00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:46.460
 I never had a thing like this happen before.

00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:47.460
 And she...

00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:49.460
 My mother, she won't even speak to me.

00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:51.960
 Henry, do you want to get jabbed with this needle?

00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:54.460
 Why don't you let me turn around a little and why?

00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:56.460
 Now listen, Homer, what's the matter?

00:21:56.460 --> 00:21:57.660
 Why are you sawing me with?

00:21:57.660 --> 00:21:58.860
 Just a needle and thread.

00:21:58.860 --> 00:21:59.860
 Where'd you get that, Neel?

00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:01.060
 It's three inches long.

00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:02.060
 I got it down in the gym.

00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:03.860
 They use it for lacing footballs.

00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:05.360
 And look at that thread!

00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:07.360
 What's the matter with it? It's a little bit strong.

00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:09.360
 It's wrong. But she wears.

00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:11.360
 Now, there you can get up.

00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:13.360
 It's a very good job, Henry.

00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:15.360
 But Homer, look at the size of the stitches you saw.

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:17.360
 I had to draw the cloth together, didn't I?

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:19.360
 Didn't you ever see anybody mend a sale?

00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:22.360
 Oh, boy. You least opposed that is.

00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:24.360
 Is Overton there? Is who in here?

00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:26.360
 Homer, did he say Overton?

00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:28.360
 Hey, that's it! What did you want?

00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:30.360
 We want you, Overton!

00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:33.360
 The algebra class is out here. What did you do in our exam paper?

00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:36.500
 I will well listen, fellas, I can explain everything!

00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:38.740
 Throwin' nothing over that door, let us in!

00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:40.800
 What's the government needs, wait, paper fellas?

00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:43.840
 Then do you realize how many targets I can make with a hundred pounds of...

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:45.280
 ...a lot of examination papers?

00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:46.440
 Over that door!

00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:47.940
 Can you list throughout the window?

00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:49.320
 Oh, my, we're on the second floor!

00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:51.020
 Hey, over that door!

00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:53.680

 [Music]

00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:08.180
 Hello?

00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:10.080
 Hello, is Henry Oldwich there?

00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:11.380
 No, he isn't. Who is this?

00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:12.480
 This is Homer Brown.

00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:14.580
 Oh my goodness, Homer, do you know where Henry is?

00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:18.580
 We've waited dinner and waited dinner and we haven't heard one word from instant school let out.

00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:21.580
 Oh, I'll tell you, Mary. He's coming home.

00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:22.580
 Where has he been?

00:23:22.580 --> 00:23:24.000
 He's coming home.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.760
 He's nice and dark and the sun is down and no one can see him.

00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:29.440
 He's coming home.

00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:30.140
 Oh.

00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:33.880
 Then I just thought you would ask your mother and father not to jump on him too much.

00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:35.460
 You really wasn't his fault.

00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:37.120
 I was there all the time, Mary.

00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:38.140
 What happened?

00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:39.800
 They finally got the door unlocked,

00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:43.020
 so you only got in and because of the exams, they ruined them.

00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:44.720
 Oh, well, you tell me what happened.

00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:47.020
 Somebody got hold of the end of the rawhide.

00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:47.820
 I'm Paul.

00:23:47.820 --> 00:23:48.820
 What's that?

00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:49.640
 Never mind.

00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:51.200
 When you see him, you'll understand.

00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:52.560
 Mary, but Holler.

00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:53.880
 Hi!

00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:55.880
 Mary, just hollering about Henry.

00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:57.880
 Yes, Mother, but my goodness, that hollabrow.

00:23:57.880 --> 00:23:59.880
 He's just getting crazier and crazier.

00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:01.640
 Henry, is that you?

00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:02.640
 Oh, gee, where?

00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:04.640
 Henry, old Richard, will you please come here?

00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:06.200
 Yes, Mother.

00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:08.800
 And boy, I know exactly what you're going to say.

00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:10.640
 See, why didn't you come home before?

00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:12.600
 I've been waiting for it to get dark, Mother.

00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:14.560
 You mean you were so ashamed of your appearance?

00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:15.560
 Well, I'll tell you.

00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:17.280
 Now, dear, don't try to tell me anything.

00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:19.360
 Just sit down, Henry, and make yourself comfortable.

00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:20.360
 What's that?

00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:21.360
 For a cheers, white horse.

00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:24.360
 You might come hot too before I get you a nice plate of chicken beer.

00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:27.360
 You mean Henry, I just wanna say this.

00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:29.860
 I've never felt so bad about anything in all my life.

00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:31.360
 But mother, won't you love me explain?

00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:34.360
 You don't have to be doing things like this will never happen again.

00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:37.360
 If won't, you mean you're gonna take my bicycle away?

00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:40.860
 You're like goodness, Henry. I guess you don't realize how sorry mother feels about it.

00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:42.860
 She does. There's one consolation though.

00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:45.360
 You've certainly done your share in collecting waste paper.

00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:46.860
 You think I have marriage?

00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:49.360
 My goodness, I think you deserve some kind of decoration.

00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:51.160
 Dear, are you catching cold?

00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:53.600
 Well, I've sort of had a draft up my leg all day.

00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:54.600
 [LAUGHTER]

00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:56.240
 Alice, is that Henry?

00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:57.080
 Yes, Sam.

00:24:57.080 --> 00:24:57.740
 Oh, boy.

00:24:57.740 --> 00:24:59.440
 The mother-- will you try to tell him I--

00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:00.160
 my side of it?

00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:01.280
 We all know all about it.

00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:03.240
 And tomorrow we're going down to the Emporium

00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:04.600
 and by you a new suit.

00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:05.040
 We are?

00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:05.540
 Yes, sir.

00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:06.880
 And I want you to know I should never

00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:08.080
 have let a thing like this happen.

00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:09.680
 Now, Sam, it wasn't really your fault.

00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:10.640
 It was partly my fault.

00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:12.240
 Now, Alice, the whole thing was my fault.

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:13.240
 What was?

00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:15.840
 By the way, Henry, did you get my night down?
