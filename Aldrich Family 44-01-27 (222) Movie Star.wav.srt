00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 Dello presents the Aldrich family written by Clifford Goldsmith and starring as Ristone.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 Henry Henry Aldrich! Coming Mother!

00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 [Applause]

 [Music]

6
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:37,000
 Now that autumn is on the doorstep, folks, the corner grocery store has begun to take on added color.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 Piled high on the fruit counter are heaps of shiny red cheek apples, yellow peaches and big glossy grapes.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 Yes, sir, it's a mighty attractive sight, but even more inviting is the sight of a bright, colorful, yellow fruit cup,

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 Made with some of the same apples, peaches, and grapes.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 Better yet, this swell dessert is wonderfully easy to prepare.

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 You first arrange diced tart apples, seated grapes, and diced peaches and sherbet glasses.

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 Then make up one package of orange jello according to directions on the box,

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 and pour over the fruit. Then chill, and take it from me friends, there is a real treat.

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 A tough-notch treat that you can serve either as an appetizer or as a dessert.

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 You'll be surprised to find how delightfully the cool tang of orange jello

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 blend with the rich flavor of ripe summer fruit.

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 Our jello makes a grand fruit cup taste even grander.

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 So tomorrow try this tempting jello recipe,

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 a combination of juicy red apples,

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 tender golden peaches, rich purple grapes,

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 and delicious orange jello.

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 [Music]

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 All of us know a town like Centerville, a family like the Aldrich's, and all of us know a teenage boy like Henry Aldrich.

24
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 Anything is likely to happen when Henry is around, and it usually does.

25
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 As our scene opens tonight, we find Henry Aldrich in the dining room with his father and mother.

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,500
 Mother, will you have some more peas?

27
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,500
 No, thank you. You've finished a few peas there or there.

28
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:16,000
 Oh, I wouldn't think of touching them. Father, wouldn't you like these peas?

29
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 No, thank you.

30
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 I think you ought to have them, Father. I'll just scrape them into your plate.

31
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,500
 Henry, I don't want them.

32
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,500
 Would you like some bread, Mother? No, dear. Now, I just stopped passing things in eat.

33
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:29,000
 Well, if you don't want anything, just ask for it, huh?

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,400
 Boy did I see a swell movie this afternoon.

35
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,800
 I'm going out and get some butter.

36
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,400
 Sit still, mother. I'll go out and get it.

37
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,200
 I'll get it.

38
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,400
 Give me the dish, mother.

39
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,600
 My goodness, one would think you have nothing to do,

40
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,600
 but run around waiting on all of it.

41
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,000
 Family, please tell me what's gotten into Henry.

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,200
 I have no more idea than you.

43
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,400
 I offered him his allowance a few minutes ago,

44
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,600
 and he refused it.

45
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,200
 Well, something's wrong.

46
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,200
 After dinner, you'd better take his temperature.

47
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,400
 Is your arm, mother? Will you have some butter?

48
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,200
 No, thank you.

49
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,600
 Oh, go ahead and take a little.

50
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,600
 I have some here.

51
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,200
 Did I tell you I saw a movie this afternoon?

52
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,400
 I believe you did.

53
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,800
 Boy was there a swell guy in it.

54
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,600
 Sam, don't forget when you're downtown tomorrow

55
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,000
 to get two decks of cards and bring them home at noon.

56
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 Oh, giving a bridge, Pardon?

57
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,800
 I am.

58
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,400
 Well, listen, there's no reason in the world

59
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,300
 why I couldn't get those cards for you.

60
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,900
 That's what I was waiting for.

61
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,000
 Give him a dollar, Sam, if he wants to help.

62
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,500
 Henry, are you quite sure none of this

63
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,300
 has anything to do with your conscience?

64
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,100
 My conscience?

65
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,200
 Mm-hmm.

66
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,400
 What conscience?

67
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,160
 Then you happen to me?

68
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:30,960
 No sir.

69
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,400
 I'm not surprised.

70
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,400
 Mother, about how much do you spend a week on food?

71
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,400
 Well, Mary's away, about $14.

72
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,400
 Well, from now on, I'm paying my share.

73
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,400
 Why, Henry, older, if you're not going to do anything of the kind.

74
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,400
 Yes, I am, Mother. No more free eating for me.

75
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,400
 Have you struck oil, Henry?

76
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,400
 I haven't struck oil, but I've got a job.

77
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,400
 How much do you think I ought to pay a week for my room?

78
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,400
 I have no idea.

79
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:59,400
 Well, supposing I was a stranger here and you didn't know me.

80
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,400
 And I came to the door and said, "I want a room.

81
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,400
 How much would you charge me?"

82
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,400
 Personally, I wouldn't even let you in.

83
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,400
 Well, why not?

84
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,400
 Not if your hands look the way they do right this minute.

85
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,400
 Oh, she was out, go right up and wash them.

86
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,400
 But before I go, let's settle on a price.

87
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,400
 Would $3 a week be too much?

88
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,400
 What kind of a job do you have?

89
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,400
 You'll learn soon enough.

90
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:24,400
 I begin tomorrow morning and I'm going to give half of every cent of the day.

91
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,200
 of every cent I make to the Red Cross or something.

92
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,700
 Well, isn't that fine?

93
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:33,200
 That movie I saw this afternoon was called "The Generous Gentleman."

94
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,500
 And boy was it swell.

95
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,000
 The gentleman did kind things for everybody.

96
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,600
 Did he?

97
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,200
 And did people like him?

98
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,600
 Even when he became old everybody liked him.

99
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:47,500
 And this swell looking girl that never liked him before finally fell in love with him.

100
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,300
 Henry, eat your mashed potatoes.

101
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,400
 Yes, follow me.

102
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,700
 From now on, I'm going to help my friends

103
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:55,500
 and do little things for strangers that are in trouble.

104
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:59,700
 And from now on, mother, you'll never have to tell me more than once to do anything.

105
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:03,200
 Then for the last time, will you please go up and wash your hands?

106
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:06,300
 Yes, mother, but first let me tell you how I'm going to help people.

107
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:21,800
 Young man, have I ever seen you around this golf course before?

108
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,140
 Well, I've been around it.

109
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:24,640
 Ever had any experience, kettie?

110
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:28,580
 Well, after all, there isn't much to carrying a bag of clubs is there.

111
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:29,680
 Oh.

112
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,040
 There were any other boys on hand. I wouldn't even consider you.

113
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,220
 Now, stand back when I put this ball on the tee.

114
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:38,160
 Yes, sir. But you don't have to worry about me.

115
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,460
 I know that when you're going to hit the ball, I should keep very quiet.

116
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:42,260
 That's fine.

117
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:45,600
 Personally, I think if you're being paid to do something, you ought to do it.

118
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,000
 Mm-hmm.

119
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,400
 Even if it's just to keep quiet.

120
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,240
 Do you want me to put that ball back on the tee for you?

121
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,440
 No, thank you. Just stand back.

122
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,040
 Yes, sir.

123
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:57,340
 And keep your eye on this ball when I hit it. I left my glasses at home.

124
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:59,940
 Oh, gee, I have wonderful eyesight.

125
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:00,440
 Good.

126
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,940
 Yes, or everybody speaks about it.

127
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:06,140
 Have you seen the picture called the generous gentleman?

128
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:09,740
 Will you please stand back? I'd like to hit this ball.

129
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:11,140
 Oh, down there.

130
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:14,040
 Oh, I know who that is down there.

131
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,540
 What do you mean by yelling just as I swing?

132
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:17,840
 Oh, did I frighten you?

133
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,740
 I didn't make a terrible shot.

134
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,140
 Have you hit it already?

135
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:22,740
 Didn't you have your eye on it?

136
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:23,440
 Well, uh...

137
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,940
 We'll find it alright.

138
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:26,840
 It might have gone over here to the left.

139
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,140
 What makes you think so?

140
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:30,640
 Well, we'll look to the left first and then work around.

141
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,840
 Hmm...

142
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,540
 The reason I didn't hit it straight-er is because of this coat.

143
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:36,340
 Would you like to have me carry your coat?

144
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:37,540
 All the way around the course.

145
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,040
 Gee, I don't mind a little thing like that,

146
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,840
 especially if it helps anybody.

147
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,740
 Alright, here.

148
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,740
 I'll throw it right over my shoulder.

149
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:44,640
 Ah, Herbert.

150
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,140
 I am.

151
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:45,740
 Henry!

152
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,440
 I thought that was you.

153
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,540
 Well, a lot of balls out on this course.

154
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:51,800
 I picked up four just since I got here.

155
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,300
 -Caddy, have you found my ball?

156
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:57,640
 -Not yet, Mr. Eddie, but Herbert says this is a very good place to look for them.

157
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,140
 -Here it is right here.

158
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:00,740
 -Oh, have we found it?

159
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:02,640
 I thought it would be to the left.

160
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,640
 -Let me have my machey.

161
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,240
 -Your machey?

162
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,040
 Do you think that's the best one to use for a shot like that?

163
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,840
 -I'd like my machey.

164
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,540
 -Yes, sir.

165
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,940
 -And when I hit the ball this time, keep your eye on it.

166
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:15,440
 -Yes, sir.

167
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,840
 No more talking.

168
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,340
 -And this other young man, don't stand so near.

169
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:23,660
 No sir. Herbert have you seen a picture called the generous gentleman?

170
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:27,020
 Young man. Yes sir. Herbert. Why?

171
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:32,460
 He's about to swing the club. Oh what's the name of that picture then we...

172
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:38,620
 Cathy may I ask who this young man is? Oh I guess I didn't introduce you did I?

173
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:43,260
 This is Herbert. How do you do sir? What are you doing here? I asked him to meet me here.

174
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:48,300
 What for? He wants to learn how to caddy. I told him the easiest way would be to watch me.

175
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,300
 I see.

176
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:54,900
 Well, supposing Herbert, you go over and sit under that shady tree.

177
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,900
 Not the nearest tree, not the one just beyond,

178
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:01,000
 but the one way over on the far side of the fairway.

179
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,700
 Yes, sir.

180
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:02,800
 Don't be hurt, Herbert.

181
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,900
 People that are new with this game are always easily upset.

182
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,700
 - Young man. - Yes, sir?

183
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,500
 - Have you your eye on this ball? - Yes, sir.

184
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,000
 - Very well, then. Here goes.

185
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,900
 Gee, whiz, what a sock.

186
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:16,300
 - Where did it go? - It hit that tree.

187
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,300
 Where did you learn to shoot so straight?

188
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:22,000
 I never made a shot like that before.

189
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,260
 I didn't think you should have used your mashy.

190
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:25,860
 The whole trouble is this sweater.

191
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:28,060
 Oh, that's all right. Just take it off. I'll carry it.

192
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:29,100
 You're sure you don't mind?

193
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,300
 Gee whiz, I'm here to serve you, aren't I?

194
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,020
 All right. Yeah.

195
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:35,100
 Give me the number three, iron.

196
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,060
 The number three?

197
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:37,460
 Yes, sir.

198
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:39,460
 You want me to roll that log out of your way?

199
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:40,420
 No, thank you.

200
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,300
 I'll show you how to put the ball right straight down

201
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:42,900
 on that green.

202
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:43,400
 OK.

203
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,900
 And don't say a word.

204
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:54,540
 house. I was look at that ball travel herber almost in a circle. That's the

205
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:59,460
 first time I ever made a shot like that. You know Mr. Eddie I had a feeling you

206
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:03,380
 shouldn't use that number three. The trouble is my collar is too tight. Want

207
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:06,780
 me to take your neck time? You sure it won't be too much trouble. No just roll

208
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:10,380
 it up and stuff it in my pocket. Did you see where the ball landed? Yes sir.

209
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:14,860
 Do you see that clump of trees to the left? Uh huh. And that house on the other

210
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:19,260
 side of the road yes well it went right in the yard of the house just beyond

211
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:25,060
 how did it do that well I I guess you just laid into it all right all right

212
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:28,140
 give me another ball there I'll hit it on down you go over and get that on the

213
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:31,660
 woman meet me at the green yes sir here you are I'll run all the way and don't

214
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:36,860
 come back without that ball oh you don't have to worry I saw exactly where it

215
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:40,020
 went I think

216
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:40,180
 (

217
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:50,020
 (Music)

218
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,020
 (Coughing)

219
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:53,020
 Pardon me.

220
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:56,020
 Pardon me.

221
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:58,020
 Was there something you wanted?

222
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:01,020
 Did you see a golf ball land in your backyard?

223
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:03,020
 Well if one did you better get it before a coffee does.

224
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,020
 I should.

225
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,020
 Yeah.

226
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:09,020
 Papa says it's because things like that that our chickens won't lay.

227
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:11,020
 Hmm, I wonder where that one of mine went.

228
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:14,020
 Well, I'd help you, only. I'm having some trouble with this garden hose.

229
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:15,020
 What's the matter?

230
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:18,020
 Well, the figure on the side of the house won't turn off.

231
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:20,020
 Well, gee whiz, let me give you a hand.

232
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,020
 Well, don't get all wet.

233
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:24,020
 Oh, don't worry about me. I can turn it.

234
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:26,020
 Have you seen the generous gentleman?

235
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,020
 No, what?

236
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:30,020
 It's a slow picture I saw yesterday.

237
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:33,020
 In it, a guy went out in the rain as a favor to somebody.

238
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:34,020
 And guess what?

239
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:36,620
 Guess what? He got soaking wet too.

240
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:37,520
 He did?

241
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,520
 Yeah.

242
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,520
 Mmm.

243
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,520
 That's strange.

244
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,520
 Well, won't it turn off?

245
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,520
 Mmm.

246
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:46,520
 You know, I think I can fix it.

247
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,020
 Hey, say it's an issue ball right here.

248
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:55,320
 So it is. Look, I think if I just slip the handle of this golf club into the spokes

249
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,320
 of a faucet, I can get a little leverage on it.

250
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,020
 Oh my goodness, look at your shoes.

251
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:02,520
 Look, the club just fits in.

252
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:06,980
 Oh good gracious look at what you've done to it.

253
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:07,980
 Imagine.

254
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:10,860
 I almost spend his number three iron double.

255
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,220
 Look, can you straighten it?

256
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:13,620
 I think I can.

257
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:16,420
 Fortunately it's steel.

258
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:17,700
 There.

259
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,140
 Unless you held it right up to your eye,

260
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:21,580
 you'd hardly notice it's been bent.

261
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:24,140
 I'll try the force it once more.

262
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:26,660
 Oh now look at what you've done.

263
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:29,300
 She was, I broke it off.

264
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,700
 You don't have another force it to you.

265
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:31,940
 Oh of course we don't.

266
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:32,940
 Do you have a telephone?

267
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:33,940
 No we don't.

268
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:35,940
 Well don't you have anything for an emergency like that?

269
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:36,940
 No.

270
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:37,940
 I'll tell you what I'll do.

271
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,940
 I'll run over to the clubhouse and telephone for a plumber.

272
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,940
 But how about the basement?

273
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:42,940
 It's running right into it.

274
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:45,940
 I'll have someone here before you know it.

275
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:46,940
 Imagine this.

276
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:47,940
 What is it?

277
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:51,340
 I found a dollar in my pocket to get my mother some playing cards but I can get them with

278
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:52,940
 the money I earn for tatting.

279
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:53,940
 Here you take it.

280
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:54,940
 What for?

281
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:55,940
 To pay for the false?

282
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:56,940
 Why should you pay for it?

283
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:57,940
 Well I broke it didn't.

284
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:58,940
 I hear it.

285
00:11:58,940 --> 00:11:59,940
 Go ahead you take it.

286
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:00,940
 Well thank you.

287
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:04,740
 I'll take these clubs in this sweater and coat and I'll run every step of the way.

288
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:05,740
 Well hurry!

289
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:08,940
 Goodbye and I'm very glad to have been a help to you.

290
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:24,440
 Hey Henry is that you?

291
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:28,440
 Yes Herbert, does this road swing around at the clubhouse?

292
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,440
 Yeah, where have you been?

293
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,440
 I've been busy.

294
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,240
 Well, Mr. Ruddy says he needs you.

295
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:36,840
 I wonder whether I ought to help him a little before I put in that crawl.

296
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,340
 I see a ball, Henry. I'll see you later.

297
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:40,340
 Hey, buddy.

298
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:41,140
 Who's that?

299
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:43,940
 Come back up here on the road a second. What do you my car's stuck in the mud?

300
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:47,540
 The only trouble is I've got a couple other things to do.

301
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:49,540
 Well, couldn't you land a full of our hands?

302
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:50,740
 You need some help?

303
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:51,940
 Yeah.

304
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:54,540
 Well, maybe I can assist you.

305
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,140
 Start your motor.

306
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:01,940
 No, now don't start it quite so fast.

307
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:02,740
 Okay.

308
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,820
 Just start it real slow, see?

309
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:13,380
 Look, I'll tell you what, back up until I stop moving my hand.

310
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:15,060
 You won't let me drop into the ditch, will you?

311
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,220
 Oh no, there's some boards over it.

312
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:17,620
 Okay.

313
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:19,620
 Come on.

314
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:21,860
 Come on.

315
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:29,220
 Oh, gee, whiz.

316
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:32,220
 You ought to hear what I'm saying.

317
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:35,220
 [audience laughter]

318
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:38,220
 Mr. Du-- do you have a shovel?

319
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:40,220
 What would I be doing with a shovel?

320
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:42,220
 Well, you certainly need one.

321
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:44,220
 [audience laughter]

322
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:46,220
 Wait a minute, here comes a car behind you.

323
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:49,220
 Hello there! Hello!

324
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:51,220
 Would you please let me get by?

325
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:53,220
 Could you pull up against this gentleman and push--

326
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:55,220
 Oh, my goodness, I can't drive that well.

327
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:57,520
 Well, would you like to have me take the wheel?

328
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,420
 Oh, it won't take more than a minute.

329
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:01,220
 I'm in a terrible hurry.

330
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,420
 It won't take a second.

331
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:06,020
 You better stand over there so you don't get any mud splashed on you.

332
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:08,220
 Oh, that's very tough to look you on shore.

333
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:10,520
 Gee whiz, that's the least I can do.

334
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:14,520
 This reminds me of a moving picture that's in town this week.

335
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,720
 Oh, you're coming.

336
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,120
 Are you ready to head there?

337
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,320
 Come on.

338
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,320
 Here we go.

339
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:23,920
 Be careful.

340
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:28,920
 (Laughter)

341
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,920
 Isn't that strange?

342
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,920
 How far are you?

343
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,920
 Even deeper than you.

344
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,920
 And what am I to do?

345
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:42,920
 Well, I'll tell you, Miss. I've got to go to the clubhouse and phone a plumber anyhow.

346
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:46,920
 I'd be very glad to put in a call for a tow car at the same time.

347
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,920
 And in the meantime, I'm due downtown at court.

348
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:49,920
 You're?

349
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,920
 And if I'm not there, I have to forfeit $25.

350
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:57,920
 Well my father's a lawyer and I'll phone him too and tell him to go down and fix things for you.

351
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:58,920
 Are you sure he can?

352
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:02,920
 Oh gee, he's like me. He likes to do things for people.

353
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,920
 In the same way?

354
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,920
 Well I'll beat it over and phone right away.

355
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,920
 Well my name is Mrs. McGill.

356
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:10,920
 Yes ma'am.

357
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,920
 And the charges are for talking back to an officer.

358
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,920
 Yes ma'am.

359
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:19,920
 And if you get a chance to see that picture of the guy that was so nice everyone, don't miss it.

360
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,920
 Henry I thought you were going to see Mr. Reddy.

361
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:27,520
 Mr. Reddy Herbert Herbert will you go over to the clubhouse for me? I can't Henry I'm finding too many balls

362
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:31,240
 You are sure I just sold sex to Mr. Reddy well

363
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:34,680
 Where is he you go right through those trees there under the underbrush?

364
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,340
 Okay, and then go straight through to the swamp

365
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:42,220
 Okay, tell them these boys to look in there though. I've already cleaned that part out

366
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:45,200
 Mr. Eddie

367
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,000
 Oh

368
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,920
 Mr. Ready

369
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,620
 Where have you been I just want to tell you I'll be right back

370
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:52,620
 Where are you going?

371
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:53,620
 It's a call of plumber.

372
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:54,620
 What fall?

373
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,620
 I got a lady in a ditch.

374
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:56,620
 How did you get a lady in a ditch?

375
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:58,620
 I was trying to get another guy out.

376
00:15:58,620 --> 00:15:59,620
 When?

377
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:01,620
 Right after I busted a faucet for a girl.

378
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:02,620
 What faucet?

379
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:03,620
 The girls!

380
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:06,620
 Would you like to wear your coat or sweater or anything?

381
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:07,620
 I would not.

382
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:09,620
 Boy have I been having a tough time.

383
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:12,620
 You've been having a tough time.

384
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:15,620
 I just played four holes with one club.

385
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:18,620
 How did you do?

386
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,620
 Young man, have you had a sunstroke?

387
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:21,620
 Do I look pale?

388
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:23,120
 Are you going to Cathy for me?

389
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,320
 Well, I'll tell you, Mr. Ready.

390
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,420
 I'll give you two more clubs.

391
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:28,320
 That ought to hold you while I go up on phones.

392
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,320
 Oh, no, you don't.

393
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,420
 You can't eat an hour, never.

394
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:33,120
 But you don't realize the position you're putting everyone in?

395
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,320
 Come here with that bag.

396
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,220
 I can't help it.

397
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:39,320
 You're going around with me if I have to drive you around with this club.

398
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:51,320
 [Music]

399
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:57,320
 You know, folks, sometimes it's not the things Henry says, but the way he says them, that make all the difference in the world.

400
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:01,320
 And that's true of a lot of things we all say. Take the simple phrase, "Oh yes."

401
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:05,320
 And just notice what a variety of meetings a person can put into it.

402
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:10,720
 For example, suppose you were invited out to dinner, and your hostess asked you if you had ever heard of Jell-O.

403
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,620
 Your answer would be as follows.

404
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:13,720
 Oh, yes.

405
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:19,320
 Then, when she informs you that there's to be Jell-O for dessert, you might say eagerly, "Oh, yes?"

406
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:25,720
 And later, when she asks you if you want a second dish, you'll reply as sure to be, "Oh, yes!"

407
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:29,620
 So you see, friends, it does make a big difference the way you may say a thing.

408
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:33,020
 Now, that's true when you say, "Oh, yes!" to a second dish of Jell-O.

409
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:36,520
 And it's just as true when you order a package of jello at the store.

410
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,320
 Bear that in mind, ladies and gentlemen,

411
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,720
 and the next time you ask the grocer for some jello,

412
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,320
 don't just say, "I want some jello."

413
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,520
 Say, "I want jello."

414
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,020
 Then you can be sure of getting genuine jello

415
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:50,520
 and jello's famous extra-rich flavor,

416
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:53,720
 because jello is a trademark, the property of general foods.

417
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,520
 And those big red letters on the box

418
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:59,520
 assure you of getting America's favorite gelatin dessert, jello.

419
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:08,520
 [Music]

420
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:14,520
 Now getting back to the troubles of Henry Albridge, Henry has decided to be kind and helpful to everyone he meets.

421
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,520
 So far he's done very well.

422
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:23,520
 While carrying on the golf course for a Mr. Eddie, he's broken a water spigot and run two cars into a muddy ditch.

423
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,520
 Well, as the scene opens, Henry is speaking.

424
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:31,520
 Mr. Ready. Mr. Ready.

425
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:36,520
 As soon as you've knocked the ball over this water hazard, could I just run up and foam?

426
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,520
 Give me my number three iron.

427
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:41,520
 You're a number three iron?

428
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,520
 Isn't that the one you used that took me away for so long?

429
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,520
 May I have it?

430
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,520
 Yes, Mr. Ready.

431
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,520
 Then may I put in that call?

432
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,520
 Stand back, please.

433
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,520
 Yes, sir.

434
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:57,520
 You know if I hadn't left my glasses behind, I'd swear this club was crooked.

435
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,520
 You really think so?

436
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,520
 Henry!

437
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,520
 What, Herbert?

438
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,520
 Which way are you going to have that for?

439
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:07,520
 Over the water hazard and you keep away from it.

440
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,520
 Come here, Herbert.

441
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,520
 For...

442
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,520
 Boy, what a shot!

443
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:16,520
 I was the... I was the... I was the... I was the head of each club.

444
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:20,520
 I never did a thing like that before.

445
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,520
 See, they certainly make clubs poorly nowadays.

446
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:25,040
 Nowadays give me my number two iron mr.

447
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:31,040
 Eddie I really think you ought to let me pay for that number three what became of my ball Herbert put that ball back

448
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:35,580
 I just want to see what it was this who's did you think it would be it's yours all right?

449
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:43,160
 Herbert could you step over here to one side a minute? Well you have now then let's see what this iron does listen Herbert

450
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:48,360
 I want you to go to the clubhouse and put in three phone calls if they won't let you say it's for mr

451
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:51,360
 One call is to a plumber to shut off some water.

452
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,360
 One is to a garage.

453
00:19:53,360 --> 00:20:00,360

 Miss Pearson?

456
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,360
 Yes, Mr. Olich.

457
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,360
 Will you take a letter, please?

458
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,360
 Mr. Olich, while you were at a launch,

459
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,360
 a young man by the name of Herbert Thompson, telephone.

460
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,360
 Herbert?

461
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,360
 Oh, Henry's friend, what did he want?

462
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,360
 Well, the fact is he seemed rather confused.

463
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:23,360
 At any rate, you're going to go down to court at once and help get Henry out of trouble.

464
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,360
 What kind of trouble?

465
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:27,360
 All I understand was your son has talked back to some officers.

466
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,360
 That's a fine thing. I can't possibly go down.

467
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,360
 I'm scheduled for a conference.

468
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:35,360
 Impertance to an officer, huh? What do you say to him?

469
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,360
 I don't know.

470
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:40,360
 Well, Henry can just stay down there. I don't believe in interfering with the law.

471
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:44,360
 I understand if you don't straighten things out, the fine will be $25.

472
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:48,760
 Twenty five dollars twenty call the committee and tell them I'll be late.

473
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,720
 You're going to court.

474
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,520
 Of course I am.

475
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:53,400
 I can't afford to pay twenty five dollars anymore than anyone else can.

476
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,560
 Who's that?

477
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,360
 I have no idea.

478
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,000
 Hello.

479
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,480
 Yes.

480
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,760
 One moment.

481
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,000
 Mr.

482
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,200
 Aldrich I have a message for you.

483
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:03,760
 Who is it?

484
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,160
 Mrs.

485
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:08,480
 Aldrich says she has a whole house full of guests waiting to play bridge and there aren't any cards.

486
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,880
 Didn't Henry get them.

487
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:10,880
 He doesn't seem to have.

488
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:15,280
 Well, here, take this dollar, close up the office and get her some cards.

489
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:30,080
 Excuse me, sir.

490
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,280
 What is it, young man?

491
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,880
 Have you seen Mr. Eddie around the clubhouse here?

492
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,880
 Oh, Mr. Eddie is still down the locker room.

493
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:40,080
 Well, will you tell him I found his coat, but I'm sorry we mislaid his sweater.

494
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,080
 Yes, sir.

495
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,680
 One moment, young man.

496
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,880
 Oh, I, uh...

497
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,180
 I found your coat, Mr. Eddie.

498
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,180
 But I think I ought to tell you.

499
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:52,280
 The fellow with the lawnmower ran over one of the sleeves.

500
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,380
 He did.

501
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:54,680
 Well, I'm not surprised.

502
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:58,280
 But, Mr. Eddie, all I was trying to do when I carried it was to help you.

503
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:58,780
 Yes.

504
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:00,480
 I was trying to serve you.

505
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,780
 Yes, 50-75-1 dollar.

506
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:06,580
 Now, let's just forget that we ever even met.

507
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:09,380
 Well, frankly, I don't feel I should even take the money.

508
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:12,380
 Just take it and let's not say anything more about it.

509
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:15,780
 There's just one thing for which I suppose I ought to thank you.

510
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:16,480
 What's that?

511
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,580
 For 15 years my wife has been trying to get me to give up golf.

512
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:22,580
 Today I'm giving it up.

513
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:24,580
 Forever?

514
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:25,180
 Forever.

515
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,980
 Well I'm certainly sorry.

516
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,780
 Let's not discuss it anymore.

517
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:32,080
 If we ever meet on the street let's not even speak to each other.

518
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,280
 Yes Mr. Eddie.

519
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,980
 Now then do you think you can do one more thing for me and do it right?

520
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:39,080
 Oh yes or anything you say.

521
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:44,080
 All right. Go around in front of the clubhouse and tell the boy to bring my car here.

522
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:44,580
 Yes, sir.

523
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:48,080
 But don't you go near the car. Don't you even touch the car.

524
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:51,180
 No, sir. And will you be... Where will you be here? I mean...

525
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:55,180
 I will be right over here at the desk talking to Mr. Blotman.

526
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:57,680
 Yes, sir. Did you want me, Mr. Eddie?

527
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,080
 I do. Something gone wrong, Mr. Eddie.

528
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:06,080
 Wrong? Wrong? I just want to tell you what I think of the way your entire club is wrong.

529
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,780
 Did something in particular go wrong?

530
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:15,780
 I... I hired a caddy to look for my golf balls and I spent my whole day looking for my caddy.

531
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:18,780
 Well, do you know what my score was?

532
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:20,780
 185.

533
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:26,780
 Well, I usually do it in 120.

534
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:32,780
 And then to add insult to injury, I come into the locker room looking forward to a shower.

535
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:35,780
 Oh, just a minute, Mr. Eddy. That's something I want to catch up with.

536
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:42,140
 I get under the shower and in the midst of my bath the water is shut off.

537
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:44,140
 Completely shut off!

538
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:45,700
 But that's what I want to explain.

539
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,980
 It's something over which we had no control.

540
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:53,100
 Through some misdirection a plumber came here and unknown to us shut off all the water

541
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,100
 in the clubhouse.

542
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,100
 Why?

543
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,980
 Well all we know is some young man called in.

544
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:58,980
 That is no excuse.

545
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:03,940
 The fact still remains that underneath my clothes right this minute I am covered with

546
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:10,940
 sopesons. Well, I'm very sorry. Sorry. Did you ever walk around with suds on you?

547
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:13,940
 Oh, no, sir. Try it sometime.

548
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:18,940
 Mr. Ready. Mr. Ready, I have some rather disconcerting news for you.

549
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:22,940
 Now, what happened? Was yours a black roadster?

550
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:28,940
 What has happened to it? Nothing except that the fella out in front says that sometime this afternoon,

551
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:31,940
 a man from a garage came and towed it away.

552
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:32,940
 told it away.

553
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,820
 Told it, who told him to do that?

554
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:35,820
 He didn't know.

555
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:38,940
 He just said somebody had phoned for him to come and get it.

556
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:41,940
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

557
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:54,860
 Father.

558
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,940
 Father, would you like some more, Butter?

559
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:58,540
 No, thank you.

560
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:00,620
 Are you sure you're going to have enough?

561
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:04,180
 Henry, if I were you, I wouldn't bother your father anymore.

562
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:05,180
 Oh.

563
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:07,140
 Is he tired, Mother?

564
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:08,780
 He is.

565
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:11,260
 Both tired and embarrassed.

566
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:13,460
 Did something go wrong?

567
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:14,860
 Not a thing.

568
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:19,900
 All I did was miss a yearly business meeting in order to bail my son out of jail for talking

569
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:23,100
 back to an officer who didn't know anything about it.

570
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,900
 Father, that was entirely Herbert's fault.

571
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:26,900
 Oh, no.

572
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:27,900
 No, it wasn't.

573
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:28,900
 It was your fault.

574
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:34,000
 kind to someone you didn't even know. Well it's a funny thing but things didn't

575
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,880
 work out like this in the generous gentleman. Did the generous gentleman forget to bring

576
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:43,160
 cards for his mother's bridge party? Mother I'm going to pay you back that dollar you

577
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:48,400
 gave me for the cards. I really am. I'd give you what I earned this afternoon only.

578
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:55,560
 I paid that to Mrs. McGill toward her fine. You gave your dollar to Mrs. McGill? Yes sir.

579
00:25:55,560 --> 00:26:02,640
 And I told her if there was ever anything I could do to help her, I'd be very glad to.

580
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,240
 And what did she say?

581
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,200
 She said she was quite sure there wasn't a thing I could do.

582
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,720
 Oh, I'll answer the phone, Mother.

583
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,720
 Just beat your dinner.

584
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,720
 I'll see who it is.

585
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,280
 Yes, Mother.

586
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:17,120
 Head Ray, when does school start?

587
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,320
 In a few days.

588
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,800
 Why?

589
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,800
 No reason.

590
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:25,040
 I was just wondering.

591
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,920
 Is there anything I can pass your phone?

592
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:29,080
 No, no, no, thank you.

593
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:32,720
 Gee, the more I think about how Herbert Baldwin

594
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,880
 brings up today.

595
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:36,200
 Hey, do you know Mr. Eddie?

596
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,400
 Mr. Eddie?

597
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,080
 Yeah, in a way, why?

598
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,800
 He just phoned for me?

599
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,040
 Does he want me to caddy form the moron?

600
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:46,400
 He wants to know whether you have his necktie.

601
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,680
 Oh, gee, I've got it in my pocket.

602
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,920
 I'll take it to him tomorrow.

603
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,920
 He said you're not to take it to him.

604
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,120
 You're to mail it to him.

605
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:58,960
 Well, that's certainly very thoughtful of them, because I'd plan to do something else

606
00:26:58,960 --> 00:26:59,960
 tomorrow.

607
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:00,960
 What?

608
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:05,640
 Well, I wasn't able to give the Red Cross any money today, and I thought I'd go over

609
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,520
 and help them instead.

610
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,080
 Here Henry is a dollar.

611
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,080
 A dollar?

612
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,080
 What for?

613
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,080
 For the Red Cross.

614
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,240
 They're having enough problems without you're going over and helping them.

 [Music]

616
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:46,940
 Butter, eggs, potatoes, and flour are food products that housewives refer to as staples.

617
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:50,840
 Foods that have a variety of uses and must always be kept on hand.

618
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:54,240
 And the same definition fits jello and jello puddings too.

619
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,940
 They're really what you might call staple desserts,

620
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:00,740
 because they're so handy, so easy to adapt to different recipes

621
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:04,240
 that they've won an established place on the average pantry shell.

622
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:10,640
 You'll find that jello and jello puddings are simple to make, inexpensive, and truly delicious.

623
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,640
 So ask your grocer for both of these swell desserts tomorrow.

624
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,640
 Jello and Jello would it?

625
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:28,640
 Henry, I want to tell you how nicely you helped with the dishes.

626
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,640
 Thank you, Mother. Thank you very much.

627
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,640
 Could I go out to the movies this evening? There's a swell picture.
