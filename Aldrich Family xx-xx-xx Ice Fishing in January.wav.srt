00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 [Music]

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 And now for the all-great family.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 The actions of a teenage boy are above the closing of the thunderstorm.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 They never see as long as he has an ounce of energy to draw.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 And with Henry Olvitch, there are usually a few extra ounces in reserve.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 It is Saturday morning and the scene opens on Homer Brown's front for end.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,800
 Oh my, look at it this way, it's January.

8
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,600
 Stand back, Harry, you're crying.

9
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,400
 And what better month is there to go fishing in than January?

10
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:41,000
 Can we, can't you see, I'm busy watching the store and window?

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 What's the thing about home, are you cut a hole in the ice tree?

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,600
 And you sit there and my nights lost the air.

13
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,000
 Oh, it's not too frosty.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 Just healthy.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,800
 Harry, why should I go sitting around in the air

16
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:55,000
 when I can watch the store and window from my father?

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,600
 Homer, do you feel well?

18
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,600
 Yeah, well you step aside.

19
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:04,600
 Boy, after all my father's done for me, it's only a second due.

20
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:08,600
 But when we're big of a side sister, let's see him flex your tongue.

21
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,600
 They've been growing ever since summer.

22
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,600
 There's no use after me, Henry.

23
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:18,600
 When my father wants me to do something, boy, I certainly wouldn't let him down.

24
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,600
 What?

25
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,600
 Come on, you sure you feel well?

26
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,000
 Well, I think he's right in the living room there.

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,300
 Oh, yes, sure.

28
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:28,480
 Listen, look at every word we say.

29
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,280
 Thank you, see, you got the window open.

30
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,080
 I don't see him, I'm there.

31
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:35,080
 My mother finally put a foot down on these windows.

32
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:35,920
 What?

33
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,360
 I'm walking outside, and my father's walking inside.

34
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,120
 Only Kayleigh will listen.

35
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,200
 Oh, Murr, what are you whispering about?

36
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,360
 Oh, Father, can we just--

37
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,600
 Oh, you were whispering?

38
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,560
 [LAUGHTER]

39
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,320
 How are you giving us your bra?

40
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,320
 Henry, would you mind not confusing, Homer?

41
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,820
 He could only think of one thing at a time.

42
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:58,120
 Right now, he's supposed to be on the window.

43
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,220
 - Well, Father, can you hear me?

44
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,880
 We can't sound his way home.

45
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:01,720
 - I was?

46
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,720
 - Goodbye, Henry.

47
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:06,660
 If you were that father, Homer.

48
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,240
 - Listen, Homer, suppose I go in

49
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,760
 and have a word with your father.

50
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:10,600
 - What about?

51
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,100
 - You know, when the field was better,

52
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:15,280
 then you're licked before you start.

53
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,440
 And he's putting your finger in the window, son.

54
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,720
 - Well, it's worth a try.

55
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,720
 I knew what.

56
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,720
 Watch it step in.

57
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,720
 He's pretty rigid.

58
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,720
 They'll call me if anything here happens.

59
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,720
 Oh, Mr. Brown, are you watching the window?

60
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,720
 Of course I am.

61
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,720
 And now do you think she is?

62
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,720
 I just want to get the perspective from back here before I saw it.

63
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,720
 Oh, hand me that darn sponge.

64
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:41,720
 Mr. Brown, Mr. Brown, you're quite a fisherman aren't you?

65
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,720
 What then?

66
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:48,720
 Oh, I mean, fishing is good and spring sure, but no you agree there's no month like January.

67
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,560
 For fishing?

68
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,400
 Sure.

69
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,060
 Don't you agree that that's when the fish are biggus?

70
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:53,880
 Yeah?

71
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,400
 Well, they've had some solar to put on waste.

72
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,880
 [LAUGHTER]

73
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,680
 Yes.

74
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,200
 And I will look down at that way.

75
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:00,720
 Sure.

76
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,840
 I'll bet if you went down to Fletcher's pond

77
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,160
 and chopped a hole in the ice, you could catch some whopper.

78
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:06,900
 Yes.

79
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:07,280
 I bet you.

80
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:07,960
 What is that?

81
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,400
 You mean you agree with me, Mr. Brown?

82
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,680
 That a person should take advantage of a thing like that?

83
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,640
 I certainly do.

84
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,880
 Oh, boy.

85
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,400
 Thanks.

86
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:14,900
 Come here.

87
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:15,400
 Come here.

88
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,400
 Come here.

89
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,200
 What is that?

90
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:22,000
 I fixed it over your father and grieze that this is a perfect day for fiction.

91
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 He does.

92
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,800
 Boy, father, you mean they don't have to watch the outside of the windows?

93
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,000
 Of course you do.

94
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 Rock, why?

95
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,800
 And the inside too.

96
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,000
 Listen, Haley, I thought you said.

97
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,600
 And get busy right away.

98
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,000
 I have to speak to your mother.

99
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,240
 Just think, Father, in January.

100
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,600
 Henry, I don't want to speak to you again about your seat.

101
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,240
 Why don't you run along and let me finish?

102
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,200
 My seat, Father.

103
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,760
 Are you afraid they'll get frosted, then?

104
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,200
 I'm afraid they'll get chopped off.

105
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,040
 Oh, sure. I'll stand back.

106
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,680
 Thank you.

107
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:04,160
 Why, look at that ice slide.

108
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,760
 And if you could find time to demo,

109
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,880
 let's talk more regularly.

110
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,320
 The other way you're supposed to.

111
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,720
 The ice wouldn't form like this.

112
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,080
 I realize that, Father.

113
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,360
 And I'll certainly see to it that I do it,

114
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,200
 as you're there.

115
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,240
 Good.

116
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:18,520
 And the sitting of my father had all about it.

117
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,520
 How about what?

118
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,440
 Going fishing.

119
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,360
 I'm sorry, anybody.

120
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,960
 I can't find the time today.

121
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,840
 Couldn't you cap the ice the mother's time?

122
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,040
 Not very well.

123
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,440
 Well, we're calling it Henry.

124
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,400
 I can't get out of it.

125
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,560
 Your mother is keeping an eye on me.

126
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,680
 She is?

127
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,680
 Don't look now, but she's right there in the living room,

128
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,280
 when--

129
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,320
 Oh.

130
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,280
 Hello, mother.

131
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,120
 Henry, I hope you aren't growing up your father.

132
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,720
 Now, whether I'm helping him.

133
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,560
 You are.

134
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,520
 So are now.

135
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,380
 I'm stopping out of it.

136
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:47,880
 There.

137
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,580
 There.

138
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,220
 You want to go to the phone.

139
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:52,720
 Oh, thank you.

140
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,320
 Get in there.

141
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,060
 See, father.

142
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,020
 What are you doing with it?

143
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,320
 You can shop with it.

144
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,520
 Oh, here he comes down at the bone.

145
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,720
 Oh, is it well, Bob?

146
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,420
 Yes, I don't know.

147
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:04,120
 I told you a busy, but he said this is very important.

148
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,420
 Hello.

149
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:06,520
 Hello, Sam.

150
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:09,120
 So why are the day you tied up saying?

151
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,220
 Well, I'm doing a little cleaning up outside.

152
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,520
 Oh, then he's telling you to get out of him.

153
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,520
 Why, as a matter of fact, what's on your mind?

154
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,520
 Sam, what do you say we go fish?

155
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,520
 A dead?

156
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,520
 Well, there's no better months to go fishing with you than anywhere.

157
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,520
 But, well...

158
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:28,520
 You know you're stuck in the hole in the ice, it's been around in the ice, off the air...

159
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,520
 What made you think of that, Will?

160
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:33,520
 I heard somebody talking about it. Come on, Sam, what do you think?

161
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:38,520
 Well, it's a temptation, I'll admit. The only thing is, I have this work I should do.

162
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,520
 Oh, do it tomorrow.

163
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,520
 When you see Alice want a

164
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,080
 Met me. I don't have to do it

165
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:52,320
 Did it work?

166
00:05:52,320 --> 00:06:02,760
 Well, I'll meet you there in 15 minutes

167
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,400
 Mary, who pays the bills around here?

168
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,400
 What's up?

169
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,400
 That is, I think I'll go out and get some some bars.

170
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:26,400
 I'm at all anyway.

171
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,400
 Hi, Mary.

172
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,400
 Is that you, Homer?

173
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,400
 Oh, come here, let's go. Let's go.

174
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,400
 Where?

175
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,400
 See which way you're through.

176
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,400
 This way.

177
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,400
 This way.

178
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,400
 This is a fine time for you to decide that.

179
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,400
 Just when I had to chop up the darn sidewalk for my father.

180
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,400
 Where's your father hiding?

181
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,400
 He didn't hide in any place. He would call the way on a very important conference.

182
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,400
 He was. And besides, I thought you had to stay home and wash windows.

183
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,400
 I don't know.

184
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,400
 I don't know.

185
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:57,400
 I saw him in awesome place. So I saw him in the sun even less.

186
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,400
 Don't hit a wall anyway.

187
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,400
 Oh, you really can't go.

188
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,400
 Well, but you know how long it's taken me to chop this little bit of ice.

189
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,400
 So long.

190
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,400
 Well, it's going to take me a whole day to finish it.

191
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:14,400
 If you thought I'd shoveled his walk once in a while, you wouldn't have all of his eyes.

192
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:20,400
 Oh, good words. What are you eating? A piece of ice, it just flew in.

193
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,400
 (audience laughing)

194
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,400
 Listen, Homer.

195
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:29,400
 Listen, if you think you can stand around all day eating ice when I'm breaking my darn back,

196
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,400
 what are you getting at, Henry?

197
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,400
 The least you could do is help me.

198
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,400
 But why should we both break our back?

199
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,400
 [Laughter]

200
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,400
 Oh, what?

201
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,400
 Maybe we can still go fishing.

202
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,400
 Have you thought of hot water?

203
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,400
 Hot water? Sure.

204
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,400
 You have a home, haven't you?

205
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,400
 What?

206
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,400
 Sure, it's fine.

207
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,400
 You didn't emphasize the no-turn.

208
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:52,400
 Oh, gee, what are we standing on and on for?

209
00:07:52,400 --> 00:08:00,400
 [Music]

210
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,660
 (cheering)

211
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:08,240
 - Hey, deal that phrase, Will.

212
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,740
 - Yes, sir.

213
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:12,240
 - It really keeps you on your toes, doesn't it?

214
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,740
 - Since then, how are you, toes?

215
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,180
 - Oh, they're fine, Sam.

216
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:17,480
 It's gone to my keep wiggling them.

217
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,780
 - Family to saw again, let's see if I can get this whole

218
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:20,620
 a little bigger.

219
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:22,120
 You know, you couldn't catch a middle

220
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,780
 through a whole the size of that.

221
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:25,520
 - The trouble is getting you started, Will.

222
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,920
 - Once I get the saw down in there, we'll be fine.

223
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,360
 - Say, I got an idea.

224
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,360
 You got a pen knife on you?

225
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,360
 Yeah, certainly.

226
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,360
 Here.

227
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,360
 Now if I can just get a little more ice off, I think we can get the floor in there.

228
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,360
 Good idea.

229
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,360
 Yeah, that's getting it, Sam.

230
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,360
 You mind if I run around the bit by you doing that?

231
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,360
 You're not cold, I is.

232
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,360
 Of course not.

233
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,360
 Just a little sip.

234
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,360
 I mean, I will do.

235
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,360
 Alright, clap your arms, Sam.

236
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,360
 Hey, what's that, it's real?

237
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:59,360
 I'm paying the dollars.

238
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,360
 Say, Sam, yes sir.

239
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:06,360
 Sam, did you attack any sentimental value to that ten night?

240
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,360
 Well, you're getting off the truth.

241
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,360
 Well, now don't worry, I'll get it back out.

242
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:14,360
 I have homework come out in the summer and dive for it.

243
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,360
 That's my thing.

244
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:19,360
 Now wait a minute, hand me my line. What for?

245
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,360
 Well, it's got a good big hook on it. I think I can stick around and hook to penknife.

246
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,360
 I doubt it, but here.

247
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:29,460
 But here look you go on clapping Sam. I'll drop this in and then give it a try

248
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:33,160
 Feel anything now

249
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:36,160
 Let's just forget it

250
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,660
 Hey, will get off the ice

251
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:43,760
 I gotta finish look at that shadow under the eye

252
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,960
 Why do I do hand it?

253
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,560
 Don't just stand there, throw the whole figure!

254
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,560
 I can't, but I will have to cut the line.

255
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:02,560
 Don't do something, Sam! Don't do something!

256
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:18,560
 Homework, homework, stop shivering and seeing still.

257
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,560
 Listen here, I'm taking easy.

258
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,560
 You're rubbing the back off me.

259
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,560
 You're circulating again, darling.

260
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,560
 Can't you talk it to you?

261
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,560
 That one feels like sandpaper.

262
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,560
 When I go to the women's closet and get some more towels.

263
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,560
 Is there a link to a loan in your room?

264
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,560
 Look at the sheet on.

265
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,560
 Well, anyway, I'll find you some clothes.

266
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,560
 And all I can say is, the next time you hold the sidewalk,

267
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,560
 I hope you have a little more control.

268
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,560
 Anyways, Homer, it was your own fault.

269
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,560
 Mine's fault, mine's fault.

270
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,560
 You were.

271
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,560
 Then you come right out and say, "Turn the hose over here, Henry!"

272
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,560
 You are here. I didn't say, "Turn the hose on me!"

273
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,560
 And then you jump right in one way.

274
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,560
 [laughter]

275
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,560
 The whole boy knows how I feel about what his car is now.

276
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,560
 It's a nice waterfall, James.

277
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,560
 Well, you know what I was just thinking for?

278
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,560
 See, if it's no fun-tapping life on your own sidewalk,

279
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,560
 think I'm a stupor, it's one of the atoms, what your car is.

280
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,560
 Sure.

281
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:20,360
 See you stand around and wake you back and sing some things come along and play your nice water.

282
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:24,560
 All of these cools and your mix brings you to the line.

283
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,060
 Sure.

284
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:28,760
 And right here at home we've got a fireplace and lots of wood.

285
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,760
 So long.

286
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:34,760
 Then we can sit in front of the fire with a comic book and a skyscraper sandwich.

287
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:35,360
 Sure.

288
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:35,860
 Sure.

289
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:38,360
 Some of them somewhere.

290
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,760
 I'm going to be with...

291
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,760
 I'm going to get a family.

292
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,760
 I'm going to have to...

293
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,760
 I'm going to get a tattoo here.

294
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,760
 Extensive?

295
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,760
 I thought I saw a milli-line.

296
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,760
 What do you want?

297
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,760
 Mother wants to see who's out on the living room.

298
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:55,760
 He does? What's more?

299
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,760
 I don't know. But you better come out down.

300
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,760
 I can't even give me a...

301
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,760
 Mother!

302
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,760
 No, no, no, no. I don't think I've ever been so curious in my life.

303
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,760
 Hey, mother.

304
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,760
 Let's go out the window here.

305
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,760
 Look at the condition of our truck walk.

306
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,360
 Why, good, this is a solid piece of art!

307
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,360
 The person just missed a bell right on his mailbag.

308
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:17,360
 [audience laughter]

309
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,560
 If your father's policy is safe,

310
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:22,160
 then you have all that ice cleaned off today.

311
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,160
 Brother, this is after a gift of power.

312
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,160
 I'll give you my word.

313
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,760
 Wait, wait, please, for good hold on.

314
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,360
 We're going out? You are, dear.

315
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,560
 I want you to go straight out to take this pond

316
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,160
 and, Mother, I've changed my mind.

317
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,160
 What about that?

318
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,160
 I don't want to go to breakfast time anymore.

319
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,560
 Well, I want you to, and you're the ten-year-old father

320
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,560
 to come home immediately.

321
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,560
 Father, the twickers are?

322
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,560
 Yes, dear.

323
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,560
 Mrs. Brown and I are positive.

324
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,560
 That's where they went.

325
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,560
 He's having his cocks on, sir?

326
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,560
 My conference.

327
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,560
 Oh, he is.

328
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,560
 He's standing there.

329
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,560
 He's out there with Mr. Brown.

330
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,560
 This is.

331
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,560
 He is.

332
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,560
 We're all these dogs.

333
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,560
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

334
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:05,560
 Anybody home?

335
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,560
 Hey.

336
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,560
 Hey! Anybody home?

337
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,760
 What is the fire, Mr. S?

338
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,760
 Oh, I'm sorry to be so noisy, but this isn't an emergency.

339
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,560
 - If you're not an act. - I sure.

340
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,960
 You want to come in? No, I can't.

341
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,560
 I have to get back down to flesh and pine.

342
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,360
 What's the trouble?

343
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,060
 My friend and I went down there fishing,

344
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:22,960
 see, and all of a sudden there was this big

345
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,160
 that was splashing around.

346
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,060
 - Under that? - My friend is hanging on

347
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:27,960
 for dear life, and the hole isn't taking off

348
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,960
 the porting out.

349
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,960
 He's all a thing.

350
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,460
 And man, is he struggling.

351
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:33,660
 If we don't get him out fast, we're gonna lose him.

352
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:36,160
 Now look, you find an act around the side on the ground.

353
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,500
 Oh, fine. Thanks a lot.

354
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,000
 You get right down there and don't worry.

355
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 Father, it'll be part of my stupid surprise.

356
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,040
 Get you down to the pond right away.

00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,600
 Where are my boosters back?

358
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:52,000
 Quick, you better get me a rope.

359
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000

 with the eye that preceded only in selling both their father's on the idea

365

 so far the men are having difficulty landing their face and the boys have been sent out

366
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:16,740

367
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,500
 Hurry up with.

368
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,820
 I'm treating the Jack.

369
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:22,980
 Now listen, ma'am, I got up to that farmhouse and back as quick as I could.

370
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:24,100
 Well, at least you've been moving.

371
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:26,220
 Here, you hold the pick right and that needs to come.

372
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,100
 Let's do space.

373
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,820
 Oh boy, it's good to sit down.

00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,460
 I get to sit down the way, Will.

375
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:32,820
 My feet are all right.

00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:35,220
 Let's hurry and get that fish out and get home.

377
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:37,220
 Well, it's a lady of some kind.

378
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:39,220
 Have we seen her?

379
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:40,220
 Oh, ma'am.

380
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:43,220
 Look, Sam, it's a lady of some kind.

 Oh, ma'am.

 What's going on?

384
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,220
 My dad.

385
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,220
 I'm not coming up at the Lord's end of the car.

386
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:53,220
 We've been looking all over and we haven't been able to find anything.

387
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:55,220
 Well, say, we've been here for over an hour.

388
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:57,220
 We haven't seen anybody around here.

389

 I'm seven. I have the toxins in these glands.

 Look, I'm sure it's expected.

00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:01,220
 A car in the sense that I knew.

392
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:02,220
 Why, I thought it was more.

393
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:04,220
 You don't think it's going through up its purchase tree?

394
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:06,220
 Sure, I feel you here.

395
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:07,220
 You must be up there.

396
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:08,220
 I think we did it. Get up there. Right away.

397
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:09,220
 I'll go and get my house.

 We have time. Come on, Will. On your feet.

399
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:13,220
 What's Sam? What about our sick?

400
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:15,220
 We can't worry about that now.

401
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:18,220
 I've aligned this tree over here and we'll come back for it later.

 Oh, are you sure this is what you're talking to?

405
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:40,220
 You're sure you are.

406
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:43,220
 Nothing looks familiar anymore since it started this now.

00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,220
 It's a mystery.

00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:46,220
 You don't find our father here.

 I'm from here.

 Hey, wait.

 You know what I think?

 I think there are lots.

 Summer.

00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:13,020
 Summer, this isn't any basis, a piece of strength.

428
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:15,620
 Now listen, I'm not that mean.

429
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:16,820
 But look, Homer.

430
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,820
 Look, it's trying to achieve.

431
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:20,620
 It is an assembling.

432
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:23,820
 Seriously, it's a white one, so I follow it along.

00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,820
 Except it is re-ggling.

 She lives here right.

00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,820
 What do I think, Summer, is snowing.

436
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:30,820
 What is it?

437
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:32,320
 You go down to a hole in the ice.

438
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,320
 Bring me to a hole.

439
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:33,820
 What?

440
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,520
 There's a structure in the end of it.

441
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,520
 It's great to see it.

442
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,120
 Well, all these do on.

443
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:38,820
 Pull it out.

444
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:39,820
 Pull it out.

445

 The hole is in the middle.

446
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,320
 And if he was hooked up here, I'd let it snow.

00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:44,820
 Why?

448
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:47,320
 And then, I'd say, it's a miracle.

 You're that a hole.

 Well, suppose somebody really had fallen through the ice.

 We had to go, sure.

00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,740
 I was talking more.

532
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:37,460
 All right.

533
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:37,900
 I got him.

534
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:38,460
 The car.

535
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:39,180
 Let's go.

536
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:39,620
 All right.

537
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:40,620
 All right.

538
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:41,620
 Forget it.

539
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:42,780
 Let's forget everything.

540
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:44,900
 Let's just lie down here.

541
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,060
 Move over, Sam.

542
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:48,420
 So I'm thinking we're going to get you some blankets.

543
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:49,340
 Father.

544
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:50,540
 Every coming here.

545
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:51,060
 Good.

546
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:51,580
 They're running you.

547
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:52,580
 They're there.

548
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:56,020
 You're into one of their chesies.

549
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:58,340
 Every.

550
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,340
 When could you get that there?

551
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:00,500
 We found this, Father.

552
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:07,500
 You're a addict, but you're a

553
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:07,500
 But that's what you've got. Sorry, that you and the floor.

554
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:11,500
 Henry, was that safe by any chance?

555
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:16,500
 Side to a tree. What? What do you know about that?

556
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:20,500
 In that case, I'm a guinea pig. You want to have a good look at it, Bob?

557
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:23,500
 It happens. It's that safe. It belongs to Mr. Brown and Denise.

558
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:26,500
 So, now you're still on me. Oh, yes, oh, man.

559
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:29,500
 I'm sorry, boys, but we caught it and we tied the line to the tree.

560
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,620
 But father, even if he did, we landed.

561
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:32,820
 Henry's come day.

562
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:34,820
 I'll tell you what we went through today

563
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:36,020
 because of that thing.

564
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:36,860
 I'll hand it over to you.

565
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:37,960
 But he wins.

566
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:38,860
 Henry's.

567
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:39,860
 Yes, father.

568
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:42,760
 Well, let's see it,

569
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,300
 let's have a good look at it.

570
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,060
 It's near a beauty.

571
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:45,800
 Oh, boy.

572
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,600
 He was late.

573
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,600
 10 pounds.

574
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,600
 8 pounds.

 [LAUGHTER]

576
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,300
 It's all right, too, man.

577
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,300
 Come on, father.

578
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:54,300
 Boy.

579
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,100
 Oh, no.

580
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,940
 Oh, why don't you go along with Henry

581
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,300
 and stop asking questions?

582
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:02,300
 Well, do you think we should know them?

583
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:04,300
 Who? Oh, man.

584
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:06,300
 [ Laughter ]

585
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:07,300
 I'm so proud of you.

586
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:08,300
 All right, all right.

587
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:09,300
 Oh, here. Hold it, please.

588
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,300
 We'll have your right back.

589
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:13,300
 Hey, sure. And, Sam, we ought to take a picture of it, you know.

590
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,300
 Hello?

591
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,300
 Oh, and that's a problem.

592
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,300
 Yes?

593
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,300
 I understand you're a commoner, Steve.

594
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:20,300
 You don't care. My friend and I are a designer.

595
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,300
 It is our best.

596
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:24,300
 Well, what we will do today, I'd like to see anyone else claim that best.

597
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,300
 I understand you're a commoner.

598
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,300
 Our best is the beauty of 10 pounds, man.

599
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:28,800
 Let me tell you how we call it.

600
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,300
 You can tell me all about it in my office at 10 o'clock in the morning.

601
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,800
 - Who is this? - The game was.

602
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,800
 You're not allowed to catch fast and genuinely.

603
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,800
 No way!

604
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:53,500
 Will everyone have another piece of space?

605
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,000
 I will, please.

606
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 I paid enough for it.

607
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,100
 I might as well enjoy it.

608
00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:02,100
 I don't mind a bit you're taking the fix away from me, Todd.

609
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:05,100
 Oh, that's fun. I got something much better.

610
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:07,100
 Who and I was feeding the fix to you and who are you?

611
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:09,100
 What a game for a miracle.

612
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:12,100
 Oh, thanks. Guess what we found inside it, Mother?

613
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,100
 What, dear?

614
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,100
 It's something I've always wanted, a pen knife.

615
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:17,100
 What's done?
