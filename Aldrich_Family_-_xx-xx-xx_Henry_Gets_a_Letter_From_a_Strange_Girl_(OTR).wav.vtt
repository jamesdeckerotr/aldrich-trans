00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
 Thank you for this time, excuse me for men in the armed forces of the United Nations,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
 the special service division of the War Department of the United States

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
 presents a re-broadcast of one of America's most popular radio programs,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 the Aldrich family.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
 And we'll be coming, mother.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:53.720
 Next to actually being young again,

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:59.520
 There's no better way to recap through that feeling than to know a teenage boy like Henry Olgrich.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.720
 Or he acts just like you used to when you were that age.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.720
 And so his troubles become your father.

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.920
 The scene opens at the Olgrich breakfast table.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.520
 And he has led us to you, Sam.

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:11.520
 And another for you.

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.520
 Thank you, Alice.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:13.720
 Henry has won for you.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.120
 For me, mother, for me.

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.320
 Alice has an advertisement from some of her thoughts, Blimmer Lake.

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:19.120
 Really?

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.220
 Father, I certainly hope we aren't going away anyplace this summer.

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:23.320
 Wait, certainly or not.

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.820
 and I agree with both of you.

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.720
 Oh, you know what I'm gonna do.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.700
 This thing is a matter.

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:29.820
 Henry, what's the matter?

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:30.660
 Nothing, mother.

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.460
 I was just reading a sweater.

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.900
 No, it really did you care.

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.260
 Yeah, you were only.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:36.940
 Huh.

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.600
 Father, what about working at any of the rest of this sweater?

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.740
 Could you make out this word right here?

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.440
 Well, I, um, that's Cindy.

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.040
 Oh, yes, of course.

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.140
 I thought it was friendly.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:47.980
 Mother!

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:48.820
 Yes, Mary.

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:49.980
 I'm gonna help her, maybe this morning.

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:50.820
 No, dear.

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.520
 Oh, oh, you got letter from?

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.320
 - Why, it's just hardly anything.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.040
 - Mary, will you please stop trying to read over my shoulder?

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.000
 - Every all I was doing was innocently looking to see

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 whether you'd open one of mine that is by mistake.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 - Well, I haven't.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.840
 You don't even know who this was from.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:05.680
 - Hi, Mary.

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.000
 Are you a few requests for it?

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.440
 - Oh, where did you come from?

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.080
 - Johnson, tell me, tell me, tell me.

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.080
 - Hi, Mr. O, which one of these are five?

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.920
 - What, then?

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.560
 - Go ahead, it has one next to you.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:15.840
 - Oh, but when you please take that bag

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:16.680
 from under my nose.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.000
 - Oh, excuse me.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.320
 Oh, I couldn't eat a little.

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.920
 Henry, you look me as your egg.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.000
 We have a little piece of flood down the side.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.680
 Mrs. Aller, you may know.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:25.520
 - Oh.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.520
 - Mother, could I speak with Homer confidently

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.520
 out in the hole with (indistinct)

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.480
 Do you have any thought of your breakfast?

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:31.960
 Mother, my engine's hot.

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:35.440
 Say, I mean, it's not cold enough for me to eat my,

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.720
 I'd like to talk to Homer about this,

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.080
 about a certain matter.

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.480
 And will you be right there?

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.040
 Yes, Mother, I'll be out of here in the hole

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.560
 for exactly two minutes or not.

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:44.880
 One second long.

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:45.720
 - What is it, Mary?

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.040
 - Is it a report card turned?

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.160
 - Oh, my hooky.

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.000
 - So what?

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.840
 - I'm a girl.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:50.680
 - A whole weekie.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.680
 I don't know. What do you mean you don't know? I know if you have the one out of the city.

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:01.680
 What do you say? Dear Henry Olga, I suppose you think I am very bold right in your

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.680
 boring letter like this, but I'm simply so bored I can't help it.

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.680
 Or what's the matter with it? I guess you know your friend Nancy Adams who was visiting here,

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.680
 and yesterday he happened to film in her school yearbook, and I said, "Who's that

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:15.940
 Who's that picture?

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.060
 He said, "Why that's can reality."

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.680
 And I said, "It's such a boring day.

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.100
 I'm going to write to you."

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.860
 And he said, "All right, I dare you."

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.300
 And I said, "All right, and here I am.

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:26.140
 What's that?"

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.500
 "All go on probably no way before doing it."

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:29.500
 "Can we let you down?"

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.260
 "Oh, will you please take your hands off?"

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:32.660
 All I want to do is read it.

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:34.340
 In the first place, Homer,

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.900
 some of it is confident leading some more.

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.700
 Leading some more.

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.740
 He says, "You could certainly be glad, Henry.

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:44.020
 You don't live in this boring place.

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:49.780
 It's friendly. I mean, I can hardly wait until summer comes, and we've got a beautiful

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.100
 light cat for two when there is something doing every minute.

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.820
 Who are you going to be this summer?

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:56.460
 Yes, mother.

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:59.180
 Yes, mother.

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.980
 Can I be eating the rest of this?

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:06.020
 Public property.

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:07.980
 I'm coming right now, mother.

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.820
 And boy, mother, what do you think your father said a little while ago was a good

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:17.420
 idea what he said about blood Henry about ongoing away this summer when did I say

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:19.380
 we were going away I thought you said

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:25.300
 see father those things are places going boring in the summer sorry I don't do

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.580
 you like it here mother would see it it's what's

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:34.340
 and the summer I think we ought to go the right path but then they passed the

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.060
 You never heard of it.

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.060
 I'm Homer.

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.260
 I'm assuming it don't have anything.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:40.660
 I could be looking around.

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:41.300
 No.

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:42.700
 Now, Henry Homer is your guest.

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:43.940
 You go find him a magazine.

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.220
 Yes, well, we'll get it for him, either way.

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.180
 And mother, it's like past the two.

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.340
 There's something doing practically every minute.

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.580
 Well, there's nothing wrong with our whole life here.

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.980
 Hey Henry, let me see just one more page of it.

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:57.260
 OK, Homer, it's just promise not to handle.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.900
 Where were we?

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.140
 At like past the two.

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:00.340
 Oh, yeah.

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:01.420
 Here's a good part.

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:02.940
 The way this was good.

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.640
 It is raining out and has been all day.

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:08.040
 The fact it's been raining most of this week.

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.740
 Is it raining in Centerville?

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:11.300
 Isn't it seeing this?

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.440
 If there's one thing I find boring,

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:17.200
 it's a sit indoors all day with nothing to do when it's raining.

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.360
 That's very interesting.

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.900
 - Hi, Kathleen Anderson.

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.440
 Why don't you want a telephone?

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:22.960
 - Oh, me, Mary.

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.320
 Oh, well, hello, I can't talk with her.

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:26.880
 I'm very busy right now.

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:27.720
 - Hold on, Henry.

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:28.840
 Why do you keep stopping?

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:29.680
 - Why?

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:30.680
 - She goes on and says,

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.680
 Naturally, I am asking you all about yourself.

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.240
 And Nancy tell me your very interesting.

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.400
 Do you please promise to write?

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.400
 Please, oh, please, oh, please.

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:41.240
 Oh, boy.

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.160
 I hope I have not bore you.

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:48.760
 As ever-- as ever in this journey, yes?

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:50.640
 Homer, can you make that first name now?

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:51.920
 Let's see.

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:54.000
 I can figure out the last name, OK?

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:54.680
 You can.

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:55.280
 Yeah.

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:56.640
 Three-quarter.

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:57.800
 Three-quarter?

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.160
 That's what it looks like to me.

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.760
 Oh, there are two always in there. Could it be drop water?

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:07.260
 Well, I see what that middle letter is in the first name of Steve.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:11.860
 See? Could it be Walter? Walter? Walter drop water.

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:13.860
 Why would a girl have that name?

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:17.660
 I can't see what it is. It's just as clear as day. It's Myrtle.

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:21.660
 Oh. Oh. Myrtle drop water.

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:24.960
 Can we turn it frankly? Do you think you want a right to her?

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:27.160
 Oh, no! It's because...

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:28.580
 Just because...

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:31.820
 And beside Coma that isn't old in the last name, it's an odd.

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:32.320
 Oh, why?

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:33.620
 It's drip water.

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:35.620
 Drip, seal or not drop?

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:37.620
 No wonder you had the wrong impression of it.

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:39.560
 Drip, drip, and then...

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:40.460
 Yes, mother!

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:43.560
 When you feed the last in the kitchen, get your father drink of water...

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:45.000
 A drink of...

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:45.960
 Who was that thing?

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:46.460
 Why?

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:47.820
 It's Myrtle Drinkwater.

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:49.560
 Isn't that a beautiful name?

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:53.560
 [Music]

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:57.060
 [Music]

00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:01.060
 [Music]

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:05.060
 Sam, I don't like to bother you, but I do have something I like to talk over with you.

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:06.060
 Yes, but the trouble.

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:09.060
 Oh, it's about Henry. He's been so upset ever since he got another letter this morning.

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:13.060
 And about a half an hour ago, he asked whether I did anything he could have his allowance in clean.

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:14.060
 Come on, guys.

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:16.060
 Yes, Mary. Did you know Henry got another letter this morning?

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:19.060
 Yes, we know all about it. Mary, turn around.

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:22.060
 What's wrong? Here, I think you ought to go down to the hairdresser.

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:26.060
 Mother, I'll do it. She said that matter was from some loan company. Mary, what's that?

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:26.780
 What's that?

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:28.020
 What did you say with Palm Mary?

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:29.420
 A loan company in Avoc City.

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:31.220
 I saw it right up on top of the page.

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:33.340
 And then he came to me and asked if he could borrow some money.

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:34.340
 And he was all excited.

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:35.340
 Yes.

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:36.340
 Father.

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:37.340
 Then what do you say, does it matter?

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:39.300
 Come on, see you along for--

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:40.300
 Oh.

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:41.940
 Oh, hello, Mary.

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:42.700
 Hello, Mother.

00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:43.540
 Hello.

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:44.540
 Hello.

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:48.540
 Well, this is nice that we can play together.

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:50.940
 We really film and get together.

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:51.740
 And right.

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:52.980
 Yes, Father.

00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:54.580
 What was it you came in here to say?

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:56.880
 Boy, I'm trying to bother.

00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:58.240
 Oh, boy, I was in the door.

00:07:58.240 --> 00:07:59.520
 I knew that problem isn't--

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:00.260
 No, it isn't, mother.

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:01.480
 I think it's someone that's seen me.

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:04.200
 I'm sort of a business arrangement.

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:06.320
 Oh, my, how I tried to come in.

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:07.320
 What's the idea?

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:08.200
 What's what I did?

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:09.520
 I'm keeping your door locked.

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:11.240
 How do you expect your friends to come in?

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:13.600
 Wait, my father asked us to keep the rock every morning

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:15.000
 until he goes to the office.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:15.560
 What's in home?

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:17.080
 I think that's a 35-10.

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:17.920
 Yes, dear.

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:18.840
 Now, where's the land?

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:20.240
 Why do you turn it to me?

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:20.740
 Oh, no.

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:22.280
 I didn't say I'd let you read it.

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:23.480
 I said, I'd read it to me.

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:25.040
 What did she say? What did she say?

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:26.720
 Don't push me, Loma.

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:29.600
 Because my dear head, oh boy,

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:32.800
 I received your 14-page letter and it was a wiz.

00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:34.660
 Oh, I have a mind, Loma.

00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:37.480
 I hope you'll excuse my losing my father's business,

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:39.600
 stationary, but my newspaper with this

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:42.320
 and every of the wiz hasn't come yet.

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:44.480
 You'll have me to describe myself,

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:46.400
 and I'll do the best I can.

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:48.280
 Although there are some things I can say

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:51.280
 because you would think I was terribly confused.

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:54.360
 First of all, I am five feet nine.

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:55.800
 Thomas, about to be nine.

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:57.960
 He was in the only five feet eight.

00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:59.920
 I think you're quarter, Homer.

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:02.640
 Besides, I didn't know I had to say it was clear as day.

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:04.040
 Looks like a learning to me.

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:04.880
 Scoring.

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:08.680
 I am five feet two and have rather pleasing eyes, I think.

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:11.480
 Otherwise, you would at times, my eye lashes weren't quite

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:14.840
 so long because they were always somehow getting in my way.

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:16.160
 What did you have to do, Tom?

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:18.600
 And Thomas, that's a roughing.

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:20.360
 After the color of my eye,

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:22.860
 I was here to judge for yourself.

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:24.380
 Some boys say they are gray.

00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:26.340
 Some boys say they are green.

00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:27.340
 Let's do that.

00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:29.300
 We can have your toys.

00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:32.300
 Homer, lots of things say color and different lights.

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:33.140
 Where was I?

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:33.980
 Right here.

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:35.020
 What color were you having?

00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:36.260
 Oh yes.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.180
 As tonight here, which is black,

00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:40.620
 I have recently had done into a feather cut.

00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:43.140
 What does a whiz, even if I do say so?

00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:43.980
 - Henry.

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:44.820
 - Yes, mother.

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:45.660
 Are you busy?

00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:46.500
 - White.

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:48.120
 I'm carrying out a little transact

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:49.620
 and you might say with Homer.

00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:51.920
 - Well, Mary, I stayed with you right now, mother.

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:54.080
 - Listen, here you have me for your convenience.

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:54.920
 - I'll be back.

00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:56.960
 This is what you want for 35, friend.

00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:57.800
 - Henry?

00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:58.640
 - Yes, mother.

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:01.620
 - Dear, I just want you to know that if you really need money

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:03.840
 and would be willing to tell your father what you needed for,

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:06.000
 he might seem to be way greater helping you out.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:06.840
 - Thanks.

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:08.840
 - Mother, I appreciate your bringing it up,

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:11.960
 but you've got so many things on your mind.

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:14.640
 I'd say you would be better than I just didn't bother you.

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:16.120
 - Well, if you're not, if I'm not gonna point

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:17.880
 with your head yesterday, someday this week,

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:18.880
 no, not at all.

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:21.280
 - You're Henry, pass me an attitude phone you again.

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:22.180
 She's in.

00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:24.680
 She was our main Senate Bill girl, but just before it.

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:25.520
 - Henry.

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:27.400
 - You're a phone where I'm coming.

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:29.680
 Mary, are you going in the hands of her today?

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:31.560
 Hey, why don't you give a feather cut?

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:32.920
 Boy, that's hard to the wind.

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:34.080
 - A feather cut, Henry.

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:36.040
 I thought I let my hands go this way.

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:36.880
 - Henry.

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:37.840
 - I'm coming, Homer.

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:38.680
 Where was I?

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:40.880
 - She just got me a hand pool or something.

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:41.720
 You're crazy.

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:43.080
 You're where I stopped.

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:46.680
 But I think your idea of phoning me is a win.

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:49.880
 I'll probably be thrilled when I hear that old telephone ring.

00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:52.380
 Your case or a murder drink water?

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:54.980
 You know, it's her new really drink water.

00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:55.980
 Why not?

00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:56.980
 Why?

00:10:56.980 --> 00:10:58.780
 You think she could be partying again?

00:10:58.780 --> 00:10:59.980
 Now what's from Homer?

00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:01.980
 What's that at the bottom of the page?

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:03.980
 I think it was I hadn't seen that.

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:04.980
 Huh.

00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:06.980
 Instead of your phoning me,

00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:10.380
 why don't I phone you if I never know where I'm going to be next?

00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:12.680
 So I'll call you outside and take five of that.

00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:14.980
 You need to leave my money and we'll give it back to you.

00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:16.280
 No, Homer, I will not.

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:20.280
 Suppose he called me correct. Don't you think you expect me to be a gentleman?

00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:23.880
 Well, if I were to keep it, can I be here when we call?

00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:25.080
 No, Homer.

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:26.680
 Oh, I just think.

00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:29.880
 Tomorrow I hear Myrtle's voice from the first time.

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:41.680
 - Santa, have you thought anything more about our going away this summer?

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:43.280
 - At least I thought we decided not to go.

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:44.080
 - Mother!

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:44.880
 - Yes, Henry!

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:46.320
 What time of a now?

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:48.960
 It's exactly what it very surprised.

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:50.320
 Thank you, Father.

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:52.840
 I'd like to take a cottage someplace for a couple of weeks.

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:54.120
 I'm sure I have no objection.

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:55.320
 Yeah, there's somebody.

00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:56.640
 I can't remember who it was.

00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:59.720
 They said something about Lake Pastor II being a nice place to go.

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:01.000
 Lake Pastor II?

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:01.920
 Somebody named it.

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:04.160
 In the last couple of days, he said it was wonderful.

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:06.720
 Father, are you enjoying your watch this ride?

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:07.600
 I'm positive.

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:10.720
 Would you please tell me why you asked what time it is every 60 seconds?

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:14.640
 The reason, Father, I was just waiting for it to be five o'clock.

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:16.940
 Henry, why do you have your new Bluetooth on?

00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:19.340
 Well, he wouldn't think I got that on.

00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:20.640
 This is a phone phone, oh boy.

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:22.640
 Henry, good luck.

00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:24.640
 You was looking back here, dear man.

00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:25.140
 Henry.

00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:26.040
 I'm sorry, Father.

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:27.340
 I'll pick it up when I come back.

00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:28.540
 Father, just say where you are.

00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:29.840
 Please, I beg of you.

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:31.140
 Henry, what's the matter with you?

00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:32.640
 Nothing, Mother, it's just a...

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:34.340
 Come on, why won't you listen?

00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:35.140
 What's that?

00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:36.640
 Who is that you?

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:38.640
 Get off the line, the phone will be a play.

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:40.140
 You're on calling you.

00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:41.240
 Have you found yet?

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:43.140
 No, why won't you point your hand off?

00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:44.740
 I'll say and I'll be right over.

00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:46.000
 No, you're not to come over.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.480
 I don't want you even around here.

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:50.280
 I think I'm going to be talking to her on my 35th day.

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:52.640
 Oh, please, what's the reason?

00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:54.720
 Look, if I'll tell you something,

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:55.980
 she said no letter this morning.

00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:57.480
 Will you say where you are?

00:12:57.480 --> 00:12:58.480
 Is it any good?

00:12:58.480 --> 00:12:59.320
 Sure, it isn't.

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:02.220
 So I said it better than any telephone conversation would be.

00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:04.120
 Well, all right.

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:06.800
 She says you want me to come to a bound map.

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:07.620
 Come on.

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:08.920
 To a what?

00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:10.160
 To a bound map.

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:11.760
 That's a map to Ray party.

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:13.260
 I went to have a study.

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:14.860
 - Hey, what do you think it's safe?

00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:16.100
 - What do you mean, say?

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:17.420
 - Are you going Henry?

00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:18.700
 - No, I'm going.

00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:19.540
 - Henry?

00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:20.360
 - Yes, mother.

00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:21.200
 - Here you have to hang up right this minute.

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:22.040
 - I will.

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:23.640
 Homer, my mother says I have to hang up

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:24.480
 and I guess she's right.

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:25.320
 Goodbye.

00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:26.640
 - Henry.

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:28.440
 - Hey, mother, did you save my life?

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:29.960
 - Yeah, I want you to jump on your bicycle

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:31.880
 and go right down to the meat market.

00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:35.120
 Mr. Phil, as I, as I, hello.

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:35.960
 - Number three.

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:37.480
 - Operator, this is Henry, all the guests.

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:40.320
 I'm expecting a very important call from Abbott City City.

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:42.720
 When it comes to this little after the picture stop.

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:45.300
 (upbeat music)

00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:55.960
 Hey Mr. Wilson, Mr. Wilson.

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:56.960
 - Why there, Henry?

00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:58.280
 - Now my mother's me, Freddie.

00:13:58.280 --> 00:13:59.280
 - It is right here.

00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:00.280
 - Good boy, Frank.

00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:02.200
 Can the telephone call come for me?

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:03.960
 - No, not 'cause I've been on duty.

00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:06.120
 - Yeah, I'm expecting an important call.

00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:07.440
 But boy, that feels right now.

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:08.960
 - You better let me ask her, please.

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:10.960
 Well, keep a teller right here, won't you?

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:12.960
 Hello? Henry?

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:13.960
 How are you?

00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:16.960
 I'm glad I guess I got here just the right time, didn't I?

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:18.960
 How are we just going distance?

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:19.960
 It is not. Henry?

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:22.960
 Well, how about you? What's something that happened to him?

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:23.960
 And something happened to who?

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:24.960
 He's calling me.

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:25.960
 I am.

00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:29.960
 As long as you're downtown, I want you to run over to the Haven's drug store and get some cigars for me.

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:30.960
 No.

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:31.960
 And hurry home. Goodbye.

00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:32.960
 What's wrong with you?

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:34.960
 Hey, boy.

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:36.960
 What's the one who want to all this food call come for me?

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:39.440
 come for me because you could you tell them they can catch me or would you

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:40.800
 haven't dropped store?

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:43.800
 I don't know why I couldn't. What's the name of the party's calling?

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:46.320
 Her name is Myrtle Joyce. Why?

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:48.600
 Well, don't do that for me.

00:14:48.600 --> 00:15:00.960
 Alice? Yes, Sam.

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:02.720
 Did you call to Havens and leave that message?

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:06.120
 Yes, I did. But was it you started to say about Lake Pazepu?

00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:09.680
 Only that I'd heard of someone downtown who owns a couple of parishes up there.

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:13.720
 Oh, that's fine, Sam, because I don't know whether it's just one of my pre-manations or not,

00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:17.120
 but it seems to me if we forget Henry Awaison this town this summer,

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:18.880
 he might not have quite so many problems.

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:19.760
 Yes.

00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:21.840
 And goes the telephone again. I'll see you at it.

00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:24.360
 It's Henry telling the police, honey.

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:25.120
 Hello?

00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:26.560
 Is this Elm, 303?

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:27.120
 It is?

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:30.680
 This is Long Distance. I have a call from out of city, so it's a Henry Aldrich.

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:32.760
 Henry Aldrich isn't here right now.

00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:34.480
 May I ask who to call it from?

00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:36.780
 Why, it's a party by the name of Drinkwater.

00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:39.280
 Drinkwater? Oh, thank you.

00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:40.580
 And who was it?

00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:42.180
 Someone from Abbot City, but the name of...

00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:44.080
 Alice, I know who that was calling him.

00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:45.380
 I know exactly who that was.

00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:47.080
 Who? A fellow by the name of Drinkwater.

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:49.380
 And he's connected with that lone company over at Abbot City

00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:50.680
 that him has been getting letters from.

00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:51.680
 Oh, my goodness!

00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:06.440
 Mr. Behaven, are you too busy to wait on me?

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:07.540
 I guess not, Henry.

00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:09.640
 This person's a phone call coming for me.

00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:10.740
 Yes, two of them.

00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:12.120
 Two more guests, sir?

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:13.640
 No, they were both from your mother.

00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:15.660
 He wants you to get a quart of milk at the grocery

00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:17.960
 and then stop at the cleaners and pick up your father's soup.

00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:18.760
 Oh, keep waiting.

00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:19.320
 Oh, boy.

00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:19.880
 Just a minute.

00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:21.400
 Now, wrap your father's cigars for you.

00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:24.120
 I'm expecting your call from a girl

00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:25.840
 and it's coming here to your drugstore.

00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:26.440
 That's right.

00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:29.200
 There's a big math grade over in Abbott City tomorrow, and I--

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:30.440
 And either way, I'm going to wear it.

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:30.880
 No.

00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:32.200
 It can better unfold, you.

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:33.200
 What's that?

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:35.920
 Oh boy, Mr. Heyman, could I have to your phone? It's probably.

00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:36.920
 What must be?

00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:39.040
 Hello, is this long distance?

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:39.480
 Hello.

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:40.280
 Oh, Marty?

00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:42.840
 Hello, could you work up a bottle of paragord right away?

00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:51.040
 Hello?

00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:52.400
 Hello?

00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:54.600
 Hello, Addison Market and Loan Company.

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:56.800
 May I speak with Mr. Drinkwater, please?

00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:59.320
 I'm sorry, but Mr. Drinkwater is hidden right now.

00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:02.880
 Well, could you tell me whether my son has been trying to borrow money

00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:06.280
 or old you any what's the name and they are already

00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:10.120
 all well we are allowed to get our confidence in this

00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:12.360
 I know but he's my son and he's

00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:15.560
 I'm sorry you're happy to get the drink out of personally

00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:19.200
 and here's it is I see well thank you bye bye

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:21.600
 - Then how much was Henry old? - He wouldn't tell me.

00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:23.700
 She said, "As a matter of fact, I know what I'll do."

00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:25.200
 - What, Sam? - Now, when any comes in,

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:26.600
 don't say one word about anything.

00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:29.200
 - You don't think he should? - I got to drive over to Abbott City

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:31.000
 on some other business in the next few days, anyhow,

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:32.800
 and I'll drop in and have a talk with drink water.

00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:33.600
 - Really?

00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:35.200
 - When did an I-your father say Abbott's

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:36.800
 gonna be a very cold for a man race?

00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:37.800
 When did you get there?

00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:40.200
 - Okay, I wasn't qualified. - Henry, I was simply

00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:42.800
 talking about going over to Abbott City sometimes.

00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:43.800
 - Oh. - That's all.

00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:45.800
 - That's enough time.

00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:48.200
 - Father, do you have any ideas of,

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:50.200
 to say when you might be driving over.

00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:52.200
 Oh, any time in the next few days?

00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:56.200
 Well, they have absolutely good movies over there sometimes.

00:17:56.200 --> 00:18:00.200
 Wouldn't you like to take Mother and go over to Mar and I can have a good time?

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:02.200
 He's out of the night? Yes, you are.

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:04.200
 And I might go along with you.

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:06.200
 Well, we'll see. We'll take it over.

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:07.200
 Oh, there it is.

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:09.200
 That's Henry with you. Please, walk.

00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:10.200
 Why don't you want to miss him?

00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:12.200
 Well, here's Henry.

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:13.200
 Hey, what's the matter?

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:15.200
 You think Mother, I just went into the telephone table.

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:17.200
 Well, get up off that floor.

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:19.200
 I can talk right down here.

00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:23.200
 Hello, Henry. What did you say?

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:27.200
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:33.200
 I came in and see if you found that costume for me.

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:35.200
 Oh, yes, Henry. Here it is.

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:36.200
 It's Lieutenant uniform.

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:38.200
 Is your last Confederate outfit I have in the place?

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:40.200
 Yes, that's exactly what I wanted.

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:42.200
 That'll be $2.

00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:44.200
 $2? Just for 24 hours?

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:45.200
 That's right.

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:46.200
 That's right.

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:49.560
 Couldn't you let me have us play a dollar or a dollar and a half?

00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:51.560
 If I bring it back, why should I?

00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:55.400
 Well, how would you like to go as an 1890 policeman for a dollar-dendly five?

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:56.600
 I don't think it might.

00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:58.600
 My girl tried to get me by phone yesterday.

00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:02.040
 I mean, we couldn't get together and I saw in a hotel room that I'd be there the matter

00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:03.040
 of the Confederate phone.

00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:04.040
 Yeah.

00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:06.040
 She'd like to get as well as a policeman, wouldn't she?

00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:09.680
 No, I think you can never met, and I don't want to confuse her.

00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:13.520
 So, Mr. Johnson, do I get a sword with that for two dollars?

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:18.520
 I want M787.

00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:19.520
 M787.

00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:20.520
 Yes, please.

00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:25.520
 Mr. Johnson, do I understand correctly if 50 cents left without the forward?

00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:27.520
 Hello, have a moment, biggie.

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:33.520
 Father, I think you said that I had a fan of coat pants and sword, a third piece for two and a half dollars.

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:34.520
 What's that?

00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:35.520
 Just for one night.

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:36.520
 Who is it?

00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:37.520
 It's your son, Helen.

00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:42.520
 I have a chance to go to a costume board and I just have General Lee for two and a half dollars.

00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:48.560
 dollars. When the sword two dollars without good. Only don't try to get

00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:57.240
 somebody from a stranger. Where will I get it from me? Goodbye. Mr. Johnson I can take it.

00:19:57.240 --> 00:20:02.280
 Mr. Johnson where are you? Henry how do I look? What's in that card? What are you doing with that

00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:07.120
 uniform all? I'm gonna rid it. Eddie I've already said that you have not. Eddie give me that.

00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:08.920
 Now listen, Henry, you take your hands off that.

00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:10.120
 What do you stop listening?

00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:11.720
 Now wait boys, what's the idea?

00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:13.520
 Mr. Johnson, I want this uniform.

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:15.320
 Mr. Johnson, I said I say it.

00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:16.920
 Well, Henry's right, Ed.

00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:17.920
 Don't give it to me, Ed.

00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:19.920
 Henry, for the last time, take your hands off me.

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:21.920
 You bet he's drawing your hair.

00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:22.520
 Hey, stop.

00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:23.320
 Now listen, Henry.

00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:25.920
 Now wait boys, let's not have another war over this.

00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:28.920
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:37.200
 How you feel, Henry?

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:38.440
 All right.

00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:41.240
 Here, put this cloth on your other eye.

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:43.040
 Boy, did you take a beating.

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:45.000
 Well, I got the costume, didn't I?

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.360
 I mean, that's corny, doesn't look so hot either.

00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:48.280
 Where's the costume?

00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:49.280
 Let me put it on.

00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:51.320
 It's still down at Mr. Johnson.

00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:53.240
 After we got for a week that he thought it would look

00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:55.640
 a little better if he gave it a brushing and a brushing.

00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:56.480
 - Thank you.

00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:57.320
 - Yes, mother.

00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:58.160
 - Mr. Medical, are you?

00:20:58.160 --> 00:20:59.000
 - Oh, for me?

00:20:59.000 --> 00:20:59.840
 Yes.

00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:01.280
 Are you quite sure you can yellin' up

00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:02.760
 to go to that dancing idea?

00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:04.480
 Look, I never felt better in my life.

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:06.480
 You know that, Dr. Paul?

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:07.480
 Homer, why?

00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:09.080
 This is the front of the fence, bro.

00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:10.280
 You're looking right at it.

00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:11.480
 Oh, yeah.

00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:14.580
 You can dial it and reload it to you with your eyes,

00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:15.680
 feeling the way they do.

00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:18.480
 Now, Homer, I can read it perfectly all right.

00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:22.780
 And dear Henry, as long as I know exactly what you're going to look like,

00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:25.680
 I think it is only fair that you know what I'm going to wear.

00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:28.480
 And so I'm enclosing a photograph of me and my costume.

00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:29.480
 Where is it?

00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:29.980
 Where is it?

00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:30.980
 There it is.

00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:31.480
 Hi, kid.

00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:32.480
 Oh, boy.

00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:33.480
 Oh, boy.

00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:36.480
 Let me see that child boy him waiting for you.

00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:38.480
 Come on, I got to knock you down soon.

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:39.480
 Take a look at her.

00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:41.480
 Boy, is that a sight for sure?

00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:42.480
 I...

00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:44.480
 He was home with us.

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:45.480
 Is that...

00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:46.480
 Yeah, Penrose.

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:47.480
 Metal drink water.

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:49.480
 No, but he looks like a medical.

00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:50.480
 No, but...

00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:52.480
 Look at that face.

00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:55.480
 Can you think that might be a mask that goes with the costume?

00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:56.480
 No, homeward's real.

00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:57.480
 Hey, man.

00:21:57.480 --> 00:21:58.480
 Yes, father.

00:21:58.480 --> 00:21:59.480
 You better be ready to go over with me.

00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:00.480
 I'm leaving in a few minutes.

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:01.980
 to Abbott City?

00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:02.980
 Yes.

00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:04.980
 Well, he's going for his father.

00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:07.480
 Frankly, I don't think I'll be going to that day.

00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:08.080
 You're not going?

00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:08.580
 Why not?

00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:10.780
 He just had some bad news, Mr. Alden.

00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:12.680
 And you're just saying you aren't going?

00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:15.480
 Mother Mike, my eyes are sort of tired.

00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:18.280
 I don't think I'd want to go over there and train them.

00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:19.980
 Well, I'd like to better get your things on.

00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:22.080
 Then I don't think I want to take that tippy down.

00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:23.880
 I know, but Alice, I've got to go over there

00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:25.380
 and keep that appointment with--

00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:27.280
 Well, you do right on over and taping.

00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:29.280
 Mother, if anybody's home for me to see me,

00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:31.280
 I thought you wanted to go there.

00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:33.280
 Someone told me that afternoon we wouldn't know.

00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:35.280
 I thought you wanted to go there.

00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:37.280
 Someone told me that afternoon we wouldn't know.

00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:39.280

00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:47.280
 I thought you wanted to go there.

00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:49.280
 I thought you wanted to go there.

00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:51.280
 I thought you wanted to go there.

00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:53.280
 I thought you wanted to go there.

00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:55.280
 I thought you wanted to go there.

00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:57.280
 I thought you wanted to go there.

00:22:57.280 --> 00:23:01.880
 There's no one told me that afternoon we wouldn't like it. There was a white path to love.

00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:04.080
 Why in the world do you want to go to that place?

00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:06.780
 Well, that's what I'd like to know. They say it's simply changing.

00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:07.280
 I mean...

00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:11.780
 Well, what I'd like to know is what I'm driving all the way over to Abbott City alone for.

00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:22.280
 Hello? Hello?

00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:23.480
 Hi, Henry. Is it you?

00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:24.380
 Yes, it's okay.

00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:28.180
 Ed Carney, I just wanted to tell you why father went down ahead and talk to Mr. Johnson.

00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:30.580
 I'm going to wear that Confederate uniform after all.

00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:33.580
 You are to the mass-grade Mavic city.

00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:34.080
 Sure.

00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:35.280
 And you're going there.

00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:36.080
 Once I am.

00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:38.180
 And if you show up, I'll knock your block off.

00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:40.980
 Hey, as a matter of fact, let me give you a sip.

00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:44.580
 If you get bored, look around for a girl in a murder-like drink water.

00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:47.280
 She's got a feather bob and boy sees a wind.
