00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.600
 You know something, your coffee dollars last longer when you buy instant

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:12.480
 sycra coffee because a jar of the new improved instant sycra costs a good

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.560
 third less than a pound of most ground coffees. It costs less and it gives you

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:22.640
 more. Besides a new wonderful flavor, instant sycra offers you freedom from

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.400
 caffeine effect and if the caffeine and coffee upset your nerves or sleep you

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.960
 You know what a priceless advantage that is.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:30.960
 Try it.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.400
 Economical instant-sica coffee.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:43.640
 Hello, everybody.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.640
 Now America's red letter desserts present.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:47.640
 Henry!

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.640
 Henry Oldridge.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:49.640
 Coming, mother.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:50.640
 Yes, it's the Oldridge family.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.640
 [applause]

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.640
 Yes, it's the old hit family.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.640
 Based on characters originated by Professor Goldsmith and starring Ezra Stone as Henry with Jackie Kelke as Homer.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.640
 And yes, it's the Jell-O family. America's red letter dessert.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:08.640
 [music]

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:15.640
 Oh, the big red letter stand for Jell-O family. Oh, the big red letter stand for Jell-O family.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.640
 That's Jell-O, yum-yum-yum.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.640
 ♪ Tell the warnings, yum yum yum ♪

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.640
 ♪ Jell-a-tack, bioca planning, chassery ♪

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.640
 And now for the Aldrich family.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:34.640
 It's late afternoon and the scene opens in the Aldrich front hall.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.640
 Henry, I just spoke to Mal and Patrick on the phone

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.640
 and she wants to know if you're coming to her weekend skating park.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.640
 - Sure I'm coming, Mary. - Well, she asked me to make up a list.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.640
 Who are you going to take?

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.340
 Just put a question mark down temporarily.

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:49.740
 You have nast anybody?

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.140
 Oh sure, I've asked.

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:52.340
 Anita Swanson.

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.640
 Whose father owns the supermarket on Elm Street?

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:55.140
 Yeah.

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.140
 What are you doing?

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.340
 I'm putting her name down.

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:58.340
 Oh, wait, Mary.

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.840
 There's just one fly in the ointment.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:01.640
 What's that?

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:02.640
 Her father.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.640
 He has to approve of whoever takes her.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:06.740
 What are you doing?

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.040
 Crossing her off.

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.040
 Well, Mary, don't be so hasty.

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:11.040
 Mother!

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:12.540
 I'm in the kitchen, Henry!

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.440
 Excuse me, Mary.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.740
 If Anita doesn't work out Henry, you can always ask the mother girl.

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.340
 Mary, every girl has a father.

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:20.940
 What is it, Henry?

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.840
 Mother, would you mind if I ask you a frank question?

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.340
 How frank?

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:26.540
 Very frank.

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.840
 Are you sure it isn't something you'd rather ask your father?

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.940
 Mother, I think you're right. I'll ask him.

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:32.940
 Father!

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:33.440
 What is it?

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:34.740
 Are you in the den?

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:35.740
 Not anymore.

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.740
 Well, Father, I'd like to ask you something.

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.440
 I think I'd better leave.

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.440
 What is it you want, Henry?

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.740
 Can I ask you a frank question?

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:44.240
 Well...

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.240
 A very frank question.

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.440
 Erm, well, just wait until I light my pipe.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.140
 You won't need your pipe, Father. It's not that frank.

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.140
 Oh.

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:54.640
 What is it?

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.140
 Father, you've known me a good many years over the years, haven't you?

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.640
 I have.

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.640
 Suppose you just forget I'm your son.

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:04.640
 I'm willing.

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:05.640
 Yeah, huh?

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:06.840
 (Laughter)

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.840
 Now, now, what would you say, just looking at me,

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.340
 What's your general impression of me?

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:13.140
 Well...

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.340
 Be Frank.

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.840
 You really want a Frank opinion?

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:17.340
 Be...

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:18.840
 How Frank?

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:19.840
 (audience laughing)

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:20.840
 Very Frank.

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.840
 Father, maybe my question was too general.

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.840
 Let me put it this way.

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.840
 Do you consider me reliable?

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.840
 Enry over the years and forgetting you're my son.

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.840
 Let me put it this way.

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.340
 There have always been certain things I could rely on you for.

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.340
 Gee, Father, thanks.

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.340
 And would you be willing to tell that to Mr. Swanson?

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.340
 Mr. Swanson owns the supermarket.

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.340
 Oh, yes, the one that has that very pretty daughter?

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:47.340
 Yeah, she's super, too.

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.340
 Yeah, come to think of it, he does have a daughter.

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:51.340
 Yeah.

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:52.340
 So, would you?

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.340
 Henry, I don't think a recommendation from your father would carry much weight.

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:57.340
 No?

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.340
 Well, how about a recommendation from Ms. Agleston?

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.340
 Your English teacher?

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.340
 No, you're right. That would be too much weight.

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:07.340
 Hey, are you out of the home?

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:12.680
 I'll be right there Homer. Thanks anyway, father. They get something you have to work out for yourself

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:18.920
 I guess so. Hi Homer. Can I have you spoken to Anita's father yet? No, I'm just sort of making plans to listen

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:25.200
 I just found out something interesting that might interest you what mr. Swanson has a job open in a supermarket

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:31.440
 He has don't you think that's interesting? You mean I should take the job Henry? I think you've hit on a wonderful idea

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:37.440
 I've not wait a minute. Don't you see? Once you're a fellow co-worker, Mr. Swanson's, how can he refuse you?

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.440
 Would you mind telling me why you're so interested?

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:47.440
 Well, Geraldine told me her father said she could go with me, only if Anita's father lets her go with you.

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.440
 What? So Henry, don't you see? You'll really be making an impression for both of us.

00:04:51.440 --> 00:05:00.440
 [Music]

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.440
 Alice, have you seen that old briefcase of mine anywhere?

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:08.440
 No. And Sam, I'm just wondering if you should have let Henry go down and apply for that job.

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.440
 Alice, he had his heart set on it. What could I say?

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:15.440
 Well, if he was so anxious to work, why couldn't you give him a job in your office?

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.440
 That's exactly what I offered to do.

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:18.440
 What did he say?

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:22.440
 Unless I gave Mr. Swanson a job to it, wouldn't do him any good.

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:23.440
 I don't understand.

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:27.440
 Who does? I could have sworn I put that briefcase right here by my desk.

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.440
 I thought you discarded that old briefcase.

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.440
 I did, but to handle all my new one broke,

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.440
 and I'm using the old one, meanwhile.

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:34.440
 Have you seen it?

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.440
 It must be around somewhere.

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.440
 I should hope so. I've got some very important papers in it

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.440
 that I need for this afternoon.

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.440
 Sam, do you think Henry was dressed warmly enough?

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:44.440
 I'll just forget Henry for a minute,

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:46.440
 and let's find that briefcase.

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:00.800
 See Henry there's the sign help once yeah, how do I look Homer fine?

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.640
 What have you gotten that briefcase nothing?

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:07.160
 It's just for the interview Homer to give me a business like air. Oh

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:11.800
 It's an old one of my fathers. Come on. Let's go in and see mr. Swanson

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:15.800
 There he is right the checkout camera. Yeah

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:26.080
 Oh mr. Swanson yes, what can I do for you? I came in about the job you have in the window

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:29.080
 Oh, oh, one second. Charlie, take over here will you?

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:30.080
 Oh, okay, Mrs. Watson.

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:32.080
 No, just step over here.

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:33.080
 Yes, sir.

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:34.080
 You want a job, huh?

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:35.080
 Yes, sir.

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:36.080
 Yes, sir.

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:39.080
 Oh, wait a minute. Are you both applying for this job?

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.080
 Oh, no. Not me.

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:42.080
 What are you doing here?

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:46.080
 Wait. I'm just doing a little shopping.

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:49.080
 Shopping. How much are these cookies?

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:50.080
 23 cents.

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:52.080
 For how many boxes?

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:54.080
 One.

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:58.080
 Well, I'll just be shopping around.

00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:59.080
 What's your name, son?

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:01.080
 Henry, Henry Aldridge.

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:03.080
 Mm-hmm, never worked before?

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:05.080
 Oh, sure, quite a few places.

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:07.080
 What was your last place of employment?

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:11.080
 Well, that was for quite a prominent attorney.

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:12.080
 What's his name?

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:14.080
 Does his name matter?

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:16.080
 Of course.

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:20.080
 It was a Mr. Samuel Aldridge.

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:22.080
 Oh, a relative.

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:23.080
 In a way.

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:25.080
 Where else did you work?

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:29.080
 Well, odd jobs. I've done quite a few odd jobs.

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:30.080
 Who for?

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:31.080
 Who for?

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:33.080
 Well, mostly, uh...

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:36.080
 Do you know a Mrs. Haldry jump on Elm Street?

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:40.080
 Another relative.

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:41.080
 Yeah, sorta.

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:42.080
 Mm-hmm.

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:45.080
 Well, son, I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll give you a trial.

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:49.080
 You will? Oh, boy. Thanks, Mr. Swanson. Thanks a lot.

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:51.480
 Put your briefcase down and slip on this apron.

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:52.480
 Yes, sir.

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:56.480
 Now, as an employee of Swanson's market, I want you to keep two things in mind.

00:07:56.480 --> 00:08:00.680
 First and foremost, there's our motto, Swanson's self-service, hell-service.

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:01.380
 Yes, sir.

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:04.080
 Swanson, Swanson's swans-- is this a Swanson swells--

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:05.080
 s--

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:07.480
 gee, that's a swell motto.

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:07.980
 Yes, sir.

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:09.380
 Tells the story.

00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:11.980
 Person who thought that up certainly was clever.

00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:13.080
 I suppose that was you.

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:15.680
 How much do you-- how much do you-- I mean Mr. Swanson?

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:17.480
 No, Mrs. Swanson.

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:17.980
 Oh.

00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:20.140
 Now, secondly, you see that sign?

00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:21.140
 Think?

00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:24.620
 No, it may not sound like much, but just think about it.

00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:25.620
 Now?

00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:26.620
 What?

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:29.740
 You want me to think about it now?

00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:30.740
 All the time.

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:33.420
 You keep thinking and you'll avoid costly mistakes and accidents.

00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:34.420
 Think.

00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:35.420
 That's pretty good.

00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:36.420
 I'm going to write that down, T.

00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:37.420
 That isn't necessary.

00:08:37.420 --> 00:08:42.860
 Well, as far as I'm concerned, Mr. Swanson, I couldn't stop thinking if I tried.

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:44.140
 Yes, sir.

00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:47.500
 No matter what else I'm thinking about, I'm always thinking.

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:48.500
 Yes, sir.

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:49.500
 All right.

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:52.500
 Now, suppose you unpack these cartons of canned tomatoes.

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:53.500
 Yes, sir.

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:56.500
 Just stack them right there on the top shell.

00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:57.500
 Yes, sir.

00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:59.500
 Henry, you're working.

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:01.500
 Yeah, he's giving me a one day he's pre-trying.

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:02.500
 Boy, that soil.

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:04.500
 I knew you could do it.

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:05.500
 Well, so long.

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:06.500
 Wait a minute, Homer.

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:08.500
 Hand me these cans and help.

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:09.500
 What?

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:12.500
 Don't you feel Geraldine is what's stacking for?

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:13.500
 Well, okay.

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:15.500
 When you put it that way.

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:16.340
 Here.

00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:19.840
 Henny, I think you're stacking them too high.

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:20.680
 - No, I'm not.

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:21.520
 - Yes, you are.

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:22.360
 It's teetering.

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:23.200
 - Looks perfectly straight to me.

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:24.720
 - Back up a little and you'll see.

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:26.280
 - It still looks okay.

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:27.480
 - Back up a little further.

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:28.320
 - Looks straight.

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:29.360
 - Further, straight.

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:30.200
 - Further.

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:31.320
 - Henry, look out!

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:33.580
 (clattering)

00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:36.920
 Oh boy.

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:38.760
 - What happened?

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:41.520
 - You back tried into that stack of beer cans

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:43.000
 and here comes Mr. Swanson.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:43.840
 - Oh boy.

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:45.280
 - So long him.

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:49.080
 You mean you're gonna leave me to face the music alone Henry from the look on mr.

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:51.600
 Swanson's face. I don't think there's gonna be much music

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:53.680
 I'll just be shopping around but home

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:55.180
 What is it what happened?

00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:58.040
 Why you're it's nothing that can't be straight now mr. Swanson

00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:03.240
 It's a good thing that beer comes in cans. Yes. It's too bad that ketchup doesn't

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:09.360
 Catch up where oh boy. Well, that'll come off the walls pretty easily. Don't you think?

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:12.120
 Think don't you?

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:17.180
 Suppose you take off that apron. You mean I'm fired? Have you got a driver's license?

00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:17.640
 Yes, sir

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:21.820
 I'd like you to take some deliveries out on the truck on the truck say that would be swell

00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:26.080
 I only shouldn't I clean up the ketchup first? No, I think you'll be a lot safer on the outside

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:32.880
 Hear the keys. Oh, mr. Swanson. Have we got a Henry Aldrich here? We certainly have what is it?

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:34.800
 He's wanted on the phone. I am

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:39.740
 Gee was who would be calling me here go ahead and answer it. Hey, while you're on the phone

00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:44.760
 I'll be taking you orders and I thought you were going you thought I'd leave you in a spot like that

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:47.340
 Where are the keys to the truck?

00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:53.280
 You're gonna take this call Aldrich. Yes, sir. Okay. Homer. You'll be loading the truck right there on the counter. Thank you

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:58.660
 Hello hello, Henry. This is your father. Hello father. How's everything going? Why?

00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:05.820
 It's going father. Good Henry. I don't suppose you know anything about it, but frankly I've looked everywhere and I'm desperate

00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:09.140
 You didn't see that old briefcase of mine. Anywhere did you well?

00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:10.900
 Do you need it?

00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:15.780
 Yes, there's some papers in it that I've got to have for a very important conference over in Abbott City this afternoon.

00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:16.680
 Have you seen it?

00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:22.280
 As a matter of fact, Father, I know just where I can lay my hands on it, and suppose I bring it down to your office.

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:23.740
 Fine, and the sooner the better, Henry.

00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:25.140
 Yes, Father, goodbye.

00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:27.480
 Okay, Aldrich, suppose you get started on those orders.

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:32.080
 Yes, sir, and Mr. Swanson, would you reach under the counter and hand me that briefcase, please?

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:33.740
 There's no briefcase back here.

00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:37.240
 What? Oh, boy, but I put it right behind there with my coat.

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:39.040
 Well, it's not here. Now get started.

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:39.840
 But that briefcase...

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:41.740
 Now look, son, do you want to work or just talk?

00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:42.240
 But you see...

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:44.040
 Maybe I better put that sign back in the window.

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:46.240
 Well, I'm going, Mr. Swanson. I'm going.

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:50.140
 Gee, I could swear I'd put that briefcase right here next to the coffee grinder.

00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:51.640
 Well, I'm going, Mr. Swanson.

00:11:51.640 --> 00:12:06.640
 Now, Homer, have you got that stray shoe or hen?

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:10.900
 While you're making this delivery, I'll go back to the store and see if I can find the briefcase.

00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:14.800
 And remember, don't let Mr. Swanson catch sight of the truck.

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:18.240
 Don't worry, I won't. And I'll come right back here and pick you up.

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:19.240
 Soooooooow.

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:21.940
 Hello.

00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:24.640
 Good morning, Swanson's self-service, self-service.

00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:26.340
 I'm from Swanson's.

00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:27.840
 Oh, come right in.

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:30.240
 Just bring it right into the kitchen, please.

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:31.040
 Yes, ma'am.

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:32.540
 Set it right down on this chair.

00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:33.240
 Yes, ma'am.

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:34.940
 Oh, uh, just a minute.

00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:36.860
 Are you sure this is my order?

00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:38.260
 It's got your name on it.

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:40.620
 Yes, but I didn't order this briefcase.

00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:41.500
 What?

00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:44.100
 Oh boy, I've been looking all over for that.

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:45.420
 Well, goodbye.

00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:47.740
 Well, look, before you leave,

00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:49.740
 I wonder if I could ask a favor of you.

00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:50.780
 Gee, sure.

00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:53.420
 So I had some self service, self service, you know.

00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:55.340
 No, I didn't know.

00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:56.860
 It's our motto.

00:12:56.860 --> 00:13:00.540
 Oh, well, do you see that home freezer over by the sink?

00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:01.380
 Yes, ma'am.

00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:02.820
 It was just delivered this morning,

00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:07.560
 I had the men put it next to my stove. Now I realize I can't get the oven door open.

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:12.640
 Ha! Is that right? Would it be too much trouble if I asked you to move it over by the sink

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:17.300
 for me? Nothing's too much for a science and self-service, which sells service. A new

00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:24.220
 freezer, huh? Isn't it lovely? I guess it holds quite a bit, huh? Oh my goodness, yes.

00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:28.740
 You can get a whole side of beef and over 200 pounds of fruit and vegetables in there.

00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:29.740
 Yeah, is that right?

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:30.740
 Yeah.

00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:33.740
 Boy, that's going to mean a big order for some store, isn't it?

00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:34.740
 I guess so.

00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:38.620
 Well, ma'am, I don't want to influence your decision, but wouldn't you prefer to buy

00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:42.580
 it in a place like Swanson's where the employees keep thinking all day long?

00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:45.580
 As a matter of fact, I probably will buy it there.

00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:46.580
 Really?

00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:50.540
 Well, I wouldn't necessarily expect you to tell Mr. Swanson I recommended you, but that

00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:52.540
 is unless you really feel you want to.

00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:54.340
 Well, I'll be glad to tell him that.

00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:55.340
 You will?

00:13:55.340 --> 00:14:01.340
 Oh boy, if you do that, Mrs. Billings, there's no question who I'll be ice skating with next weekend.

00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:02.340
 I beg your pardon?

00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:04.340
 Over by the rink, uh, sink, huh?

00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:05.340
 Yeah.

00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:07.340
 I'll have it over there in a jiffy.

00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:12.340
 Is it very heavy?

00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:14.340
 T-wiz, no.

00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:21.340
 You're sure you don't mind.

00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:23.340
 Glad to do it.

00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:26.340
 [groaning]

00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:29.340
 [groaning]

00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:30.340
 How's that?

00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:33.340
 I think it almost moved that time.

00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:34.340
 [laughing]

00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:36.340
 I just need more leverage.

00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:37.340
 Yeah.

00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:38.340
 [groaning]

00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:39.340
 There!

00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:40.340
 I'm getting it now!

00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:43.340
 Oh, wait a minute. I think you better--

00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:44.340
 [groaning]

00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:45.340
 That's okay, guys!

00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:47.340
 Did you turn the lights off?

00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:49.340
 Don't you see what you did?

00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:51.340
 You pulled the cord right out of the freezer.

00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:55.540
 of the freezer. Oh boy, guess I forgot to disconnect the plug. Oh and now you've

00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:59.820
 probably short-circuited the whole house. Wait, isn't there something they do with

00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:05.860
 a penny? Not these days. No, just don't stand there, Sonny. Do something.

00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:17.780
 [Music]

00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:20.780
 Oh, mister, you and the truck there.

00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:21.780
 Ah, yes, honey.

00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:26.780
 You haven't seen a couple of dozen oranges laying around in the street, have you?

00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:30.780
 Oh, she was. They dropped off my truck somewhere around here.

00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:32.780
 Well, thanks.

00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:34.780
 Oh, oh, honey, just a second.

00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:35.780
 Yeah?

00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:37.780
 Would you mind giving me a push? I think my battery's gone.

00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:42.780
 Well, I'd like to, but I couldn't find the briefcase, and now on top of that I've lost the oranges,

00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:44.780
 and he's probably wondering what's keeping me.

00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:49.780
 It'll only take a second and I was supposed to deliver those chickens a half an hour ago.

00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:50.780
 Chicken?

00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:51.780
 Yeah, I'm like truck.

00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:52.780
 Just take a second.

00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:54.780
 Okay, I'll back up behind your truck.

00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:55.780
 Yeah.

00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:57.780
 No, wait till I get in now.

00:15:57.780 --> 00:16:00.780
 Just keep rolling, fly away, and then cut away.

00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:01.780
 Okay.

00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:02.780
 Let it go.

00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:04.780
 All right, keep going.

00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:07.780
 No, no, no, wait, wait, hold it.

00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:08.780
 What?

00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:09.780
 Hold it!

00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:10.780
 My crates are starting to...

00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:11.780
 Hold it!

00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:12.780
 No!

00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:13.780
 No!

00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:15.780
 Oh no, no!

00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:17.780
 What happened? What happened?

00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:19.780
 Look! Oh boy!

00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:21.780
 Look at my chickens! They're all over the place!

00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:23.780
 You never mind the chickens?

00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:25.780
 Whose bumper is that laying on the ground?

00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:39.780
 If you think Henry and Homer have problems,

00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:41.780
 just listen to what Willie Marshall has to say.

00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:42.780
 to say.

00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:47.020
 Problems, problems, I'll say I got problems. My folks go out nights, I have to stay home

00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:51.500
 as babysitter for my younger brother, Gulliver. But my folks have people in nights, I have

00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:55.900
 to entertain them playing hearts and flowers on the piano. He gets a little guy, I can't

00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:57.900
 even enjoy his dinner.

00:16:57.900 --> 00:17:02.380
 Cheer up, Willie. Just ask your mother to have Jell-O for dessert and you'll feel swell,

00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:05.980
 whatever happens. And say, have you folks heard about the new quick setting way to make

00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:10.620
 Jell-O? You know, you get beautiful finished Jell-O desserts in just about one hour. Now

00:17:10.620 --> 00:17:13.980
 Now all you do is dissolve the jello in one cup of hot water.

00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:18.220
 Then add one cup of ice cubes or crushed ice filling the cup to the brim with water.

00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:22.020
 Stir until the ice melts thoroughly then chill firm in the refrigerator.

00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:27.340
 And adjust about one short hour there's a beautiful jello dessert already to serve.

00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:30.580
 Try a jello treat this new quick setting way tomorrow.

00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:34.080
 Remember, it's jello for red letter desserts.

00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:36.820
 (dramatic music)

00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:43.060
 And now getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldrich,

00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:45.260
 it's later the same day, and the scene opens

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:47.980
 in a phone booth somewhere in Centerville.

00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:48.820
 - Hello?

00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:50.900
 Is this Harrison's electric shop?

00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:51.740
 - That's right.

00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:53.060
 - Well, I don't know if fellow who just bought

00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:54.340
 some fuses there.

00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:55.340
 - Yeah, who?

00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:56.300
 Speak up, Sean.

00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:58.340
 - The fellow from Swanson's market.

00:17:58.340 --> 00:18:00.640
 Oh, you're the fellow who just bought some fuses.

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:02.240
 Well, what's wrong now?

00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:04.540
 Were those very good quality fuses?

00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:05.540
 Well, sure.

00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:08.840
 Well, I'll tell you every time I put one in, it blows right out again.

00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:10.940
 Well, there's nothing wrong with those fuses.

00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:12.940
 You still got a short somewhere.

00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:16.440
 I told you you should never fool around with those pennies in the fuse box.

00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:17.840
 That wasn't my idea.

00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:18.940
 It's illegal, too.

00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:19.740
 I know.

00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:23.040
 Besides, you can get terrible damage resulting from that.

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:26.540
 Well, maybe you better come over and take a look at it yourself.

00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:27.740
 Well, I can't right now.

00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:29.540
 But he was not in a terrible spot.

00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:30.940
 I don't want to lose a good customer,

00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:33.740
 but on the other hand, what's Mr. Swanson going to say?

00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:34.240
 Who?

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:36.240
 Mr. Swanson, Mr. Swanson.

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:36.940
 Oh, yeah.

00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:38.940
 Yeah, one of his fellows was in here a while ago

00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:40.140
 and bought some fuses.

00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:41.440
 Well, that was me.

00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:42.240
 And so?

00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:45.340
 Can't you please come over?

00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:48.240
 Sorry, I won't be free for another hour, at least.

00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:50.040
 But I'll tell you what you can do, meanwhile.

00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:50.640
 What?

00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:52.140
 You know where the fuse box is.

00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:52.840
 Of course.

00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:53.740
 OK.

00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:54.840
 Open it up, see.

00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:55.440
 Yeah.

00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:56.940
 Take out all the fuses.

00:18:56.940 --> 00:18:57.740
 Yeah.

00:18:57.740 --> 00:18:59.940
 Be sure you got your main switch off.

00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:00.540
 Yeah.

00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:02.340
 Then you can put your pennies in.

00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:03.340
 What?

00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:05.140
 Now try to get over there as soon as I can.

00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:05.940
 So long.

00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:07.140
 But wait.

00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:09.540
 I-- I also want to ask you--

00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:13.040
 if I left an old briefcase when I was down there.

00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:14.440
 Hello?

00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:15.440
 Hello?

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:18.440
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:34.440
 Here's Chicky Chicky. Nice Chicky Chicky. Uncle Homer's not gonna hurt you.

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:42.440
 Chicky, won't you please come Uncle Homer. Now listen, Chicky, come down off that roof

00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:44.440
 for all ring your darn little neck.

00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:53.840
 But operator I've been calling Swanson supermarket for over an hour.

00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:55.140
 How could it be busy that long?

00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:57.240
 I'm sorry sir, the line is busy.

00:19:57.240 --> 00:20:00.040
 Operator is terribly important that I get in touch with him.

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:01.140
 Can't you do something?

00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:07.640
 Hello, hello, are you still there?

00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:12.240
 Mrs. Ferguson, believe me, your order went out of here two hours ago.

00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:16.940
 I wish I knew, but here's what I'm doing. I've taken two of my regular men off the

00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:21.360
 checkout counter and they're making the orders up all over again. Yes, you should

00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:23.820
 have your order within the hour. Good-bye.

00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:26.760
 Mrs. Swanson, are you going to check me out or orange?

00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:31.500
 All right, all right, I'm coming. Hello Swanson's your order will be there inside

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:35.460
 of an hour. Mrs. Swanson, Mrs. Jones is raising a fuss over at the meat counter.

00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:37.080
 She says you promised to save her a chicken.

00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:39.440
 For the butcher tell her our delivery was three hours late.

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:41.440
 Yes, but Mrs. Jones...

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:44.440
 Mr. Swanson, look at that mob at the checkout counter.

00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:45.440
 They're going crazy.

00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:47.440
 Oh, good grief. Let's get over there.

00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:49.440
 Let's get going. I got it in the mail.

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:53.440
 All right, we'll take care of everybody. Just be patient.

00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:57.440
 Now, let's see, Mrs. Mead. Two cans of baked beans.

00:20:57.440 --> 00:21:00.440
 Excuse me. You'll have to wait your turn in line.

00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:03.440
 Oh, I'm not shopping. I'm the electrician. Where's your fuse box?

00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:05.440
 Listen, I can't be bothered with that now.

00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:08.440
 All right, all right. We're doing our best.

00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:09.720
 The fuse box is in the cellar.

00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:10.720
 Okay.

00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:12.560
 Now where was I, Mrs. Mead?

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:14.920
 Oh yes, two cans of baked beans.

00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:16.720
 Now just a minute, Mrs. Swan came.

00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:18.720
 Excuse me, Mrs. Mead.

00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:20.840
 Swanson's your order will be there soon, goodbye.

00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:23.480
 Wait, I'd like to order some milk, please.

00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:24.880
 Yes, ma'am. How many quarts?

00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:28.680
 Just one. And would it be possible to have it delivered?

00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:29.680
 Yes, ma'am.

00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:31.920
 Swanson's self-service, self-s--

00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:33.160
 Oh, come on, Ed.

00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:33.680
 Wait a minute.

00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:36.080
 Madam, where would you like that delivered?

00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:41.240
 Well, that all depends. In what part of the store is Henry Aldrich working now?

00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:42.080
 What's that?

00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:48.380
 Henry Aldrich, I'm his mother and I know this is a lot of trouble for you, but I like the milk delivered to him.

00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:49.680
 Hello?

00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:51.380
 I'm here.

00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:54.080
 And when you please tell him not to go up the milk?

00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:59.180
 Yes, ma'am. And when I see him, I'm going to tell him a few other things. Goodbye.

00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:03.680
 Now let's see Mrs. Mead. Two cans of baked beans.

00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:07.680
 Mr. Swanson, that's the third time you rang up those beans.

00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:11.680
 Huh? Oh, Mr. Swanson. Mr. Swanson, come quick.

00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:14.680
 What now? There's been an accident. What kind of an accident?

00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:17.680
 Four shopping wagons crashed at the corner of Oak Meal and Salt Flakes.

00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:21.680
 Oh, no. And the place looks like it was hit by a blizzard.

00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:24.680
 Mr. Swanson, Mr. Swanson. You? Where have you been all this time?

00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:29.680
 Mr. Swanson, I can explain everything you see. Never mind the explanation. What did you do with all those orders?

00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:32.680
 Well, you see all of it. Oh, gee whiz. What did you do with that briefcase?

00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:36.720
 I can explain everything you see never mind him. What about those orders? Oh look here, sir

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:39.160
 Will you keep out of this this boy works for me, sir?

00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:45.280
 What's so happens that he's my son? Oh, he's your son. Well, let me tell you something

00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:48.880
 All right, all right, you'll all be

00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:55.720
 What happened who turned out the lights? I'm not going to let him add my bill in the dog

00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:58.840
 Now where everybody?

00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:05.040
 Please don't move around in the dock. You're knocking the merchandise over.

00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:19.200
 Is that you, Mary?

00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:21.440
 Now it's me, mother.

00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:22.320
 It's...

00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:24.480
 It's father here.

00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:25.520
 No, dear.

00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:28.320
 And what are you doing home from the store at this hour?

00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:30.160
 I'll tell you.

00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:33.560
 The store closed a little early today.

00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:35.840
 Really? Why?

00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:38.360
 For repairs.

00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:42.240
 And I think they'll be closed tomorrow too.

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:45.400
 But when they reopen next week,

00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:47.400
 you ought to get down there.

00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:50.560
 What for? Mr. Swanson's going to give stuff away.

00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:54.640
 Free? Practically. For every item you buy,

00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:57.600
 you can have two of them just by paying another penny.

00:23:57.600 --> 00:23:59.600
 Well, what's he doing that for?

00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:03.600
 He said it's the only way he hopes to get back the public's good will.

00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:04.600
 Has...

00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:06.600
 His father cold at all?

00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:09.600
 Yes, he said he was going to drive over to Abbott City.

00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:13.600
 And Henry, I think it was very careless of you to miss place his briefcase.

00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:19.600
 I know it was, Mother, but the first thing to Maram going over my entire route and try to turn it up.

00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:23.600
 Well, that's funny. That sounds like your father driving into the garage now.

00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:24.600
 Oh, boy.

00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:26.600
 Mother, I'm going up to my room for a while.

00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:29.600
 And if Homer calls, I'll take it on the upstairs phone.

00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:31.600
 You're not coming down at all?

00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:33.600
 Not for a few days.

00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:37.600
 And incidentally, if anyone in the Swanson family calls me,

00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:39.600
 I've gone away for the duration.

00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:41.600
 Oh dear.

00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:43.600
 Oh, good evening, Sam.

00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:46.600
 My, that was a quick trip to Abbott City.

00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:48.600
 I didn't go to Abbott City.

00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:50.600
 I thought you said you were.

00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:51.600
 I thought you were.

00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:53.600
 I thought you were.

00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:55.600
 I thought you said you were.

00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:58.600
 I started, Alice. I just didn't get there.

00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:00.600
 What happened? I'll take your code.

00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:02.600
 Thank you.

00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:04.600
 Well, as I was driving along Main Street...

00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:06.600
 Yes?

00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:08.600
 You won't believe this.

00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:10.600
 Well, believe what?

00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:12.600
 As I was driving along Main Street...

00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:14.600
 No, it's too ridiculous.

00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:17.600
 Sam, for heaven's sake, tell me what happened

00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:19.600
 as you were driving along Main Street?

00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:24.600
 Well, a chicken blew in my window and laid an egg in my lap.

00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:29.600
 It's unbelievable. What's a chicken doing on Main Street?

00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:35.600
 Anyway, I hit another car. Oh, nothing serious, but I decided against driving any further.

00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:39.600
 I'll get that. They're probably calling from Abbot City to find out what happened to me.

00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:43.600
 I'll get the door.

00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:46.600
 Hello? Speaking.

00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:50.600
 No, I didn't forget, I had an accident on the way over there.

00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:55.600
 Well, as I was driving along Main Street, it's really nothing that would interest you.

00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:57.600
 You want to meet tomorrow instead?

00:25:57.600 --> 00:26:02.600
 Well, the only trouble is that my briefcase containing the papers has gone astray and I don't know if--

00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:03.600
 Wait!

00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:05.600
 Oh, just a minute. What is it, Alice?

00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:09.600
 Look, but some woman just brought over. She said Henry left it at her house this morning.

00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:11.600
 My briefcase. Let me have it.

00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:13.600
 Sam, don't bend it, it'll break.

00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:15.600
 What? What happened to it?

00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:18.000
 It seems it's been at her freezer all day.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.920
 Oh, I haven't said so.

00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:20.720
 Oh, hello.

00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:22.480
 Look, I've just found my briefcase.

00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:25.480
 How about meeting the day after tomorrow?

00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:26.840
 Well, I don't know about tomorrow.

00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:29.400
 It may not be defrosted by then.

00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:30.920
 I'll explain when I see you.

00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:31.920
 Goodbye.

00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:33.360
 Anybody home?

00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:34.600
 Is that you, Homer?

00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:35.840
 Yes, Mrs. Aldrich.

00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:37.920
 I'm afraid you can't see, Henry, now.

00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:39.920
 Oh, this isn't a social call.

00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:42.120
 Mr. Aldrich, I need some legal advice.

00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:43.160
 Yes, what kind?

00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:44.440
 Two kinds.

00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:48.760
 In the first place, a store sells you iron glue, but it doesn't glue iron.

00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:50.360
 Can I sue them?

00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:52.040
 What did you try to glue with it?

00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:53.080
 A bumper.

00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:54.520
 Yeah.

00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:57.160
 Well, Homer, don't you think that's a little ridiculous?

00:26:57.160 --> 00:26:58.120
 It is.

00:26:58.120 --> 00:27:00.040
 Send that briefcase is beginning to drip.

00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:03.400
 Oh, I wonder if we better put it in the refrigerator.

00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:07.000
 You're gonna put a briefcase in the refrigerator?

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.360
 Yes, why?

00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:11.160
 And trying to glue a bumper is ridiculous?

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.760
 What's your other problem over?

00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:18.500
 Oh, yeah. Well, if I'm nice enough to give another fellow a push,

00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:22.200
 and then I'm nice enough to help him chase his chickens, can he sue me?

00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:23.100
 What's that?

00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:25.100
 I'm not making myself clear.

00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:27.300
 No. Alice, can we eat soon?

00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:30.500
 Of course, dear. Would you like some nice vegetable cutlets?

00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:31.600
 Vegetable cutlets.

00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:34.000
 The Swanson's didn't deliver my order either.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:35.200
 What vegetable cutlets?

00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:37.000
 Mrs. Aldrich, yes, Homer.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.600
 Could I interest you in some nice chickens?

00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:40.200
 Chicken?

00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:43.440
 Yes, ma'am, I've got them right outside on the porch.

00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:46.280
 And the beautiful part of it is, they're half plucked.

00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:49.440
 (audience applauding)

00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:59.120
 - Boy, Homer, we certainly went about getting a girl

00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:00.960
 for that skating party the hard way.

00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:02.280
 - Boy, Henry Alson.

00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:04.200
 - And all we actually have to do is go to the telephone

00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:05.640
 and call someone just like that.

00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:06.480
 - Sure, Henry.

00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:08.960
 - So we call, Homer, come on, pal, think.

00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:13.520
 Think, think, listen Henry, after all we've been through with that word today,

00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:18.480
 let's just relax and let second nature take its core. You mean good old Gladys and Agnes?

00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:21.680
 Sure. Sure. Sure, that's a happy ending for our boys,

00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:25.840
 just the way Jello is always a happy ending for any meal. Because everybody goes for a

00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:30.960
 gay, colorful Jello. In any of those six delicious flavors, strawberry, raspberry, cherry,

00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:35.200
 orange, lemon, and lime, all six have delectable fruit-rich goodness,

00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:38.800
 wonderful, fresh-tasting flavor that reminds you of the ripe juicy fruit,

00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:41.320
 And there are dozens of glamorous ways to fix jello.

00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:43.680
 Have it riced or cut into sparkling cubes,

00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:45.480
 served with any favorite fruit.

00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:47.680
 Just look for the big red letters on the box,

00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:50.320
 'cause it's jello for red letter desserts.

00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:51.400
