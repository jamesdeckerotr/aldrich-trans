00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 [Music]

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
 Coming, Robin.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 [Applause]

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
 Yes, it's the Oldridge family based on characters

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.600
 by Clifford Goldsmith and starring Edward Stone as Henry with Jackie Kelker's home.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.000
 And now for the Aldridge family.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:48.400
 Typical teenage boys are too busy even to sit down and remember way back when.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.200
 Like Henry Aldridge, they live only the exciting here and now,

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.000
 with only everything to look forward to.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 It is late afternoon in the scene opens in to Haven's drugstore.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
 But, Agnes, aren't you even interested?

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 Of course not, Kathleen. Of course not.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 Fasting up with Homer is the best thing that ever happened to me.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 It is?

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 What's Henry saying to Homer now?

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 Nothing.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 Mr. de Haven just delivered something to Homer.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 What?

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 A banana split.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 He's gonna eat a banana split?

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
 Kathleen is not supposed to. It makes him break out in bunks.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 Now Henry's saying something.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 He's leaning over and pointing his finger right in Homer's face.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 What's Homer doing? He's eating it.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 And his finger? No, the banana split.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
 Oh my goodness, what's the matter?

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 He did take a bite of it. The banana split?

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 No, Henry's finger.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 He got it too close to the spool.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 Now he's feeling the convincing Homer.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 Why not that I'm the least bit interested?

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 Oh my goodness, Henry's coming back.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 I'll let you decide, Kathleen.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 Now let you decide.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 Does the end of my finger look like a spoonful of banana split?

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 Why, of course it doesn't.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 And that's a good example of how pig-headed Homer is.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000
 Sure, Agnes.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 And if you ask me, you're much better off without him.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 I am.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
 After all the beautiful years they've been stuck together.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 Sure.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 Hey, did you explain that Agnes had no idea

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
 that his home is red-boarding, she put the papery in.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 Sure.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 And we're just sitting there in the school cafeteria

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 without a bit of a identification on it.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
 And I thought... I thought...

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
 Did you ask him what happened to his sense of humor?

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000
 Sure.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000
 And you know what he said?

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.600
 - What do you say? - What?

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:21.440
 Huh?

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.600
 What?

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:23.600
 Huh?

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:24.440
 (audience laughing)

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.080
 I told you, Kathleen, I told you it was no use

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.920
 coming down here.

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:27.760
 Agnes, wait.

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.280
 And I wouldn't have if you hadn't pointed out

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.760
 a dimple like a fight with people.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.120
 Agnes, we can't give up this easily.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.120
 And we will have to go back and talk to him again.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.960
 - But carefully, Harry.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.320
 - Harry, we can't sit by and see our two best friends

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:39.840
 go over the dam.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:40.680
 Go ahead.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.080
 - Well, okay.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.000
 Excuse me.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.440
 - Just watch out for your finger this time.

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.600
 - Homer, excuse me, Charlie.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.100
 Homer, old timer!

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.100
 Henry, aren't you ever gonna give up?

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.100
 (audience laughing)

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.400
 - Not a Homer.

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.800
 - I'm gonna do the Haven, another banana split.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.100
 - Another one, Homer.

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.600
 Don't you think you ought to go easy on that stuff?

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.000
 - Henry, I'm no child.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.400
 If I don't mind being a mess of bumps,

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.600
 she was who cares anyway.

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:06.600
 - Agnestah?

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:07.900
 - Sure, sure.

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.700
 - Or I mean to her as someone she can play jokes on.

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.200
 - No, Homer, she's very fond of you.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.200
 - Fun.

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.100
 - Henry, there was so much pepper in that pudding

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.100
 When I got to French, I couldn't even say mercy, Vocoupe.

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:24.300
 Sure, but that's what it's like to have Agnes Fern, love, you know? Thanks.

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.600
 I can't afford to live that dangerously.

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.700
 Okay, all right. Okay.

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.100
 That's the way you feel. That's the way I feel.

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.100
 That's the way you feel. Okay.

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.600
 Only you can't blame Kathleen and I for being depressed.

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.300
 Gee, when you think of those wonderful times the four of us adds.

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:41.600
 Wonderful times?

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:42.800
 What wonderful times.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.040
 She was how about that summer we all spent it like which I'm a clatching.

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.520
 Remember those picnics down by the water?

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.040
 A rowing parties in the moonlight?

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:51.880
 Yeah.

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.320
 Dancing on Agnes' veranda?

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.720
 Standing in our heads on the raft?

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.040
 Yeah, sure.

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:01.520
 And Henry the way Agnes visited me in the hospital every day?

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:02.240
 Hospital?

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.840
 Don't you remember I had that bad case of poison in the ivy?

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.360
 Well why, I'm a wise guy.

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.640
 Put it in my bed to play a joke on me.

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.080
 - Son of a joke. - Homer.

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.640
 Boy, I scratched for weeks.

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.120
 Homer, there's a perfect example of how you exaggerate things.

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.360
 Agnes didn't even know it was poison ivy.

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:18.360
 Agnes?

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:20.360
 No, she thought it was skark cabbage.

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:22.800
 I was Agnes who did it.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.800
 You mean he didn't know?

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.760
 I can tell her to go jump in like what you're mclatching.

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.760
 Homer, you mean nothing do.

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.160
 But Homer, you may be throwing away someone who could share your old age.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.400
 Tell me if I sit to Agnes, this is a good chance I may never reach my old age.

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:46.040
 [Music]

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.600
 Hold the box straight, Henry.

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:51.840
 Gee, Agnes, I think you're foolish to throw up the sponge like this.

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.600
 Listen, Henry. If Homer feels the way he does, and I feel the way I do,

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:00.680
 well, she was, why sit around with a lamp in my window? You know what I mean?

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:01.680
 Sure only you don't.

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.920
 Gee. She sure was cute, though.

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:06.920
 'Cause that postcard he sent me when you booked

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:08.720
 that trip to Washington.

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.120
 Put a circle around the room where you slept.

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.960
 - That's our room?

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.520
 - That's what it says.

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.060
 - Geez, my memory serves me, Agnes.

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:16.720
 That's the elevator shaft.

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.120
 - His next cue.

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.120
 Poor Homer didn't even know where he slept.

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.720
 Put him in the box with the rest of the junk Henry.

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.560
 And here, here's that cupidow we wanted the carnival.

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.000
 - You're returning that too?

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:28.840
 - Why not?

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:29.880
 - But you wanted.

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.920
 You were the one who hit the bell with a sledgehammer

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:33.760
 four times in a row.

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:35.760
 That's why I wanted to have him.

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:38.760
 She, you're the first thing he ever gave me.

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.720
 It's swimming medally, gotten camped.

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.760
 He nearly drowned winning.

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:44.600
 That's fine.

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:46.480
 I was never so touched.

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:47.920
 Gee, Agnes.

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:51.120
 Gee, I'm certainly sorry you've had to end this way.

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:51.840
 Agnes?

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:52.600
 Yes, mother?

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:53.800
 Could I see you for a moment?

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:54.400
 Sure.

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:55.280
 Excuse me, Agnes.

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:57.160
 I'll be getting everything together.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:58.200
 OK.

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:59.080
 Yes, mother?

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.000
 Dear, I put up some hot milk for you.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:01.720
 Hot milk?

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:02.880
 Yes, dear, with butter.

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.320
 It'll make you feel a great deal better.

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.120
 But mother, I'm not supposed to feel better.

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.400
 At a time like this, I'm supposed to feel miserable.

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.120
 Dear, I don't think that's necessary at all.

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.200
 Why, look at the way your father took the news at home

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:15.040
 or wouldn't be coming over anymore.

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:16.840
 He just swallowed his disappointment

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:18.760
 and actually managed to smile.

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:19.600
 He did?

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.080
 He even laughed.

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.640
 Incidentally, dear, we heard from your uncle Clifford

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:24.600
 in Arizona.

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:26.440
 And do you know what he's sending you?

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:28.520
 Mother, not one of his horses.

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:30.680
 Agnes, he spends a great deal of time on them.

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:32.120
 He was in my condition.

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.520
 you think he'd come across with a present I can use instead of a heart he draws on

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:36.520
 his typewriter.

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:39.320
 Dear, in some circles, they're very highly put off.

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:41.320
 Agnes, I'm about ready to leave.

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:42.520
 Thanks, honey, Henry.

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:44.320
 I'll see if you're a male kiss boy.

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:45.420
 Mother, I beg of you.

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:48.720
 Boy, will Nell Polone make me think of Homer more.

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:51.120
 Is there anything else you want to send back to Homer?

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:52.020
 No.

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:54.620
 Boy, if that doesn't make a whole thing complete.

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:55.420
 What does?

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:57.620
 My uncle's sending me one of his darn horses.

00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:59.620
 Oh, boy, is that right?

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:00.920
 And listen, Henry.

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:02.520
 Shake his hand, will you?

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:04.420
 I don't even know your uncle.

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:05.620
 I mean, Homer.

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:07.720
 And just tell him there's no hard feeling, see?

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:08.420
 There isn't.

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:09.520
 Not a bit.

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:10.720
 And to prove it, you know what?

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:11.220
 What?

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:14.120
 Tell Homer if he wants to, we can keep my boxing gloves.

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:23.320
 Who was that on the phone, Alice?

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:26.920
 Elizabeth Brown, Sam, and she's very upset about Homer.

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:28.320
 That's understandable.

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:29.520
 What is it this time?

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:32.120
 Well, dear, it seems he stopped eating.

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:33.480
 Homer? Yes.

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:36.520
 The same Homer that's been eating us out of house and homes?

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:38.680
 Sam, this is no time for jokes.

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:40.760
 Elizabeth is very much concerned.

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:42.120
 What are you going to do with that bowl?

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:43.480
 Take it into Homer.

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:45.400
 Boys, are you still in the living room?

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:46.240
 Yes, mother.

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:47.480
 And I want you to know that Homer's

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:49.960
 going to take that box off a coffee table just as soon

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:51.400
 as he's finished going through it.

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:52.840
 I don't mind the box.

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:55.240
 I'm just looking for a place to put this bowl of figs.

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:56.840
 Would you like one, Homer?

00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:58.200
 No, Mrs. Aldrich.

00:07:58.200 --> 00:07:59.960
 I don't feel much like a fig.

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:02.840
 Well, maybe you'll feel like one later.

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:05.040
 Sure, Mrs. Orange.

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:06.560
 Gee.

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:09.680
 Gee, so Agnes really sent back all these things, huh?

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:10.520
 Yeah.

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:12.920
 Although if you want me to, I'd be glad to return them to her.

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:14.960
 Why would I want you to do that?

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:16.080
 Boy.

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:18.600
 Boy, there's some very valuable junk in here

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:20.160
 that I've been dying to get back.

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:20.680
 They're in?

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:21.760
 Sure.

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:23.800
 Take the swimming medal, for instance.

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:26.960
 Do you realize I had a swim door near 20 yards to win it?

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:30.040
 -Sure, only about an minute or two. -(audience laughing)

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:33.080
 Homer, this is the wrong time to break up with Agnes.

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:36.480
 Did I tell you what Agnes' Uncle Clifford is sending her for...

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:38.280
 A horse!

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:40.040
 -A horse? -Sure.

00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:42.800
 A horse? A horse?

00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:44.520
 Who are you trying to kid, Henry?

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:46.040
 I heard it with my own two ears.

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:48.880
 Her Uncle Clifford is sending her one from Arizona.

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:50.760
 -Yeah. -Really?

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:52.480
 -Really? -No kidding.

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:53.760
 No kidding.

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:55.920
 Sheeee, a horse.

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:58.640
 So now don't you agree it's worth patching Agnes up?

00:08:58.640 --> 00:08:59.440
 No.

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:00.160
 But Homer...

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:02.880
 Okay, okay. So she's got a horse.

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:04.800
 What's so wonderful about that?

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:07.600
 You didn't hear her call me up and offer to share it with me, did you?

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:07.920
 No.

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:09.320
 Or even offer me a ride?

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:10.680
 Or even a walk?

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:12.400
 Homer, you didn't call her her even.

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:14.920
 Can we stop taking her side?

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:18.520
 That's probably the reason she wanted to break up in the first place.

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:21.800
 Well, if a horse means more to her than...

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:23.040
 Well, she can have...

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:23.880
 Homer.

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:26.880
 And they ought to make a very nice couple at the spring dance.

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:27.880
 Hand me my box.

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:38.600
 Agnes, dear, it's such a nice afternoon.

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:40.200
 Why don't you glott and get a breath of air?

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:42.680
 Mother, if you don't mind, I'd much rather read.

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:47.880
 But, dear, besides, don't you think these blustery winter days are too much for my constitution?

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:49.880
 Agnes, I hardly--

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:50.880
 Listen to this.

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:52.880
 Yet who'll complain?

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:56.880
 My heart and I, and this abundant earth no doubt,

00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:59.880
 as little room for things worn out.

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:02.880
 Did you ever hear anything that was more darn soul stirring?

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:04.880
 Agnes, what book is that?

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:06.880
 The poems of Elizabeth Barrett Brownie.

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:07.880
 My goodness.

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:09.880
 I'm feeling quite worn, Mother.

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:12.880
 I think I'll go upstairs and lie down in my wheelchair.

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:13.880
 I mean my bed.

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:15.880
 Agnes Lawson.

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:17.880
 Now please see who's at the door.

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:18.880
 Isn't my condition?

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:19.880
 Here, if you don't stop this nonsense,

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:22.880
 I'm going to give you a good dose of sulfur and molasses.

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:23.880
 I'm going, mother.

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:25.880
 There's a limit to how foolish you can get about southern life.

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:29.880
 Mother, I assure you, Homer has nothing to do with the way I feel.

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:31.880
 Oh.

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:33.880
 How do you do, Miss Lawson?

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:34.880
 How do you do, Mr. Browning?

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:36.880
 I mean, Mr. Brown.

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:38.880
 Aren't you step inside?

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:39.880
 You're very kind.

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:41.880
 It's just that you're creating a draft.

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:44.880
 Would you care to come into the living room?

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:46.880
 Well, I can just stay a minute.

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:50.880
 I just stopped by to return this box of things you gave Henry.

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:51.880
 You want me to have them back?

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:53.880
 That's not the point, Miss Lawson.

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:57.880
 I just don't want certain parties getting the idea I'm an Indian giver.

00:10:57.880 --> 00:10:59.880
 Oh, well, thank you.

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:01.880
 You're welcome.

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:04.880
 Well...

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:06.880
 Well...

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:09.880
 How have you been?

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:11.880
 Okay.

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:14.880
 Except, gee, I don't know. I haven't been sleeping too well.

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:16.880
 - Yeah, neither of us. - Yeah?

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:17.880
 Yeah.

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:19.880
 I guess some germs been going around.

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:20.880
 [laughter]

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:22.880
 I guess he had.

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:23.880
 Well...

00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:24.880
 Yeah?

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:27.880
 Well, I guess I better be going.

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:28.880
 Holler.

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:29.880
 Yes, Agnes.

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:30.880
 Darnit.

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:32.880
 Would you excuse me while I answer the door?

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:33.880
 Sure.

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:35.880
 And you try to remember what you were going to say.

00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:37.880
 And do you have anything to eat around the house?

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:38.880
 I've suddenly gotten her over.

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:39.880
 Sure.

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:40.880
 In just a minute.

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:41.880
 Hi, Kathleen.

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:43.880
 Agnes, I just heard the good news.

00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:46.380
 I'm ready for Homer just to arrive.

00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:47.380
 Homer?

00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:48.380
 He's in the living room.

00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:51.080
 I don't know what brought him around, but I have a feeling we're going to make up any

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:52.080
 minute.

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:55.880
 Agnes, Homer's one thing to get excited about, but do you really think he compares to a horse?

00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:56.880
 In hot way.

00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:57.880
 In any way.

00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:58.880
 [LAUGHTER]

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:01.880
 My goodness, but hey, me tell me you were getting one from your uncle Clifford.

00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:03.880
 I almost dropped, you did.

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:04.880
 Uh-huh, right there in my veranda.

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:05.880
 You did?

00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:07.880
 About a thing like one of my uncle's horses?

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:09.880
 Agnes, how can you be so glad they?

00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:12.880
 What's so special about a picture of a horse?

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:14.880
 A picture?

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:16.880
 Agnes, the horse you're getting is a picture?

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:18.880
 Sure, drawn on a typewriter.

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:20.880
 Oh, my goodness!

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:22.880
 You mean you thought it was a real one?

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:23.880
 What did you say?

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:24.880
 They did.

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:25.880
 They thought...

00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:27.880
 Wait a minute!

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:28.880
 Agnes, what's wrong?

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:29.880
 So fast.

00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:31.880
 So that's why Homer came sneaking back.

00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:34.880
 I had my Benedict Arnold.

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:35.880
 I just...

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:38.880
 You and Homer came around because he saw how Kathleen...

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:40.880
 Homer!

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:41.880
 What are you gonna do?

00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:44.380
 I'm gonna get even. That's what I'm gonna do.

00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:45.880
 Homer!

00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:47.880
 What are you calling me, Agnes?

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:49.880
 Yes, Homer, doll.

00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:50.880
 What's that?

00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:53.880
 I've been thinking Homer. We don't want to fight, do we?

00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:56.880
 Boy, especially now that I'm getting a horse.

00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:57.880
 A horse?

00:12:57.880 --> 00:12:58.880
 You knew I was getting one?

00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:00.880
 Boy, I've heard rumors.

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:02.880
 That's what I saw.

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:04.880
 In honor of our making up, you know what?

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:08.880
 I'm gonna write to my Uncle Clifford and ask him to send you one of his horses too.

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:09.880
 What?

00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:10.880
 Agnes!

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:12.880
 Haffling, it's no more than he deserves.

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:14.880
 But, but, Gee, do you think you're sure?

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:15.880
 Why not?

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:18.880
 He's got more horses like that than he can give away.

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:19.880
 She, Agnes, Gee.

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:21.880
 Is it a deal?

00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:22.880
 Sure.

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:27.880
 And Agnes, I want you to know I've never seen anyone with a nicer nature.

00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:49.880
 [Music]

00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:52.880
 I'm now getting back to the troubles of Henry Alberts.

00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:58.880
 Agnes correctly guessing that Homer made up with her because he thought she was getting a real horse.

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:08.880
 It's now getting even. She told Homer he too would get a horse from a uncle, but what she didn't tell him is that the horse in question is a picture drawn on a typewriter.

00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:11.880
 It is the next day in the scene opens in Homer's garage.

00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:14.880
 Have you got the tape measure against the edge of the wall, Henry?

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:17.880
 Sure, start stretching it toward the other wall.

00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:18.880
 Okay.

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:25.880
 Boy, Henry, can't you just see us in our boots and saddles galloping off into the sunset on Whitey?

00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:26.880
 Whitey?

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:28.880
 That's what I'm gonna call my horse.

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:30.880
 Suppose he's black.

00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:31.880
 I'll call him dusty.

00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:34.880
 Have you got the tape to the other wall?

00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:36.880
 Not yet. This post is in a way.

00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:37.880
 Go around it.

00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:38.880
 Around it?

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:42.880
 We'll never find out how wide my garage is by going around post.

00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:45.880
 Sure you will, huh? When you get to the other wall, take off a foot.

00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:47.880
 Oh, okay.

00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:49.880
 No, my father's car is in the way.

00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:51.880
 Well, go over it.

00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:52.880
 Over it?

00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:54.880
 Yeah, and subtract another foot.

00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:56.880
 Okay.

00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:58.880
 How wide does it say the garages?

00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:00.880
 I'm putting the hand.

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:03.880
 I'm 12 and a half.

00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:05.880
 I was looking at the wrong side of the table.

00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:11.880
 12 and a half last two feet for the post and car last another two feet for lawnmowers, barrels and stuff.

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:15.280
 Oh, that leaves only two feet for the horse.

00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:16.680
 That isn't enough room.

00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:18.380
 Even if it's a small horse?

00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:19.380
 I know, but--

00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:20.880
 How big is a small horse?

00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:22.880
 Homer, it still isn't enough room.

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:23.880
 What do I do?

00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:26.380
 This is the only place where I can keep spotty.

00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:27.380
 Spotty?

00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:31.380
 That's why I'm going to call him if he comes in two different colors.

00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:34.380
 Who's in there?

00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:35.380
 Gee whiz.

00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:36.380
 Hi, Father.

00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:37.880
 Homer, your son.

00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:39.380
 That's what I thought.

00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:40.880
 It'll do you no good to hide.

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:46.260
 From why and it'll do you know good to play innocent either didn't I ask you to rake the leaves nearly a week ago?

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:49.960
 Wait, I believe the subject did come up and idle conversation

00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:53.960
 Oh my grab that rake off the wall and start sure father

00:15:53.960 --> 00:16:00.200
 Boy if a father asks a son to do something that's one thing that should come before everything else if the son's a son

00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:05.040
 And a father's his father and I want you to feel his freedom come to me as you want me to come to you

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:10.400
 Don't you oh my what are you up to he looks like he's up to something mr. Brown

00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:14.080
 He does father. I don't want you answer right off

00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:19.420
 But would it be too much trouble to move certain things out of the garage so I could move a certain thing

00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:21.820
 Move out of what certain things right?

00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:26.080
 Your car say and keep it in the driveway

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:31.900
 Absolutely not you promise not answer right off. Oh, but you realize what leaving it in the driveway

00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:35.020
 We'll do to my cars finish, but if I have to leave my horse outside

00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:39.980
 So I think what it'll do to his finish horse. Did I say horse horse father?

00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:41.620
 before you close your mind.

00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:43.380
 Would you consider this angle?

00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:45.580
 You can't give a horse another coat of pain.

00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:55.540
 The mother was just a joke.

00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:56.500
 Very well, dear.

00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:58.660
 If you want Homer to hate you for the rest of his life,

00:16:58.660 --> 00:16:59.980
 it's no concern of mine.

00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:01.940
 He'll hate me when it's so funny.

00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:04.260
 Agnes, Homer isn't going to think it's funny.

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:05.100
 No.

00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:08.060
 Well, I suppose I better tell him that it's all a big joke

00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:09.660
 and that I don't expect a real horse.

00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:12.260
 - Agnes, he'll explode. - He will, of course.

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:14.980
 Well, couldn't I say Uncle Clifford's had a...

00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:17.620
 a crock failure and ran out of horses.

00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:19.180
 You're going to lie?

00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:22.820
 Good mother, if I can't tell the truth and I can't lie, what can I do?

00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:26.780
 Agnes, this is your problem. I wash my hands of the whole thing.

00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:28.820
 [music playing]

00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:36.100
 I'm sorry, Agnes, but I don't think I could.

00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:37.100
 She was.

00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:38.100
 Why not?

00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:39.600
 I'm not asking Sheila to give up her career.

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:40.600
 I know, but the thing.

00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:41.900
 All I want you to do is render.

00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:43.700
 Tell me when she's through pulling your junk wagon.

00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:48.900
 Well, the fact of the matter is, Agnes, Sheila's just not the kind of a horse to take to a saddle.

00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:49.900
 She's not?

00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:51.500
 That goes a real outlaw.

00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:52.900
 But she pulls your junk wagon.

00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:54.600
 Well, that's something else again.

00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:56.600
 Besides, she's getting along.

00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:59.400
 When it comes to horses, Sheila ain't no chicken.

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:02.600
 Oh, sure, but I retired a year ago only.

00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:04.300
 She enjoys her work, so...

00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:05.100
 But, gosh!

00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:08.100
 Oh, she loves to hear them bells jingle.

00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:09.600
 Oh, God, I have to get a horse.

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:12.400
 If I don't, I'll lose homework permanently.

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:14.100
 That's bad, is it?

00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:15.100
 I'll say.

00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:17.300
 Well, now let's sing.

00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:19.100
 Say, tell you who my do.

00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:20.100
 Yes, God's who?

00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:23.100
 'Cause he wouldn't be entirely up to specification.

00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:24.100
 Oh.

00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:25.400
 Although with little imagination,

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:27.100
 he might be just what you want.

00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:27.600
 God!

00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:28.100
 What?

00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:29.100
 Whoa!

00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:31.680
 (upbeat music)

00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:40.820
 Do you need any help up there, father?

00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:42.460
 Father?

00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:45.120
 Gee, it's your gonna be a swell shed.

00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:48.860
 And I certainly wanna thank you for your cooperation.

00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:50.360
 Father?

00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:52.160
 Father, what are you doing now?

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:53.060
 Shingling.

00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:53.900
 Why?

00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:56.300
 Shingling, shingling, and shut up!

00:18:56.300 --> 00:18:57.940
 (audience laughing)

00:18:57.940 --> 00:18:58.860
 Yes?

00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:00.340
 Here's a glass of water, Will.

00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:01.260
 Yes.

00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:02.420
 Step back.

00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:03.780
 I'm coming down the ladder.

00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:06.140
 Homer, I just came from the Centerboat Feed Company

00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:07.460
 and they want $9.

00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:08.300
 Mm-hmm.

00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:09.140
 For what?

00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:09.980
 A sack of oats.

00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:10.980
 For just one sack?

00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:13.260
 Although these are the best you can get, Mr. Brown.

00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:14.580
 They're not only nutritious.

00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:15.900
 They're delicious, too.

00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:16.740
 You don't say.

00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:17.420
 Yeah?

00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:19.100
 I even brought along a sample.

00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:19.860
 Mm.

00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:20.860
 They are delicious.

00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:21.360
 Homer!

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:23.020
 [LAUGHTER]

00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:25.220
 You don't even know that it was sugar.

00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:27.180
 Mother, do you have any cream in the house?

00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:27.680
 Yes.

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:29.440
 You spoil your dinner.

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:32.080
 And if you're bothered by the tongue, they're even cheaper.

00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:33.040
 A tongue?

00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:35.040
 Henry, you buy just one sack.

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:37.120
 Yes, Mr. Brown, I'll go down right now.

00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:39.040
 And Homer, it's coming out of your allowance.

00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:39.880
 Moring?

00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:42.320
 This family costs me enough without my having to shell out

00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:44.480
 for anything that eats like a horse.

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:47.920
 Now step aside, while I go back up the ladder.

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:49.320
 Hi, everybody!

00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:50.720
 Well, Chiwiz, it's Adam.

00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:51.720
 What?

00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:52.920
 What's that cheese leading?

00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:55.760
 So, before you say anything, remember, it's time to do the job.

00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:56.560
 What is?

00:19:56.560 --> 00:20:00.560
 But when I realized you had your heart set, I couldn't disappoint you.

00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:03.560
 - That's the best thing. - I'm afraid this is the best I can do.

00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:05.560
 His name's Otis and he's a very good friend of Sheila.

00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:07.560
 - Yes, but... - He's not an outlaw or anything.

00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:10.560
 Gee, so gentle sometimes he doesn't move at all.

00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:13.560
 And you can have him every afternoon when he's through delivering vegetables.

00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:17.560
 - Thanks, Jim. - This is what you're giving me.

00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:18.560
 - Homer. - This?

00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:20.560
 Homer, there's no need to take that attitude.

00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:22.560
 A mule is as much a horse as any.

00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:25.320
 (dramatic music)

00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:34.260
 - Come on in and have a soda on me, homeroom time.

00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:37.560
 - Oh, Henry, a darn old Mothys new.

00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:38.400
 - How are you?

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:40.960
 - You're just getting upset over nothing.

00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:43.640
 You know what my father's gonna do with that stably built?

00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:45.040
 Turn it into a wood shed.

00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:46.080
 - Yeah? - Yeah.

00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:47.400
 - And you know who's gonna have to chop

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:49.520
 enough wood to fill with me?

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:50.360
 - Oh.

00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:51.400
 - A sack of oats.

00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:53.400
 What do I do with that?

00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:55.400
 Here, here's a booth over here.

00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:56.400
 Oh, gee whiz.

00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:57.400
 Agnes.

00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:58.400
 What do you want?

00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:00.400
 What are you doing with that lampag?

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:01.400
 What do you think?

00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:04.400
 I'm scratching out this heart with our names on the lampshade.

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:05.400
 You are?

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:08.400
 After what you said to me in your backyard, I never want to have another thing to do with you.

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:10.400
 Even on a lampshade.

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:11.400
 Well, same here.

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:13.400
 But if anyone's crossing that out, it's me.

00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:15.400
 How many of us have this lampag?

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:16.400
 I came in all the way.

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:17.400
 Oh, my.

00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:18.400
 And this quam.

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:19.400
 How is this?

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:21.400
 Oh boy!

00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:22.400
 You broke it!

00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:23.400
 That's all that.

00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:25.400
 Homer sit down next to me quick and watch for.

00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:27.400
 Do you want Mr. Dehaven to notice it's broken?

00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:28.400
 No.

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:29.400
 What do we do?

00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:31.400
 We'll have to get a fix somehow.

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:32.400
 We...

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:33.400
 You and I...

00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:35.400
 I and you...

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:37.400
 Let's go about that.

00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:41.400
 Listen, we can't desert each other when we're in common danger, Kenley.

00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:42.400
 No.

00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:44.400
 Let's call it temporary truths.

00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:45.400
 I guess it makes sense.

00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:46.400
 Sure it does Homer.

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:47.400
 Oh boy.

00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:48.400
 Thanks.

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:51.000
 I'm going to show you holding my hand.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.700
 I'm just trying to hide the lamp with my sleeve.

00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:54.700
 Oh.

00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:55.700
 In a way.
