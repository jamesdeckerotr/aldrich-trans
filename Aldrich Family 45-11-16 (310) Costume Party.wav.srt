00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,160
 Great much, and great much place.

3
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,160
 Is that...

00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,400
 [Music]

5
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,240
 Can you see all this coming out of here?

00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:27,360
 [Applause]

7
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,620
 They all look thunder.

8
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:31,060
 They say, "Don't tell me if you're here to let me go."

9
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:33,060
 I'm sorry, nothing's wrong with him.

10
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:35,060
 They say, "Don't tell me, don't tell me, don't tell me."

11
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:38,560
 I'm walking in my face, and I'm a great black person.

12
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,660
 All around there, he's going to want to take him

13
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:43,660
 play when he hits the lake, not.

14
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:46,660
 And great, not play.

15
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:50,660
 You're now the favorite black flute studio.

00:00:50,660 --> 00:01:10,660
 [Music]

17
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:13,660
 And now for the Audrey family.

18
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:19,660
 Henry Aldrich is a typical American boy that revolves all the sometimes somewhere.

19
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:25,660
 Yes, Henry is a familiar to all of us. I please show this baseball and I'm the most patient able.

20
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:29,660
 The scene opens in the Aldrich living room.

21
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:33,660
 Gee, you ladies, how am I having you any ideas at all?

22
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,660
 I told you, no, I'm learning to say.

23
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:36,660
 Why not?

24
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:42,660
 Because the last time I went to a mad monastery I was giving a board for a social activity for a week.

25
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:47,360
 is going to have a prize for the best costume and hot dog to best them all pie

26
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,100
 this little time they are here

27
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:53,660
 I think they have to go to the free part of the horse

28
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:59,060
 they are a lot worried me as a cat named mother is making her a costume just

29
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:03,700
 especially for this masquerade and I can't think of a single thing I can go at

30
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:07,980
 it would be free to go and buckle a bill but I want to wear a costume that'll

31
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:09,980
 I'm kind of mad to Kathleen.

32
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:11,980
 I thought we could go into Buffalo.

33
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:13,980
 I don't know how much be sensible.

34
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,980
 We haven't much time.

35
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:18,980
 Well, wait, wait, wait, we can fully calculate and find out where I calculate.

36
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:20,980
 That's a very good idea, Homer.

37
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:22,980
 I can't phone her right now.

38
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,980
 Oh, K-2-7.

39
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:29,980
 Oh, do you suppose we're going to kill you and you can kill me to stay in the creek?

40
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:33,980
 Homer, please try to control yourself, especially when I'm finding Kathleen.

41
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:34,980
 Hello?

42
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,260
 I'm glad you're getting me.

43
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:38,060
 You're kidding, but I'm very busy right now.

44
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:39,220
 I'm having a feeling.

45
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:40,060
 A what?

46
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:40,900
 A feeling.

47
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,900
 You know, from my last year I passed now.

48
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,700
 You have been this woman I wanted to talk to you about.

49
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:46,580
 My feeling?

50
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:47,080
 Sure.

51
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,740
 I was just wondering what it is you were having fitted.

52
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:52,900
 You know, I'm telling you, I'm going into any of your friends there.

53
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,100
 I'm in the internship?

54
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,180
 Can I help you go now?

55
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,740
 I mean, my mother's calling me.

56
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:59,100
 She's got her mouth off of a can.

57
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,060
 Well, that's fine.

58
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,820
 I mean, thank you very much, Kathleen.

59
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:03,820
 Goodbye!

60
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:04,820
 Homer!

61
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:05,820
 Homer, what do you know?

62
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,820
 Pass me his going as an Indian princess.

63
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:11,820
 He's the only one who can't even decide to go as a lord.

64
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:14,820
 I wonder where I can get an Indian costume.

65
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,820
 So, what I look good is a...

66
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:18,820
 You can't do that, Homer.

67
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:19,820
 You can't go as an Indian.

68
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:20,820
 Why not?

69
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,820
 Well, he was because I'm going to be an Indian.

70
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:25,820
 He thought that's what you weren't interested in after a ride.

71
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:28,820
 That was the largest point of view, Henry.

72
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:31,820
 Well, if I'm Mrs. Out of town, who's going to go with you?

73
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:37,820
 I just said I do. A paper could be more likely to have two of you and do it in a normal movie.

74
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,820
 Listen Homer, Kathleen's mind girl.

75
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:43,820
 Thank you, Anthony. I wasn't suggesting for one minute if he wasn't.

76
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:47,820
 And I realized I was saying that I had not anything to do with it.

77
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,820
 Hey, Anthony, do you like being a holler?

78
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,820
 Are you calling on, Mother?

79
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:53,820
 He's coming to the dining room for a moment.

80
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:57,860
 You said you're a m

81
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:00,820
 I'll be right back.

82
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:04,120
 Did I get a new in-home or are you able to count me in-depth now?

83
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:04,820
 No, Mother.

84
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:09,320
 Homer just wants to help me take Kathleen to this mass grade we're going to and I said no.

85
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,620
 Now, I don't think that's a bit nice.

86
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:15,420
 Mother, you mean I said let Homer go every place with Kathleen and me?

87
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:18,820
 I think it's because we said all I said I think we can live whenever we can.

88
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,520
 And if you can do a plan, a good plan,

89
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,320
 I think you think,

90
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,320
 we're going to consider it a good time to get scared with Homer Brown.

91
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,620
 So, little, no more boy than you can be.

92
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:31,620
 and I want you to go right back and say you saved your mind.

93
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:33,620
 You mean right now?

94
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:37,620
 So how many of you did you like it to have in go along to this dance or whatever it is?

95
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:38,620
 You and Kathy?

96
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:42,620
 But you and my mother, you know, I've been on that and someday you'll want to call

97
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:44,620
 but to do the same for you.

98
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,620
 What do you do with me and Kathy?

99
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,620
 I said I go home.

100
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,620
 I'm a caller.

101
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:52,620
 You can help me take Kathleen to the master.

102
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,620
 I can, I really can.

103
00:04:54,620 --> 00:05:07,300
 Provided I escorted home afterwards and provided you don't think you're always in the end right here. I said you have you? Hey, hey, hey, oh boy. See how we can both go with anyone.

104
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:17,300
 [Music]

105
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,300
 Hi, I'm Iris.

106
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,300
 Is that you, Dad?

107
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,300
 Iris, are you in the kitchen?

108
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,300
 I'm in the room, Ty, but you're ready.

109
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,300
 Oh, your breakfast is ready.

110
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,300
 What's it doing in the room, Logan?

111
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,300
 It's a good thing you're in the room, Ty.

112
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,300
 It's sad, I don't like it for something.

113
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:33,300
 Go on, my, you can see my new brown hat in the glaze.

114
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,300
 My goodness, you know, didn't the horse even get mob yesterday?

115
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,900
 Yes, no, I can't find it.

116
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,600
 Well, they are in the toilet, doesn't they?

117
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,000
 I find myself a desk.

118
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 Alex, my hat is a good year more important than I've ever done to her.

119
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,200
 I didn't even tell the doctor before breakfast.

120
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:49,200
 I don't mean it, Sam. I just have to notice it isn't where the whole way is.

121
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,400
 Sam, all this big hat right there in the dining room.

122
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:52,900
 Where?

123
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,100
 On the chair.

124
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,200
 Now, will you please let me look for my doctor?

125
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,300
 I saw that hat on the chair, Alex, and it's not my hat.

126
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:02,400
 Alex, what's the girl hat? Very good, the brown hat you bought yesterday.

127
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,200
 Yes, Alex. That is a brown hat.

128
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:09,700
 But that hat I bought yesterday has a bright all-in feather in the band. That hat has nothing. Not even a band.

129
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:14,200
 I don't think I know if it's gonna be this far. My hat? I've never done so.

130
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:18,200
 Mother, that's Mother! I'm here to get in there. Oh, I'm just here to explain it.

131
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,200
 So they carry me, I've got to. What's happened to Henry now?

132
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,200
 It's in the Henry's water. It's my biddly.

133
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,200
 You know what? It's my biddly. Oh.

134
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:29,200
 Yep, Mother, this is the one that needs to have that lovely old red-seddy tail in it.

135
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,200
 And I'm a dirty-sail dog.

136
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:38,200
 No, it was not the fair detail. Alex, what am I going to do about my hat? I'm sure I don't know, Sam. You don't have to wear that brown hat to do my dining thing.

137
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:43,200
 Without my orange hair, Alex will... Oh, the girl is going to do about my shiny tail.

138
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:48,200
 Let's see, look at that, Anna game. Yeah, you think my feather does, Sam? You don't know the dress, Sam?

139
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:54,200
 I don't know, Sam. I don't know the dress, Sam. I'm sure I shouldn't say the call to you, Alex.

140
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,200
 What's happening up here, Sam? My feather is a feather.

141
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,200
 I'm going to have breakfast on top.

142
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,200
 Dad, I'm going to have breakfast on top.

143
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,200
 Dad, I'm going to have breakfast on top.

144
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,200
 Dad, I'm going to have breakfast on top.

145
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,200
 Dad, I'm going to have breakfast on top.

146
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,200
 Dad, I'm going to have breakfast on top.

147
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,200
 Dad, I'm going to have breakfast on top.

148
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,200
 Dad, I'm going to have breakfast on top.

149
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,200
 Dad, I'm going to have breakfast on top.

150
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,200
 Dad, I'm going to have breakfast on top.

151
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,200
 Dad, I'm going to have breakfast on top.

152
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,200
 Dad, I'm going to have breakfast on top.

153
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,200
 Dad, I'm going to have breakfast on top.

154
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,200
 Dad, I'm going to have breakfast on top.

155
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,200
 Dad, I'm going to have breakfast on top.

156
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:43,000
 I'll be up in a second. I'll be right back.

157
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 I did, guys. It's better not having home a lot.

158
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 Homer, how do you feel about scrambled eggs?

159
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 What's that?

160
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 Granny eggs!

161
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 Are you my own?

162
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 No, I'm getting a sign of this.

163
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 Look what I found.

164
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 It took a look at this.

165
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 It took seven inches to go up at the side of it.

166
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 Oh boy, where did you find it?

167
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 Oh, my name is Father's Poel.

168
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000

00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,360
 And it is great, not for energy.

345
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,000
 It's great, not for concentrated all around the world.

346
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,600
 including important feed values of the whole grain.

347
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:26,880
 A bowl of their body makes goodness get you off to a flying shot on a day.

348
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,000
 So take a tip and get a grip with a great smash.

 [MUSIC]

350
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,760
 And now I get into the troubles of Henry Aldrin.

351
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:45,000
 Henry and Homer, in an effort to make two Indian costumes,

352
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 to escort Kathleen to a masquerade, that borrowed all the feathers they'd been flying.

353
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 And now they've been informed like that later, she's going as expensive to India and sent

354
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 possibly receiving the company of two American Indians.

355
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 The thing opens in the woven drugstore.

356
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 Then we have Jason Lerman's flat face, giving him the salt and a pink hair.

357
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 Now that moment, besides your own self-friendly,

358
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,960
 Booking in the list, or is that heaven, man?

359
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:17,720
 He is a cat, we need to wanna be like that, we can be like that too.

360
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:22,400
 We're looking here, we're looking here, we're looking here, we're placing a princess out, that isn't what I mean.

361
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:28,300
 I mean, if he's gonna stand us up after all the trouble we've gone, then he won't take her to the masquerade at all.

362
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:29,800
 You're a hilly, sure.

363
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,700
 Oh, he's a little hilly, man.

364
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:35,400
 Oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, I would be like to be a hilly, man.

365
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,000
 For what?

366
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,900
 Homer and I are making ourselves a American Indian cat, too, Mr. the masquerade on Friday night.

367
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:44,340
 Geraldine, would you like to be an Indian children's out with us?

368
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:47,140
 Why, I think they all, you guys are basically wonderful, I believe.

369
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:48,700
 You really like it, Geraldine?

370
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:49,700
 I think you really like it, Geraldine.

371
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,100
 I think you really like it, Geraldine.

372
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,600
 Oh, yeah.

373
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,400
 And I'll be playing another one.

374
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,400
 What can I do?

375
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,700
 For the third of the year, you know?

376
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:57,900
 I can not continue?

377
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:58,900
 Are you looking at me?

378
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,300
 I don't have to expect that like that.

379
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:02,500
 But Geraldine, you know, I think you always do.

380
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,900
 I think that might be going a little too far.

 (music)

383
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:18,780
 Sam, I don't see how we can possibly get those feathers down from the ceiling without

384
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:20,180
 climbing up their acid.

385
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,380
 Let me try it with the broom first.

386
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:23,780
 Now stand back up.

387
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:24,780
 Please be careful.

388
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:28,020
 I'll jump up and try to create a breeze that'll knock them down.

389
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:30,020
 You'll be ready to start catching.

390
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:31,020
 Oh, I like you.

00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:34,020
 There, that's taking a move.

392
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:36,460
 Alice, get those coming down with a little help.

393
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:38,460
 Party there, going back up again.

 You're laughing at us.

 I'm not doing this for entertainment.

398
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:46,460
 I want to talk to you.

399
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:47,460
 Hello?

400
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:49,460
 Hello, is this your daughter?

401
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:50,460
 Yes.

402
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:52,460
 This is your daughter's meeting.

403
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:53,460
 What is your mother's meeting?

404
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:54,460
 Well, Mrs. Anderson.

405
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:56,460
 Well, Mrs. Anderson, we're talking about the life of the big two bars.

406
00:16:56,460 --> 00:17:00,460
 It's really unimportant, but the big thing means so much to children.

407
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:02,460
 Well, yes, of course Mrs. Anderson.

408
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:03,460
 I think it's a little bit of a constant,

409
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:06,460
 but Henry has a normal plan on letting you evacuate next Friday.

410
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:10,460
 Yes, so I'm afraid I don't know anything about their constant here, Mrs. Anderson.

411
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:12,460
 They are a young girl and giving in to this.

412
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:13,460
 And what?

413
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:14,460
 An awesome Indian.

414
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:16,460
 Her name is the bulldog that's speaking in.

415
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:19,460
 And they were carrying around logs that's a better thing.

416
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:22,460
 They did say, "They said it's a better thing to do."

417
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:24,460
 They said, "They're collecting that one Indian, who's there?"

418
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,460
 They said, "Come here."

419
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:27,460
 They thought it was a long way to go.

420
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:29,460
 Oh, no, Indian is a better thing.

421
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:30,460
 Just one moment, too.

00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:31,460
 You call me Alex?

423
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:32,460
 Oh, still a minute, Alex?

00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,460
 Don't move.

425
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:35,460
 I said, "It is a nice idea."

426
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:36,460
 I was going to do one.

 Oh, there you go.

00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,460
 Under that minute.

431
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,460
 Are you all right, Mr. Vollig?

432
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:45,460
 Oh, yes, I'm sorry, Mr. Vollig.

433
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:48,460
 I thought the boy was in the top of his drawing.

434
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:54,480
 It really isn't terribly important, but I thought he was trouble making a copy of the

 cat's room.

436
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,480
 He's going at the Pinterest or media.

437
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,480
 So where is the guy in the game?

438
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,480
 In the app.

00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,480
 That's how it is.

00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,480
 It's coming over.

 It's crazy.

00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,480
 When you see the dog taking that feather, what did you say about talking to Mr. Vollig?

00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:08,480
 about talking to them. I'm going to go ahead and do well. The boys have a strong making

 and Indian costume and I'll tell you what it is.

00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:38,480
 And Indian costume? What's wrong with you?

453
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,480
 I'm going to draw the princess in India, but I've changed my mind.

454
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,480
 I've decided to draw in American Indian and still.

455
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,480
 My goodness, and American Indian!

456
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,480
 You're a princess, and you're going to go to the North Indian.

457
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:52,480
 And if I was going one day, then I'd ask you another girl.

458
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,480
 Or she'd go, "Where are you?"

459
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,480
 In my Mary, it's dead.

00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:59,480
 I'm sorry, I only decided I need to go to the place next to India.

 You don't talk to me?

00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,480
 Why not?

00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:05,480
 My goodness, if I have to wear a bow over the long time, I say to the last over my eyes,

 So I just ate a few out of the way that started.

 They have a little tail of feathers that goes right near our back.

 That would be tight. You know you have anything you think.

00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:46,440
 Anyway, how did all these studies get down here?

478
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,600
 I was about to ask you the same question.

00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,400
 Well, they learn if I got a glass of water.

481
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,400
 Get it on over.

482
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,400
 Now, yeah, maybe I'll begin with the orange feather that belongs in my hat.

483
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:03,400
 That feather is perfectly safe, Father. I haven't had an envelope up stairs.

00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,400
 I see.

485
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,400
 Would you like to have me into the phone, Father?

486
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,400
 No, I would not.

487
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,400
 I like to, Father.

 sanitary feather that's floating around his house.

 to collect my grandfather or couldn't use an act. You make me whatever you wish. And when you have him collect he's gonna throw them away.

00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:32,400
 Oh, then father? Yes, along with those takers that is. Yes, he's doing it again. Yes? Yeah, that's what you're saying.

494
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,400
 That's what you're saying is going to be the costume, right? What are you going to do, Bob?

495
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,400
 He thinks he can find the eye dark costume for him in his helmet.

496
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:41,400
 You have no eye dark costume, he's going to be the eye dark costume for him in his helmet.

497
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:46,560
 I told him that the scene is both over the masquerade as Roger, so there's no costume in the match I didn't even...

498
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:49,740

 But Kathleen, you are getting wise, our costumes. I definitely wish you made them go live.

 because I never leave a press machine,

618
