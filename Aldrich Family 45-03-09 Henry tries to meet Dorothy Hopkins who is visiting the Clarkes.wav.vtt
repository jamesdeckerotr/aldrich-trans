 [Music]

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 Henry! Henry Aldrich!

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.500
 Coming, mother!

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.000
 The Aldrich family!

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
 A special rebroadcast for you soldiers, sailors, and Marines of the United Nations.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:38.340
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.560
 And now for the Aldrich family with Dick Jones as Henry

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.080
 and Jackie Calcas-Homer.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.360
 There's one secret a teenage boy like Henry Aldrich never

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:48.440
 knows.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.120
 The troubles he can get into are familiar to all grownups.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.800
 His mishaps of today are his memories of tomorrow.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.200
 The scene opens at the Center for Railroad Square.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.200
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:07.280
 Homer, look at her.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.240
 Look at her.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.600
 Oh boy, is she good-looking?

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.440
 Oh boy, Henry.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.680
 That's a loud Homer.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.160
 Look at her.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.600
 She must be coming to visit the Clark.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.600
 Oh boy, Henry.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.840
 What are you supposed to name this?

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.080
 How should I know what her name is?

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.720
 She's kissing Charlie Clark's mother.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.880
 Oh boy.

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.880
 And now she's kissing Charlie's father.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.800
 Oh boy.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.400
 And now she's-- she's shaking hands with Charlie.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.400
 Oh.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.080
 Listen, Homer, close your mouth.

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.920
 Look, Henry, they're putting her in the car

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.320
 and driving off with you.

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:45.680
 Where do you suppose they're going?

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.200
 Up to Charlie's house.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.040
 Hey look, she dropped something, Homer.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.120
 Come on, let's see what it is.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.320
 Hey, Charlie, your friend dropped something.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.080
 Hey, Charlie, come back.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.920
 Here it is.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:56.760
 It's an envelope.

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:57.600
 An envelope?

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.440
 Is it for me?

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:59.440
 No, Homer.

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:00.280
 (audience laughing)

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.120
 It's got a name on it.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.600
 Miss Dorothy Hopkins.

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.080
 Dorothy Hopkins?

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.960
 Do you suppose that's her name?

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.400
 Is there anything in the envelope?

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.240
 No.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.320
 Listen, give me that.

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:10.200
 What are you gonna do with it?

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.360
 I'm gonna keep it.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.200
 Boy, I haven't seen a girl that good

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.460
 Looking all winter.

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.220
 (dramatic music)

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:27.580
 - Come on, Henry.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.140
 This next block down there is where Charlie Clark lives.

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.100
 Boy, wait 'til I ever ask Charlie to do me a favor again.

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.340
 You just wait, Homer.

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:35.940
 - Did he hang up when you asked him

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.100
 if you could meet Dorothy?

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:38.340
 - Sure he did.

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.300
 Look out, I'm gonna start limping.

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.100
 - Henry, that's no way to do it.

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.500
 You mean you're just gonna limp in and meet Dorothy?

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:45.260
 Why not?

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.900
 She whiz.

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.420
 Henry, you've gotta do it right.

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.900
 You've gotta fall down right in front of the car town.

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.600
 For sure.

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.340
 You mean, just walk along and then all of a sudden fall down?

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.940
 No.

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.460
 You start running, see?

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.820
 And then I'll trip you, and then I'll carry you in.

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:01.260
 Now listen, Homer, I'm not gonna do anything like that.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
 I can fall down without your help of me.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.060
 Come on, we'll just be jogging along.

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.060
 OK.

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.660
 And just as you fall, Henry, be laughing.

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.700
 Well, here I go, Homer.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.060
 Now listen, Henry, what did you do this to me for?

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.740
 Did you fall down too, Homer?

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:17.740
 You can't get up.

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:18.940
 I can't get up.

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.340
 Homer, you didn't fall any harder than I did.

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:22.540
 Come on over here and pick me up.

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.180
 Boy, I think I broke my arm.

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.540
 Oh, no, you didn't.

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:27.700
 I know you, Homer.

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.700
 You're just trying to get Dorothy's sympathy.

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:30.620
 Now, come on.

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.220
 I've got a lie here until you pick me up.

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.620
 Well, hold up your head so I can get a hold of you.

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:36.980
 Easy now, Homer.

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:37.660
 Easy.

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.380
 Why, you didn't hurt yourself.

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.100
 That doesn't make any difference.

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.380
 Is anyone looking out the window yet?

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:46.220
 Can I stop trying to show off and give me some cooperation?

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.020
 Boy, are you heavy.

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.660
 Look, help me up the steps.

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.540
 And don't forget, as soon as she gets me straighten out on the sofa,

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.980
 you're just so you've got to beat it home and get me some rubbing you in a minute.

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:57.220
 Oh, no, I don't.

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.420
 I stay right there with you.

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.300
 I don't trust you.

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:02.300
 Someone's coming to the door.

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.300
 They are?

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.220
 Listen, Homer, why'd you drop me for her?

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:08.100
 Hello there, boys.

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.140
 What's going on here?

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:11.020
 Oh, hello, Mr. Clark.

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:13.320
 Henry, what are you lying there on the porch for?

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:19.820
 Why, I tell you, Mr. Clark, Homer, I mean, I just fell down.

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.520
 Didn't anyone see me out the window?

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:23.020
 Oh no, did you hurt yourself?

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:27.720
 Well, just as soon as I get in on the sofa, Mr. Clark, I think I'll be all right.

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.720
 Well, if you hurt your leg pretty bad, you just put your arm around my shoulder and let me lead you.

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.220
 See, that'd be swell, Mr. Clark.

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.720
 All right, here we go.

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.520
 But Mr. Clark, we're going down the steps.

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.820
 That's right, I've got my car out here, now it's just on my way downtown and now.

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:42.420
 But Mr. Clark, we were on our way inside.

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:44.020
 Well, Homer, you get around the other side of Henry.

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:45.820
 Yes, sir. But where are we going?

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.820
 Down to the hospital. I'll have him there in two minutes.

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:48.820
 To the hospital?

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:50.620
 Listen, Henry, I'm going home.

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.520
 [LAUGHTER]

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.820
 Homer, what did you drop me a damn for?

 [CHEERING]

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.320
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:08.820
 Henry, are you home?

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:11.060
 I'm sure I'm home, Homer. Who's in jail over here?

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.460
 Nobody. I just thought I'd come over and see how...

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:15.700
 Listen, Henry, what happened at the hospital?

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:17.160
 Nothing, Homer. Nothing at all.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:18.620
 Well, who would they do to you?

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:19.820
 They didn't do anything.

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:22.020
 From Mr. Clark was trying to get someone to take care of me,

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:23.340
 I sneaked out and ran home.

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:25.900
 She is. And he doesn't know where you are?

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:27.380
 No. How could he?

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:30.700
 Well, listen, Henry. You know that envelope of Dorothy's you picked up?

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:33.740
 Yeah. Well, why don't we call her up and tell her we found it?

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:36.740
 Homer, you're crazy. Why would she want with an empty envelope?

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:37.940
 She probably threw it away.

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:40.820
 Alright, alright, then let's not tell what it is.

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:42.820
 We'll just say we've got something of hers,

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:44.820
 and would she like to have us bring it over?

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:45.620
 Where's the phone?

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:47.620
 Now wait a minute, Homer, did Nysh your first?

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:48.980
 Did Nysh pick up the envelope?

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:50.180
 Isn't this my phone?

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:51.380
 Hello?

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:52.180
 Hello operator?

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:55.140
 But him, Aaron, too crazy about your old in love.

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:56.740
 Why'd be a pig in a manger?

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:00.260
 Oh, I want L-889.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:01.300
 L-889?

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.180
 But, G-Henry, don't you realize I like her too?

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:05.460
 And I and I, your friend.

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.460
 But sure, Homer, of course you are.

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:10.580
 That's why I'm gonna ask Dorothy whether she doesn't have a friend who would like to meet you.

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:16.980
 Oh no you're not. Every time anybody meets a pretty girl they say can she get a friend someplace behind her?

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:19.380
 And boy what a beating I've taken.

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:21.380
 Bob? Bob is this Charlie Carr?

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:22.260
 Yes who's this?

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.420
 Wait it's just... just...

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:24.980
 Oh?

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:28.020
 Well why um is Miss Dorothy Hopkins visiting you?

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:29.940
 Listen Henry Aldrich is that you?

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:34.580
 Wait... yes. Oh hello Charlie I thought I recognized your voice.

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:36.340
 What do you want to talk to Dorothy for?

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:39.940
 Never mind. I happen to have a very important message for him.

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:42.540
 And I think she'd like very much to have me give it to her personally.

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:45.540
 Is that so? All right. Hold the line a second.

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:47.740
 You mean you're going to call her? Charlie?

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:49.740
 Is he going to hit me? Is he going to?

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:51.740
 Sure he's going to. He can't bluff me, Homer.

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:55.140
 I'll say he can. That's the only way to handle Charlie.

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:57.540
 Just talk right up to him and put him in his place.

00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:59.940
 Hello? Oh. Hello.

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:02.940
 I... I...

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:04.940
 Is that you?

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:06.940
 Yes?

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:09.940
 Well, yeah, I guess you wonder...

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:11.940
 I'm Henry Orr, you see, and...

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:14.940
 Probably Charlie hasn't told you, but...

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:16.940
 I play center on a basketball team.

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:17.940
 Yes, I know!

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:19.940
 You know?

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:21.940
 Is that a ride?

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:24.940
 Did you happen to know about the track meet I was in last spring?

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:28.940
 I mean, well, I didn't win in the first, but I got two-thirds,

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:31.940
 and I might have won the poll vote if I hadn't broken my poll.

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:32.940
 Yes, I know how about it!

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:34.940
 Is that a ride?

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:37.940
 Well, I guess I know almost as much about you too.

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:39.940
 I saw you downtown this morning.

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:40.940
 You did?

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:41.940
 Down by the station.

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:44.940
 Boy, the man I saw you.

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:46.940
 Boy.

00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:48.940
 The station? I wasn't down at the station today.

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:51.940
 Sure you were. And you dropped something.

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:53.940
 Wouldn't you like to have me bring it over?

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:54.940
 Is this Henry Aldridge?

00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:56.940
 Sure, isn't this Dorothy Hopkins?

00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:58.940
 No, it's Geraldine Love.

00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:00.940
 How'd you know I was over here at Charlie Parks?

00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:02.940
 Geraldine?

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:03.940
 Geraldine, not Dorothy?

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:05.440
 You're Geraldine Long.

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:08.440
 Henry, all, should you think you were talking to Donnie Hopkins like that?

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:09.940
 How'd you get on the phone?

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:11.940
 Charlie told me you wanted to speak to me.

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:15.940
 And if you're that hot-up to me, if you're clean as of any girl that happens to come into town,

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:17.440
 Henry, would you go after her?

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:19.940
 He never mind. Just forget the whole thing. Goodbye.

00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:21.940
 Come on, Henry. Shall we start over?

00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:24.940
 No, Homer. I think we'd better just rock the whole thing.

00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:25.940
 whole thing.

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:36.940
 (Music)

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:37.940
 Hello Mr. Allerich speaking.

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:39.940
 Hello Mr. Allerich this is Mr. Clark.

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:40.940
 Oh yes Mr. Clark good morning.

00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:43.940
 I'm sorry to bother you but I'm down at the hospital and I need some advice.

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:44.940
 Yes?

00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:45.940
 Have you been in an accident?

00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:46.940
 Well no not exactly that.

00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:48.940
 Well whatever it is I'll be glad to help you out.

00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:49.940
 What's the trouble?

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:50.940
 Well I don't know how to begin.

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:52.940
 Have you heard from Henry?

00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:55.940
 A man, Ray? No. No, why would I hear from him?

00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:57.940
 Well, I guess I better tell you the whole thing, Mr. Aldrich.

00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:00.940
 I don't want to upset you, but he fell down in front of our house, eh?

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:02.940
 Yes. And he's over at the hospital?

00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:06.940
 Well, he was here, but when I stepped out of the receiving room for a minute, he disappeared.

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:08.940
 He disappeared? What became of it?

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:14.940
 Well, that's what we don't know. I have phoned your house a couple of times. The line was busy, but let me assure you there ain't anything to worry about, Mr. Aldrich.

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:15.940
 I just think you should know about it.

00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:17.940
 Yes, of course. Was he able to walk?

00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:22.620
 to walk by yes yes at least I helped him in another car and nobody's only the

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:25.860
 hospital so we think he must still be around here yes well I'll be right down

00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:28.740
 and Mr. Clark all I have to do is call the courthouse and cancel two hearings

00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:31.260
 well how you about it Mr. Aldrich could you call my secretary and tell me to

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.780
 cancel all my appointments for this morning well that's very kind of you

00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:35.140
 Mr. Clark I'd be glad to call her

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:48.320
 Now listen Charlie Clark, go on, get away from in front of our house.

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:49.980
 You make me Henry, you make me.

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:52.360
 Henry come on, close your window and ignore him.

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:53.760
 Homer stop pulling on my shirt.

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:55.420
 They know how to handle Charlie.

00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:57.320
 Charlie I want to tell you something.

00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:59.660
 You're standing out there on my father's front lawn.

00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:02.060
 And he spent a lot of money on grass seed last fall.

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:05.460
 And if none of it comes up next summer, I'm going to tell him who's the cause of it.

00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:07.220
 And let me tell you something.

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:09.420
 What is it you've got that belongs to Dorothy Hopkins?

00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:10.600
 And why should I tell you?

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:13.620
 Because she's my cousin and she told me to come over and get it, that's why.

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:14.620
 Is that so?

00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:16.620
 Well, in the first place, I don't even have anything.

00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:18.420
 Oh, yes you have. Oh, yes you have.

00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:20.020
 And what's more, I know what it is.

00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:21.420
 All right, then what is it?

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:22.520
 What is it?

00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:24.620
 Never mind, never mind.

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:26.620
 But you've got to throw it down to me right away.

00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:29.020
 And I want to tell you another thing, a bit breaks when you throw it.

00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:30.020
 You're responsible.

00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:31.120
 Is that so?

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:32.520
 That shows you how much you know.

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:34.120
 Hey, Henry, keep him there a second.

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:36.120
 Will I go get a glass of water to throw it?

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:37.920
 [LAUGHTER]

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:40.620
 Only instead of just a glass full, get a lot.

00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:42.620
 Henry, for the last time, do you hear me?

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:44.120
 Yes, I hear you.

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:46.660
 So you want me to throw something down to you, huh?

00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:47.460
 Yes, I do.

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:49.460
 Well, come up here under the window

00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:50.660
 so you can really catch it.

00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:51.400
 Why?

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:53.380
 Charlie, I hope you don't think I'm gonna throw anything

00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:55.020
 as valuable as this to your way out there

00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:56.460
 and have you miss it.

00:10:56.460 --> 00:10:58.860
 All right, then I'm standing closer.

00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:00.780
 That isn't close enough.

00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:02.820
 Come a little closer.

00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:03.980
 How about this?

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:04.740
 Here you are, Henry.

00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:05.740
 Here's the water.

00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:06.900
 What can I have got in here?

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:07.980
 Oh, she's risen.

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:09.980
 What would you do, fill a bathroom waste basket?

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:10.820
 (audience laughs)

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:12.740
 Hurry up, I can hardly carry you.

00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:13.580
 Here, let me have it.

00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:15.940
 Oh, no, Henry, I can shoot straight of the new can.

00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:17.860
 OK, but wait until I tell you to.

00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:19.380
 Oh, Charlie, hurry up.

00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:20.460
 I'm hurrying.

00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:22.500
 I just want to explain one thing.

00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:24.380
 When you see Dorothy, be sure you have tarred.

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:25.380
 You asked for it.

00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:26.540
 Stand back, Henry.

00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:27.380
 Henry?

00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:29.220
 Oh, she was, mother's at you down there.

00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:30.020
 Henry, look out.

00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:31.180
 Oh, don't throw it.

00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:33.020
 What are you doing up in that window, Henry?

00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:33.580
 Right.

00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:35.180
 Just getting some fresh air, mother.

00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:36.020
 I'm closing it.

00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:41.900
 Now listen Henry, look what you make me do.

00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:43.100
 Oh boy, you homework.

00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:44.740
 Yes, but all over my room.

00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:46.100
 All over your room.

00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:47.380
 All over myself.

00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:48.540
 Look at her.

00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:50.460
 Well, don't stand there looking at yourself.

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:53.140
 Come on, help me mop it up before it leaks through to the living room.

00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:54.660
 What do I mop it up with?

00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:55.420
 Here.

00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:56.500
 Here, use my pajamas.

00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:58.260
 Have one of them for a week anyhow.

00:11:58.260 --> 00:11:59.500
 Come on.

00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:01.220
 Charlie Clark's still out there.

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:02.820
 I don't know, and I don't care.

00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:04.180
 Oh, yes, mother?

00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:05.980
 Is that you downstairs?

00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:06.580
 Hello.

00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:08.940
 - Will you come down here right, isn't it, Katie?

00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:10.580
 - Yes, mother, sure.

00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:11.860
 Do you notice anything leaking?

00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:14.500
 I mean, it's everything all right down there.

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:15.660
 - What?

00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:17.100
 - Hey, Mom, what's the idea of mopping up

00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:18.820
 and ringing it right out on the floor again?

00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:19.820
 (audience laughing)

00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:21.740
 - I'm ringing it, Mrs. Bazbear.

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:22.860
 - Can't wait!

00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:25.500
 - Yes, mother, don't bother to come all the way up here.

00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:26.700
 You saved yourself.

00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:27.700
 I'm coming down there.

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:29.020
 - Then please hurry.

00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:31.100
 - Oh, you mean, you wanna have a talk with me

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:31.940
 about something?

00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:34.380
 - Yes, dear, and I want you to sit down here.

00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:35.220
 - Yes, mother.

00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:39.220
 I've just been having a talk with Charlie Clark and to say the least Henry, I'm surprised.

00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:40.220
 You're surprised?

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:41.220
 Yes.

00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:45.220
 And don't keep looking up at the ceiling. Please look at me and let the ceiling take care of itself.

00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:48.220
 Oh, excuse me. What did Charlie Clark say?

00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:54.220
 Now what do you think he said? He said you stole something that belongs to a cousin of his named Dorothy Hopkins.

00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:57.220
 He said that? He said I stole something from her?

00:12:57.220 --> 00:13:00.220
 Yes, dear. And I don't think Charlie would say a thing like that if he didn't have a reason, would he?

00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:04.220
 But, Mother, I give you my word. I don't steal things. Not from anybody.

00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:10.220
 Remember, the only time I ever stole anything in my life was that pocket full of candy out of a box in your bureau drawer

00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:15.220
 about five years ago, and I got caught, and it made me sick. And the site I didn't like it.

00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:18.220
 Ben, do you know why Charlie said you took comfort?

00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:22.220
 Well, all I can say is he certainly got a powerful imagination.

00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:26.220
 He told me that what you have of this Darth is extremely valuable.

00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:28.220
 He said that. He said that.

00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:33.220
 He certainly did, and he's going all around town saying you stole it, and I'm going to do something about it.

00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:33.380

 Did you have a talk with the nurse, Mr. Olga?

00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:53.220
 I've had a talk with all the nurses. I've just had a talk with the gentleman at the head of this hospital.

00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:54.220
 And what did he say?

00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:58.220
 He said Henry couldn't possibly be here. He's never had anyone disappear in his hospital before.

00:13:58.220 --> 00:13:59.220
 And that's cooperation for you.

00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:02.260
 for you. Oh he's doing all he can and Mr. Clark I want you to stop feeling that

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:05.140
 this is all your fault. Mr. Orange I don't want to worry you but I've been

00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:08.540
 thinking when I first picked Henry up he was talking about his leg and maybe it

00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:11.940
 was but but what you don't think he could have hit his head too do you.

 [applause]

00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:53.780
 Now getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldrich.

00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:56.340
 In his efforts to meet the new girl that's in town,

00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:59.060
 Henry first tried to make out he heard his leg.

00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:02.940
 Next he let her to believe that an empty envelope, which he dropped at the station,

00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:05.500
 is really something of considerable value.

00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:09.900
 As the scene opens at Charlie Clark's house, the young lady in question is speaking.

00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:12.620
 Oh, I don't blame you, Charlie. I agree with you entirely.

00:17:12.620 --> 00:17:14.420
 And I'm glad to hear you say that, Dorothy.

00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:18.540
 Charlie, I wonder what it could be of mine that Henry Aldrich has.

00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:20.380
 You mean you're having any idea what it is?

00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:22.340
 I can't think of anything.

00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:24.180
 Unless it could be my wristwatch.

00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:26.220
 Oh, your wristwatch. You've lost it?

00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:31.100
 Well, I haven't lost it exactly. I thought I left it at home on my bureau.

00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:32.860
 Because the catch was broken on the stress.

00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:34.540
 But it still might be your watch, my nit?

00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:38.740
 Well, tell me, after he refused to throw it out, what did you say?

00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:42.540
 I said, listen, Henry Aldrich, I don't intend to have any cousin of mine that says,

00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:45.740
 "Find a young lady as Dorothy Hopkins is, insulted like this."

00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:47.940
 Oh, really? Then what did he say?

00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:51.540
 He didn't say anything. He thought I was going to climb up the side of the house and beat him up,

00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:52.740
 so he closed the window.

00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:54.340
 You scared him? You really did?

00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:57.140
 Sure I did. I even told his mother on him.

00:17:57.140 --> 00:18:00.740
 Well, frankly, I don't blame Geraldine Muff for getting mad at these bad kind of a boy.

00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:03.140
 And did you see Geraldine stuck out of here and beat it home?

00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:05.060
 She said she was never going to speak to Henry again.

00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:08.060
 I know. And did you notice she was sort of mad at me too?

00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:10.380
 It wasn't my fault he took my watch.

00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:13.300
 You mean he did take it? I thought you said he didn't take it.

00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:18.300
 Well, Charlie, the more I think about it, the more I think about it,

00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:20.780
 maybe I didn't leave my watch at home.

00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:23.860
 Maybe I did put it on just absent-mindedly,

00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:26.580
 and when I got off at the station, that's where I dropped it.

00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:28.300
 Sure you did, of course you did.

00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:29.580
 What do you suppose that is?

00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:32.180
 I don't know, but I'd be willing to make a bet as to who it is.

00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:33.080
 It's probably Henry.

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:34.780
 Really? Do you think you're really scared

00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:35.980
 in the debris in my watch bag?

00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:36.980
 Sure I did.

00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:39.280
 You should have heard me talk to him, Dorothy.

00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:41.680
 How do you do, Charlie? This is Mrs. Aldrich.

00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:42.780
 Oh, how do you do?

00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:44.280
 Is your mother in, Charlie?

00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:46.080
 No, ma'am, she isn't Mrs. Aldrich.

00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:47.180
 Are you quite sure?

00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:47.980
 Yes, ma'am.

00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:49.880
 She got word that my father's down at the hospital,

00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:50.980
 so she went down there.

00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:51.880
 Oh, really?

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:54.080
 I didn't know your father had gone to the hospital.

00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:55.880
 Oh, I'm terribly sorry to hear it,

00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:57.580
 especially at a time like this.

00:18:57.580 --> 00:18:59.680
 Did you bring Dorothy's watch over Mrs. Aldrich?

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:00.280
 Her watch?

00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:01.080
 Yes, ma'am.

00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:02.680
 Didn't Henry confess to you?

00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:18.080
 You know, Henry, the more I think about it, the more I wonder.

00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:20.580
 The more you wonder what?

00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:23.580
 Whether we shouldn't come right out and tell the truth.

00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:27.480
 But all we picked up was an empty envelope with Dorothy's name on it.

00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:28.680
 Homer, you're crazy.

00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:31.020
 Do you think if we did say that, anybody'd believe us?

00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:31.940
 Why wouldn't they?

00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:34.540
 You'd say, "Why did we pick up an empty envelope?"

00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:36.700
 As a matter of fact, why did we?

00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:38.200
 Don't you remember Homer?

00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:39.980
 Dorothy's a darn good looking girl.

00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:43.880
 I know, Henry, but no girl's worth what we're going through.

00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:45.580
 That's no way to talk, Homer.

00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:48.140
 I don't mind being persecuted like this for her sake.

00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:49.900
 As a matter of fact, my mother will probably straighten

00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:51.020
 the whole thing out.

00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:52.060
 She's over there right now.

00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:54.660
 Boy, will she make a fool out of Charlie?

00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:55.940
 Of course she will.

00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:58.140
 And do you know what I have a good mind to do?

00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:00.840
 I think I'll call a Clark's house and if both the answers I'll say.

00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:03.840
 Dorothy, could you deliver a very important message to Charlie?

00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:06.540
 Who you may think is a gentleman but I happen to know a couple of things about him.

00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:08.240
 I wouldn't tell him how much you paid me.

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:10.840
 Because I'm not the kind that goes around talking about people.

00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:12.440
 Boy, that'll hold him.

00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:13.340
 Sure.

00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:14.940
 What's the message?

00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:16.140
 What message?

00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:18.140
 She was there, she is right now.

00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:19.140
 She's calling me Homer.

00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:20.140
 I'll answer it, Henry.

00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:22.640
 Now listen, Homer, she probably wants to call me and apologize.

00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:26.140
 But Henry, why don't you let me answer it and make out you don't want to talk to her?

00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:27.040
 Why would I do that?

00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:29.800
 Then she'll be all the more sorry. She tweeted you like a dog

00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:37.840
 Hello, hello is this Elm 303 wait, yes, sir. Homer is that you yes, sir? Is that you father?

00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:43.540
 It is not this is mr. Allridge. Oh, excuse me. Did you want me to go home?

00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:51.080
 Wait, I'm just sitting here reading a good book mr. Allridge

00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:55.200
 Where's Mrs. Allridge? She's going over to the clerks mr. Allridge over to the clerks

00:20:55.200 --> 00:21:02.000
 Then she knows about it about why about Henry. Oh, you know too if she comes in tell her I'm on my way home

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:08.240
 I'm just trying to get in touch with Henry. Goodbye. He's right here. Mr. Aldrich. Mr. Aldrich does Dorothy want me homework?

00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:14.180
 No, your father's looking for you anyone should have come right home now. Listen I am home

00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:17.160
 She wins and what do you suppose he wants?

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:22.580
 Yes, mother did you straighten everything out over Charlie's? I'm afraid I did not in fact

00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:26.080
 Dear, you and I are going to have the one of the most serious talks we've ever had.

00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:28.080
 What about that watch, dear?

00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:29.080
 That watch?

00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:30.080
 What watch?

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:33.080
 That belongs to Dorothy Hopkins and you won't get back to her.

00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:34.080
 Why?

00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:38.080
 Now, dear, I realize you probably don't appreciate how extremely serious this is.

00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:42.080
 But keeping a piece of expensive jewelry, Henry, that belongs to somebody else, just as a souvenir,

00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:44.580
 is not as funny as you apparently think it is.

00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:46.580
 But, mama, I don't even know what you're talking about.

00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:48.580
 Mrs. Aldrich, may I say just one thing?

00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:50.080
 You may not, Homer.

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:52.080
 Were you with Henry when he took the watch?

00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:54.080
 Yes ma'am. No ma'am.

00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:56.080
 What, why?

00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:57.080
 - How about... - Yes ma'am.

00:21:57.080 --> 00:22:00.080
 - May I have a word for you? - Yes ma'am, but please go in the dining room.

00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:02.080
 I want to have a talk with you in there.

00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:05.080
 And Henry, you're to stay right here. Yes, mother. But mother.

00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:06.080
 I don't want to talk to you now.

00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:10.080
 Listen, Henry, has something happened today that you haven't told me about it?

00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:12.080
 Sam, I'm awfully glad you came home.

00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:15.080
 No, Alice, I know how upset you must be about Henry, but let's not go all to pieces.

00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:16.080
 Then you know about Henry?

00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:20.080
 Of course I know about him. Mr. Clark and I have been downtown working on it all afternoon.

00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:22.480
 - Really? - But everything's going to be alright, Alice.

00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:24.080
 He's reported it to the police.

00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:25.880
 - Stand the police!

00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:27.880
 Mr. Clark went to the police about it.

00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:29.680
 - I'll admit, I didn't know he was going to do it,

00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:31.880
 but sooner or later, that would have known about it anyhow, Alice.

00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:33.880
 - But dear, it does seem to...

00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:37.680
 My goodness, Sam, do you realize it'll probably even be in the paper?

00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:38.480
 - And what if it is?

00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:41.080
 Don't you think the public should be warned in case they see him?

00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:43.880
 - Yeah, I can't believe I only hear.

00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:44.880
 - That's the phone.

00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:47.080
 - I'll answer it. You sit down. You look tired.

00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:48.280
 In fact, you must be tired.

00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:49.880
 You wouldn't have let a thing like this happen.

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:50.880
 I am trying.

00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:52.480
 Well, just as soon as I get through with this,

00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:53.880
 I'll try and get some lunch for you.

00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:55.680
 Though personally, I couldn't eat a thing.

00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:57.040
 I'll add you the phone for you, mother.

00:22:57.040 --> 00:22:57.880
 You will?

00:22:57.880 --> 00:22:58.720
 That's for me.

00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:00.240
 I'm in no condition to speak to anyone.

00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:01.360
 She had to be glad to do anything

00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:03.120
 that would make you feel better.

00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:03.960
 12.

00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:04.780
 Hello?

00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:05.600
 This is police headquarters.

00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:07.120
 I'm calling about Henry Orange.

00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:07.960
 About who?

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:09.120
 Henry Orange.

00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:11.840
 But please, is that right?

00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:12.720
 How did you--

00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:14.360
 I mean, oh boy.

00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:16.320
 Henry, can you say police?

00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:17.320
 Who is this, me?

00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:19.760
 Well, let me explain how the whole thing happened.

00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:22.820
 I happen to be down by the station this morning and the star good looking girl.

00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:26.920
 I mean we didn't see anything of a watch. It was just an empty envelope.

00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:28.840
 What? What about his hand?

00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:30.320
 What's that?

00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:31.760
 I'll choose that right the amnesia.

00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:33.680
 Who? What kind of a watch?

00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:35.600
 Look maybe I better come up there and talk with you.

00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:38.720
 She was you don't have to come up here. It was only an empty envelope.

00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:41.480
 Hello? Hello?

00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:43.040
 Who? She who is?

00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:44.200
 Henry is that you?

00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:45.280
 Yes Father, are you home?

00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:46.640
 May I ask what you're doing here?

00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:48.480
 Wait, I was just answering the telephone.

00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:50.480
 I mean, were you looking for me?

00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:51.520
 Henry, what happened to you?

00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:52.520
 Wait.

00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:54.240
 Here's the whole story, Father.

00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:56.080
 I was going by the clerks this morning, see?

00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:57.080
 Yes.

00:23:57.080 --> 00:23:58.920
 And you fell down, didn't you?

00:23:58.920 --> 00:23:59.920
 Oh, yes.

00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:01.720
 I've forgotten all about that.

00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:04.080
 Do you mean you don't remember what has happened since?

00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:06.000
 Well, an awful lot has happened.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:09.280
 I think I remember it all, but it doesn't seem to fit together.

00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:10.680
 And it's all mixed up?

00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:11.480
 Yes.

00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:13.000
 At least I can't understand it.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.000
 Henry!

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.880
 Did someone here that wants to see you?

00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:16.720
 He's a police.

00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:18.600
 No, Henry, it's Dorothy Hopkins.

00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:19.440
 Who?

00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:21.800
 And I just wanted to say that I phoned over to Addison City,

00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:23.720
 and my walk has been home all the time.

00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:25.400
 So you couldn't possibly have it.

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:26.240
 I know it.

00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:27.360
 I never said I did.

00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:29.960
 You said you had something very valuable of mine.

00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:31.280
 Well, I did.

00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:33.080
 But it's only valuable to me.

00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:35.960
 I mean, you wouldn't even run it.

00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:37.280
 It's only this empty envelope.

00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:39.600
 My goodness, Henry, where did you find that?

00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:40.440
 Now, at the station--

00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:42.360
 Well, that's very valuable to me too.

00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:43.640
 I need that address on the back.

00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:46.040
 Yes, the address of the boy I'm engaged to.

00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:47.640
 That you're engaged to?

00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:49.840
 And I do thank you for saving it for me, Henry.

00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:52.140
 And I'm awfully sorry to have caused so much trouble.

00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:53.440
 That's all right, Dorothy.

00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:56.140
 It was certainly nice of you to come over, wasn't it, Sam?

00:24:56.140 --> 00:24:57.140
 What's that?

00:24:57.140 --> 00:24:59.640
 Oh, yes, yes.

00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:00.640
 Alice, may I ask one?

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:02.840
 And Dorothy, before you go, how is Mr. Clark?

00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:03.640
 Mr. Clark?

00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:05.240
 Yes, isn't he down with the hospital?

00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:06.440
 The hospital?

00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:07.640
 I'm glad you mentioned it, Alice.

00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:08.440
 Where's the telephone?

00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:09.440
 Goodbye, Henry.

00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:10.240
 So long, Dorothy.

00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:11.640
 I'm very glad you've met you.

00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:12.140
 Thanks.

00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:14.060
 And I'm very glad to have met you.

00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:16.900
 -Homer! -Homer, where are you?

00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:19.900
 I'm under the sofa. I have to call you one.

00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:31.340
 Anyone go back to work and drop them in.

 You got him, Homer.

00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:58.560
 Charlie Clark, he's down at the front door, and I just dumped a bucket of water out on him.

00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:01.560
 Listen, Homer, I didn't say that was Charlie Clark down there.

00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:02.560
 That's Mr. Clark.

00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:03.560
 Who?

00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:04.560
 Henry Orrry!
