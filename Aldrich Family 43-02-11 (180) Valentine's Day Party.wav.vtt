 Postum presents Henry, Henry Oldrich, coming mother.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
 [Applause]

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
 The Oldrich family written by Clifford Goldsmith.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.100
 At attainment for all the family,

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.760
 brought to you by Postam,

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.600
 attempting wholesome drink for all the family.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.440
 Postam.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.020
 (upbeat music)

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:52.580
 Well friends, here it is another Thursday night,

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.420
 an opportunity is knocking loudly at your door

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:56.840
 and knocking twice.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.720
 First, it's your opportunity to put away your worries and cares for a half hour and relax

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.060
 and laugh with those grand people, the Aldrich family.

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:09.540
 And second, it's your opportunity to find out something about that equally grand mealtime

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.100
 drink postem.

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.200
 While even in looks, friends, postem is a winner.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.500
 The kind of drink you don't waste a second tilting to your lips.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.580
 It has the kind of flavor you refer to in italics.

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.340
 It has the kind of hearty, robust goodness that warms the cockles of your heart.

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.540
 But just don't expect when you try it that Postam is going to taste like coffee any more

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.380
 than you'd expect coffee to taste like tea.

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.260
 Remember that Postam's distinctive flavor is in a class apart.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:41.020
 It has an extra special goodness of its own that leaves you no words for description but

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.620
 ah, and ah again.

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:48.180
 And then don't be surprised if you enjoy your meals far more than you did before the day

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.780
 you start enjoying Postam.

00:01:49.780 --> 00:02:09.280
 [Music]

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.780
 Boys like Penrod Scofield, Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn live in our memories because they

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.860
 They typify the teenage youngsters all of us know.

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.020
 And Henry Aldrich is another of these real American boys.

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.660
 He lives in your block, perhaps in your own home.

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.860
 The scene opens in the Aldrich living room.

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.260
 - But Mary, what have I done?

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.140
 - You know very well what you've done, Henry Aldrich.

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.700
 You know very well what you've done.

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:33.540
 - When?

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:34.860
 - Didn't you and Homer ask the whole crowd here

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.140
 to our house for a Valentine party Saturday night?

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.220
 - Sure, we even sent out written invitations.

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.580
 - But, Henry, that's the night I'm having my party.

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.100
 - Mary, how could you have a party?

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.600
 Oh my goodness Henry, I've been planning on it for six weeks.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:46.600
 On a party?

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.100
 Yes, for my sorority.

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.600
 Oh, all right, Mary, can't you meet at some other house?

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.600
 Henry, mother says it's my party and I can have it here at our house and I'm not to budge an inch.

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:55.600
 I know, but Mary.

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.600
 Henry, you're well done with telephones.

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.600
 Yes, mother, I'll be there just as soon as I get something straightened out.

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.600
 Mary, how about our invitations?

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:03.600
 What are Homer and I gonna do?

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.600
 I'm sure I don't know. You can have your party at Homer's house.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:07.600
 But Mary!

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:08.600
 But Mary!

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:09.600
 Hello?

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.600
 Hello, Henry, this is Agnes.

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:12.600
 Who?

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:18.600
 No, I was just going to call and see whether he's over at your house. There's something I have to seem about right away.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.600
 Well, Henry, we're all looking forward to your party Saturday night.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:22.600
 You're?

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:27.600
 And I was just wondering whether you'd mind calling Lillian Spencer and asking her to come.

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:28.600
 Lillian Spencer?

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.600
 She'd have an awfully good time, Henry.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:31.600
 But Agnes, I wasn't.

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:32.600
 What do you mean by that?

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.600
 Well, besides one reason I'd rather not even mention, I'm not speaking to Lillian.

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.600
 That's all right. I'd be glad to call her.

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.600
 But Agnes, Agnes, that'll make 13.

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:41.600
 I'm gonna make 13.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:42.600
 Henry!

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:43.600
 Yes, Mary.

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:44.600
 Just a second, Agnes.

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:45.600
 Homer's here.

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.600
 Well, tell him to come here quick.

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:48.600
 Agnes.

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:49.600
 Agnes.

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:50.600
 She was.

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:51.600
 Hey, Henry.

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.600
 I was just open to the bakery and loaded four dozen donuts.

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:56.600
 Homer.

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:00.600
 Homer, why couldn't we throw the party at your house?

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:01.600
 Why?

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.600
 Well, your house is a lot nearer the center of town, Homer, and your heating system's a

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:06.600
 lot better than ours.

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.400
 Now listen, Henry, don't you remember the last party we threw at my house?

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.640
 Homer, that was just due to an unfortunate series of circumstances.

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.320
 Even so, my father hasn't gotten over it yet.

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.400
 But Homer, let me tell you.

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.080
 We're giving a party Saturday night,

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:21.440
 and it doesn't want to be at your house,

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:22.880
 and it doesn't want to be at mine.

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.880
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:36.320
 But, Mother, why not look at it this way?

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:37.400
 I'm sorry, dear.

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.280
 Alex, if you see that piece of paper, I add.

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:40.200
 What was it, Sam?

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.920
 It was a list of the members of the Rotorich Club.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.760
 Father, do you have any ideas as to how we could manage him?

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.360
 Henry, I haven't time to talk about anything.

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.640
 Now I've got to go find that list.

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:48.840
 But Mr. Aldrich...

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.320
 Henry, I'm sorry, but you may not have your party here.

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:52.680
 Please go answer the telephone.

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:53.600
 Yes, Mother.

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.000
 Henry, what are we gonna do?

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.280
 I don't know, Homer. Why do you keep asking me?

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.160
 Because I ordered the donuts in my name.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.120
 Hello?

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.120
 Hello, Henry. This is Kathleen.

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.280
 Oh, hello.

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:07.920
 I just wanted to tell you the good news.

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:08.440
 What?

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.920
 I don't suppose I should tell you, but I got a new evening dress for your party.

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:12.920
 You did?

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:13.920
 An evening?

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:16.320
 But Kathleen, it's gonna be informal.

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.320
 Oh no! Agnes found all of us instead of it had been changed.

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:20.720
 Where to wear long dresses?

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:21.520
 Agnes, please?

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.320
 Yes, Henry, and I just wanted to tell you, I'm looking forward to coming.

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:24.920
 Goodbye!

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:25.720
 But Kathleen!

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.120
 Kathleen!

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.520
 What's the matter, Henry?

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.320
 Agnes is having them all dress up.

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.520
 Who gave her any authority like that?

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.320
 You know, Henry, what we've got to do.

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:34.720
 Why?

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:36.520
 Something about the number 13.

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:40.960
 Either we've got to get rid of one of our guests or you or I have got to drop out.

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.280
 Now listen Homer, you're not gonna leave me flat.

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.240
 Well, we're just making a generous offer, Henry.

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.560
 I know.

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:51.600
 Why not call Agnes and see whether she'd have any suggestions?

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:52.560
 And what what?

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:57.680
 Well, as long as she's showing so much interest, she might be very glad to have our party at her house.

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:01.280
 Now listen, Homer, we're not gonna get Agnes any more mixed up in this than she is.

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:04.560
 Henry, didn't you ever taste the lemon meringue pie her mother makes?

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:04.960
 Yes.

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:06.640
 And there you are. Let me call her.

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:08.280
 But Homer, hello.

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:09.040
 Number please.

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:11.040
 L9-7-1-7.

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:12.640
 L9-7-1-7.

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:14.800
 Homer, how do you know her mother will make any paw?

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.320
 Henry, why worry about that detail when you don't even

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:19.000
 have a roof over your party?

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:19.960
 Hello?

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:22.080
 Hello, is this-- is this Agnes?

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:23.880
 Yes, Homer, and I'm glad you call.

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:24.560
 You are?

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:26.640
 Yes, I want you to go right over to Andy Martin's

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:27.960
 and get all of his records.

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:28.720
 What for?

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:31.040
 But the party's out at E-Nite, at Henry's.

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:31.840
 At Henry's?

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:33.360
 Yes, aren't you taking me?

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.840
 Well, as a matter of fact, Agnes, that's

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:38.160
 what I really called you up about.

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:41.920
 Supposing, supposing it's raining real hard that night.

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:42.760
 - What about it?

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:45.560
 - Well, you wouldn't wanna go out in it, would you?

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:47.920
 I mean, if it was practically the worst storm

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:49.200
 we've had all season.

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:50.440
 - What made you think of that?

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:52.000
 - You can't tell Agnes,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.920
 suppose it even turned to Sleeved and Frodo's right on you.

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:56.920
 - Oh, my, I'll go out of it, yes, that.

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:58.720
 - Well, I'm glad you'd be sensible

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:01.080
 because I've got a wonderful solution.

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:02.680
 We're all coming over to your house.

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:03.520
 - What's that?

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:04.640
 - Ask her about the pie holder.

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:07.440
 The home of the invitation said the party was to be at the Aldrich's.

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:09.440
 But Agnes, why not look at it this way?

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:11.040
 Now listen Homer Brown!

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:23.240
 I wonder why she doesn't come to the door.

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:27.440
 You know Homer, something tells me we're going to be sorry we're having the party at Agnes's house.

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:30.740
 Henry will have a wonderful turn and it was very nice of Agnes.

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:33.140
 But why do we have to come over a day early?

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:35.340
 because she said we had to come and make the plan.

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:36.860
 Sure, that's what I mean.

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:39.580
 Homer, we know what the inside of her house looks like.

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:40.100
 Hello!

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:41.000
 Hi, Agnes.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:41.500
 Hello.

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:42.340
 Come on in.

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:44.260
 My goodness, I'm so excited.

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:44.980
 Yeah?

00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:47.940
 First of all, I've got a lot of ideas about things for us to eat.

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:50.640
 Agnes, so far as the refreshments are concerned,

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:52.220
 Homer and I have taken care of everything,

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:54.220
 but the lemon meringue pie.

00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:55.540
 But Henry, what do you have in you?

00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:56.780
 Ginger, Ellen, don't know.

00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:57.780
 Don't know.

00:07:57.780 --> 00:07:59.500
 Sure.

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:01.100
 We just ordered four dozens.

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:01.980
 Four dozens?

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:02.620
 Sure.

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:04.380
 But my goodness, four dozen!

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:06.080
 Why didn't you say that isn't so many?

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:08.680
 As a matter of fact, I was just thinking we ought to double the order.

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:09.340
 Sure.

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:11.180
 For boys, I don't like donut.

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:12.080
 But I do.

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:15.220
 All right, my goodness, why worry over a little thing like donut?

00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:17.960
 Naturally, we can decide to sing like that later on.

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:19.500
 Now here's the living room.

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:20.500
 Oh, yes.

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:21.100
 Yes.

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:25.300
 The first thing you want to do is move the piano down to the other end of the room.

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:25.900
 Move it?

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:26.540
 Move it.

00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:27.600
 Yes, and you might as well--

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:28.640
 [LAUGHTER]

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:31.340
 Why tell my mother to bake a couple of cakes?

00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:32.840
 In case we don't have donuts.

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:33.640
 What's that?

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:35.340
 In addition to the lemon meringue.

00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:35.840
 Of course.

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:37.240
 Oh, she was agus.

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:39.440
 Naturally, I'd move your piano anyplace you want.

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:40.540
 That's so alive.

00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:43.840
 And Agnes, are we glad you can come to our party here?

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:45.340
 Well, thanks, fellas.

00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:47.740
 It was definitely very nice of you to ask me.

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:49.040
 And would you do me a favor?

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:49.540
 Sure.

00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:50.040
 Sure.

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:50.540
 What is it?

00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:53.540
 Would you mind if I asked Gerdie Parker to come Saturday night?

00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:55.640
 She doesn't get invited to many parties.

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:56.640
 Gerdie Parker.

00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:57.840
 Gerdie Parker?

00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:58.440
 Oh, boy.

00:08:58.440 --> 00:08:59.440
 I'm glad you mentioned her.

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:00.740
 I'll call her right now.

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:02.340
 Listen, Homer, who mentioned her?

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:07.800
 But, Henry, why should you object to Gerdy Parker when you're getting a wonderful room like this thrown in with her?

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:09.240
 Come on, let's move the piano.

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:11.080
 Okay, but my heart is minute.

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:11.740
 Push!

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:13.120
 Push yourself!

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:14.040
 Keep your going.

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:14.740
 Push!

00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:16.740
 Now, wait a second, Henry.

00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:18.040
 That's what I say.

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:22.740
 Oh, Homer, after we get this taken care of, how about our moving that picture that's on the wall?

00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:23.840
 What's the matter with it?

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:25.340
 That's Agnes' father.

00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:26.140
 It is?

00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:27.040
 Sure.

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:28.540
 Come on and push.

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:29.840
 Push yourself!

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:29.920

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:33.760
 She was...

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:34.600
 Boys!

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:36.760
 May I ask just what you think you're doing?

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:37.480
 Wait, uh,

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:38.560
 all muscles are awesome.

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:40.720
 Henry Oldridge, I'd like to ask you again.

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:41.560
 What you're doing?

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:42.640
 Wait, we're just...

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:43.160
 We're just...

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:44.680
 We're getting ready for the party.

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:45.320
 What party?

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:46.160
 Hours!

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:47.080
 Here!

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:47.960
 And you heard?

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:51.120
 And we want you to know Mrs. Lawson, we're very grateful.

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:53.640
 Boys, will you both please leave this house?

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:54.680
 Yes, ma'am.

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:55.960
 Without...

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:57.000
 Without...

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:57.760
 Well, she was.

00:09:57.760 --> 00:09:59.960
 And I have a good notion to call both your parents.

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:01.760
 Oh, you don't have to bother about anything like that.

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:03.760
 We're going right away, Mrs. Lawson.

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:06.760
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:15.920
 Kathleen, tell me once more.

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:17.960
 When you called Henry, just what did he say?

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:21.240
 I miss he said he had no desire, whatever, to discuss the matter.

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:23.640
 And he said that I tried to boss their whole party?

00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:24.320
 Yes, I miss.

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:25.760
 That's exactly what he said.

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:28.960
 But I don't see why you should blame me, Kathleen, for something my mother did.

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:31.760
 When I stuck up for you, I told him you didn't mean to be bossing.

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:34.560
 My goodness, I was never so embarrassed in my life.

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:36.760
 I'll never be able to face Homer again.

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:39.760
 I know, but I don't know why Henry should be so mad at me.

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:41.760
 At least, Kathleen, I did one thing.

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:44.560
 The minute I realized my mother wouldn't bake anything for them,

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:47.060
 I called the bakery and doubled their order for donut.

00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:47.760
 Really?

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:50.760
 And Kathleen, as a matter of fact, I have an idea.

00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:51.260
 What is it?

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:52.660
 First, where's your telephone?

00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:54.160
 My goodness, when I get through,

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:55.480
 Henry and Homer will come around

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:57.680
 unbended knees and apologize.

00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:00.260
 (upbeat music)

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:08.800
 - Hello.

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:09.760
 - Doesn't she answer?

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:11.200
 - I'm ringing your number.

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:12.840
 - Homer, when you went back to gift your hat,

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:14.400
 what did Mrs. Lawson say?

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:15.680
 - She didn't say anything.

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:17.520
 She wouldn't even let me in.

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:18.680
 - Well, I can tell you one thing.

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:20.840
 I'm never gonna darken the Lawson door again.

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:22.720
 and I hope you don't think I'm going to.

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:23.960
 I'm ringing your number.

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:24.720
 Thank you.

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:27.040
 Henry, when you see your mother, tell her I found the list.

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:27.800
 So what, Father?

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:30.120
 The list of bembers of the Rotary Club I was looking for.

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:30.920
 Hello?

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:32.920
 Well, she was-- oh, Anne Harriet.

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:33.800
 This is Henry.

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:34.680
 Hello, Henry.

00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:35.320
 What is it you want?

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:36.920
 I've got to get back to the kitchen.

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:39.520
 Anne Harriet, how would you like to--

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:40.960
 how would you--

00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:42.760
 how do you got a full day Saturday?

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:44.280
 No, not especially.

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:46.280
 Did your mother want me to come over for dinner?

00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:48.600
 Well, if I could arrange it, could you?

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:50.200
 But what did you call me for?

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:53.300
 I wanted to know whether I could borrow something.

00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:54.100
 What?

00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:54.900
 Your house.

00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:55.900
 What's that?

00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:57.500
 [LAUGHTER]

00:11:57.500 --> 00:12:00.100
 And Harriet, I have to give a party that evening, see?

00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:02.700
 And, Gee, if I could arrange it so you wouldn't have to be there,

00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:04.200
 Aunt Harriet, would you be interested?

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:05.100
 Why, I might.

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:05.600
 You might.

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:06.300
 Oh, boy.

00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:08.600
 I'll let you have the party at my house, Henry, provided you

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:10.800
 don't invite that awful home of Brown.

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:12.800
 Oh, what an Harriet!

 Yes!

 Well, this is Agnes Lawson.

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:32.800
 Do the ladies in your church serve suppers sometimes?

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:33.800
 Oh, my, yes.

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:36.800
 We have beautiful equipment downstairs right off the Sunday school room.

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:39.800
 Well, could you serve a little Valentine's supper tomorrow night?

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:41.300
 Well, I guess we could.

00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:43.300
 Hey, Ms. Henry and Homer had many money.

00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:43.800
 Happily.

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:45.800
 Just a minute, Mrs. Tomkins.

00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:49.260
 Kathleen, the food they serve wherever they have it is going to cost something, isn't it?

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:49.760
 Yes.

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:52.800
 Then why not let it go towards the church and make it worthwhile?

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:53.300
 Alright.

00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:54.500
 Hello, Mr. Tompkins.

00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:55.300
 Hello.

00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:59.600
 Do you suppose you could serve something that wouldn't cost hardly anything?

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:01.400
 Oh, I guess we could.

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:06.000
 Something as simple as a bowl of soup and maybe sandwiches and a rice pudding.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:06.700
 Yes.

00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:09.400
 Well, we're awfully anxious to raise some money for the new organ.

00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:11.700
 And I'm sure the ladies will be more than glad to.

 Yes.

 Harriet, this is Mrs. Thompson.

 Oh, yes, hello.

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:30.700
 Say, I've got some good news about people organ.

00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:31.700
 The organ?

00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:33.700
 Yes, the one we're raising money for is the truth.

00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:37.700
 Oh, a young lady just phoned and wanted to know whether we could have a little dinner for her, a little party tomorrow night.

00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:39.700
 Good, how many are you going to serve?

00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:42.660
 I told her it wouldn't be worth our while unless we had at least 40.

00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:43.340
 Good.

00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:45.740
 And she said she'd see you, but there were at least that many.

00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:47.500
 And she might be able to round up 50.

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:49.340
 Well, I'm awfully glad to hear that.

00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:52.500
 That organ we have now bothers me every Sunday.

00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:55.260
 And Harriet, do you suppose you can be one of the ladies of help, sir?

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:56.000
 Tomorrow night?

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.020
 Yes.

00:13:57.020 --> 00:13:57.660
 Oh, I would.

00:13:57.660 --> 00:13:59.020
 I'd be glad to only--

00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:03.220
 Just this man has got through inviting some people over here for a party tomorrow night.

00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:03.720
 Oh?

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:07.100
 Yes, I'm going to give a little surprise party for my nephew, Henry.

00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:08.140
 I know he wants one.

00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:08.980
 Oh.

00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:10.980
 And I'm asking in quite a few.

00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:14.480
 Mrs. Carbel said she could comment that wasn't too slippery for her bad leg.

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:15.380
 Really?

00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:18.180
 And another person I'm going to ask is old Mr. Perkins.

00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:19.380
 Henry, I like him.

00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:21.080
 He's a lot of fun at the party.

00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:21.780
 Good.

00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:24.780
 And, uh, Miss Frederick, she hasn't been out all winter.

00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:25.680
 Good!

00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:28.180
 I'm just sorry that you can't be there yourself.

00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:41.180
 [Music]

00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:47.180
 Well, I'm afraid Ad Harreid and Henry have rather different ideas about who's welcome at a teenage boy's party.

00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:53.180
 But something they probably would agree about is what makes the most welcome, hot drink at meal times.

00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:55.180
 The answer is post them, of course.

00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:57.180
 Millions of Americans will tell you that.

00:14:57.180 --> 00:15:03.060
 In fact, it's because post-em is so popular, it's because every day more and more people

00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:07.040
 are insisting on post-em that there's a temporary shortage.

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:11.500
 We just can't keep pace with the fast-growing demand, even though we're making more post-em

00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:14.100
 today than ever before in our history.

00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:18.820
 So if you can't always immediately get post-em when you ask for it at your grocers, don't

00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:20.220
 be discouraged.

00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:23.100
 Don't think your grocer isn't going to get any more post-em.

00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:24.100
 He will.

00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:27.660
 And as soon as he does get post them, you'll get it too.

00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:38.260
 So be sure to ask for it again.

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:41.380
 Now getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldrich.

00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:45.740
 Henry and Homer are trying to find a place to hold their party Saturday night.

00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:50.100
 Meanwhile unknown to them, Agnes Lawson has arranged for them to hold it at the Methodist

00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:51.100
 Church.

00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:56.100
 And Aunt Harriet, also unknown to them, has decided to let them hold it at her house.

00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:59.100
 The scene opens in the Aldrich living room.

00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:03.100
 Hey, babe, would you please answer that phone?

00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:05.100
 -Why? -Yes, please.

00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:08.100
 Homer, would you mind answering it and just tell whoever it is I'm not here.

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:11.100
 Henry, I'm not going to be your personal ghost.

00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:16.100
 But Homer, suppose the sadness is trying to get us again.

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:19.100
 Just tell her again, we're not speaking to her.

00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:23.900
 Okay, if it's somebody wanting to know where we're going to have the party, I'll tell them it's slightly up in the air.

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:26.840
 Hello?

00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:28.340
 Hello, is Mr. Aldrich there?

00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:30.280
 Mr. Aldrich, why no, he isn't.

00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:33.680
 Oh, well, when he comes in, could you please tell him that the mansion house phone...

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:36.160
 The mansion house? The mansion house hotel?

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:39.240
 Yes, I wanted to submit an estimate for his party, Saturday night.

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:40.280
 A party?

00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:45.440
 Yes, I received word that he's planning a party for Saturday night, and I wanted to give him the figures for a private dining room.

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:47.520
 She was unplaining a party, but...

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:49.120
 Oh, are you Mr. Allridge?

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:50.320
 Yes, sir, only...

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:52.280
 Oh, you're the gentleman.

00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:53.080
 Yes, sir.

00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:54.760
 Well, I figured out an estimate for you.

00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:57.960
 I know, but we can't afford anything that's going to cost as much as...

00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:00.320
 Well, we just couldn't afford it, that's all.

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:01.880
 Well, this isn't going to cost so much.

00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:02.520
 An answer?

00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:03.440
 No, not at all.

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:04.560
 How much is it?

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:06.560
 Well, first, I'll have to know a little more.

00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:09.960
 Would you want a fruit cup or tomato juice to begin with?

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:10.920
 What's that?

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:14.920
 I said, do you want a fruit cup or tomato juice?

00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:17.920
 Why, Homer, what do you want a fruit cup or tomato juice?

00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:18.920
 Now, who are you?

00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:19.920
 We want to get a fart!

00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:20.920
 [laughter]

00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:22.920
 At the mansion house hotel.

00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:23.920
 Oh.

00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:25.920
 Could we have grape juice?

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:26.920
 Hello.

00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:27.920
 Could we have grape juice?

00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:28.920
 Yes, yes.

00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:29.920
 You can have anything you want.

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:30.920
 We can't.

00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:31.920
 We don't have anything you want.

00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:32.920
 She would.

00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:33.920
 How are you up on the side?

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:34.920
 What do you want?

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:35.920
 Oh.

00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:36.920
 Take fruit cup.

00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:37.920
 Hello.

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:39.920
 Oh, we'll take fruit cup.

00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:40.920
 No, no, wait a minute.

00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:41.920
 Henry, wait a minute.

00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:42.920
 What's the matter?

00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:44.320
 Okay, fruit cup.

00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:45.560
 Hello?

00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:46.920
 Fruit cup's okay.

00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:47.920
 Yes, Mr. Olridge.

00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:51.620
 Now would you want chicken patties with peas or lamb chops with limers?

00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:54.320
 Well, that sounds all right.

00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:55.320
 Which will it be?

00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:56.120
 What?

00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:58.520
 Chicken patties with peas or lamb chops with limers.

00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:00.620
 Homer, how would you like some lamb chops?

00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:02.920
 All right, with lots of mashed potatoes.

00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:07.320
 Well, could we have lamb chops with mashed potatoes?

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:08.820
 Yes, of course, Mr. Olridge.

00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:10.320
 Lamb chops with mashed potatoes.

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:11.120
 Lots of them.

00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:12.720
 And how about limers?

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:15.720
 No, who wants lime if she was?

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:17.720
 Well, now about the dessert. What would you like?

00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:19.720
 Well, what have you got?

00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:24.720
 Well, we can give you almost any kind of pie, ice cream, French pastry, stewed fruit.

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:28.720
 Stewed fruit? Listen, Henry, I'm not going to eat any stewed fruit in my own party.

00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:32.720
 Home a line a second. Homer, we can have any dessert we want.

00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:36.720
 Anything? Sure. I've got an idea. Hello?

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:37.720
 Yes?

00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:39.720
 Could we have pumpkin pie allomode?

00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:41.720
 At the old fight, Henry.

00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:46.180
 Well, I guess you could you'd like it served in separate dishes. No, just don't the whole works together

00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:54.380
 Ask me about chocolate sauce. Oh, yes, would there be an extra charge or what chocolate sauce?

00:18:54.380 --> 00:19:01.520
 Chocolate sauce. Yes. Are you sure you should have chocolate sauce? Oh sure. Well, there might be a small charge

00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:07.380
 Well, how much will the whole thing including it all come to? Well, just exactly how many are you having? Why?

00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:11.040
 14 with Gertie Parker. What's that?

00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:13.040
 I understood it was 200.

00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:14.040
 200?

00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:18.040
 I don't know where I got the idea, but that was the message that was left here for me.

00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:19.040
 200?

00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:20.040
 200 why Henry?

00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:25.040
 Mr. Aldrich, I'm afraid that for 14 we'd have to charge you at least a dollar and a half of these.

00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:27.040
 How much now what's happened?

00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:30.040
 The only thing is, what do you wear?

00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:31.040
 You can't afford it?

00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:36.040
 Oh, it isn't that we can't afford it. It's just the...even when I wear my beans?

00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:40.040
 Well, naturally I thought you wanted something rather nice.

00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:43.640
 Oh, we do it, and I appreciate your offer only.

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:45.540
 Suppose I think it over.

00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:46.540
 And you'll call me back?

00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:49.740
 Yes, I may, but if you don't hear from me, don't worry.

00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:51.840
 Well, thank you, Mr. Alrud, goodbye.

00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:53.040
 And thank you.

00:19:53.040 --> 00:20:07.840
 But, mother, mother, we can't have a lot of fly-by night, young people who don't take anything seriously dancing around as well as sororities having a meeting here.

00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:10.240
 My goodness, we have a deficit in the treasury as it is.

00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:12.840
 But dear, I'm sure they wouldn't pay any attention to your deficit.

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:16.040
 But that isn't a point. Our president gets nervous with even just us there.

00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:19.340
 Mary, I was simply wondering whether there isn't some way we can help your brother.

00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:21.340
 - Brothers! - Yes, Sammy, you home?

00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:22.840
 Yes, hello. Hello, Mary.

00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:23.840
 Hello, Father.

00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:24.640
 What's the matter with you?

00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:27.340
 Nothing. Her sorority has a deficit.

00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:30.940
 - Yeah? Any phone calls for me? - Not that I know of, dear.

00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:33.040
 No. Isn't the mansion house phone?

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:34.440
 No, Sam. - No.

00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:37.440
 Now, Sam, you don't have to start putting in phone calls the minute you get home.

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:42.240
 But Alice, I left word for them to let me know whether they could take care of our Rotorick Club bandwidth Saturday night.

00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:44.440
 And we're expecting 200 guests.

00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:45.440
 Hello?

00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:46.240
 Number please.

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:47.240
 I want to...

00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:48.440
 Elm 224.

00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:49.940
 Elm 224?

00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:50.640
 If you please.

00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:53.840
 Sam, do you have any ideas as to where Henry could get his party?

00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:54.740
 Why not right here?

00:20:54.740 --> 00:20:55.940
 Father, Sam!

00:20:55.940 --> 00:20:56.640
 Hello?

00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:56.940
 Hello?

00:20:56.940 --> 00:20:57.840
 Is this the mansion house?

00:20:57.840 --> 00:20:58.240
 Yes.

00:20:58.240 --> 00:20:59.440
 Well, listen to the roll-rich.

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:01.240
 Oh, yes, yes, Mr. Roll-rich.

00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:02.940
 I was wondering whether you'd call me.

00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:04.540
 Did I say I'd call you?

00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:06.040
 Well, I understood you would.

00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:08.040
 Oh, I'm sorry, I thought it was the other way around.

00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:10.040
 Have you finally decided to go ahead with your party?

00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:13.040
 Oh, yes, definitely. The question is, can you take care of us?

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:15.540
 I don't know why or not. There's nothing complicated about it.

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:17.540
 Good. Then I don't have anything to worry about.

00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:19.540
 No, not a thing. You just leave it to us.

00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:21.540
 And on second thought, Mr. Aldrich,

00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:24.540
 there won't be any extra charge for the chocolate sauce.

00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:27.040
 For the why? For the chocolate sauce.

00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:28.540
 Oh, that won't.

00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:30.040
 Well, that's fine. That's fine.

00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:31.540
 - Goodbye. - Goodbye.

00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:33.540
 - Alice! - Yes, thanks!

00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:35.540
 But everything all fixed.

00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:36.540
 And what do you think?

00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:38.540
 They're throwing in the chocolate sauce.

00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:39.540
 For what?

00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:41.540
 I don't know, but it's very nice of them to give it to us.

00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:42.540
 Well, isn't that fine?

00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:46.540
 Yes, sir. I've been hoping we'd be able to have our banquet at the mansion house.

00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:50.540
 And you know, Alice, I didn't tell you before, but this year it's going to be a bit more important than usual.

00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:51.540
 In what way?

00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:55.540
 Well, I've heard a rumor that they're going to nominate me for president.

00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:57.540
 Really? Well, dear, you deserve it.

00:21:57.540 --> 00:21:58.540
 Yeah?

00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:00.540
 No wonder you want everything to be especially nice.

00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:02.540
 Everything was especially nice about what, Mother?

00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:03.960
 - Henry, I'm glad you came into the room.

00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:05.700
 Kathleen and Agnes stopped me on the street

00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:07.660
 and said they'd been trying to get you for two days.

00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:08.500
 - I did.

00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:09.460
 - They did Mr. Aldrich.

00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:11.100
 Did they seem apologetic?

00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:12.860
 - They said I wasn't anything for you to worry about

00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:13.980
 and they'd be seeing you

00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:15.900
 at the Methodist Church tomorrow night.

00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:17.820
 - At the Methodist Church, what for?

00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:19.460
 - I wonder what's going on over there.

00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:20.620
 (audience laughing)

00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:21.980
 - I don't know anything more about it

00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:23.060
 than what I've just told you.

00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:24.140
 - Well, the nerve of it.

00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:25.220
 - That's what I say.

00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:26.220
 - You know what they're trying to do,

00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:28.060
 Homer, come to us on bend and knee.

00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:29.660
 - In the Methodist Church?

00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:31.920
 (laughing)

00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:34.180
 We'll show them.

00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:35.820
 We're gonna give the best party tonight

00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:37.220
 to this town, ever saw.

00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:38.040
 - Where?

00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:40.020
 - Mother, that's the least of our worries.

00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:42.220
 Something will open up, it always does.

00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:44.100
 And Homer, do you know what I'm going to the phone and do?

00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:44.940
 Why?

00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:46.260
 Double our order of donuts.

00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:48.840
 (upbeat music)

00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:57.460
 Homer, how does my next tie work?

00:22:57.460 --> 00:23:00.660
 waiting till we get up here into this lamppost and we now take a look at it.

00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:03.260
 Oh, let's turn here though. My Aunt Harriet lives up the street.

00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:05.660
 Okay. Your tie looks fine.

00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:09.660
 You know, it was very nice of my Aunt Harriet to call me up and say we could have the party at her house.

00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:10.760
 That's what I was thinking.

00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:12.060
 Did I tell you what else she said?

00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:12.560
 What?

00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:14.460
 She said she had sort of a surprise for her.

00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:14.960
 She did?

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:16.460
 Sure. You know what that means?

00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:19.460
 She's probably going out and let us have the whole house to ourselves.

00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:20.460
 She is?

00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:21.560
 Oh boy.

00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:22.760
 Oh boy.

00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:24.560
 That's what I was thinking.

00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:27.360
 Say, I wonder what's going on across the street at the Methodist church.

00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:28.560
 I'm not interested.

00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:30.360
 As a matter of fact, I'm not either.

00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:32.360
 Hey, Henry, look up the street.

00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:33.360
 Where?

00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:34.360
 Well, she was-- what's that all about?

00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:37.360
 There's something going on over at the Mansion House Hotel.

00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:38.360
 Boy, they're all dressed up.

00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:40.360
 There must be a lot of parties going on tonight.

00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:43.360
 But, Henry, there are a couple of hundred people out there in the sidewalk.

00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:45.360
 They're all trying to get in.

00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:47.360
 Remember, they're all getting put out.

00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:48.360
 Oh, look. There's my father.

00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:50.360
 Oh, yeah? And there's mine!

00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:51.360
 Where?

00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:54.360
 Don't you see them with all those men talking to them with us back against the wall?

00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:56.360
 Oh sure.

00:23:56.360 --> 00:23:58.360
 Oh, there you are Homer Brown.

00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:00.360
 She was Agnes. Where did you come from?

00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:02.360
 We just came from the Methodist Church. That's where we came from.

00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:03.360
 Oh, Kathleen.

00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:06.360
 Henry Olbridge, you realize everybody's waiting for you?

00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:07.360
 Where is the church?

00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:08.360
 It's the church.

00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:09.360
 We're not interested.

00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:10.360
 You're not interested in your own party.

00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:11.360
 You're not part.

00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:13.360
 Now listen, Agnes, have you been arranging more things?

00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:16.360
 And just what Homer Brown do you mean by that insinuation?

00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:18.360
 Now wait a minute, Agnes. Wait a minute.

00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:20.360
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:35.280
 And before I sit down, ladies and gentlemen,

00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:37.680
 I would like to extend the thanks and gratitude

00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:40.040
 of the Rotary Club to several groups,

00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:42.760
 and shall I say, individuals.

00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:46.920
 First, I think we should thank Sam Aldrich for the very clever

00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:50.160
 an original way in which you arrange this evening for us.

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:52.200
 I needn't tell you that for a few minutes,

00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:54.560
 when we first went over to the mansion house,

00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:56.440
 it looked as our salmon slipped up

00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:59.040
 and arranged the table, seating 16,

00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:01.320
 to take care of 200 guests.

00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:04.880
 But it was done, of course, simply to teach us a lesson

00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:07.540
 that we mustn't expect sumptuous banquets

00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:09.560
 in these days of war.

00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:12.200
 In fact, it's very delicious dinner,

00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:16.240
 consisting of pea soup and peanut butter sandwiches

00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:22.080
 And shall I say rice pudding and let's not forget the doughnuts

00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:25.080
 was just what we needed to bring us back to earth.

00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:28.120
 While the 15 soldiers who would be our guests

00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:31.200
 are reading at the mansion house and will join us later.

00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:34.480
 Oh, incidentally, I understand Sam arranged their dinner

00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:37.520
 to end up with a triple-headed dessert.

00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:40.960
 And besides that, Sam Orritz has asked me to say

00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:42.920
 that we're going to put all the money that we've saved

00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:45.560
 on tonight's dinner into war bonds.

00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:51.320
 What's more, the treasurer of this church has just handed me a report to the effect that

00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:53.760
 their organ has gone over the top.

00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:56.520
 [APPLAUSE]

00:25:56.520 --> 00:26:02.280
 And I would like to extend our thanks to the good ladies of this church who dropped everything

00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:05.520
 in order to make our banquet the success that it's been.

00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:10.360
 I understand one lady in particular would plan to Valentine's party at her house for

00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:12.440
 her nephew or someone.

00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:18.440
 At the last minute, Carmen did all her adult guests and brought them down here to help serve,

00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:22.760
 leaving the youngsters to ship for themselves as best they can.

00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:30.440
 And now, ladies and gentlemen, may I introduce our genuine chairman and next president, Sam Aldrich.

00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:36.440
 Ladies and gentlemen, frankly, I don't know what to say.

00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:53.240
 Well, all those parties seem to straighten out nicely for everyone, didn't they?

00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:57.840
 But if you think Mr. Olrus' troubles are over, just you stay tuned in to find out what happens

00:26:57.840 --> 00:26:59.080
 the next morning.

00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:03.400
 And now let me remind you that Postum, for years the favorite mealtime drink in millions

00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:08.880
 of American homes is made for your convenience in two forms. Instant Postam, which you make

00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:14.680
 instantly in the cup, and Postam cereal, which you make in pop percolator or drip maker.

00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:19.720
 Both forms make the same delicious distinctive drink. So no matter which form of Postam you

00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:23.840
 choose, you'll enjoy a mealtime cup that's a real treat.

00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:39.840
 (music)

00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:41.840
 Good breakfast, Alice.

00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:43.840
 Thank you, Sam. Father, will you have another doughnut?

00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:46.840
 No, thank you. Go ahead, have one.

00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:48.840
 Henry, I have already had three.

00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:52.840
 Oh. You know, I think that was a very good idea you had about lunch.

00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:56.400
 What idea was that? To make all o' costre, to plow with a donut.

00:27:56.400 --> 00:28:00.840
 Incidentally, Alice, I won't be here for dinner.

00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:05.160
 Listen again next week to the Aldrich family, same time, same station,

00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:09.800
 for another sparkling half hour with your favorite youngster, his family, and his pals.

00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:13.640
 The Aldrich family, starring as Ruston, is written by Clifford Goldsmith.

00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:17.160
 Original music is composed and conducted by Jack Miller.

00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:21.960
 This is Harry Vanzel, saying, "You will enjoy fragrant, flavorful postum."

00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:24.560
 And remember, Postam contains no stimulants.

00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:26.460
 It cannot make you nervous.

00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:27.460
 Good night.

00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:29.460
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:42.560
 This program came to you from New York.

00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:44.960
 This is the National Broadcasting Company.
