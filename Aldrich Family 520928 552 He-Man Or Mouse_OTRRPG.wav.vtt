00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 Henry, Henry Oldridge.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.000
 Combing mother.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:19.000
 Yes, it's the August family written by Clifford Goldsmith.

 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:34.000
 There's an old saying that claims you're only young once.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.400
 But as a matter of fact, you can be young more than once, and the best way of doing that is

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.200
 to share the misadventures of a typical boy like Henry Aldrich.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.300
 He'll take you right back to your own teenage days.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.720
 The scene is the living room of Nancy Adams, one of Henry's favorite classmates, and the

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.440
 Time is evening.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.360
 Nancy, tell me honestly.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.040
 What is it you like about Bill Turner?

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.120
 I don't know, Henry.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.840
 I just like him, don't you?

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.840
 Well, sure he's all right.

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.440
 If you like athletes.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:03.960
 What's the matter with athletes?

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.400
 Nothing.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.720
 Except you're so athletic.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.080
 I mean, well, to hear Bill Turner talk,

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.320
 you think he was Joe DiMaggio, the Notre Dame football

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:13.440
 team in gorgeous George.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.920
 All rolled into one.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.160
 That's so loud, Henry.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:17.080
 He might hear you.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.720
 Who do you hear me?

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.200
 He's out in the front hall.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.000
 I like them only.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.900
 Frankly, is there any way of getting rid of them?

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.320
 - You're eating your dog like him?

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.640
 - Well, sure, I'm crazy about him only.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:26.700
 - Hey, Nancy.

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:27.540
 She whiz.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.100
 - Nancy, did I ever tell you about the time

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.200
 I dove off the top of the boat house?

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.120
 - Oh, Bill, I didn't even know anybody could climb up that high.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.440
 - Oh, it's easy.

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.920
 And you know that flagpole down at the end of the lake?

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.120
 - Yes.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:40.880
 - I dove off that once, too.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.440
 - Nancy, how's your mother?

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:43.480
 - Oh, she's better, Henry.

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:44.880
 She just strained her back a little.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.600
 - Boy, was that some luck I had in the game Saturday.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.760
 You remember when those three guys tackled me

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.000
 and I carried them right across the gold for a touchdown?

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.760
 Oh, that was just wonderful, Bill.

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.360
 I don't see how you stood up.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.280
 Nancy, what kind of a television set is this?

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.000
 I don't know.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.960
 Hey, Henry, could you or Bill open this window

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:00.800
 a little, please?

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:01.140
 Sure, why not?

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:01.880
 Oh, wait a minute, Henry.

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:02.320
 I'll open it.

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:03.400
 Well, that's all right, Bill.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.400
 I've got it practically--

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.120
 practically.

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.480
 Is it stuck, Henry?

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:10.400
 No, it isn't stuck.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.680
 I just--

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.520
 [GRUNTING]

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.800
 Could you stand back, please, Bill?

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.360
 How am I in the way?

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.020
 I want to get some leverage.

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.160
 - Here, Henry, let me show you how to open it.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.660
 - Now look, Alpil, all I have to do is...

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.360
 (clears throat)

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.520
 Nancy, would you mind if I pushed this sofa away?

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:27.360
 - No, Henry.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.600
 - Well, don't get off, I'll push you along.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:30.440
 - Along.

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.240
 (audience laughs)

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.240
 - Well, maybe if you just got up for a second, Nancy.

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.480
 Never mind this sofa, I'll just...

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.560
 She was who opened that window.

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:43.400
 - I did.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.160
 (audience laughs)

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.360
 You know, I thought I had it started,

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:47.640
 I just should have kept at it.

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.240
 Anything else you want done, Nancy?

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.120
 Well, there's some ginger ale out in the kitchen

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.960
 if one of you wants to--

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.960
 But you as I'll get it for you, Nancy, you stay where you are, Bill.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.840
 You're sure you don't need any help lifting the bottles?

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.480
 You'll find everything out there on a tray, Henry.

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.520
 All you have to do is put some ice in the glasses.

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.360
 I'll be right back.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.640
 Nancy, isn't there any way of getting rid of him?

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:06.200
 This evening?

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:06.800
 Sure.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.560
 Bill, Henry Aldrich is one of the nicest--

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.000
 Nancy, I'm not saying he isn't.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.200
 Only, frankly--

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.360
 Frankly, what?

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.760
 Well, three's a crowd.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.280
 And frankly, I have crowds cheering for me every time

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.800
 I go out on the field.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.320
 I want to be alone.

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:22.440
 Excuse me, Nancy.

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.760
 But is there any special way of getting your ice trays loose?

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.760
 Well, my mother never has any trouble, Henry.

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.280
 All she does is pull and they come right out.

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.520
 That's funny.

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.640
 I'll take another crack at it.

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:34.440
 Nice guy.

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.360
 I'd like to see him come out for football practice

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:37.240
 some afternoon.

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.560
 Bill, what did I tell you about sympathy and understanding?

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:41.680
 Oh, I understand, Henry.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.960
 That's why I have no sympathy for her.

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.600
 I don't forget about him.

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.280
 What about that dance Friday night?

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.120
 What about it?

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.320
 Well, what time should I--

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.240
 [LAUGHTER]

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.320
 What time should I--

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:57.000
 You know, he's going to wreck your refrigerator.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.600
 What time should I call for you?

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:59.600
 Oh, about that.

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:07.600
 [LAUGHTER]

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.680
 Just an answer.

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:10.680
 Yes, mother?

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.520
 - All those boys playing football down there.

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:17.520
 - No, Mother Henry's getting some ice.

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:19.640
 - I'll pick everything up, Nancy.

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:21.040
 - Does your father have a hammer I could use

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.720
 with this screwdriver or a small crowbar

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:23.960
 would be even better?

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.960
 - Henry, what's that all over your suit?

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.800
 - It's, well you see, I was aiming for the ice cubes,

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.120
 but was your mother planning to have

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.200
 tomato juice for dinner?

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:33.760
 (audience laughing)

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:34.600
 - Why?

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.240
 - There's a freshly opened can in the ice box.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.400
 - Oh my goodness.

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.400
 - Of course if they're going out for dinner,

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:39.520
 it'll keep the tomorrow's lunch.

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.720
 - I'm out of the way, Henry, I'll get the ice out.

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.080
 - Now wait a second, Bill, you'll need something

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.920
 to loosen it with.

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:45.920
 - What's the matter with my hands?

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:49.480
 - Some guy sure loved a brag.

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:50.560
 - Why a bill turner?

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:51.560
 - Whoa!

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.960
 Hey, who could put her on the floor?

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.080
 - I'm here!

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.400
 - Just took it out so I could get better leverage.

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.400
 - Nancy, will one tray of ice be enough?

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:01.960
 - She did, I loosen it that much?

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.520
 - Nancy, I don't think you'll feel the same way about

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.520
 you know who, once you get a look at your mother's kitchen.

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:08.760
 - I think I better be going.

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:10.240
 Oh, Henry, do you have to?

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.800
 Well, I've got a lot of homework to do,

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.720
 and I think I better.

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:14.640
 Don't you?

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:16.080
 Well, if you have to.

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.560
 I, I, I had a very swell evening, though.

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:19.880
 Oh, I'm awfully glad, Henry.

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.680
 Well, so long.

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.440
 You really have to go.

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:24.480
 I think I better.

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:26.400
 Oh, but would your mind closing that door

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.840
 that coach told me to keep out of draft?

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:29.680
 Oh, oh, sure.

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:33.320
 I didn't realize I was keeping the door open.

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:36.120
 What time should I call for you Friday evening?

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.480
 Friday evening?

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:39.080
 Sure for the dance.

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:42.080
 Henry, I didn't promise to go with you, did I?

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.720
 Why sure, why sure?

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:45.640
 You didn't?

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:46.760
 I don't see how I could have.

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.200
 I'm going with Bill.

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:49.360
 Oh.

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:50.060
 With Bill?

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:51.480
 Oh, I'm terribly sorry, Henry.

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:53.080
 I guess you must have misunderstood it.

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.560
 Hey, what about that door?

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:56.120
 I'll walk you after the porch.

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.080
 No, no, you go back and have your ginger ale.

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.480
 I can find my way, all right.

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.360
 Boy, I hope you understand, Henry.

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:02.640
 Oh, sure.

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:04.800
 You and Bill just go ahead and enjoy yourselves.

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:17.120
 Sam, could you pass the toast please?

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:18.660
 Hey, you are, dear.

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:20.480
 Why didn't Henry go to the dance?

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:22.120
 Well, dear, that's what I don't know.

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:25.720
 Do you remember the other evening when he came home from Nancy Adams soaking wet?

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:26.220
 When?

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:29.360
 Last week, dear, a couple of nights before the dance.

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:32.000
 He walked into the house covered with tomato juice.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.900
 And Sam, Henry hasn't been himself since then.

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:36.140
 Did you have a talk with him?

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:39.940
 Yes, and all he'd say was he felt dancing was a waste of time.

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:40.780
 Mother!

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:42.940
 And Mary come in here and eat your breakfast.

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:44.940
 Mother, what's this letter all about?

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:45.740
 What letter?

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:47.740
 Why is the silliest thing I've ever seen?

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:49.540
 It must be for Father.

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:51.140
 May I see it, please?

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:52.540
 Who's it from, Sam?

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:57.140
 From the Lionel Strong Ford Institute of Physical Development Incorporated.

00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:03.140
 Dear Mr. Olrich, are you a man or a mouse?

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:05.940
 I knew all the time it wasn't for me.

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:06.940
 Yeah.

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:07.940
 Mm-hmm.

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:09.700
 No man can make his mark in the world.

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:15.700
 No man can inspire the love of a good woman unless he is willing to develop his inner potential

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:17.940
 strength in our 26-week course.

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:20.500
 Sam, what in the world is that?

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:22.300
 I don't know, Alice, but I'm fascinated.

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:27.500
 We can give you a money-back guarantee if your chest expansion does not increase by

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:30.580
 at least two inches during the first six lesson.

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:32.660
 How many inches, darling?

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:35.660
 You quiet Mary, that's just the first six lessons.

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:41.660
 We also offer a shorter course for the busy executive, interested in only partial development.

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:44.660
 Remember, decide now, yours Julie.

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:45.660
 Father, what's that?

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:57.660
 P.S. replied by return mail and received free, one genuine simulated nylon tape measure, especially desired, for checking your chest development.

00:07:57.660 --> 00:07:59.660
 Dear, when did you write for that?

00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:01.660
 May I see the envelope please?

00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:04.160
 - Father, it's addressed to Mr. Harold Olrich.

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:05.660
 Who's he?

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:08.160
 - I have no idea whether he's a man or a mouse.

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:10.660
 - Well, he put the letter back in the envelope, please.

00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:11.660
 It's probably for Henry.

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:13.660
 - Mother, why would he want to develop?

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:14.660
 - I don't know, dear.

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:16.660
 And besides, it's none of our business.

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:18.660
 Please put it back in the envelope.

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:24.660
 - Well, I think I'll walk to the office this morning.

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:27.660
 - What time you haven't walked to the office in six years?

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:28.660
 - Well, of course I have.

00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:31.540
 I walked a couple of times just this last summer.

00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:32.540
 It made me feel great.

00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:34.340
 I'll get you top coat for you, Father.

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:35.340
 My coat?

00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:36.340
 The coat?

00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:37.340
 Why would I want a coat?

00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:38.340
 Well, I can at least get your hair.

00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:39.340
 Goodbye, Alice.

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:40.340
 Goodbye.

00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:41.340
 Goodbye, son.

00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:42.340
 Goodbye.

00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:44.700
 Mother, do you have any idea where my blue and white tie is?

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:45.700
 You're a blue and white tie?

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:46.700
 No, dear.

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:47.700
 And sit down on each of your brackets.

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:48.700
 But, Mother, I've got to find it.

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:51.900
 There'll be plenty of time to find it after you've eaten.

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:52.900
 Turn around.

00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:53.900
 What's the matter?

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:57.300
 I think you want to have those shoulders on that coat taken in a little.

00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:58.300
 Taken in, Mother?

00:08:58.300 --> 00:08:59.380
 You just want to throw your money away?

00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:01.620
 They'll be filled out in 26--

00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:03.020
 I mean, before you know it.

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:05.060
 Henry, dear, please sit down.

00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:06.500
 I want to ask you something.

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:07.340
 What about?

00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:09.100
 What in the world is the trouble?

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:09.540
 The trouble?

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:10.580
 The trouble?

00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:11.780
 Gee, I don't know of any trouble.

00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:13.340
 But you want yourself, dear.

00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:16.140
 And when anyone speaks to you, you're way up in the air.

00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:18.300
 When I'm up in the air, mother, I may be a little upset

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:19.740
 because I can't find my blue and white tie.

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:21.340
 But otherwise, I feel fine.

00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:22.740
 Then why not eat your breakfast?

00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:23.300
 I'm going to eat it.

00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:25.260
 I'm going to eat it.

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.860
 How's Nancy Adams these days?

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:29.500
 Nancy Adams?

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:30.340
 Mother.

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:31.060
 Oh, I asked this.

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:32.260
 How is she?

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:33.260
 You see this book here, Mother?

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:34.020
 You see this book?

00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:34.520
 Yes.

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:36.020
 Well, that gives you an idea of what little interest

00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:37.300
 I have in Nancy Adams.

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:38.220
 What about the book?

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:39.740
 I borrowed it from her two weeks ago.

00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:40.240
 Well--

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:41.260
 I'm returning.

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:41.900
 Well, that's fine.

00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:42.540
 I'm returning it.

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:43.180
 I'm returning it.

00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:43.700
 That's all.

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:45.260
 That's as far as I go.

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.420
 She asked me whether I'd like to keep it and finish it.

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:49.260
 I'll tell her I'm not even slightly interested.

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:49.900
 Well, that's fine.

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:51.100
 Do you not drink your milk?

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:52.060
 You know what else?

00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:52.580
 What?

00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:53.060
 That's all right.

00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:53.540
 Never mind.

00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:55.220
 But if her folks can't afford a better ice box

00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:58.780
 The one they have, she was, do you like Bill Turner?

00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:00.500
 Bill Turner, I hardly know him.

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:01.860
 She is, he got a lot to learn.

00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:04.260
 He just goes around, you know what he thinks.

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:07.380
 Henry, what's your ambition in life?

00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:08.700
 My ambition, Mary, what do you mean?

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:09.420
 That's all.

00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:12.700
 I just wondered whether you wanted to be a man or a mouse.

00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:14.820
 Mary, I haven't any time for small talk.

00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:16.180
 Have you seen my blue and white tie?

00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:18.620
 No, but I'd love to see your chest expansion.

00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:20.140
 Not Mary.

00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:21.100
 That's what I say, Mother.

00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:22.420
 But, Mother, all I was going to ask him

00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:25.680
 was if he was going to take the short course of the 26-week course.

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:28.120
 Mary, will you please give Henry that letter?

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:28.680
 A letter?

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:30.680
 I don't think it's for you, though, Henry.

00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:31.760
 Mary, give me that letter.

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:33.720
 Are you, Mr. Harold, Aldrich?

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:34.840
 Mary, you come back with that.

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:36.480
 Do you realize that United States may help?

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:36.960
 Mary?

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:38.560
 Mother, it says right on the envelope.

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:40.160
 Maybe open for inspection.

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:41.680
 Mary, if you don't give me that--

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:43.520
 [LAUGHTER]

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:45.040
 Oh, we won't break anything.

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:47.480
 I'm just helping Henry develop.

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:50.120
 Now, listen, Mary, you're only going to make me late for school.

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:52.960
 - Do you wanna take it with you and show it to Nancy Adams?

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:56.400
 - Mary, if you breathe one word about this to her out,

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:59.560
 Mary, Mary, come back down here with that.

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:02.140
 (upbeat music)

00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:11.000
 - What are you writing, Henry?

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.560
 - Henry, what are you doing?

00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:17.640
 - Homer, is there a class in this room next period?

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:19.000
 - Sure.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.120
 Henry, what are all those questions you're filling out?

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:22.720
 Nothing Homer, nothing important.

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:25.080
 It's just some information I've got to send away.

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:29.160
 Could you measure my chest just once more please?

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:31.280
 It's pretty hard with this ruler.

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:32.120
 Well,

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:35.120
 (audience laughing)

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:37.320
 well, just go around me real slow.

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:40.840
 It's exactly two and a quarter.

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:42.360
 Two and a quarter?

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:44.320
 Two and a quarter rulers.

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:47.120
 That's 27 inches.

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:49.240
 27 inches for my chest.

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:51.360
 Don't you think I better take off a half inch

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:53.360
 for where I went around the corner?

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:54.920
 (audience laughing)

00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:57.000
 The only thing is Homer, my thigh was 27, too.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.880
 You mean my thigh is as big as my chest?

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:00.320
 It is.

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:01.800
 Boy, Homer, I don't want to mislead anyone.

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:03.720
 Listen, Henry, what is it you're sending for?

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:04.560
 Nothing, Homer.

00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:06.640
 Gee, what is, why would I...

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:08.360
 Do you know whether Nancy Adams has a class

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:09.200
 in her next period?

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:10.320
 Sure.

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:11.920
 I thought you were ignoring her.

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:14.440
 Oh, yeah, that's why I'm waiting to return this book.

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:16.640
 When I hand it to her, it's going to end everything.

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:18.540
 Let me see that letter, just for a second.

00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:19.640
 Will you, Henry?

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:21.820
 Homer, don't you see what's printed right at the top of it?

00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:23.280
 Strictly confidential.

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:25.340
 What is that question at the bottom mean?

00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:26.220
 What question?

00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:27.740
 Do you have flat feet?

00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:29.020
 (audience laughing)

00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:30.500
 Now listen, Homer, that just shows

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:32.020
 how your imagination works.

00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:33.260
 Well, what did it say then?

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:34.100
 Keep quiet, Homer.

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:35.300
 Ms. Watson just came into the room.

00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:36.140
 Ms. Watson?

00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:38.780
 Well, boys, you certainly look busy.

00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:40.180
 We are, Ms. Watson.

00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:42.260
 You working on your biology?

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.780
 Well, you know, what do we are?

00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:46.700
 Now isn't that fine?

00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:50.380
 You know we're going to start working on mice next week.

00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:51.380
 We are?

00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:52.820
 On mice?

00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:55.260
 Yes, we're going to compare their development

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:56.580
 without a man.

00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:58.340
 What's that?

00:12:58.340 --> 00:12:59.060
 Come on, Henry.

00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:00.220
 That's the end of the period.

00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:01.420
 There's a class coming in.

00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:02.180
 Hello, Henry.

00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:03.540
 What are you doing in here?

00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:06.220
 Well, well, and, Nancy, I've been waiting--

00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:08.300
 I've been filling out--

00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:08.900
 I've been--

00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:11.260
 Henry, you're getting ink all over yourself.

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:11.940
 I am.

00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:13.940
 Here's a blotter.

00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:17.100
 Well Nancy, I just wanted to tell you how much I enjoyed this book.

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:21.200
 Oh, I'm awfully glad you were turned at Henry, because Bill Turner is anxious to get it.

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:22.200
 He is?

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:23.400
 Are you sure you're through with it?

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:24.400
 Oh yeah.

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:28.120
 After all, even if I weren't through with it, naturally a Bill wants the book.

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:29.680
 Where have you been for the last week?

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:31.180
 Just around.

00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:32.180
 Just around every place.

00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:33.480
 Hey Henry, come on!

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:34.480
 You go ahead Homer.

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:36.320
 I may be held up here a second.

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:37.320
 Quietly.

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:38.680
 Oh you better go Henry.

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:41.080
 I just wanted to tell you though how much I enjoyed your book.

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:42.080
 Henry Aldrich.

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:44.080
 Don't you have a class this period?

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:46.080
 Yes, Ms. Watson. I'm on my way right this minute.

00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:47.080
 Goodbye, Henry.

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:48.080
 Goodbye.

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:51.080
 Boy, is Nancy a good-looking girl, Henry.

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:54.080
 Do you think she's so good-looking? I think she's terrific.

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:57.080
 Well, the way I think of her, she's good-looking, but I wouldn't ever want to...

00:13:57.080 --> 00:14:00.080
 Henry, let me have a look at that letter, will you?

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:01.080
 What letter?

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:02.080
 About your flat feet.

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:03.080
 Now Homer, listen.

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:06.080
 Homer, who is that letter?

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:08.080
 I haven't got it.

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:10.080
 I put it in this Latin book.

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:12.380
 I put it right here in the Appleton of Absolutes section.

00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:13.460
 Well, don't look at me.

00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:15.380
 I didn't even touch your letter.

00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:17.380
 Do you suppose I put it in Nancy's book?

00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:18.300
 You did.

00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:21.580
 Well, why would she be interested in your flat feet?

00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:23.260
 Oh, I didn't know I put them there.

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:24.500
 I mean, the letter there.

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:26.580
 I was just talking to her, and I may have just stuck it in there.

00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:28.460
 Well, Homer, I've got to get that letter.

00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:29.020
 Why?

00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:31.620
 I think I want a thing like that to be read publicly by Nancy.

00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:33.500
 Well, you certainly can't get it now, Henry.

00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:34.860
 Maybe they haven't started class yet.

00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:36.300
 Well, I'm not going in with you.

00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:38.820
 I don't want the whole class to look at me, you quiet, Homer.

00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:42.060
 going back in and get that letter.

00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:45.420
 Will you all get your pencils, please?

00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:47.300
 I bet your part in Henry Always is there

00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:48.900
 something we can do for you?

00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:52.340
 Why, if Miss Watson, I'm starting to interrupt your lesson

00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:54.700
 like this, but I just returned Nancy to a book.

00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:56.140
 [LAUGHTER]

00:14:56.140 --> 00:14:58.620
 I mean, the Nancy's desk has something in it

00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:01.220
 I'd like to want.

00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:01.980
 I mean, me.

00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:04.220
 Well, is it anything you can't do without for the rest

00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:04.900
 of the period?

00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:05.340
 Well, yes.

00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:06.780
 Am I just have to have it?

00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:08.540
 Well, if it won't take more than a second,

00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:10.340
 you may go to a desk and get it.

00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:11.340
 Thank you, Ms. Watson.

00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:13.580
 In the meantime, when all of you be copying,

00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:15.140
 what's written on the board here?

00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:17.620
 [LAUGHTER]

00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:19.820
 It's like, by the way.

00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:20.820
 Nancy.

00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:22.300
 Henry, what on earth is it you want?

00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:23.780
 I'd like to borrow that book again.

00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:25.580
 But Henry, it didn't have to come all the way back

00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:27.020
 into class and embarrass me.

00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:28.500
 But I just happened to remember.

00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:29.580
 I haven't finished it.

00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:31.140
 I thought you said you had finished it.

00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:32.500
 All the giants, like I don't know all.

00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:33.900
 Henry, will you hurry, please?

00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:34.900
 Yes, Ms. Watson.

00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:35.400
 You're Henry.

00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:37.220
 Thanks very much.

00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:41.180
 Henry, may I ask what book that is?

00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:42.820
 This book I just got from Nancy?

00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:43.660
 Yes.

00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:45.860
 Well, it's just a book.

00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:48.620
 What is the title?

00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:49.620
 Rita's Revenge.

00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:52.780
 [LAUGHTER]

00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:56.460
 And that is the book you were in so much of a hurry to get.

00:15:56.460 --> 00:15:58.540
 Well, I'll tell you, it isn't a story I'm so anxious to get.

00:15:58.540 --> 00:16:01.100
 Yeah, I have a book, please.

00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:01.900
 The whole book?

00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:04.300
 The whole book.

00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:05.460
 Wouldn't I take just one look?

00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:06.660
 Please don't open it.

00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:07.500
 No?

00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:08.940
 - May I have it please?

00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:10.020
 - Yes, Ms. Watson.

00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:12.500
 - And I should like to see Nancy Adams

00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:14.060
 immediately after class.

00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:17.980
 - But Ms. Watson, will you please leave this classroom?

00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:18.980
 - Yes, Ms. Watson.

00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:22.380
 I'll go.

00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:25.220
 (audience laughing)

00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:27.800
 (upbeat music)

00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:36.460
 - Welcome back to the Aldridge family in just a moment.

00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:39.900
 Sundays on this station are really full of top radio shows,

00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:42.020
 but I'd like to tell you about just one of them,

00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:43.980
 "Theta Guild on the Air."

00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:45.540
 For seven seasons, "The Theta Guild"

00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:47.180
 has been bringing you the brightest stars

00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:49.340
 of Broadway and Hollywood and some of the world's

00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:50.900
 greatest plays.

00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:53.020
 Tonight, the comedy attraction is Ring Lardner's

00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:55.540
 baseball story, "Elmer the Great."

00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:58.220
 Your stars are Eddie Bracken and Wanda Hendricks.

00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:00.380
 Now, the play concerns Elma Kane, a pitcher

00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:03.020
 with the best right arm and the three-eye league,

00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:04.740
 but a brain which has failed to vibrate

00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:06.820
 with a clear thought since birth.

00:17:06.820 --> 00:17:08.820
 Now Elmer refuses to leave Gentry Villalenoy

00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:11.540
 for the big league because he's in love with Nelly Poole,

00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:14.660
 owner of the grocery where he drives the delivery wagon.

00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:17.380
 But Nelly guesses his secret and fires Elmer.

00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:20.020
 Well, from then on, it's all ring-lard and a fun.

00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:22.580
 So check your newspaper for broadcast times

00:17:22.580 --> 00:17:26.140
 and tune to NBC tonight for "Theta Guild on the Air."

00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:29.140
 You'll enjoy Elmer the Great.

00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:31.720
 (upbeat music)

00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:38.720
 [Music]

00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:41.720
 And now getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldrich.

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:45.720
 Henry has decided that he needs a course in physical development.

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:49.720
 And after filling out the rather intimate questions on the application blank,

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:53.720
 he discovers that he has left the blank in a book belonging to Nancy Adams.

00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:56.720
 The scene opens in Henry's school at the close of a period.

00:17:56.720 --> 00:18:00.720
 Listen, Henry, this will make two classes I've missed just because of you.

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:03.720
 All you have to do is just walk up to Miss Watson's desk there,

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:05.720
 pick up Nancy's book, and walk out with it.

00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:07.720
 It's as easy as pie.

00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:09.720
 Are you sure Miss Watson isn't in there?

00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:12.720
 No one's in there. There isn't a soul in there now.

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:15.720
 You like pie? Why don't you go in and get it?

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:17.720
 Well, she was Homer. I was going to stand here in the door,

00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:19.720
 and people watch for you.

00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:22.720
 Well, if anyone does come along, Henry, give me a signal.

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:23.720
 Clear your throat.

00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:25.720
 Sure, I'll sort of cough.

00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:27.720
 Okay, I'll go.

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:29.720
 That's it.

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:33.720
 That's it. Just walk right up as though you own the place.

00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:36.720
 Which book is it? The one your hand is on.

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:39.720
 This isn't it. Sure it is. Isn't that book blue?

00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:42.720
 Sure, but it's the advanced essence of poetry.

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:44.720
 It must be there Homer.

00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:46.720
 Come here and show it to me.

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:49.720
 Alright, wait a second. I'll close the door part way.

00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:51.720
 If it was here, it would be here.

00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:54.720
 Homer, I'm almost positive Miss Watson didn't take it with her.

00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:56.720
 Alright, show it to me.

00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:58.320
 It's a book with a blue cover.

00:18:58.320 --> 00:18:59.720
 A blue cover?

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:00.720
 Oh, this must be it.

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:01.720
 Yes, Ms. Watson.

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:03.220
 Henry, someone's out in the hall.

00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:04.720
 Well, I'm glad to hear that.

00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:06.220
 Quick, Homer, Doc, have you got it?

00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:07.220
 Where are we done?

00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:09.720
 Get down here beside our desk.

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:11.720
 Did they come in, Henry?

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:13.220
 No, they just closed the door.

00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:14.220
 Well, come on.

00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:15.220
 Let's get out of here.

00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:16.220
 And that's so fast, Homer.

00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:17.220
 It won't tell you they've gone down the hall.

00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:19.220
 But, Henry, I've got to get to my next class.

00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:20.720
 Quiet.

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:22.220
 Open the door easy.

00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:24.220
 I'm going to.

00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:27.720
 You must be stuck.

00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:29.720
 Let me try it.

00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:33.720
 Henry, this is all your fault.

00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:35.720
 Now don't get panicky Homer, we'll get it open.

00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:36.720
 Oh, it's locked.

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:39.720
 You are crazy. Why wouldn't anybody lock a door and draw a daylight?

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:45.720
 All we have to do is throw ourselves against it.

00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:48.720
 Okay. One, two, three.

00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:54.720
 Don't you stand there Homer? Help me up.

00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:57.720
 I guess they locked it all right.

00:19:57.720 --> 00:20:00.720
 You mean we're locked in and I can't get to solid geometry?

00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:02.720
 Well at least they didn't see us Homer.

00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:04.720
 But Henry I'm weak in geometry as it is.

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:07.720
 Well all we have to do is climb out that window.

00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:10.720
 But what good are we going to do? We're way up in the third floor.

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:13.720
 Homer stop arguing. Give me that book and let's go.

00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:24.680
 [

00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:29.680
 If you're quite sure you won't let this book interfere with your studies anymore, you may have it.

00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:30.680
 Yes, Miss Watson.

00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:32.680
 I'm sorry you let Henry Aldrich have it.

00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:37.680
 After all, he has much more important things to attend to than Rita's revenge.

00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:40.680
 Yes, Miss Watson. He's a very nice boy, Nancy.

00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:42.680
 At least he has his good points.

00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:48.680
 But I do wish you'd become more interested in someone who takes things just a bit more seriously than Henry does.

00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:49.680
 Yes, Miss Watson.

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:51.680
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:20:51.680 --> 00:21:05.600
 Be careful, Homer.

00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:07.600
 Do you want to knock me off this fire escape?

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:10.800
 Well, gee whiz, Henry, we have to get out of here somehow.

00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:12.080
 Don't you realize this fire escape

00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:14.280
 goes right past all the second floor classrooms?

00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:15.920
 It never goes below the second floor?

00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:17.280
 We'll keep quiet, Henry.

00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:19.400
 Suppose somebody should see us out here.

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:20.720
 Let's close the window.

00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:22.040
 They're quiet now, Henry.

00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:24.040
 They're being quiet.

00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:24.540
 That's it.

00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:26.600
 Make all the noise you can.

00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:29.680
 All we have to do now is go up the fire escape to the roof.

00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:32.080
 And then I suppose we just jump off.

00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:33.720
 It's bound to leave to something, Homer.

00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:34.600
 Come on.

00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:35.600
 Have you got Nancy's book?

00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:36.240
 Sure.

00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:37.000
 Here, take it.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:37.920
 Here's my letter in it.

00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:39.320
 I don't know.

00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:40.200
 Hey, Homer.

00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:40.840
 What?

00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:42.280
 This is Nancy's book.

00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:44.360
 She was-- this is Miss Watson's report book.

00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:45.440
 There's a report book.

00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:47.600
 What made you think my letter'd be inside this?

00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:49.600
 You said blue so I grabbed blue.

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:50.960
 [LAUGHTER]

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:53.200
 But you should have looked, Homer.

00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:56.800
 Boy, if we get caught with this, we can even be expelled.

00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:58.080
 Just for having a report book?

00:21:58.080 --> 00:21:59.080
 Sure.

00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:02.120
 Well, you can be the one that takes it back, Henry.

00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:03.840
 All we have to do is open the window.

00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:05.600
 And be sure no one's in there, Henry.

00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:07.840
 No one's in there.

00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:08.880
 She was.

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:09.960
 Lift, Henry.

00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:11.960
 I am lifting, Homer.

00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:13.960
 Move back so I can get some leverage.

00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:14.920
 What's the matter, Henry?

00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:15.960
 Are you weak?

00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:18.160
 Well, gee, as maybe I do need--

00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:19.640
 wouldn't you think I could at least open a window

00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:21.320
 when it's an emergency?

00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:22.840
 Boy, you're really in a fix.

00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:24.640
 You've got Ms. Watson's reports, and Nancy's

00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:25.640
 got your measurements.

00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:26.800
 Sure.

00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:29.920
 And probably by this time, Nancy's read the whole thing.

00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:32.080
 Come on, Homer, we've got to get off this virus game.

00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:36.000
 Boys, boys, what are you doing up there?

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.280
 Who is it, Henry?

00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:39.760
 What are you doing up there?

00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:41.000
 It's Mr. Bradley.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:42.000
 He's down in the courtyard.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:43.240
 Boys!

00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:46.520
 - Why, we just kind of opened a window, Mr. Bradley.

00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:48.680
 - Don't you know the rules about going out

00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:50.600
 on the fire escape?

00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:52.520
 - Are there any special rules, Mr. Bradley?

00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:54.120
 - What are your names?

00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:57.040
 - Henry, Aldrich.

00:22:57.040 --> 00:22:57.880
 - Oh.

00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:00.720
 - Homer, Brown.

00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:01.960
 - Oh.

00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:03.560
 - Henry and Homer.

00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:05.200
 - All tricks and brown?

00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:06.040
 - Yes, sir.

00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:06.880
 (audience laughing)

00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:08.720
 - Of an adult and fire estate,

00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:10.680
 then report to my office at once.

00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:11.720
 - Yes, sir.

00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:15.720
 How would you like to have us get there, Mr. Bradley?

00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:19.720
 Any way you can.

00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:21.720
 The only trouble is, Mr. Bradley.

00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:23.720
 What's that?

00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:26.720
 Nothing. We'll get down.

00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:40.720
 And how long have you been a student in this school, young man?

00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:42.220
 About three years, Mr. Bradley.

00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:43.880
 And this other young man?

00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:46.080
 About three and a half, Mr. Bradley.

00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:49.180
 But that was on account of the mumps right on top of the measles.

00:23:49.180 --> 00:23:51.160
 I see.

00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:55.860
 And you both know those fire escapes were placed there for emergency use only?

00:23:55.860 --> 00:23:57.260
 Well, the fact is, Mr. Bradley...

00:23:57.260 --> 00:23:59.700
 It wasn't enough that you were out on a fire escape.

00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:04.740
 You climbed in a window and broke right into the middle of Professor Vanderhoof's French class.

00:24:04.740 --> 00:24:07.980
 Well, you see, Mr. Bradley was the only way we could get off the fire escape.

00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:09.840
 Professor Vanderhoof's window was open...

00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:12.520
 Homer, must you lean on my desk?

00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:14.400
 No, sir, excuse me.

00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:15.600
 I thought you were through with us.

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:18.520
 I don't know whatever gave you that impression.

00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:21.040
 Excuse me, but can I interrupt you, Mr. Bradley?

00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:22.880
 You're Bill Turner, aren't you?

00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:25.600
 Yes, I'm the one that carried three men over our goal

00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:26.320
 Saturday.

00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:28.600
 And what were you sent in here for?

00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:31.120
 Well, I suppose I shouldn't have been reading this book

00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:32.800
 during study hour, Mr. Bradley.

00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:34.360
 What's the title?

00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:36.400
 Readers revenge.

00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:37.800
 Readers revenge.

00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:39.400
 I see.

00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:40.900
 - Hey, Henry. - Yes, Mr. Bradley.

00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:42.820
 What do you think of a boy who would spend his time

00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:44.340
 reading a book like that?

00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:47.340
 Well, I guess it's pretty bad, Mr. Bradley.

00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:48.620
 That's what I say.

00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:49.460
 I see.

00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:53.340
 Do you know what I think all three of you boys need?

00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:54.180
 No, sir.

00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:56.820
 Suppose you wait here, all of you,

00:24:56.820 --> 00:24:59.020
 while I step out and get your records.

00:24:59.020 --> 00:25:00.020
 Yes, sir.

00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:01.860
 Bill, what did you get that book?

00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:04.100
 From Nancy, and what business is it of yours?

00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:05.940
 Listen, Bill, could I borrow it a second?

00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:08.660
 Nancy's book, all I wanna do is take it for just one second.

00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:10.160
 I just want to...

00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:11.600
 I just want to...

00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:13.000
 Can't you even let me look at it?

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:14.000
 Keep your hands off.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.000
 Let me have that.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:16.000
 People, wait, do you hear me?

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.500
 Hey, Henry, look at what fell out of it.

00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:19.000
 There's your letter right in the floor.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:20.000
 Gee whiz.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.000
 Phil, turn to you, take your foot off that.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.000
 You make me.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:24.000
 Do you hear me?

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.000
 Take your foot off that letter.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:26.000
 Henry, somebody's coming.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:27.000
 I don't care.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.840
 Mr. Bradley, Ms. Watson asked me, Henry.

00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:30.840
 Hello, Nancy.

00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:31.840
 Close the door.

00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:32.840
 Let go of my leg, Aldrich.

00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:34.840
 You look like you're like, do you hear me?

00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:35.840
 Let's go.

00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:36.840
 Boy, stop.

00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:38.400
 (audience laughing)

00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:40.500
 Lift his leg, Henry.

00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:42.100
 - I need more leverage.

00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:43.500
 - Hey, Bill, cut it out.

00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:44.540
 You're twisting my hand.

00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:45.380
 - Yeah?

00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:46.660
 - No, turn it, you stop that.

00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:48.020
 - Tharn you, Bill.

00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:49.940
 ( (audience laughing)

00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:50.780
 - There.

00:25:50.780 --> 00:25:53.420
 - Henry, Gee, Henry, you knocked him out.

00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:54.260
 - Oh boy.

00:25:54.260 --> 00:25:56.420
 - You lifted him right off the floor.

00:25:56.420 --> 00:25:58.340
 - Hey, what happened?

00:25:58.340 --> 00:25:59.220
 - He's all right, Henry.

00:25:59.220 --> 00:26:01.100
 Pick him up before Mr. Bradley comes in.

00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:01.940
 - Come on, Homer.

00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:03.340
 Let's lift him out of the couch.

00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:04.740
 - Ugh.

00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:07.340
 Listen, Alders, why did you hit me with?

00:26:07.340 --> 00:26:08.980
 I just used my bare hands.

00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:10.340
 Didn't I, Nancy?

00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:12.500
 Now then, young man,

00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:15.940
 Turner, did anyone invite you to lie down in that pouch?

00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:19.260
 (audience laughing)

00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:20.420
 Oh, Mr. Bradley.

00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:22.060
 I'll help him out, Mr. Bradley.

00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:23.820
 Don't you think he can get up himself?

00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:24.980
 Well, I'm up.

00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:27.020
 Well, young lady.

00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:29.140
 Miss Watson asked me to bring her keys down here.

00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:30.740
 I'll take them in one moment.

00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:32.620
 Turner, here's what I want you to do.

00:26:32.620 --> 00:26:37.100
 I want you to spend a part of each lunch hour for the next 10 days picking up the papers

00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:39.100
 and the corridors of this building.

00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:41.500
 On all three floors.

00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:43.140
 On all three floors.

00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:48.620
 And as for how did Miss Watson's report book get here on my desk?

00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:50.140
 On your desk, Mr. Bradley.

00:26:50.140 --> 00:26:51.900
 Nancy, would you see that she gets it back?

00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:52.900
 Yes, sir.

00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:54.940
 Now then, Aldrich and Brown.

00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:55.940
 Yes, Mr. Bradley?

00:26:55.940 --> 00:26:56.940
 Yes, Mr. Bradley.

00:26:56.940 --> 00:26:59.260
 I'm sending you to the gym instructor.

00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:03.260
 He needs a couple of huskies like you two to help him move the steel lockers.

00:27:03.260 --> 00:27:04.260
 Move them?

00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:07.260
 Yeah, tell me.

00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:09.260
 Aren't there quite a few, Mr. Bradley?

00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:13.260
 There are 350. It will take every afternoon for the next two weeks.

00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:18.260
 Gee whiz! That's alright Homer. You heard what Mr. Bradley said.

00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:21.260
 They need a couple of huskies like you and me.

00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:23.260
 Aldrich, what's that you're tearing up?

00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:27.260
 Nothing. It's just sort of a letter I've decided I won't need anymore.

00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:30.700
