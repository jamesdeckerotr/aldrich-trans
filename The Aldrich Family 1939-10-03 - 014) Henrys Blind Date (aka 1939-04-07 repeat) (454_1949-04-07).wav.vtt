 [Music]

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.400
 Henry Henry Audrey!

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.600
 Coming, Mother.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:22.000
 [Music]

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
 The Aldrich family, starring as Restoned, written by Clifford Goldsmith,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.500
 Brought to you by Jell-O-footing, those delicious new desserts all America's talking about.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:47.200
 [Music]

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.800
 The Aldrich family can be seen now in the current Paramount picture of what alive.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.500
 Don't miss it.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:59.500
 And tonight Betty Field, one of the stars of the picture, plays Barbara Pearson, Henry's current girlfriend.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.500
 As usual on the air, the part of Henry Aldrich is played by Ezra Stone.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.500
 In the living room of the Aldrich home, Mr. and Mrs. Aldrich are talking.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.500
 Henry is just coming in through the hall door.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.500
 Well, then, remember how worried we were a week ago?

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.500
 Over Henry.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:18.500
 Over Henry.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.500
 And that terrible constant mark.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.040
 Who's interested in this week?

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.960
 He's coming back to Barbara Pearson.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.260
 Mother!

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:27.180
 Yes, Henry.

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.720
 May I ask you a question?

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:29.280
 Yes.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.260
 Are you sure you won't mind if I ask him?

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:32.560
 Well, no.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.000
 Could I have $3?

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.320
 We're all.

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:36.300
 Could I please?

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:37.160
 What for?

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.840
 Well, I've got to get something, mother, before it's gone.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.200
 Can't you tell me what it is?

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.000
 Well, you'll just think it's foolish.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.040
 Then I'm afraid, dear.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.200
 You cannot have the $3.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.600
 You mean you don't trust me?

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.440
 Well, would you mind not standing directly in my light, Henry?

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:51.800
 I'm sorry, Father.

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.760
 Why don't you ask your father, Father?

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.320
 I know he wouldn't give it to me.

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.320
 Would your father?

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.000
 Would you?

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.680
 No, would I want?

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.400
 Well, I'll tell you, this is all I want.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.280
 This is all there is to it.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.320
 Practically every guy I know that's got a girl

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.280
 has given her something to wear.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.720
 Henry, you mean the boys give their things

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.640
 to wear nowadays?

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.040
 Oh, sure, it may sound a little strange,

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.480
 but I mean things like class pin.

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.560
 Only my class hasn't got a pin.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.120
 - Well, I thought you did give Barbara

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.360
 some kind of a pin.

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.920
 - I did, mother, but she isn't crazy about it.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:28.720
 - Why not?

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.000
 - Well, in the first place, all it says on it

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.240
 is vote the Democratic ticket.

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.800
 Would you like it if that was all somebody

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.040
 could afford to give you?

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.840
 - But the important thing is the sentiment behind it.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.040
 - I know if that's a trouble.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.680
 Her father's a Republican.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:43.720
 - A Republican?

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:44.560
 - Yeah.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:45.760
 - But I think you'd better stay away

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.260
 from their house in the future.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.060
 This is no time to joke.

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.860
 Here's the position I'm in.

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.660
 I told Barbara, in fact I practically promised her I'd give her a pin.

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.460
 You know, the one I saw downtown, the jewelry store.

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:01.560
 Henry, dear, knowing Barbara Pearson as I do,

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.060
 I don't believe that what you give her is even slightly important.

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.060
 But she was there, thought you wanted me to take an interest in Barbara Pearson.

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.460
 I even promised her I'd never go inside Constant Marshall's house again.

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:15.060
 Wouldn't you like encouragement?

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.140
 Henry, you may not under any circumstances have any money.

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:20.740
 I'm not asking for money, mother.

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:21.820
 You're not.

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:23.380
 I've given that up.

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:24.620
 When did you give it up?

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.100
 Just now.

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.220
 This is all I want.

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.700
 Now, don't fly off the handle, father.

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.540
 It isn't as bad as it's going to sound at first.

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.700
 You know that gold five beta cap of key you wear on your watch chain?

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:37.580
 I do.

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:38.940
 Well, uh...

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.260
 Do you wear that quite a little?

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.820
 You mean to say you're going to ask me for it?

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:48.140
 Well, don't you ever get tired of it and wish you could wear something else now and then?

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:52.380
 In other words, you want to give Barbara Pearson my five-eighter capacity.

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.300
 You feel that strong about it?

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:55.340
 That's wrong.

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:01.100
 I'm just suggesting you loan it to her father and you can go back to the vote the Democratic ticket pin.

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:04.540
 Hi, Henry. Mind the black men?

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:05.660
 Come on in, Dizzy.

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:08.220
 I want to speak to you alone, Henry.

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:09.420
 Good evening, Dizzy.

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:10.940
 Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Aldrich.

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:12.220
 Good evening, Dizzy.

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.140
 Henry, I've got to speak to you alone.

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:15.020
 What about?

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.940
 Just something.

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:17.420
 Can't you tell him here, Dizzy?

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:20.220
 Oh, this is in strict confidence, Mrs. Alders.

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.260
 Well, I'm trying to get a decision about something, Dizzy.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.620
 Henry, if I were you, I'd go out and see what Dizzy wants.

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:27.340
 Okay.

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.260
 Come on out here in the hall, Henry.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:30.060
 It's private?

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:31.180
 Wait till I tell you.

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:35.020
 Can anyone hear through that door?

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.900
 No.

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.820
 What are you doing tomorrow, Eden?

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:38.620
 Why?

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:39.980
 Well, hold on to something.

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:42.780
 How would you like a blind date?

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:43.780
 A blind date?

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:44.780
 Sure.

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:45.780
 Me?

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:46.780
 She's a dream.

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:48.780
 Henry, you never saw a prettier girl in your life.

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:49.780
 Have you seen her?

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:50.780
 No, but my girl has.

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.780
 But I've got a date tomorrow night with Barbara Pearson.

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.780
 Listen, Henry, you can see Barbara anytime.

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:57.780
 But this girl?

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.780
 She's visiting my girl only a few days.

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:01.780
 Oh, I see.

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:02.780
 Well, you see, does he...

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:05.780
 I just got one misunderstanding straightened out with Barbara.

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:08.780
 You don't help me out, I'm sunk.

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:12.240
 Henry, what are you and Izzy talking about out there in the hall?

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.580
 Oh nothing mother.

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:16.780
 We were just discussing a problem I had Mrs. Aldrin.

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:19.140
 If you don't mind, I'll leave this door open.

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:21.580
 It's terribly close in the living room.

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:24.580
 Well, let's go into the dining room.

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:27.380
 Don't you think you ought to get to know other girls?

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:29.180
 Do you want to stay in a ruff?

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:31.980
 That's what started the trouble I just got over.

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:33.580
 Look, will this help?

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:35.980
 Supposing I get the girl on the telephone.

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:36.580
 Why?

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:37.980
 So you can sound around?

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:42.400
 "No." "Then what can I do to convince you?" "Well, uh...

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:48.320
 Have you got three dollars?" "For what?" "Well, just as a loan."

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:53.640
 "Listen, she's begging for a chance to meet you. Meet me?" "Sure!"

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:59.940
 "I think you know about me. If I remember correctly, she thinks she saw you on the street

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:04.620
 the other day." "Say come to think?" "I wonder if she's

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:09.540
 a one-ice walk does she have a high black hat with a sort of a veil that sure

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:16.200
 is that right who has a black hat in the veil nobody father would you mind

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:22.560
 talking so I either can hear you or so I can't maybe we better go in the kitchen

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:25.180
 okay

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:30.960
 now do you see what's ahead of you Henry the only thing let me call her up and

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:35.600
 ask her whether she's got a bail. Do you have any way of raising three dollars, Dizzy?

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:40.080
 I've got to pay you to meet a beautiful girl? I promise, Barbara, that when I see you tomorrow

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:45.680
 night, I'll have a pen for it. All right, you wait. You wait. Just you wait until sometime you

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:50.080
 ask me to do something for you. I'm sorry, Henry, but you both have to get out of this kitchen

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:55.120
 while I do some work here. Where do we go now, Henry? Let's go upstairs. Your father just went

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:59.680
 upstairs, Henry. Well, then let's go out and have him been in the living room yet. That's right.

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:01.180
 Come on, let's go in there.

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:03.880
 Would you boys mind telling me what all this is about?

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:07.180
 I'm trying to make Henry see the light, Mrs. Allred.

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:10.980
 See, Henry, I've got an idea.

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:14.380
 I haven't got a pin you could give, Bobber, but I've got a lady's ring.

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:15.180
 Where'd you get it?

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:15.980
 I found it.

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:17.680
 I found it in a trash pile.

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:18.480
 Is it any good?

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:21.180
 It's gold with a black stone and pearls.

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:24.080
 And if I help you out tomorrow night, you'll give it to me?

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:26.580
 Well, I won't give it to you, but I'll loan it to you.

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:27.980
 Say yes, Henry.

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:30.980
 Well, of shaking, we'll make it a bargain.

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:31.980
 No.

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:34.980
 If I give you the ring out, right, will you let me?

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:37.980
 And I can tell Barbara to keep us sure.

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:39.980
 And it isn't going to cost me anything?

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:40.980
 Not a cent.

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:42.980
 All we'll do is sit around in the house.

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:44.980
 Something tells me dizzy.

00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:46.980
 I shouldn't say yes.

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:50.980
 And something tells you that you shouldn't say no to, doesn't it?

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:53.980
 Remember that black hat with the veil?

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:54.980
 Yeah.

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:56.980
 Go ahead.

00:07:56.980 --> 00:07:58.980
 Hello, operating?

00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:00.980
 Alfa, fire!

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:02.980
 I want Elm, free, free, free!

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:06.980
 From now on, Henry, your lucky number is free.

00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:09.980
 Are you going free, free, free?

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:11.980
 Yes, ma'am.

00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:13.980
 I wonder if she's doing anything tonight.

00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:19.980
 The only thing is to see, even if you do get this girl, you can't tell from her voice what she looks like.

00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:20.980
 Why not?

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:24.980
 All I've got to do is hear one word and I can size up a girl in a minute.

00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:28.740
 minute. Oh, what was that?

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:33.780
 Listen, if that's the girl you're trying to get for me, does he? You can hang up. Who is this

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:34.420
 speaking?

00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:42.820
 Hang up, my girl's aunt. Oh, what is going on here? Nothing, Father. Hello, this is

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:44.340
 Dizzy. All the girls in?

00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:52.260
 Out? Ask her whether her friend, you know, your girlfriend's friend has a veil. Does your

00:08:52.260 --> 00:09:07.440
 Nice have a veil. Mrs. Hopkins you can tell that will be all set for tomorrow. Thank you

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:14.060
 Mrs. Hopkins. Goodbye. Your boys find the veil. Well only in the way we did father.

00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:20.460
 Henry could you walk to the door with me? Sure. All I want to say Henry. If you don't

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:21.720
 I want to all take it.

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:24.460
 Oh, you don't. I saw her first, didn't I?

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:25.960
 When do I get that ring?

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:28.360
 I'll get it for you by noon tomorrow.

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:29.660
 Why not before then?

00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:31.460
 I've got to get it from my girl.

00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:32.460
 From your girl?

00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:33.860
 Sure, she's wearing it.

00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:34.960
 She's wearing it?

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:36.060
 At night, Henry.

00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:37.460
 Hey, Disney.

00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:41.460
 I wonder whether Barbara will mind if she finds that out.

00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:44.460
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:47.200
 (dramatic music)

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:57.760
 - What's the matter, grandmother?

00:09:57.760 --> 00:09:59.700
 - What are you flying around so far?

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:01.960
 - This is the evening Henry's coming over.

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:04.500
 - Huh, you suppose you bring a box candy?

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:06.900
 - What is the evening paper?

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:08.020
 - Right here.

00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:09.820
 - Let me have the movie section.

00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:12.880
 - Grandmother, will you promise me something?

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:13.720
 - Huh?

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:18.040
 that you won't embarrass me by asking him whether he ever sees any other girls.

00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:19.960
 Oh my goodness, don't you think you're not alone?

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:21.880
 It makes it look as though I were worried.

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:23.240
 Oh, God, she should be.

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:25.800
 Here's a picture I'd like to see.

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:29.560
 All right, if I come in.

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:30.600
 Hello, Henry.

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:33.000
 I've only got a second, then I've got to be going.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:33.880
 So soon.

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:34.920
 Oh, Henry?

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:36.600
 Good evening, Mrs. Anderson.

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:39.080
 Did I hear you say, young man, you can't stay?

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:41.720
 Well, something came up quite unexpectedly.

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:46.720
 You don't say how the constant marshal these days.

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:49.720
 Oh, she haven't seen her for over a week.

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:50.720
 Mm-hmm.

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:52.720
 I'm never going to see constants again.

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:57.720
 Well, you know, excuse me, I'll go out in the kitchen and make some candy.

00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:02.720
 The only reason why I have to go so soon is because I have an examination of Marlborough.

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:03.720
 And what?

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:04.720
 In Geometry.

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:07.720
 By the way, I just happened to think I brought you something.

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:10.720
 My section doesn't have an examination of Geometry tomorrow.

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:14.320
 You know? I wonder how you could account for a thing like that.

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:15.120
 Oh, wonder.

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:16.960
 Well, here's what I brought you.

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:17.920
 What is it?

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:19.360
 It's instead of a pin.

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:23.040
 Henry, I hope you didn't go and get me something expensive.

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:24.960
 Well, I just hope you'll like it.

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:28.960
 Henry, oh, look at it. It's a ridge.

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:29.840
 Sure.

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:32.880
 Oh, Henry, you shouldn't have brought anything like this.

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:34.480
 Oh, I didn't pay much for it.

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:36.960
 It's a little too large for that thing, dude.

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:38.240
 Well, try the next thing.

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:40.080
 Too large for that one.

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:42.080
 Well, how about the next one?

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:44.080
 It's still too big.

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:46.080
 Do you suppose you could wear it on your thumb?

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:50.080
 I know. I'll wear it on this chain around my neck.

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:54.080
 Hey, do I make a candy? Why don't we all go to the movie tonight?

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:57.080
 It's a picture called Man Crazy that I want to see.

00:11:57.080 --> 00:12:02.080
 But Mrs. Sanderson, I've got a geometry exam coming.

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:04.080
 I think you've got your schedule mixed in.

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:08.080
 I'm sure I am. And Dizzy has the same schedule I have.

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:12.280
 Let me give you some advice young man. I never studied geometry in my life

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:18.820
 There isn't anything going on that I don't know about well if it's money it's worrying you the trick is beyond me

00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:23.920
 Oh, that isn't it. I've got you want to go go get your coat on bobber and we'll stop grandmother

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:30.600
 Maybe he doesn't want to go. Well, of course, I might be able to you want to call your parents an ask

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:35.040
 I don't think you need to you want me to laugh on them. Oh, no, you don't have to

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:37.960
 No, you suppose that is.

00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:39.960
 They were all after the door.

00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:42.960
 Do you think that you really could go with us?

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:47.960
 I'd certainly like to, but if I don't get my studying done tonight, when will I?

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:50.960
 Good evening, Mrs. Anderson. This Henry here?

00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:51.960
 You certainly are.

00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:52.960
 Is that you, Dizzy?

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:55.960
 Hurry up, Henry. We're going to be late.

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:56.960
 Late for where?

00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:58.960
 We plan to study together.

00:12:58.960 --> 00:12:59.960
 Study what?

00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:01.960
 Our geometry. Our geometry.

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:02.960
 When?

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:05.960
 Now you dope over at my house.

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:08.960
 Oh yeah! You don't say so.

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:12.960
 Didn't I tell you it wasn't tonight that you'd have to study in the week?

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:17.960
 Well whether it is or not, uh, Dizzy, I think you'll have to study without me.

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:22.960
 Huh? Um, could I have a little conference with you out in the hall?

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:24.960
 It isn't necessary to talk it over.

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:26.960
 Speak to me in private?

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:30.960
 Uh, Bob, would that's a nice ring you're wearing around your neck?

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:35.360
 Yes, you are. Let me see it. It's gold. Now, where did you get it?

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:38.000
 Hand my baby to me. Oh, is that right?

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.480
 Uh, I'll go out my hall with you, Dizzy.

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:45.520
 Why don't we all stay here and study? Well, I have to be alone when I study,

00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:48.240
 Barbara. That's why you got to be with Henry?

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:52.720
 Are you sure you understand, Barbara? Of course.

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:57.040
 If you tell me you have to study, you have to. Sure.

00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:59.840
 It never occurred to me that I shouldn't understand.

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:00.840
 Well...

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:02.240
 Goodbye.

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:03.040
 Goodbye.

00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:05.040
 Don't study too late, boy.

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:07.540
 Oh, we won't, Mr. Sanderfuss.

00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:09.740
 Hurry up, Henry.

00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:11.740
 Tony's been waiting for us for 20 minutes.

00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:12.640
 Who has?

00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:14.040
 Constance Marshall.

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:15.640
 She's my girl, now, you dulpe.

00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:16.440
 Since when?

00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:17.640
 Since you finished with her.

00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:20.340
 This is a fine time to tell me.

00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:21.940
 I can't go over there.

00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:24.540
 I promise, Barbara, I wouldn't see her anymore.

00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:26.740
 I'm not seeing her. I'm seeing her.

00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:28.940
 You just happen to be going over to her house?

00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:29.940
 No.

00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:32.740
 Do you want me to go back and ask Barbara for that ring?

00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:34.140
 I'd like to see you.

00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:36.140
 Oh, you don't think I do it, eh?

00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:37.740
 I'll go right back into my house.

00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:38.740
 Wait, is he waiting?

00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:39.940
 Are you going?

00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:41.740
 I'll stick by you.

00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:46.340
 But something tells me I'm going to be sorry for as long as I live.

00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:57.180
 Henry and Disney are just going up the steps of constant smart little town

00:14:57.180 --> 00:15:01.660
 For some reason or other Henry doesn't look very cheerful

00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:08.260
 43 high street

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:10.340
 Didn't I tell you three years of lucky number?

00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:17.420
 Hi, ya Connie. Why Henry? Oh, did I thought Connie wasn't ever gonna see you again?

00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:21.900
 Hi, ya Connie. He got lonesome. I got lonesome. Oh, come on in

00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:27.440
 Where's uh, where's- Oh, of course. Just a minute now, Cola.

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:29.840
 Gwendolyn! Gwendolyn!

00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:30.840
 Is that her name?

00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:32.040
 What do you have?

00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:33.240
 Dizzy, I'm going home.

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:36.440
 Well, well, well. If it isn't Henry himself.

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:38.640
 And you're just as cute as I thought you'd be.

00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:41.440
 Gwendolyn, that isn't Henry. That's Dizzy.

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:44.740
 You mean... this one here is Henry?

00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:45.740
 Yes.

00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:46.740
 Well...

00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:48.240
 I'm sorry.

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:50.640
 What are you putting down your hat for, Henry?

00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:52.940
 Well, I thought we were going to stay.

00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:55.280
 Oh my goodness, what can we do here?

00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:56.240
 We're going out?

00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:58.080
 Don't you like to go out at night, Henry?

00:15:58.080 --> 00:15:59.780
 Sure he does, don't you, Henry?

00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:01.580
 We want to go to the movies.

00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:02.520
 In the movies?

00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:05.420
 Yeah, we want to see men crazy.

00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:06.480
 I know, but...

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:08.420
 Come on, little, get our things on.

00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:11.620
 I better wear my coat in case we get some ice cream after work.

00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:14.360
 Dizzy, I haven't got enough money to take them out.

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:16.760
 You don't have to pay for all of this.

00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:18.360
 Just for yourself and Glamoury.

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:19.460
 I know, but I haven't even enough for that.

00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:29.460
 For that? For that? Oh, just some. You told me this wouldn't cost anything. And did you take a look at Gwendolyn? One helping of ice cream isn't going to be enough for her.

00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:38.460
 Henry, cheer up. 25 years from now you'll be able to look back and laugh at this. Sure. 25 years from now, but this is tonight.

00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:41.460
 Henry, you're beginning to make me sorry I brought you.

00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:48.460
 But, Dizzy, she's not the girl I saw on the street. No wonder she wears a veil. What she should do was wear it in the house.

00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:50.460
 Now I am sorry.

00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:52.460
 Well, we're already dizzy.

00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:56.460
 Uh, Quentin and you leave dizzy alone. Henry is your property.

00:16:56.460 --> 00:16:58.460
 I'm her property?

00:16:58.460 --> 00:17:00.460
 That's what I'll call ya, my prop.

00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:03.460
 Come on, prop. Let me take you on.

00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:07.460
 The only thing is I promised my folks I'd be in early.

00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:11.460
 But you don't belong to them anymore? You belong to me.

00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:14.460
 Look at them own, Henry.

00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:20.940
 Yeah. And look at those three stars right up over us. Yeah. Henry, didn't I tell

00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:26.300
 you three as your lucky number? Let's get on this street. D.C. go Connie something.

00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:31.020
 Why did you want me to give back that ring? Well I had to do a favor for

00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:35.780
 somebody. You didn't give it to any other girl did you? No. Say look

00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:41.980
 Constance here on the corner. What is it? A soda fountain. Yeah? Oh boy do they

00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:44.280
 They serve terrible sodas in there.

00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:45.780
 Listen, these are good.

00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:47.480
 Look in the window there, Henry.

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:48.480
 At what?

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:49.780
 Those boxes of candy.

00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:52.380
 Don't you think we're going to be late for the first show?

00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:53.980
 Oh, we don't care whether we're late.

00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:56.380
 It looks like an awfully nice place inside.

00:17:56.380 --> 00:17:59.580
 Would you like to go in and get waves?

00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:02.980
 Say, you can't get me on any scales.

00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:06.080
 Well, why don't we stop here after the show?

00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:09.580
 I never liked to eat anything just before I go to bed.

00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:10.380
 Come on, Henry.

00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:12.700
 You might as well go in and get it over with.

00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:13.700
 Mmm!

00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:18.540
 Both those roasted almonds smell good.

00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:19.540
 Don't they?

00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:21.660
 Where shall we sit?

00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:24.580
 Let's take this table here by the candy counter.

00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:25.580
 Okay.

00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:26.580
 Good evening.

00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:27.580
 What do you have?

00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:30.180
 I'll have a chocolate marshmallow.

00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:31.180
 Same here.

00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:32.180
 Same here.

00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:35.100
 Make it free chocolate marshmallows.

00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:36.700
 I want glass of water.

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:37.700
 Why, Henry.

00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:39.700
 Aren't you going to eat anything?

00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:40.960
 I'm in training.

00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:42.960
 Oh, isn't that true bad?

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:45.640
 Read chocolate marshmallows in the glass of water.

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:46.640
 Right.

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:49.440
 You ought to change your mind, Henry. They're good here.

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:50.400
 All right, then?

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:53.640
 Why, Henry? What are you worrying about?

00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:56.040
 Worried? Worried?

00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:57.200
 Who's worried?

00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:01.280
 Say, Dizzy, let's go down there to the end of the star and look at those magazines.

00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:03.080
 Why do we have to look at those?

00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:04.960
 Oh, please, Dizzy, Izzy.

00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:05.760
 Oh...

00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:07.760
 I don't think you'll ask me.

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:12.360
 Well, I guess Connie and Henry are all alone.

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:14.560
 I guess we are.

00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:18.160
 Henry, no thanks normal picturesque.

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:20.260
 You don't think the longs are these?

00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:21.260
 Oh, you're not a...

00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:24.360
 Henry, that Bob repressed in a grandmother.

00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:27.260
 Constance, would you understand if I should go...

00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:29.560
 And leave me at the table all alone?

00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:30.760
 Where's Henry?

00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:31.760
 Oh, Richard.

00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:34.260
 Good evening, Mrs. Anderson.

00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:35.260
 Henry!

00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:37.260
 Oh, your geometry.

00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:39.880
 Constance, I guess you know...

00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:42.120
 Mrs. Sanderson and Barbara don't know.

00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:43.220
 Oh, yeah!

00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:43.880
 Would...

00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:46.360
 Would you like to sit down here with us?

00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:48.480
 No, thank you, Henry, all of the time.

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:50.280
 I wouldn't even be slightly interested.

00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:52.760
 Oh, you wouldn't, wouldn't you, Barbara?

00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:54.760
 What is that you got on that chain?

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:56.760
 That happens to be a ring, thank you.

00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:59.500
 That happens to be my ring, thank you.

00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:01.880
 So that's why he asked me for it.

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:03.880
 I didn't ask you for it.

00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:08.120
 You'll needn't explain Henry Arch. Take your hard ring.

00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:09.400
 But I don't want it.

00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:11.400
 This whole thing is a mistake.

00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:13.560
 You take it off right away.

00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:16.840
 I don't know anything foolish, young lady. That's gold.

00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:18.600
 What if it is there?

00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:22.520
 Oh my. Where did it go?

00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:25.880
 Henry, all the time. I think you're contentable.

00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:27.880
 Listen, Barbara, let me tell you.

00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:30.920
 No. Aren't you going to introduce me to your friends, Henry?

00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:32.920
 Gwendolyn, please go away.

00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:34.920
 And what's more, Henry Otis?

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:37.920
 I think you're the meanest person who never drew the life of breath.

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:39.920
 The life of breath.

00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:40.920
 The life of breath.

00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:42.920
 Where did that ring go?

00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:44.920
 What do I kid?

00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:45.920
 I'm going home.

00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:48.920
 You're going to let a thing like this spoil the movies for you?

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:49.920
 Yes.

00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:51.920
 Oh, life of breath.

00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:53.920
 A life of breath.

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:55.920
 See, who does she think she is?

00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:58.920
 Well, what I want to know is who dizzy thinks he is.

00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:02.080
 Huh! Giving my ring to that little snip.

00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:04.760
 Pardon me. You hear your Sundays and hears you check.

00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:06.880
 Say, yeah. Where is Dizzy?

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:08.560
 One day came in, he left.

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:09.560
 He left? Yeah.

00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:11.320
 That'll be 45 cents.

00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:13.000
 You like to pay for it now?

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.160
 I'd like to, but I can.

00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:18.560
 This is a nice predicament.

00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:39.280
 [Music]

00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:42.080
 Oh, look y'all, Austin! I'm going to the door!

00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:43.840
 [Music]

00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:45.600
 Oh, you!

00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:47.100
 Yes, Mrs. Sanderson.

00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:50.600
 Oh, you're the last person in the world, I expected to see tonight?

00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:51.600
 If, um...

00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:54.600
 If Barbara hasn't gone to bed yet...

00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:56.600
 Could you tell her I'm here, please?

00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:59.600
 Oh, cool. I don't think it'll do any good.

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:01.600
 Barbara?

00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:02.600
 Barbara!

00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:04.600
 You probably heard you.

00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:05.600
 Yes, Grandma.

00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:06.600
 From here a minute.

00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:07.600
 Where are you?

00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:09.600
 I'm in the front hall!

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:11.600
 Well...

00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:12.600
 Hello, Barbara.

00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:13.600
 Oh.

00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:18.280
 Oh, all I want to do is tell you exactly what happened.

00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:19.720
 I know what happened.

00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:20.720
 But you don't.

00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:23.080
 Come on in out of the cold, Henry.

00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:24.080
 All right.

00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:25.480
 I don't think I better come on in.

00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:25.980
 Come in.

00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:28.120
 I won't let her hurt you.

00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:30.360
 Yes, ma'am.

00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:33.880
 No matter what you say, Henry, it won't do a bit of good.

00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:35.680
 The only reason I didn't stay here

00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:37.360
 with you in the first place, Barbara,

00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:40.640
 was because I had a blind date night.

00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:42.080
 A blind date?

00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:44.000
 Wait, you've only heard the beginning.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:45.600
 That's all I want to hear.

00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:47.760
 You've got to hear it all.

00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:51.080
 That ring I gave it didn't even belong to me.

00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:53.680
 A beautiful sentiment to say the least.

00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:54.480
 Oh, wait.

00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:55.760
 Now, wait a minute.

00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:57.520
 It didn't belong to any girl.

00:22:57.520 --> 00:22:59.800
 If it belonged to Dizzy, he found it.

00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:00.300
 Where?

00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:02.400
 In a trash pile.

00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:04.360
 Yeah, trash pile.

00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:06.520
 And that's what I was wearing around my neck.

00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:08.160
 But I still haven't finished.

00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:10.360
 Well, from the progress you're making young men.

00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:12.600
 may be just as well if you don't finish.

00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:15.080
 And if you excuse me, I'm going upstairs.

00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:19.240
 You don't want to hear the rest of Christ I don't.

00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:20.240
 She was--

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:22.960
 Ah, Henry, old Regeira, genius.

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:25.320
 But she's so unreasonable.

00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:28.200
 She won't even listen to me.

00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:33.080
 Mrs. Sanderson, what would you do in a case like this?

00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:34.880
 You want me to tell you what I do?

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:36.240
 Yeah.

00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:38.640
 I'd stop trying to make things up.

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:41.240
 I tell her what really did happen.

00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:43.520
 That's what I've been doing.

00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:44.440
 That's the truth.

00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:47.560
 Then I'd start him with something she could believe.

00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:49.360
 You mean I should lie to her?

00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:52.200
 No, I'm not saying you should lie to her.

00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:54.720
 But in this case, I certainly wouldn't tell her

00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:56.680
 any more of the truth.

00:23:56.680 --> 00:23:57.760
 What should I do?

00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:00.080
 Let me tell you something, young man.

00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:03.360
 And if you remember, it's going to help you just as much

00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:05.080
 as geometry, ever will.

00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:05.920
 What is it?

00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:09.420
 No woman is going to believe what you want her to.

00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:11.520
 Oh, what is she going to believe?

00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:13.120
 What she wants to do.

00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:13.920
 Is that right?

00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:15.020
 Yes, sir.

00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:18.320
 At least that's the way it is to every woman I've ever known.

00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:21.020
 And when I call Barbara down here again,

00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:22.820
 don't try to push her into believing

00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:24.520
 what you think she should think.

00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:28.820
 Well, if you don't mind, I'd rather not see her.

00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:29.520
 No, no, no.

00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:31.520
 Now you wait for you.

00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:33.020
 Barbara?

00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:35.020
 Barbara?

00:24:35.020 --> 00:24:37.020
 There's no use in my trying anymore

00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:45.820
 See what I mean when I say they believe what they want to

00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:54.500
 You better be careful how you talk young lady up until this evening

00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:58.800
 I always thought it was the nicest boy I'd ever known and then hello

00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:02.860
 Didn't I tell you to be careful you've got a listen Barbara?

00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:10.480
 No, but that wasn't really dizzy's ring now. We have a new story, but it wasn't really his who's was it?

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:12.560
 well

00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:14.560
 That's something I can't tell you I

00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:21.140
 Asked my mother it didn't ever it didn't ever belong to your mother. Did it my mother? Yes

00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:23.840
 No

00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:25.480
 Henry it's dead

00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:31.420
 Why didn't you admit it in the first place? Well, because I didn't want it. Yeah, man. What?

00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:34.280
 I got the anymore stories.

00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:36.280
 She's not making this up grandmother.

00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:37.280
 How do you know?

00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:43.280
 Because, Henry, if it did belong to your mother, I'm sorry I pulled the ring away.

00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:44.280
 Y'all?

00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:46.280
 Of course I am.

00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:48.280
 Well, here it is.

00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:49.280
 Grandmother.

00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:52.280
 Have you excused me? I think I'll go up to bed.

00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:55.280
 I hope you sleep well, Mrs. Anderson.

00:25:55.280 --> 00:26:01.280
 By the way, Henry Aldrich, the story's alright as far as it goes.

00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:03.640
 Well, what were you doing Constance Marshall?

00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:05.040
 With Constance Marshall?

00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:08.840
 Do you want to know the truth?

00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:10.360
 Of course I do.

00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:12.880
 Well, that's easy to explain.

00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:14.880
 We started out and...

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:15.720
 You what?

00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:20.040
 Well, my father wanted me to study my geometry.

00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:22.680
 But you entered the soda fountain instead?

00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:23.640
 Well...

00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:25.960
 And that was where you ran into Constance?

00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:26.480
 Yeah.

00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:27.800
 Henry.

00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:29.720
 Sure.

00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:35.260
 Doesn't that just go to show you what a person's imagination can do? I'll say

00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:40.780
 Are you sure you didn't make that up about your father wanting you to stop it? No

00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:43.460
 your profit trip

00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:45.980
 Because the whole thing sounds so simple

00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:54.940
 At the yes, mr. Sanderson your father just bones you want you to come right home and do your geometry. He does

00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:57.660
 Well, what do you know about that?

00:26:58.060 --> 00:27:02.060
 Don't ever tell me anything but the truth again, Henry.

00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:04.060
 I'll say I won't.

00:27:04.060 --> 00:27:13.060
