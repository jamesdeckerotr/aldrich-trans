1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 The Olrich family based on characters originated by Clifford Goldsmith and starring Ezra Stonas Henry with Jackie Kalk as Homer.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 Henry! Henry Olrich!

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 Coming, Mother!

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 [applause]

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 When you take a typical American family, plus some friends and neighbors,

6
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,240
 You don't have to be a teenage boy.

7
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:48,280
 Well, you needn't bother to stir things up.

8
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,520
 The boy will always attend to that.

9
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,640
 Henry Olridge is no exception to the rule.

10
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,120
 The scene opens in the Aldrich living room.

11
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,280
 It's early morning.

12
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,160
 Now, Alice.

13
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,560
 Now, Mother.

14
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,760
 Sam, I'm not crying.

15
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:01,760
 Of course not, Alice.

16
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,880
 Of course not, Mother.

17
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,440
 Here, take my handkerchief.

18
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,560
 Alice, you knew Mary would be doing a thing like this,

19
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,520
 eventually.

20
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,400
 Yes, only.

21
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,920
 Sam, she's so young.

22
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,680
 You and Father wouldn't want me around the house for the rest of your lives, would you?

23
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,000
 It's just a matter of getting used to the idea, out of it.

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,280
 You'll get over it in no time.

25
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,120
 Of course you will, Mother.

26
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,600
 Henry Oldridge!

27
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,800
 Oh, Gee whiz.

28
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,560
 Henry!

29
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,280
 Henry Oldridge, how long have you been there under that piano?

30
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,200
 Why are you not long, Mary?

31
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,840
 Dear, please get off the floor with your clean sweater.

32
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,880
 Yes, Mother.

33
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,040
 And what's in that gunny sack beside you?

34
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:34,760
 Gunny sack?

35
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,440
 Mother, that's no gunny sack.

36
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,000
 No.

37
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,600
 Gee whiz, no.

38
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,480
 Then what is it?

39
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,980
 Hi Mrs. Aldrich.

40
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:41,980
 My goodness!

41
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:44,380
 Santa Coma!

42
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:46,780
 An understandable mistake, Alice.

43
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:50,580
 And would you mind telling us what you and Homer were doing under that piano?

44
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:51,980
 Doing, Father?

45
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:52,780
 If you please.

46
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:53,680
 Why you?

47
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,080
 You might say we're looking for a golf ball, Father,

48
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,680
 that accidentally rolled under there from the hall.

49
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,480
 A golf ball?

50
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,280
 Yes, sir, and I was helping him.

51
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:02,980
 You don't say?

52
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:03,680
 Yes, sir.

53
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,480
 Yes, sir.

54
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,880
 Then may I ask why you didn't let us know you were there?

55
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,380
 Why, uh...

56
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:11,080
 We didn't think it was polite to interrupt you.

57
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:16,080
 Henry Aldrich, I never thought you'd stupid-slow with spying under piano on your own sister.

58
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,880
 Spying? Mary, I was spying?

59
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,880
 Yes, you were.

60
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,880
 Well, honest, Mary, we hardly heard a word.

61
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,880
 Did we, Homer?

62
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:26,880
 No, hardly a word.

63
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:30,180
 Well, then, suppose you each take an apple and go outside.

64
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,680
 Outside? Yes.

65
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,180
 Before we find out why Mary's leaving home.

66
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:34,680
 Homer?

67
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,180
 Mr. Aldrich, I'm not nosy.

68
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:39,180
 I'm just naturally curious.

69
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:42,780
 When the time comes for you boys to know, you will be told.

70
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:43,780
 Now run along, Henry.

71
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,380
 Yes, Father. Come on, Homer.

72
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:46,180
 Well, other...

73
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:48,180
 Mother, won't you please give me your permit?

74
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:51,380
 Boy, Henry, why do you suppose they're throwing Mary out of the house?

75
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,980
 Homer, they're not.

76
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,180
 No. She's throwing them out?

77
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:58,780
 No, she's just leaving peacefully.

78
00:02:58,780 --> 00:02:59,580
 What for?

79
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:00,580
 Don't you get it?

80
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,980
 Mary's finally getting married.

81
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,380
 Mary? Sure.

82
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:05,980
 Mary? Sure.

83
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:06,980
 To a fella?

84
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:07,980
 Homer.

85
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:13,380
 It's just that I've always looked at her as just a member of your family.

86
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:15,140
 Not someone in person would marry.

87
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,140
 Why not?

88
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:18,620
 She was when you forget your prejudice.

89
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:21,300
 Mary's really a darn good looking girl.

90
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,300
 She is?

91
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,300
 Sure.

92
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,340
 Henry, who do you think she's doing it to?

93
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:26,340
 Doing what to?

94
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,340
 Getting married to.

95
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,340
 Gene.

96
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,220
 Kermit Hannigan, I guess.

97
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:33,860
 The Kermit Hannigan who's a reporter on the time.

98
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:35,300
 Well, who else could it be?

99
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,300
 Oh, boy.

100
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:40,300
 - Hi Henry, you'll be able to get your name in the paper any time you want.

101
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,900
 - Not exactly, Homer.

102
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:45,000
 Kermit sort of specializes in obituaries.

103
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,600
 - No, Mary, I must thought my housework.

104
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,200
 - For what you say, you'll let me first.

105
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,200
 - Alice, why not?

106
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:54,100
 - Sam, I told you, Henry, why aren't you outside?

107
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,000
 - Why, we're just about to go, Mother.

108
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,900
 Come on, Homer.

109
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,900
 - Okay, and good luck, Mary.

110
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,100
 - Homer, we're not supposed to know.

111
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:03,600
 - You see, Mother, even Homer approves.

112
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,800
 Dear Homer is not your mother.

113
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,400
 Why not say yes and get it over with?

114
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:12,560
 Well, Mary, will you ask Alvin to let you come home to lunch every day?

115
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,640
 All the way home?

116
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,920
 Well, Mary, I'm sure he can spare you for that long.

117
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,080
 Well, I'll ask him.

118
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:20,280
 And tell him I insist that you take a nap in the afternoon.

119
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,240
 No, Alice.

120
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:25,440
 Sam, she's always been a little weak since she had her tonsils out.

121
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,240
 That was when she was 12.

122
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,640
 I know, but she's never completely recovered.

123
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,440
 Mother.

124
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:34,560
 No, Alice, I was 14 when I got my first job, and it did me a world of good.

125
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,060
 Yes, Sam, but your tonsils were like iron.

126
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:40,060
 Alice, why get so upset over a little thing like Mary getting a job?

127
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:43,760
 Sam, old rich, if your only daughter were going to work in a hard list

128
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,560
 or filled with saws and chisels, you'd be upset too.

129
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:59,560
 - Area your sodas, boys. - Thanks, Mr. Dehaven.

130
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,960
 Now, I let be, Mrs. Kilmer.

131
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:06,640
 She was... imagine. Poor little Mary getting married.

132
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,760
 Homer, what's so terrible about that?

133
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,400
 She was all people have to get married sometime.

134
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,360
 Show me one person who isn't.

135
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,160
 You're in Harriet.

136
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,760
 She's a rare case, Homer.

137
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:22,160
 Besides, she's going to marry Alvin Springer someday.

138
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,240
 The one who owns Springer's hardware?

139
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,640
 Yeah. When?

140
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,640
 Someday.

141
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:29,160
 She better hurry if she's going to.

142
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,600
 Homer, she's not that old.

143
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,120
 She's just around 40.

144
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,120
 Sure.

145
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,120
 But where around 40?

146
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,880
 Just around it, Homer.

147
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:41,520
 She's been that way for as long as I can remember.

148
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:46,440
 Well, 40's a good place to get stuck, I guess.

149
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:50,280
 Gee, you know, it's going to feel funny with Mary out of the house.

150
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,200
 Funny how?

151
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,240
 Oh, no.

152
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,760
 Oh, mister.

153
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,560
 Gee, there's one swell kid, Mary.

154
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,640
 When I think of all the swell arguments we've had together,

155
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:03,940
 gee, there's one swell kid.

156
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,740
 Henry, you'll get over it.

157
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,540
 Sure, but just the same.

158
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:12,780
 Every time I pass your empty room, I'll get a pain right here.

159
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:13,740
 Excuse me, Henry.

160
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,820
 Did I hear you say you had an empty room?

161
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,060
 What's that, Mr. de Haven?

162
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:20,060
 If it's for rent, my nephew might go as high as $6 a week.

163
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,180
 $6?

164
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,140
 Take it, Henry.

165
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:22,740
 Take it.

166
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:23,740
 Now, wait a minute, Homer.

167
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:25,620
 Mr. de Haven, we're not renting the room.

168
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:29,620
 It's just that my sister Mary is getting married, we think.

169
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:30,620
 You don't say.

170
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,620
 What's that Mrs. Kilmer?

171
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:34,620
 Do you have to give a body to help me die?

172
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:35,620
 Yes, I'll be right with you.

173
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:38,620
 Well, if you decide to rent that room, Henry, let me know.

174
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:41,620
 Gee, Henry, six dollars. Why did you turn him down?

175
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:43,620
 Because it's ridiculous, that's why.

176
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,620
 What's ridiculous about it?

177
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:49,620
 You said yourself every time you pass her room, you'll get a pain right here.

178
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:52,620
 Oh, sure, only what would my father say?

179
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:57,180
 Henry he'll probably double your allowance if you bring in six extra dollars a week.

180
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,180
 I don't know.

181
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:01,420
 You might even get more than six dollars if you throw in breakfast.

182
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:02,420
 Breakfast?

183
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:04,220
 Home or my mother would never agree.

184
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:05,220
 Why not?

185
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,940
 What's one more stranger at breakfast?

186
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:10,580
 But that takes all the profit out of Henry.

187
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:14,780
 How much can one egg and one orange and one cup of coffee cost?

188
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:15,780
 Ten cents.

189
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:18,420
 Fifteen at the most.

190
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:19,900
 Twenty tops.

191
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,620
 Suppose he wants two eggs.

192
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:25,940
 We'll put that in the contract one egg or his rent goes up

193
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:31,500
 Well, it's a matter of fact if we're getting ate for breakfast think of all we could get if we throw in dinner now

194
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:36,100
 Listen home Henry if your mother doesn't object to breakfast. Why should she did dinner?

195
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:48,260
 But Daisy

196
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:52,100
 Who was that on the phone Mary? Daisy Hoffman.

197
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:56,100
 And mother she's never said anything so strange to me in my life.

198
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,100
 Strange? How?

199
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:01,100
 Well I know sooner lifted the receiver when she said, "Why didn't I tell her first?"

200
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:04,100
 And then she burst out crying. What? Then she hung up.

201
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:07,100
 What do you suppose me to say that? I can't imagine.

202
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:10,100
 Unless... Unless what?

203
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:13,100
 You don't think she wanted that job at Springer's too. You think so?

204
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:16,100
 Well my goodness she certainly has her nerves.

205
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:19,100
 Especially when she knows I'm taking the job because of Kermit.

206
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:22,600
 Kermit, yes. He asked me what I did during the day.

207
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,100
 And mother, I've never been so tongue tied in my life.

208
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,100
 Well, I've seen who that is.

209
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,600
 Hello?

210
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:32,600
 Alice, this is Sam. Do you know any other orchards in Centerville?

211
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,600
 Are they orchards?

212
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,600
 Yes. They might rent rooms.

213
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,600
 No, Sam. Why?

214
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:41,100
 I just had a call from a man who heard from another man that we have a room for rent.

215
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,100
 We?

216
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:42,600
 With breakfast.

217
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,600
 My goodness.

218
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,600
 What did you tell him?

219
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,360
 - The city obviously had the wrong party.

220
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,640
 - I should say so.

221
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,680
 My goodness, we just about have enough room for ourselves.

222
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,260
 (upbeat music)

223
00:08:54,260 --> 00:09:04,680
 Can you hear me from under the car, Chester?

224
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,520
 - Yeah, sure.

225
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,840
 Hand me that hammer.

226
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,680
 - Gee, sure.

227
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,560
 - I'll get it, and I'll get it.

228
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,880
 Here, Chester.

229
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,720
 - Oops.

230
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,880
 - Oh boy.

231
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,200
 Did that get you, Chester?

232
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,200
 Well, not quite. It was a good try though.

233
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,200
 What's the best offer you've gotten for the room so far?

234
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,200
 Gia fella went to eight dollars, not more than ten minutes ago.

235
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,200
 As high as that?

236
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,200
 Did we mention breakfast was included?

237
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,200
 Yeah. And it's a nice room?

238
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,200
 I'll say it has double exposure.

239
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,200
 Oh yeah?

240
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:35,200
 The person who's moving out had it for nearly nineteen years.

241
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,200
 You don't say. Where is this room, Henry?

242
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:43,200
 Well, if I get permission at our house, yours, I didn't know you had an extra room.

243
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,100
 We don't. But we're losing Mary.

244
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,800
 Mary, your sister? She's sick?

245
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,300
 No. She's getting married.

246
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:54,300
 Oh, you don't say. Who's a lucky guy?

247
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:57,700
 Well, I'm not absolutely positive.

248
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:02,000
 And, gee, I wouldn't want to start any unfounded rumors.

249
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,700
 Oh, naturally. Henry, I'll take the room.

250
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:05,500
 You will?

251
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,000
 Oh, boy, Henry.

252
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,700
 I'll tell you the truth. I'm not very happy where I am.

253
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:15,900
 Well, I'll tell you I'll have to get my mother and father's permission first. Well, that shouldn't be any trouble student

254
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:21,540
 Well, I don't think so. Henry you won't have any trouble at all. Okay. Nobody excuse me when I make a phone call

255
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:26,720
 Sure Chester old kid Henry, why don't we celebrate with a soul?

256
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,300
 L nine nine six

257
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:38,540
 Henry were you calling on Chester? How are the acoustics and Mary's room the acoustics?

258
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:41,940
 Well, Mary never had any trouble with him.

259
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:44,140
 Oh?

260
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:45,840
 Mrs. Smith, this is Chester.

261
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:48,340
 You know, the fellow who has your front room?

262
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,140
 Yes.

263
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:52,540
 Mrs. Smith, are you still against my practicing in my room?

264
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:53,740
 I am.

265
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:55,140
 Well, in that case, Mrs. Smith,

266
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:58,540
 that my interest you to know that I'm taking my instrument and moving.

267
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:01,140
 Well, I'm certainly glad to hear that.

268
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:04,140
 I've got at least 20 people waiting to snap up that rule.

269
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:14,140
 [Music]

270
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:17,640
 Mr. Dehaven, could I have a tube of toothpaste please?

271
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:23,640
 By sure thing Mary. Here you are. I guess you're looking forward to the big day.

272
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,140
 My goodness, how did you hear about that?

273
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:28,140
 Oh, I heard. Congratulations.

274
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:30,140
 Thank you, Mr. Dehaven.

275
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:31,140
 It must be pretty excited.

276
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,140
 I am. It's my first.

277
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:36,140
 I assumed it was.

278
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:38,140
 Here's the money for the toothpaste.

279
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,140
 Thank you.

280
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:42,140
 Who's the lucky man?

281
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:43,140
 Aren't you nice?

282
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:45,140
 I wouldn't call him lucky exactly.

283
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:47,140
 I'm very inexperienced.

284
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:49,140
 What is Alvin Springer?

285
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,140
 Who?

286
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:51,140
 Alvin Springer.

287
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:53,140
 The Alvin Springer that's put...

288
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,140
 Alvin Springer?

289
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:55,140
 Yes.

290
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:56,140
 I've got to run along now.

291
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:58,140
 If you need any hardware, drop in.

292
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:59,140
 Yes.

293
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:00,140
 Yes, thank you.

294
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:01,140
 I will.

295
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:02,140
 I'll catch you.

296
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:03,780
 Oh, she was.

297
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:05,260
 She watched me.

298
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,820
 Come on goodness, it's you two.

299
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:07,460
 She was.

300
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:08,060
 Hi, Mary.

301
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:08,820
 Hi, Mary.

302
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:09,980
 Henry, I'm in a hurry.

303
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:10,900
 Goodbye, Mary.

304
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,700
 Goodbye, Mary.

305
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:15,380
 And we know that I take a good look at her.

306
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:16,380
 You're right.

307
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:17,820
 She's darn pretty.

308
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:18,820
 I know.

309
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,620
 She the more I look at her.

310
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:24,780
 The more I wish I'd noticed her when she was available.

311
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:26,500
 Are you and Mary?

312
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,140
 What's so crazy about that?

313
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:30,340
 Well, hello there, boys.

314
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:32,780
 Hi Mr. Dehaven, two double skyscrapers.

315
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:33,580
 Yes sir.

316
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:37,540
 And Mr. Dehaven, in view of business conditions,

317
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:40,680
 I don't think we can let your nephew have it for six.

318
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,620
 At what? Mary's room.

319
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:43,620
 Oh yes.

320
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,740
 Well Henry, you could have bolded me over with a feather

321
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,420
 when she told me who she was married.

322
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:48,500
 She told you?

323
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,320
 Sure.

324
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,860
 And the last man in the world I'd think of would be Alvin Springer.

325
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:53,500
 What?

326
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,300
 What?

327
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,700
 Alvin Springer.

328
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:58,300
 Old Alvin Springer?

329
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:01,560
 Oh, gee whiz, Mr. Dehaven, you must be mistaken.

330
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,160
 She's not marrying Mr. Springer.

331
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,260
 She's marrying Kermit Hannigan.

332
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:07,800
 Henry, she just told me herself.

333
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,200
 Whose guy's scraper's come to help?

334
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,160
 She whiz, Henry.

335
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,400
 Mr. Springer.

336
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:16,280
 Homer, of course, it has its good side.

337
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:19,880
 You'll never have to worry about nuts and bolts again.

338
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,320
 Don't be ridiculous.

339
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,680
 Mr. Dehaven must have misunderstood, Mary.

340
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,480
 What?

341
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,040
 Gee whiz, Mr. Springer's promised to my Aunt Harriet.

342
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,040
 Why would he marry Mary?

343
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,040
 Henry, tell me the truth.

344
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:35,040
 If you had your choice between Mary and your Aunt Harry,

345
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,040
 at which would you take?

346
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:57,040
 And now getting back to the troubles of Henry Olbridge.

347
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:03,040
 Henry and Homer have unwittingly started a rumor that Mary is about to be married.

348
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:09,040
 But when the story returns to the boys, they're dumbfounded to learn that old Alvin Springer

349
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,040
 has entered the picture as Mary's prospective bridegroom.

350
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:17,040
 The scene opens in Alvin's hardware store. It is later that day.

351
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,040
 Hello there, Mr. Springer.

352
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,040
 Well, hello, Mary.

353
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,040
 I thought I'd stop by and tell you I can take the job.

354
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,040
 Well, that's fine.

355
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,640
 My goodness, I had a terrible time before they said yes.

356
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:28,040
 Where's everyone so against women working?

357
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,440
 Speaking of that, Mary...

358
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,440
 Yes, Mr. Springer.

359
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:34,640
 I hope you won't think I'm prying, but once you start working here, you'll stay, won't you?

360
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,040
 My goodness, why shouldn't I?

361
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:40,240
 Well, I've been hearing a rumor that you see, Mary, it takes time to train someone,

362
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,440
 and once I do, I want to be sure...

363
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,640
 You're not planning on getting married, are you?

364
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,040
 My goodness, no.

365
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:46,840
 Good.

366
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,640
 That is my goodness, yes.

367
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:51,840
 I mean, naturally, I hope to marry someday.

368
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:56,000
 But the young man I have in mind feels he should work his way out of obituaries first.

369
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,840
 And you know how long a thing like that can take.

370
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:02,040
 Now, don't get the idea. I'm against marriage.

371
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:06,840
 As a matter of fact, can you keep a secret?

372
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,840
 Oh, yes.

373
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,840
 I proposed your Aunt Harriet last night.

374
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,840
 You did?

375
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,840
 Mm-hmm.

376
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,840
 Well, my goodness.

377
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,840
 I'm so happy I'm going to kiss you.

378
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,840
 Oh.

379
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:19,840
 There.

380
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,840
 Uncle Alton.

381
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:23,440
 Mary, right in the front window of the store.

382
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,640
 Mary, my goodness, why not?

383
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,340
 We're practically in the same family.

384
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:28,040
 Yes, now that you mention it.

385
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,340
 Well, I've got to be going.

386
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:30,840
 Oh, goodbye, Mary.

387
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,540
 See you Monday morning, 9 o'clock.

388
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:34,140
 9 o'clock sharp.

389
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:35,640
 Mary, wait a minute.

390
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,640
 Mary, shouldn't you carry the tin first?

391
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,840
 Three.

392
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,840
 My goodness, why are you so flushed?

393
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:44,840
 Mary, I didn't believe it when I heard it.

394
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:48,240
 And boy, if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes,

395
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,740
 I'd never believed it.

396
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:50,740
 I believe what?

397
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:55,940
 Naturally, you're free to do whatever you please, but you certainly ought to think of your family.

398
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:57,240
 What are you talking about?

399
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:02,340
 You know very well, and I certainly don't blame Mother for not wanting to give her permission.

400
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:04,240
 Henry, why should you object to that?

401
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,640
 Why not? Boy, I'll be the laughing stock of Centerville!

402
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,840
 Just because I...

403
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:11,740
 Why, Henry, I never imagined you were that old-fashioned.

404
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:12,440
 What?

405
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:15,640
 And this is your free country, and I'll thank you, remember the Bill of Rights.

406
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,440
 Okay, Mary. Okay.

407
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,840
 But wait until father hears about this.

408
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:20,880
 - Can we come back?

409
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,960
 And may interest you to know we already had.

410
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:23,960
 - Mary.

411
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:24,880
 - Yes, Homer?

412
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,080
 - Mary.

413
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,920
 I may have a way out.

414
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,200
 - How to what?

415
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,520
 - Mary.

416
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:33,360
 Mary, if I were to ask you to wait for me,

417
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,200
 would it sound ridiculous?

418
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,720
 - Wait for you to what?

419
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,560
 - She already sounds ridiculous.

420
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,240
 (audience laughing)

421
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,440
 - Homer, you mean wait for you to marry me?

422
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,480
 - Are you mad?

423
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,320
 - Well, no, of course I'm not mad, Homer.

424
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:50,320
 You're not. Oh boy.

425
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:55,320
 The only thing is, of course, I'd have to keep going to school until maybe Sunday I graduate.

426
00:16:55,320 --> 00:17:00,320
 But if you're helping with my algebra, that shouldn't take more than three or four years.

427
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,320
 Homer!

428
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,320
 And naturally, you'd have to get my parents consent to give me away.

429
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:07,320
 But that shouldn't be too hard.

430
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,320
 Homer! Yes, Mary.

431
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,320
 Dear.

432
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:13,320
 Homer, naturally, I'm very flat.

433
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:16,600
 You're very sweet to ask me, but I'm afraid it's out of the question.

434
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:21,160
 Well, if it's money you're worried about, Mary, I think I can get my father to raise my allowance.

435
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:25,240
 Oh, I don't have time to explain now, but I'm afraid I have someone else's mind.

436
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:29,480
 I know, but, Mary, don't you think I'm an improvement?

437
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,840
 Mary.

438
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:41,560
 Now, Chester, control yourself.

439
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,800
 Control myself, Mr. Orr.

440
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,600
 Do you realize what your son's done to me?

441
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,480
 Mr. Smith has already rented my room.

442
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,880
 I appreciate that, Chester.

443
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,920
 I've got my bags and my instrument case outside

444
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:50,820
 where I'm going to put them.

445
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:51,560
 Instrument case?

446
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,800
 Mr. Orr, I'm afraid I'm going to have to insist

447
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,320
 that you find me someplace to live.

448
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:55,720
 But, yes.

449
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,760
 And until then, there's just one thing I can do.

450
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,920
 Move in here.

451
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,840
 Here, in my office, I can sleep on the couch.

452
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:01,400
 No, Chester.

453
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,640
 As we move the water cooler in here, I can shave by the window.

454
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,040
 Now, wait a minute.

455
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,400
 Your father here?

456
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,600
 Henry, come in here.

457
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,720
 Oh, boy, Father, do you know what's happening?

458
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:14,720
 Would I know what's going to happen? You're going to march right out of here and not come back until you found Chester a room.

459
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,720
 Chester? Oh gee, will you?

460
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,720
 Oh, you sure got me in a fine pickle Henry.

461
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,720
 I know, but it wasn't definite.

462
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,720
 Henry, let's not waste time. Mark.

463
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,720
 But father, you heard him, Henry. And make sure the room's big enough for my glockenspiel.

464
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:38,720
 Mother, I could die. I could just die.

465
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,360
 Mary calmed down.

466
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,360
 Mother, how can I?

467
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,560
 You will have to try.

468
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:45,160
 Your nervous system won't be in any condition for dinner.

469
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,800
 But, Mother, don't you realize what I heard on the bus?

470
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,360
 What?

471
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,920
 I'm getting married.

472
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:50,480
 What?

473
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,120
 Isn't that wonderful?

474
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:54,200
 Dear, you mean just because you overheard

475
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,000
 some idle conversation on the bus.

476
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 You were jumping to a conclusion like that.

477
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,480
 Mother, it was Mrs. Kilmer, and she's never wrong.

478
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,600
 Oh, yes, but who is it?

479
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,560
 I don't know.

480
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,840
 Mrs. Kilmer got off the bus before I found out.

481
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,120
 For my goodness.

482
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:11,000
 Do you suppose those roses had anything to do with it?

483
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:11,800
 What, Rosie?

484
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,880
 Well, they came for you a little while ago.

485
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:14,840
 From who?

486
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:15,400
 I don't know.

487
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,040
 There was no card with them.

488
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,320
 But do you know what was in the box?

489
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,480
 I'll answer the door, mother.

490
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,880
 Try to control yourself.

491
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,520
 Dear, your hair's coming back.

492
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,440
 I'm controlled, mother.

493
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,440
 I'm controlled.

494
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,600
 But in a business tree--

495
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,640
 what, Kermit?

496
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,320
 Hello, Mary.

497
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,400
 Hello.

498
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,600
 Come in.

499
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,480
 Thank you.

500
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,400
 Did my roses arrive yet?

501
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,640
 Oh.

502
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,240
 Oh, you're the one!

503
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,640
 Well, after I heard the news, I thought...

504
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,640
 ...there to show you how I feel, Mary.

505
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,840
 Oh, my goodness.

506
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,640
 But the reason I came over is...

507
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,240
 ...did you happen to find my umbrella among the roses?

508
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,240
 Your umbrella?

509
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:55,840
 It wasn't until I got back to the office that I noticed I had the car that went with the flowers in my hand and my umbrella was gone.

510
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,340
 Oh, I'll certainly keep my eye out, poorness.

511
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:58,940
 Thank you.

512
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:02,540
 And you didn't have to go to anything as expensive as flowers.

513
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:04,240
 That's okay, Mary.

514
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,240
 After all, a thing like this only comes once in a lifetime.

515
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,240
 And Mary.

516
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,240
 Yes, Kern.

517
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,240
 We'll always be friends, won't we?

518
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,240
 I certainly hope so.

519
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,240
 And I'm sure you will be very happy.

520
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,240
 I hope you will be too.

521
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,240
 I'll try, but frankly, it may be a little hard.

522
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,240
 Well, Kern, Miss.

523
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,240
 Mary, I guess this is goodbye.

524
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,240
 Good-bye, aren't you coming over tonight?

525
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,240
 Well, Mary, after all, I mean, do you think I should?

526
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,240
 My goodness, why not?

527
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,240
 Well, I mean...

528
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,240
 What will Mr. Sprinter say?

529
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,240
 Mr. Springer, what does he have to know?

530
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,240
 Mary!

531
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,240
 Just because I'm going to work in his hardware store?

532
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,240
 Work! You're going to work after you're married?

533
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,240
 Well, of course, Kermit, that's up to you.

534
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,240
 Me?

535
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,240
 Yeah. I feel the husband should always decide things like that.

536
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:54,240
 Mary. Mary, do you mind if I sit down on this umbrella stand? I suddenly feel weak.

537
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,240
 Of course not.

538
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:58,240
 Mary, aren't you marrying Alvin Springer?

539
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,240
 What?

540
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:03,640
 Oh, that's what I heard. I mean someone told me Henry said that I think.

541
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:06,040
 Well, if that isn't the most ridiculous thing I ever heard.

542
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:06,940
 You mean you're not.

543
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:10,940
 Now, Kermit, why should I marry someone like Alvin when I knew you were just around the corner?

544
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:11,940
 I mean...

545
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,440
 Mary...

546
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,540
 Mary...

547
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,540
 What, Kermit, why...

548
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:19,540
 I'm stuck in the umbrella stand.

549
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:25,140
 Hi there, can I have my supper now?

550
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,940
 Henry, oh, did you come in here?

551
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,940
 Mary, I haven't got time to...

552
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:30,180
 What are you doing here?

553
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:32,180
 Henry, what are you going around saying?

554
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:34,440
 Well, I'm saying something, Mary.

555
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,440
 Henry, Mary is marrying Alvin.

556
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,440
 She is?

557
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,440
 Of course not, I'm just working for him.

558
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,440
 Wow, Gee, way!

559
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,940
 And you should know better than to start rumors like that.

560
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:45,440
 Mary, I give you my word of honor.

561
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,440
 I didn't start it.

562
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,440
 No.

563
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,440
 She was.

564
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,440
 No, I heard it from someone.

565
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,440
 Who?

566
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,440
 Who?

567
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,440
 Let me think now.

568
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,440
 Who was it?

569
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,440
 Who was it?

570
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,440
 Henry, is that you?

571
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,440
 Oh, Gee, with...

572
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,440
 Yes, Father?

573
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,440
 Henry, have you...

574
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:01,160
 - Father, aren't you going to say hello to Kermit?

575
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,960
 - Oh, yes, hello Kermit, Henry.

576
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,180
 - Mr. Aldige, while I have you here.

577
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:09,040
 While I have you here, sir.

578
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,200
 - Wait until I've done it Kermit.

579
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,280
 We ever discuss things with Father on an empty stomach.

580
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,120
 - What's that?

581
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,360
 - And Father, if you're worried as to why I'm home,

582
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,520
 all I'm going to do is get a little nourishment,

583
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,440
 then I'm going to put my nose right back

584
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,240
 to the grindstone and fine Chester a room.

585
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,440
 - You haven't found one yet?

586
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,720
 - Father, honest, I've looked everywhere.

587
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:31,720
 The only empty room I could find was in the YWCA.

588
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,720
 I see.

589
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:36,720
 And they won't let Chester above the ground floor there.

590
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,720
 Hey Henry!

591
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:40,720
 What's Homer doing here at a time like this?

592
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,720
 It must be dinner time.

593
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,720
 Hey, where can I have Chester a room?

594
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:50,720
 You have? Oh boy, Father, did you hear that Gee whiz Homer? Where did you find one?

595
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,720
 Homer in my house.

596
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,720
 Your house? I didn't know you had an extra room Homer.

597
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,720
 We haven't. I'm renting a mine.

598
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,720
 You're?

599
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,720
 For $14.

600
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:03,120
 So, Hinn, could you come outside and help me with my trunk?

601
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,120
 What?

602
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,120
 Your trunk?

603
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,520
 What's your trunk doing over here?

604
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:10,120
 Well, Jean, Mr. Olrich, I've better have some place to live.

605
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,520
 Now, wait a minute.

606
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,120
 Wait a minute.

607
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,320
 Once and for all, we are not renting any rooms in this house.

608
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,320
 But, Mr. Olrich, that's the beautiful part of it.

609
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,320
 I don't intend to pay a cent.

610
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:31,320

612
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:48,320
 Listen again next week, same time, same station, for another sparkling half-hour with your favorite youngster, his family and his pals.
