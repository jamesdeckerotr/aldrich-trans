 [Music]

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,300
 Memories almighty thing you would bring at best.

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:09,400
 And the farther back you reach, the more faded you remember it.

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:13,300
 Well, if you want to revise the memory of your youth, there's no better way

5
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:17,000
 than knowing a lively teenage boy like Henry Aubrey.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,500
 It's morning and the scene opens in the Aubrey's kitchen.

7
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,800
 Now, the itself is almost there to the E.S. Mary.

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,800
 Is it not that a car?

9
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:24,800
 No, no, Mary.

10
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,300
 It had a very hard day yesterday letting it sleep.

11
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,700
 - Great, what do you call that, how's it going?

12
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,260
 - Good, good, good, good.

13
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:32,500
 - Just go on the clockwalk.

14
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,500
 - Oh, dear.

15
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,100
 Mary's scrubbing it again.

16
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:35,940
 - Yes.

17
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,600
 - But he scrubbed it all day yesterday

18
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,140
 and he didn't get any of it all.

19
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:40,260
 - I know, but I think it's morning

20
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:41,500
 if you can cut some time.

21
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,220
 - The poor boy I'll go calling.

22
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:45,860
 - You're gonna start the copy, mop, and please, Mary.

23
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:47,380
 - Alice, where's the morning, my friend?

24
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,540
 - The right beside your plate, Sam.

25
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:51,980
 Mary, then you'll bother to use.

26
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:53,780
 - Pardon me.

27
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:55,020
 Breakfast is ready.

28
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:56,460
 - In just a minute, mother.

29
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,860
 I think I'm finally getting somewhere with a sidewalk.

30
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:01,300
 The red paint's coming off.

31
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:04,100
 Nobody's starting to turn pink now, and...

32
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:05,660
 (crying)

33
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:08,420
 Or is it just that the sun's finally come up?

34
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:10,420
 Yeah, may I say something?

35
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:12,340
 Any young lady who'd fly off the handle,

36
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:14,220
 the way that it did yesterday,

37
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:15,500
 just because of a little something

38
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,100
 that somebody wrote on a sidewalk.

39
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,860
 Well, I wouldn't exactly call this a little something.

40
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:22,820
 After all, it put me in a very compromising position

41
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:24,060
 with Nancy Adams.

42
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:33,060
 - Side by side. - And I just figure if I can erase out that. If you're going to send another day scrubbing out here, you're going to need your energy. So let's go in.

43
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:41,060
 - No, no, no, no, no. - Let me go. Let me go. Let me go. Mary, what's happening? - It's in the comfort of starting with. - I'm starting to walk outside. - Well, Mary, what are you talking about?

44
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:49,060
 - I thought I wrote an error about it to the editor. Let's go there at the morning. - Well, my goodness. Let's see it. - Mary, he didn't go and mention Nancy's in my name, did he?

45
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:50,060
 I don't know.

46
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:51,560
 Just go on some old boy.

47
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,560
 Come on Mary.

48
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,560
 Well, this person or a person's vote on our side.

49
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,260
 Oh, you didn't go and quote the exact

50
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:58,860
 verbatim words did you?

51
00:01:58,860 --> 00:01:59,860
 Of course not.

52
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:00,860
 Excuse me.

53
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:03,560
 What this person or person's vote on our sidewalk

54
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,560
 is not the concern of this letter.

55
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,560
 Mm-hmm.

56
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,560
 Gee, thanks Father.

57
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,060
 But the desecration of property, both public and private,

58
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:14,560
 is a matter which should arise every citizen in Santaville.

59
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,160
 I for one feel it is high time our town council

60
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,320
 took steps to eradicate the rising tide of vandalism.

61
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:26,840
 Samuel W. Aldrich, Samuel D'Happell, you argue.

62
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,880
 Then why you're at it?

63
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:30,640
 You can just as well have added attorney at law.

64
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,800
 - All right.

65
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,520
 - Then right after breakfast, I want you to go down

66
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,280
 and get a half dozen copies of the paper.

67
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,280
 - For heaven's sake.

68
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,520
 - I'm gonna need at least that many to send away.

69
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,080
 - I just think you're making a big fuss over nothing.

70
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,080
 After all, the letter to the editor isn't such a,

71
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,200
 you really like him?

72
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,680
 I think it's a very well written letter.

73
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,280
 It is? Oh, yes.

74
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,720
 And you use such a wonderful choice of words, didn't you, ma'am?

75
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,920
 Ma'am, yes.

76
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:55,320
 Well...

77
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,680
 You got what you wanted to get to, boys?

78
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,960
 I lost my father?

79
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,080
 Oh, well, I...

80
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,960
 You just wondered if half a dozen copies are going to be enough.

81
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,720
 Alex, believe me, it's not that good.

82
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,280
 And I'll be here?

83
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:04,840
 Every time.

84
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,680
 I've already ordered a few extra copies.

85
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,640
 You had?

86
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:10,520
 But only because I knew you were in this, on mailing them out.

87
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,560
 Oh, good.

88
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,080
 How many did you order?

89
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:13,960
 Enough.

90
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,880
 And just for the record, I'd like it to be known

91
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,660
 that the only reason I bothered to write that letter was to help Henry.

92
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:19,420
 Me, Father?

93
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:24,420
 Yes, I think once Gladys sees my letter, she'll realize you couldn't possibly have painted that on the sidewalk.

94
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:25,620
 You really think so?

95
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,460
 Of course it's just gladness!

96
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:30,820
 Yeah, the only trouble is gladness isn't too strong on logic.

97
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:34,340
 Although, excuse me, when I put in a phone call.

98
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:37,640
 Let's see, when my sister bailed, when do you have a gun?

99
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,060
 M203, please.

100
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:43,840
 Mother, do you think you would help my marks, any if I showed it to my English teachers?

101
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,240
 I don't think anything could hurt them.

102
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,040
 Hello?

103
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,240
 Oh, hello, Mrs. Claddis. This is Henry.

104
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,040
 Oh, yes, Henry.

105
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,340
 I mean, I speak with Gladis.

106
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:55,740
 I'm not afraid not, Henry.

107
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:56,840
 He means he's not there.

108
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,240
 And not just a moment.

109
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:58,740
 Oh.

110
00:03:58,740 --> 00:03:59,640
 He's gone out?

111
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,440
 No.

112
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,440
 As a matter of fact, he hasn't gone out since yesterday.

113
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,240
 Oh?

114
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,040
 He's upstairs in a room.

115
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:06,840
 Oh.

116
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,840
 And he's been up there since yesterday.

117
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,340
 Oh.

118
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:12,440
 Mrs. Claddis,

119
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,280
 Do you know if by any chance,

120
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,040
 GLATERS happen to see this morning?

121
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,600
 - Hang in, ring.

122
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,440
 - Hang in. - Hang in.

123
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,440
 - Hey, look quick. - What's wrong?

124
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,840
 - You better tell me what I just saw.

125
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:21,780
 - What, you beat it?

126
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:24,680
 Mrs. Prentice, there's a slight intercomotion here.

127
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,640
 - When you're listening,

128
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,120
 - Oh, my. - What I find another sign

129
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,040
 about you and me.

130
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,320
 - Well, can't you just wait to watch?

131
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,320
 - What? - I'm gonna say,

132
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,760
 and throw over and do three.

133
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,440
 - Oh, boy. - Hello.

134
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,020
 - And Mrs. Prentice, pardon me if I say goodbye,

135
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,000
 temporarily. - Thank you.

136
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,200
 - Goodbye.

137
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,040
 Who did it?

138
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,880
 Who's the wise guy?

139
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,840
 - I don't know, but somebody has to get you.

140
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,560
 - Not sure, yeah, well I'll show him a thing or two,

141
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,640
 whoever the wise guy is, come on.

142
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,320
 - He was, what this power of meat-tape

143
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,240
 is doing on your front porch?

144
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,120
 - Today's Center of Old Times, isn't it?

145
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:53,960
 - Yeah.

146
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,640
 - Oh, they must be the copies my father ordered.

147
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,440
 - Yeah, he's going into the business?

148
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,160
 - No, Homer, come on.

149
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,740
 (upbeat music)

150
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:09,480
 - How much further is it, Homer?

151
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,080
 - Right in the middle of the next slide.

152
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:16,380
 If you ask me, some guys have a pretty crude sense of humor, painting the town red with my name.

153
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:20,680
 Yeah, I just look glad it finds out all the trouble I'm going to for her sake.

154
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,680
 Let's cross here.

155
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,680
 Okay.

156
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,080
 Well, my father was in the paper once.

157
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,780
 He wrote a letter to the editor too.

158
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:30,080
 No, it was the time he sued the railroad for Pina.

159
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,080
 For what?

160
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,780
 Pina, Pina.

161
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:37,080
 He put a penny more than a penny, so you're nothing to me now.

162
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,580
 He sued them for that?

163
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,480
 No, that was just the way it started.

164
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,480
 My father put his hand up the machine with that stuff.

165
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,080
 The machine?

166
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,480
 No, his hand.

167
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,880
 And he missed his train and lost a big contact because of it.

168
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,880
 So he sued.

169
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,880
 Is that right?

170
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,880
 What happened?

171
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:53,880
 Be corrected.

172
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,480
 You know?

173
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,480
 Well, I'm telling you, Paine's opinion.

174
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:59,680
 My father said, "There it is, homie.

175
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,880
 Just look at that fence.

176
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,880
 This is the greatest daylight boy if I ever text a guy that did this."

177
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,880
 You know what I'll do.

178
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:06,880
 Do you know what I'll do?

179
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,480
 Why?

180
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,480
 I'll...

181
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,280
 Well, you're regret it as long as you live.

182
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,840
 Maybe longer.

183
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,720
 OK, here's a brush for you and one for me.

184
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,880
 Come on, let's get started painting this out.

185
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,120
 Well, before we do this, you don't

186
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,760
 suppose the person who owns this same small pig.

187
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,160
 Pig?

188
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,400
 Well, you ought to be glad I don't steal them.

189
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,600
 No matter what fact, I bet I've got a darn good pig.

190
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,600
 I'm right there.

191
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,240
 Helping to defamate my character.

192
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,800
 I bet I have a darn good pig.

193
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,800
 Come right on, father.

194
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,640
 My father said those peanuts cost him $200 a pound.

195
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,040
 Come on, let's start painting.

196
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,140
 Okay.

197
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:44,640
 You start on the Henry and I'll work on Nancy

198
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,640
 and we'll meet in the middle.

199
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,840
 Wait a second, Henry.

200
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,940
 What's the matter?

201
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,940
 See those two men across the street?

202
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:51,940
 What about them?

203
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:54,140
 Is that a camera they have there?

204
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:56,340
 No, I think they're probably surveying something.

205
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,140
 We hope it's here or not.

206
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:59,440
 Come on, Homer, let's start painting

207
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,140
 or we'll never get done.

208
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:01,540
 Hi, how are you?

209
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:02,340
 See, it's Mary.

210
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:03,140
 Hi, Mary.

211
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:04,140
 Hi, Homer.

212
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:05,440
 Did you do what I asked you to?

213
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,840
 I just came to talk to Mrs. Pettis.

214
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:12,840
 Did you casually mention that the order tell Gladys to look at the letters to the editor, Karlman?

215
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:16,840
 Oh, goodness, because I found out that the judges don't take the photo of those times anymore.

216
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:17,840
 They don't? How come?

217
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,840
 They go back to Venice, it's from Canada.

218
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,840
 Well, what's that got to do with it?

219
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,840
 Well, she said they have not a copy in their office, but they put them out against London.

220
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,840
 Do you, Whiz Mary? If that is typical of you.

221
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:33,840
 Oh, maybe it's you to do the simplest possible thing in your life. Somebody named Lamben get mixed up in it.

222
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,180
 and we may be back to your house and get one of your father's take.

223
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:39,500
 Well, I've been saying that if you're going to do that to better,

224
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,340
 I want it because they're going fast.

225
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:44,340
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

226
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:52,420
 In the living room, Alice.

227
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:55,220
 Here, do you know what-- what are you doing?

228
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:57,820
 Well, I'm just writing something.

229
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:58,820
 So I know what.

230
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:00,780
 You know the rest of the papers are.

231
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,660
 Oh, there aren't any more.

232
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:04,160
 Oh, papers are gone.

233
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,060
 Well, it's the race you've been mailing them out.

234
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:08,060
 Sam, so far, I've only used two.

235
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,060
 I saw.

236
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:11,660
 Well, Henne came in a while ago and took some.

237
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:12,960
 One, anyway.

238
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,460
 In the world, few people, I thought I'd like to--

239
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,260
 Alice, I'd like to get your opinion on something.

240
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:18,060
 What is it?

241
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:20,160
 Which of these sound better to you?

242
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,560
 Main Street, ma'am, or Perot, the life and limb.

243
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,260
 You're writing a murder, Mr. H?

244
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:27,360
 No, no, a letter to the editor.

245
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,960
 Just occurred to me that--

246
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,160
 Alice, have you ever noticed how traffic gets snarled

247
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,860
 around Maine and Ellen Street at five o'clock.

248
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:36,600
 Or do you think a letter about the new tax assessment

249
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,000
 would be of greater interest?

250
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,200
 - You wanna get that fan?

251
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,040
 - All right.

252
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,560
 - Mother, do you want me to start right?

253
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:42,400
 - Oh.

254
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,240
 - It's a little early, late.

255
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,080
 - Yeah.

256
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:44,920
 - Larry, look at this.

257
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,760
 - Who you think?

258
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,600
 - Apparently, a list of things your father's thinking

259
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,080
 of writing to the editor about.

260
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,840
 - Is he gonna be writing to the people every day?

261
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,920
 - I hope not.

262
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,240
 - Or his law practice will just go to pieces.

263
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,080
 - All right.

264
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:56,920
 - Yes, fan.

265
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:57,880
 - Now, that's where you might as well

266
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,320
 put a light under the potato.

267
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,320
 - Yes, mother.

268
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,580
 - What was that on the phone, Sam?

269
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:04,360
 - That Alice was the editor of the "Centerville Times."

270
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,360
 - Really?

271
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,360
 - Huh?

272
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,280
 - Seems I've really started something down there.

273
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,360
 He said a couple of reporters out this morning

274
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:13,040
 and they just came back with a picture of two of those vandals

275
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,040
 called "Light and the Act of Smearing Up a Fan."

276
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,400
 - Oh, my!

277
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,040
 - And he's gonna run it in tonight's paper

278
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,000
 along with the second editorial he's writing.

279
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,560
 Now that's what I call getting action.

280
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,520
 - I should say, now over those vandals.

281
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,360
 - Oh, just a couple of kids, he said.

282
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,200
 (laughs)

283
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,640
 Said they both looked as though they had been shot.

284
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,720
 - Oh, dear.

285
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,120
 I'll finally get what's coming to them.

286
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,420
 Grinch it.

287
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:35,020
 What do you think will happen to them?

288
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:37,220
 I wouldn't be a bit surprised if they both wound up

289
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:39,180
 in the foreign school.

290
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:42,580
 Well, personally, I don't think it was a bit fair.

291
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:45,540
 Taking those poor boys by surprise that way.

292
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:46,460
 What do you want them to do?

293
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,500
 I thought food limbs to pose.

294
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,300
 After all, they were violating the law.

295
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:53,220
 I realize that, then I realize that.

296
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:55,180
 But just think of how the parents of those boys

297
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:57,260
 are going to feel when they see that picture.

298
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:59,380
 It seems to me that's something a parent should think

299
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:04,820
 before him naturally you feel that way you're a lawyer I'm also a parent but you're not a mother

300
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:10,740
 that is if you were you wouldn't let the editor print that picture how can I stop him

301
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:15,620
 he started the whole thing didn't you yes but well you guys can't tell the editor that if he

302
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:20,580
 insists on turning the picture you will write him any more letters well Alan

 Oh, Grottus! Grottus!

305
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,580
 I don't think she gives you him.

306
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:40,580
 What do you think you just go up and ring the bell?

307
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:44,580
 Oh, but from what her mother told me this morning, I don't think that's too wild.

308
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:47,580
 Well, how else are you going to get this copy of the paper to her?

309
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:52,580
 If I can just get her to come to the window for a second, I'm sure she'll...

310
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:56,580
 Wait a second. I think I know how I can get her attention. Stand back.

311
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:59,580
 You know, throwing rocks at us, there's always no way to make up.

312
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:02,580
 It's not a rock, it's just a cobble.

313
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,580
 And I'm only going to hit the window with it.

314
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,580
 The window...scuse me.

315
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:07,580
 Where are you going?

316
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:10,580
 I think I'll watch you across the street.

317
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:12,580
 Why are you silly? I'm only going to hit it lightly.

318
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,580
 Watch.

319
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:19,580
 Boy, and the coach Nelson was wrong about you.

320
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:20,580
 And what way?

321
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,580
 He said you couldn't even hit the side of a house.

322
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:24,580
 Where's another pebble?

323
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:25,580
 Here, and then we'll try it one.

324
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:26,580
 Can we actually move it?

325
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:29,580
 Okay, but remember, lightly, sure, sure.

326
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:33,580

327
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:36,580
 Yeah, but I think about it, I think he...

00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:38,580
 You think so?

 Oh, my God, I got it.

00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:45,540
 I hope we didn't disturb you or anything, did we?

332
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,620
 Is that a picture of all the names you have there,

333
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:48,820
 if I had it?

00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:50,180
 - Gladys, what are you doing with that?

335
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:51,020
 - What are we doing with that?

336
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:52,020
 - What are we getting out of it?

337
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:54,020
 - Oh, oh, oh!

338
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:57,020
 Gladys, I just want to ask you to give a signal to me.

 - Morning!

 - Oh, boy.

 - Oh, okay, and we have you got any more ideas like that?

 - And now getting back to the troubles of Henry Alvarez.

 We just stopped hopping up and down like that.

00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,440
 But I've still got some water in my ear.

349
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:30,440
 The last one pops already, but still working on the rice.

350
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,840
 Well, what a dry out by natural means.

351
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:37,540
 Now go ahead, and remember, the important thing is to get the paper in the Gladys' house.

352
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:38,440
 Okay.

353
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:43,340
 and you don't have to mention my name in there unless the situation changes.

354
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:45,140
 My daddest.

355
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,840
 You know what just happened to think?

356
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,540
 What?

357
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:51,640
 Wouldn't it be easier for you to just start going to Nancy Adams?

358
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,640
 Oh, well, hi Mrs. Prayman.

359
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,740
 Hello, Homer.

360
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:55,840
 Would you come here?

361
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,440
 Thank you.

362
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,740
 You suppose I could speak to Gladys, sir, I'm gonna...

363
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:01,140
 No, I don't know.

364
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:04,040
 You're a pretty good friend of Henry Ausridge, aren't you?

365
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:04,940
 Wait.

366
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:06,240
 Where a queen is?

367
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,740
 Hmm.

368
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:10,860
 Well, I ask you, but I don't know if you're come down.

369
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:13,660
 Oh, by the way, Homer, you aren't by any chance

370
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:15,020
 through with that newspaper, are you?

371
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:17,220
 For this, now, if you're still reading it,

372
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:18,060
 then never mind.

373
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,140
 You'd like to have it?

374
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:20,660
 Only if you're sure that you should.

375
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,620
 Oh, yes, ma'am, here you are.

376
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:23,540
 Thank you.

377
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:24,380
 I'll call about it.

378
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:26,580
 Oh, that is a necessary, you know.

379
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:27,460
 It is, no, ma'am.

380
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:28,700
 I'll just be running along.

381
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,020
 Goodbye, Homer.

382
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:31,700
 And thanks again to the paper.

383
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,340
 You're entirely welcome.

384
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:36,540
 And I hope you and I'm glad I've seen Joy reading it.

385
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,840
 Oh, I didn't want it to read.

386
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,640
 You didn't?

387
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,340
 No.

388
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:43,240
 I guess he did something to wrap my plate of healing, then.

389
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:47,040
 Well, well, the guys, but Mrs. Turner,

390
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,540
 that person was in cleanly to Father I.

391
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:52,540
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

392
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:59,940
 Not me.

393
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,140
 Wait a second, Miss Robert.

394
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,940
 Let me close this door.

395
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:03,940
 Yeah, that's better.

396
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:05,840
 I'm glad you got that, Miss Robert.

397
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,840
 Frankly, I didn't get what you were driving it on the phone.

398
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,740
 Well, Miss Sanders and I think we had a bad connection.

399
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:11,840
 No, we must have been.

400
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:15,140
 I kept thinking what you were saying was that we should feel that picture of the two vandals.

401
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:17,140
 I didn't say that exactly.

402
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:17,940
 Of course it didn't.

403
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:21,640
 What I said was whether we oughtn't to stop and think about it first.

404
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,640
 About what?

405
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:27,340
 Well, the ceiling of the boy's parents, the possible effects on...

406
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:28,940
 Well, that sort of thing.

407
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,440
 Just thinking is a parent, you think?

408
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,740
 I'm as well as a time of thought that too, you know.

409
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:33,840
 Yes, but you're not a mother.

410
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,340
 Huh?

411
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:43,340
 I mean, what my wife, what I was going to suggest was that perhaps we ought to have these boys in and just give them talk to the government.

412
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:46,340
 Oh, Mr. Holmes, you know what your trouble is? You're too soft-hearted.

413
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:51,340
 I know. You know, but that would be kind of kids before, but I have. And you can't pant for them.

414
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:52,340
 Well, my wife...

415
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:54,340
 Then you'll see the shop we got of them.

416
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:57,340
 Why, you just have to take one look at their faces to know that their potential's criminal.

417
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:58,340
 Is that right?

418
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:01,340
 And those are the kind of kids you're feeling sorry for?

419
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:05,940
 Well, my wife, don't you see that publishing their pictures is going to teach them a lesson they'll never forget?

420
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:09,680
 Well, I wonder if you'd mind calling my wife and explaining.

421
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:15,680
 No matter a fact, the more I think of it, the more I feel I ought to give that picture the widest possible script.

422
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,320
 Yes, sir.

423
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,480
 Excuse me.

424
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,960
 Oh, Joe, uh, see you?

425
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,460
 Yes, sir, sir.

426
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:22,960
 Come in a minute.

427
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:27,360
 Uh, Joe, I'll just decide I'd like to move that picture of the two kids in the editorial page for the front page.

428
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,360
 To the front, but what about your editorial?

429
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,960
 Well, let's see if we can help suit that on the front page too.

430
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:33,800
 - When's the name?

431
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,240
 - Jack, now what about that other picture I had penciled in?

432
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,240
 - Which one was that?

433
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:40,200
 - You know, that cab driver and his 13 daughters.

434
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,520
 Oh, what was that story about again?

435
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,840
 What was it about?

436
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,480
 Yeah, what did this cab guy to do?

437
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,720
 Well, he had 13 daughters, isn't that enough?

438
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,720
 (audience laughing)

439
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,280
 - Oh, we can run that some other time.

440
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,680
 - Well, the only thing is this cab driver's already put

441
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,160
 in his order for 40 copies of tonight's paper

442
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,840
 for his immediate family.

443
00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:00,840
 Oh, well, I was thinking in the back somewhere then, on the source page.

444
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,840
 On the source page.

445
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,840
 [LAUGHTER]

446
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,840
 Yeah, with the batting average.

447
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,840
 [INAUDIBLE]

448
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,840
 Because I think they story about the bandages.

449
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,840
 Oh, excuse me, Joe.

450
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,840
 This is Mr. Aldridge.

451
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,840
 Follow up with that letter.

452
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,840
 Oh, yeah, please, to meet you.

453
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,840
 How do you do?

454
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,840
 Yeah.

455
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,840
 Hey, you're going to tell us.

456
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:19,840
 If you have to meet in that letter, wait a minute.

457
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:20,840
 Wait a minute.

458
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:21,840
 Go get the camera quick.

459
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,840
 Jack.

460
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,840
 Mr. Aldridge, I think I've wheeled up a whole something.

461
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,840
 Yes, what is it?

462
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,000
 It's an idea that's going to--

463
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:27,680
 OK, Joe?

464
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,180
 Yeah.

465
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:30,560
 I'll get this, Joe, and see if you don't think it's dynamite.

466
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,520
 And it's over.

467
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,080
 Just stand up against this wall here.

468
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:33,580
 What?

469
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:34,080
 What?

470
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,960
 You'll say, well, let me have your hat.

471
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,680
 Now, just face this way, see?

472
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,560
 And hold your arms straight out.

473
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,160
 You're pointing, see?

474
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,600
 Look, sir.

475
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,840
 A little more.

476
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,240
 More?

477
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,160
 All right, get that, Joe.

478
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,080
 Yeah.

479
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:48,720
 Got it.

480
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,720
 But if you want my picture for it.

481
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,160
 I'm going to run it right next to the picture of those two

482
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,660
 with you pointing straight up and face.

483
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:58,660
 And the cuts in the cross the top will read, "Get this girl.

484
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:01,660
 Dad, we must stop this. Dad."

485
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:14,160
 I don't know Homer. I just don't know if that's such a hot idea.

486
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,160
 Why? Why? Did you ever hear of anybody refusing to look at a telegram?

487
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,160
 Sure, when they're sent collect.

488
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,160
 But we're told.

489
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:24,120
 - Hey, well, what have you got written down?

490
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:27,600
 - C pays a this morning's time,

491
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,400
 probably with potato peelings.

492
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,240
 (audience laughing)

493
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,400
 - And how is it signed?

494
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,400
 - Oh, who's that?

495
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,640
 - Just an earlier machine, and that's confusing.

496
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,320
 - Why not just write anonymous?

497
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,320
 - Okay.

498
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,320
 - A-N-N-O.

499
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:47,120
 You write it.

500
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,480
 (audience laughing)

501
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:53,020
 Okay. A-N-O.

502
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:56,420
 I come to think of it as anonymous enough.

503
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:57,420
 Yeah.

504
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:59,420
 Well, do you want to send this?

505
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:00,420
 I don't know.

506
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:02,860
 Suppose they've already had their garbage collected.

507
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:03,860
 You wish.

508
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:04,860
 And they make up your mind.

509
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:07,860
 Do you realize you practically ruined the whole Saturday from me?

510
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:11,460
 Well, the my fault if every store in town has sold out their papers?

511
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:15,060
 They didn't really look what's right in store of this paragraph office.

512
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,060
 Well, I'll be darned.

513
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:17,060
 Come on.

514
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:19,360
 I didn't think of coming in here in the first place.

515
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,360
 Sure.

516
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,800
 They didn't have this morning's paper.

517
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,800
 Nobody will.

518
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,800
 Of course.

519
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,960
 And, Homer, I promise you, as soon as I get it over to Gladys's, we'll spend the rest

520
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,880
 of the day on whatever you want to do.

521
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,640
 The rest of the watchday, it's almost time to suffer.

522
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,640
 Yeah.

523
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,640
 Well, let's ask right here.

524
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,460
 Oh, mister, yes, any--a copy of today's "

525
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:36,460
 Center for Times" place.

526
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:39,040
 No, but we don't have one this, you know?

527
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:42,760
 She will talk of the "Sendingville Prime" and be out of the "Sendingville Prime."

528
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:45,200
 Oh, we've had quite a run of them today.

529
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,200
 Boy.

530
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,960
 What am I going to do Homer?

531
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,440
 You couldn't just learn off one more copy for us could you?

532
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,000
 Yes, I was very nuts.

533
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,400
 But that's anyway you might do.

534
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,520
 You see that door there?

535
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,080
 Yeah.

536
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,560
 And that's the composing room.

537
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,480
 When the person there might just have an extra copy.

538
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:02,080
 He's saying, at least I can do it.

539
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,320
 What kind of a room do you say a wash hand?

540
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,400
 A composing room.

541
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,720
 Oh.

542
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,480
 What are they doing there?

543
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,840
 Well, Homer, don't you know anything?

544
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,680
 Our composing room is--

545
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:15,680
 what's the place where it's a composing room?

546
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,680
 I guess we better knock first.

547
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,880
 Knock? What floor?

548
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,280
 So we don't disturb their train and fraud while they're compounding.

549
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,280
 Homer, come on.

550
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:30,280
 Here's a way of talking to this in polls with all its noise.

551
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,880
 Do you think anybody we can ask?

552
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,880
 How about that, sir?

553
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,380
 Where?

554
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,780
 When coming this way, carrying that sort of train.

555
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:36,080
 Oh, yeah.

556
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,880
 Mr. Can I ask you something?

557
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,480
 Sorry, Sonny.

558
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,080
 The paper goes to press in the five minutes.

559
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,780
 Why don't you come around when they have one of those tours?

560
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:42,080
 Oh, no.

561
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:42,880
 You don't understand.

562
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,480
 The man outside said I might be able to get an extra copy

563
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:49,640
 this morning's paper in here. Oh, I don't know if that one or not here.

564
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:53,000
 Well, you hold this one and take a look at my desk. Sure. I'll be sure and hold it

565
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:59,760
 level, Bob. Yes, sir. Boy, look at this, Tom. Yeah. What is it? It looks like a

566
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,800
 page from the paper. Isn't that right, Mr? Yeah, that's the front page. It's a nice

567
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:08,800
 paper. Well, I tell my folks I was holding it. I was pretty sure I had a

568
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:13,000
 paper somewhere isn't it, there. You know what, Bernie? Why? See that's just your

569
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 right in the center of the page.

570
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 Notice when the light hits it one way it's negative.

571
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 Yeah. And then it gets dripped a little like this.

572
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 And see the way it's going to look when it's finished.

573
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 That's right.

574
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 These would be a picture of a couple of kids, doesn't it?

575
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 Yeah.

576
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 What are they doing?

577
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 What's to me like they're painting a...

578
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 painting a...

579
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 ...mover.

580
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 They need a painting, aren't they?

581
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 Maybe not, but it sure is.

582
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 I can't quite see who it is.

583
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 Oh boy.

584
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 Somebody in the house?

585
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 Quite like my father.

586
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 What?

587
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 Three.

588
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 Can we go get the kill fly?

589
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 Come and grab it!

590
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 Get out!

591
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 Oh boy.

592
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 Some are going loose.

593
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 What'd you do?

594
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 Mr. I'm afraid we'd go.

595
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 Oh no.

596
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 Look at my size.

597
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 Look at my size.

598
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 Mr. Ed's kicking on what I ought to do to you, kid.

599
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,280
 You know what I want to do to you kids.

600
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,280
 No, he's Mr. Lettingly.

601
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,880
 He's put the paper to bed in just a few minutes.

602
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,040
 Now what am I going to do?

603
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,040
 Say goodnight.

604
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,040
 [LAUGHTER]

605
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:19,320
 Oh, Mr. Will be glad to help you out.

606
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,240
 Oh, you will.

607
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,120
 I'm sure we send you all to be able to get back together

608
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,680
 before the paper wakes up.

609
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:27,680
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

610
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:35,080
 I heard someone on the porch.

611
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:35,780
 You do?

612
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:36,760
 It must be the paper, boy.

613
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,480
 Excuse me.

614
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,480
 I'm like that's a cager up.

615
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,880
 I'll take that, honey.

616
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:45,080
 Not funny father. It's me.

617
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,480
 Oh, oh, hello, Henry.

618
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,680
 Good evening, Father.

619
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,880
 You've been till now.

620
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,880
 Why?

621
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,080
 Homer and I stopped to help a man pick up.

622
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,680
 Some things.

623
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,480
 Then it gets you this way.

624
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:01,680
 Well, there were quite a few of these things.

625
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,680
 You don't see it.

626
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,880
 We had some exciting news for you.

627
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:05,880
 You'll follow this picture.

628
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:10,600
 going to be on the front page of tonight's paper. Yeah, I know. I mean, how do you know?

629
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:19,920
 Why you? Well, I haven't been having this paper office and I thought you did. Is it a good

630
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:28,480
 picture of your father? Well, was he shy straight? I don't know how straight it is anymore. I

631
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,180
 Well, I only got a quick glance, mother.

632
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:35,480
 Oh, well, isn't it exciting, Henry?

633
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,480
 Yeah.

634
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:41,580
 Well, I must say you don't sound very enthusiastic.

635
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:42,280
 I don't?

636
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:45,080
 Well, just because I don't sound it, don't think I am.

637
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,280
 I mean, I'm not.

638
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,480
 I mean, Henry, is anything wrong?

639
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,080
 Why, you know--

640
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:49,780
 Wait a second.

641
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:51,080
 I think I hear the paper boy now.

642
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,080
 The father before you go out there,

643
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,380
 I feel there's something I want to tell.

644
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:55,880
 And all right, just that they get the paper.

645
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,280
 You've got to wait it.

646
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,600
 What I want to tell you about.

647
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:02,000
 You know that picture they took of you.

648
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:02,720
 Yes.

649
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,240
 Well, I think it's only fair for you to know that.

650
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,240
 The two boys you're pointing at.

651

 Sam old.

654
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,480
 But how?

655
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,920
 What were you?

656
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,560
 Good heaven.

657
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,240
 Hi, everybody.

658
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,280
 Something wrong.

659
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,280
 I guess it is wrong.

660
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:31,280
 Oh, I just told my father about the paper.

661
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,280
 Oh, I've got a copy of her right here. Would anyone like to see it?

662
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:38,280
 Warren, you just couldn't wait to bring the bad news, could you?

663
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:41,280
 Well, Henry, that's the point. We're not on the front page.

664
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,280
 We're not?

665
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,280
 You mean I'm not either?

666
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,280
 Oh, you are, you sure, Aldi?

667
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,280
 Let me see that, please.

668
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,280
 Sure.

 Let me look too Sam.

 Oh, heaven's taste.

671
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:52,280
 Then what's that you're pointing at?

672
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:55,280
 It's a taxi driver and it's safety and order.
