00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.000
 [Music]

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 Henry! Henry Oldridge!

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
 Coming, Mother!

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
 The Aldrich family, a special rebroadcast for you soldiers, sailors, and Marines of the United Nations.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:41.000
 [Music]

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
 And now for the Aldrich family with Dick Jones as Henry and Jackie Kalk as Homer.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 The wonderful thing about the teenage time of your life is the fact that you can experience it twice.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:01.000
 once in your own teenage and continually thereafter in the misadventures of your own or your neighbor's Henry Aldrich.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 The scene opens in the Aldrich living room. The time is evening.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.500
 Sam, I don't think you're looking at it from Henry's point of view.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.000
 You're quite right. I'm not. I'm looking at it for Mr. McCalls or whatever his name is, point of view.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.500
 And if you'll remember, Alice, I advised Henry in the first place not to take that job unless he was sure he could stick to it.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.600
 Then that's the whole point. Henry isn't working tonight because he isn't supposed to work.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.800
 He's taking Kathleen to a very nice dance at the country club.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.000
 Yes? Well then what's all the fuss about?

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.500
 Yeah, there isn't any fuss.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.000
 Mr. McCall, who hires him, phoned a few minutes ago and wanted to know where the bicycle is.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:36.600
 That what?

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.000
 The bicycle that Henry delivers packages from the drugstore on.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.100
 You mean he's lost it?

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.900
 No, Sam, of course he hasn't.

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.600
 The bicycle is right out on the front porch.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.500
 Henry didn't understand that he was to return it tonight.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.260
 And don't you think Mr. McCall could be reasonable and let him bring it back tomorrow?

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.640
 Because there isn't any other way, is there?

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:00.080
 Alice, you aren't by any chance leading up to the suggestion that I take it back, are you?

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.480
 Sam, that hadn't even entered my head.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.320
 Would you want to?

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.980
 I would not.

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:11.160
 And Alice, no matter how far Henry has to take that bicycle, if his employer wants it, he should have it.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.920
 But do you think his employer realizes that Henry's only young one,

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.720
 And that this is one of the most important dances the club is going to have all seasons.

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.520
 No, I don't imagine it does.

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:21.420
 Do you?

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:22.420
 Do I want?

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.720
 Yes, I realize a boy is young only once.

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.220
 And a man reaches my age only once.

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.320
 And I'm going to sit in this chair and read this paper and not deliver any bicycle.

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.920
 Mom, are you too busy to fix my necktie, please?

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.720
 No, Henry, sit down on the arm of this chair while I straighten.

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:38.720
 Okay.

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.320
 Did I just hear you and Father talking about Mr. McCall's bicycle?

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.920
 You did.

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.080
 Well, look, Father, be sure to remember this.

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.560
 When you first push back on the break, your feet will go all the way around once.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.800
 But on the second time around, you'll stop.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.760
 At least you'll usually stop.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.360
 I won't stop at all.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.320
 You won't.

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.800
 You mean Mother didn't have a chance to explain things to you?

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.840
 Henry, if I gave you the impression that I was going to ask your father to take that bicycle back for you,

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.800
 I'm afraid you misunderstood me.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.680
 The one I'm going to ask there is Mary.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.640
 Mary? Mary isn't even here.

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.600
 She will be. She'll be back any minute.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.960
 Are you sure? Because I feel very responsible for that bicycle.

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.520
 And Kathleen, in the dance.

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.060
 You haven't one thing to worry about. Now run upstairs and put your coat on.

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.940
 Yes, Mother, sure. Thanks very much.

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.100
 Sam, did you see that?

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.900
 Did I see what?

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.660
 How conscientious he is about it. He wouldn't even put his coat on until I assured him Mary is going to be here.

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.140
 All right, Alice. But remember, Mr. McCall has to have that bicycle.

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.300
 Sam, you top-jest as though returning a bicycle were the most awful problem in the world.

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:37.220
 Mother!

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:38.620
 He is Mary, are you back?

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.120
 Yes, and my goodness, mother, look at what I've just done to my brand-new stocking.

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.020
 Mary Aldrich, how did you do that?

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:46.420
 On that old bicycle, what's out on the front porch?

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.320
 Mother, I was going to wear these stockings to the dance tonight.

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.820
 Mary, you didn't tell me you were going to the dance.

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:55.920
 Mother, don't you remember? I told you at breakfast this morning, and I'm late as it is.

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.120
 You mean you haven't timed a...

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.720
 Haven't timed a what?

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.020
 Nothing, dear. You're only young one.

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:03.920
 Go on up and get your clothes changed.

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.320
 I'm going to put in a phone call.

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:07.120
 Hello?

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:07.920
 Number three.

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.320
 M232.

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:10.820
 M232.

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:15.120
 Mother, don't you think would be alright if I tell Henry he has to pay for these stockings?

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:20.520
 Mary, Henry only earns 50 cents for a whole afternoon's work, and those stockings cost 89.

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:22.420
 No, Mother, they cost a dollar eight.

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:24.820
 And that makes it worse, aren't you a shame?

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.420
 Hello, Mrs. Brown speaking.

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:29.220
 Hello, Elizabeth. This is Alice Aldrich. It's Homer there.

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.220
 Why, I just a minute, Alice. Homer, you're one of the telephone.

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.320
 Alice, why are you in the way I want to ask you?

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.420
 Did you know about the Alice's party?

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:39.420
 Alice, are they giving a party?

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:42.420
 Yes, dear. I understand they've invited scabs of people.

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:43.420
 Really? When is it?

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:44.420
 It's tonight.

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:46.420
 Tonight, Elizabeth. Aren't you invited?

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:48.420
 No. Aren't you invited?

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:51.420
 No. No, I guess you and I aren't included.

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:57.420
 Isn't that terrible? I'm not surprised about myself, Alice, but after all, you were made to tame the Alice.

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:00.420
 Well, that's the way things are, Elizabeth. You never know.

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:02.420
 Oh, just me, Alice. He is Homer. Hello.

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:04.420
 Oh, but can't you say hello, Mrs. Aldrich?

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:06.420
 I didn't know it was Mrs. Aldrich.

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:07.920
 Hello Mrs. Aldrich.

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:08.920
 Hello, dear.

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:10.920
 Why the could you be lacing my shoes?

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:12.920
 How are you Mrs. Aldrich?

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:15.420
 Homer, how would you like to earn a little money?

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:16.420
 Some money?

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:17.420
 Boy.

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:20.920
 It won't be very much, but it'll probably come in very handy.

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:21.920
 Okay, sure.

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:23.920
 When do you want me tomorrow morning?

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:25.420
 No, dear, tonight.

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:26.420
 Tonight?

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:28.920
 Yes, dear. You can do the whole thing tonight.

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:31.920
 Wait. I'm not working tonight, Mrs. Aldrich.

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:34.420
 I'm meeting Agnes at the Country Club.

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:37.500
 Are you sure you wouldn't like to do just one little errand?

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:40.700
 Gee, no, I've got to save myself to dance.

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:43.500
 Well, I thought you were only a young one.

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:44.500
 What's that?

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.140
 Nothing, Homer, goodbye.

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:47.140
 Mother!

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:48.140
 Come here, Henry.

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:50.140
 I'm afraid I have something I have to tell you.

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:51.140
 You have, Mother?

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:52.140
 Boy.

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:53.140
 How do I look?

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:54.140
 How do you like my hair this way?

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:57.780
 Henry, I can't begin to tell you how much I appreciate your picking things up for me.

00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:58.780
 Are you sure, Mary?

00:05:58.780 --> 00:05:59.780
 You'll be back in time?

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:00.780
 Mary's already back.

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:01.780
 The only thing is...

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:02.780
 The only thing is...

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:04.780
 I'm carrying this town that has a mother that...

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:05.780
 You know what I mean?

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:07.780
 Henry, you don't have to hug me quite so tight.

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:09.780
 I was just giving you a little squeeze.

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:11.780
 What was it you wanted to say to me?

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:13.780
 Nothing there. You go right on and have a good time.

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:15.780
 Okay, good night, mother.

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:16.780
 Don't stay out late.

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:20.780
 Okay, and explain to Mary how responsible I feel about that bicycle.

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:33.780
 [Music]

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:36.780
 Why, hello there Mrs. Aldrich!

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:39.780
 Don't tell me you're out wheeling a baby at this time and I.

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:42.780
 You're good eating Mrs. Hopper. No, this is a bicycle.

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:43.780
 Oh, why?

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:45.780
 A delivery bicycle. It has a sidecar.

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:49.780
 Oh, who years? Yeah, I recognized your face, but I couldn't place the sidecar.

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:50.980
 What's that guy called?

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:54.380
 I'm just pushing it over here to Mr. McCall's drugstore.

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:57.480
 Very good exercise.

00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:02.280
 Something I can do for you, madam.

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:04.280
 Why, yes. Are you Mr. McCall?

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:04.880
 Yes, ma'am.

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:07.780
 Well, I just returned your bicycle for Henry Oldry.

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:09.280
 Oh, yes. Where's Henry?

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:11.380
 I've got a couple of packages for him to deliver.

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:14.080
 Tonight, I answered the phone, Mr. McCall,

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:16.880
 and I don't remember your saying anything about it when you called.

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:18.880
 And why did you think I wanted the bicycle?

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:20.540
 I understood the boy was responsible.

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:22.640
 I didn't go to him about the job he came to me.

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:24.820
 Mr. McCall, let me make one thing clear.

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:27.580
 Henry feels most responsible about his work here.

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:28.280
 Yeah?

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:28.920
 All right.

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:31.020
 Can you get him on the phone and tell him to come right down here?

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:33.920
 I'm very sorry, but he left the house before I did.

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:35.120
 Oh, are you a sister?

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:36.160
 A sister?

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:37.460
 Do I?

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:38.460
 Really?

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:42.260
 Now look, I've got a new store here.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.440
 I'm trying my best to please my customers.

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:46.360
 A couple of orders come in and I promised them.

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:47.940
 And then your brother lets me down.

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:48.980
 What am I going to do?

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:51.440
 Well, if Henry's being put in the position of...

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:52.640
 up...

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:53.980
 where do your packages go?

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:55.280
 You'll take them out for me?

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:55.980
 Well, I...

00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:57.680
 The dollar for it do on this one.

00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:58.920
 And 90 cents on this golf man.

00:07:58.920 --> 00:07:59.480
 Yes, sir.

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:01.180
 And look out for the break on the bicycle.

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:02.280
 The bicycle?

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:04.180
 You don't mean I'll have to ride it, do you?

00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:07.160
 Lady, do you realize how far you have to take those packages?

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:08.620
 Well, my goodness!

00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:12.200
 Hello?

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:13.300

 This is who?

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:22.460
 Mrs. Allison over on North Street, and I have a whole dining room full of guests waiting for it.

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:25.540
 Oh yes, Mrs. Allison. The girl just left with that.

 How are you, Henry?

00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:49.340
 So am I.

00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:55.820
 But I have the next dance with you.

00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:57.980
 I'm sorry, Homer, but I promise it's a Henry.

 Agnes, Agnes.

00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:06.420
 Do you know what she did?

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:08.020
 She was so anxious to get here.

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:11.820
 She ran out of her front door and rolled right down the steps.

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:15.220
 She had to go back and change her clothes all over again.

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:16.180

00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:18.380

00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:19.380
 Yes, this she is!

00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:20.380
 What's she coming here?

00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:21.180
 Even our cat went...

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:23.080
 Mary, did you have any trouble with that right?

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:23.880
 Good what, Greg?

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:26.580
 Did you notice how your foot slips off the pedal the first time?

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:27.380
 My foot, why?

00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:29.480
 Mary, don't you know the bicycle?

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:30.880
 I certainly do know about it.

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:33.780
 I tripped right over it and you owe me a pair of new stockings.

00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:34.480
 I do.

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:36.480
 Just for taking it back to Mr. McCall.

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:37.580
 For taking what back?

00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:39.280
 The bicycle, the bicycle!

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:40.280
 Didn't mother tell you?

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:41.680
 You didn't even mention it, Henry!

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:42.980
 Oh, boy!

00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:43.980
 Henry, where you going?

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:44.880
 I'll be back, Kathleen.

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:46.600
 Just as soon as I get something straightened out.

 Well, quite a while ago.

 And dear, I hate to bother you when I know you're reading your paper,

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:21.640

 Hello, can you hear me mother? Yes, Homer, and I'm sorry but your father doesn't absolutely

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:54.000
 won't help you out. When mother doesn't understand what's happened, Henry gave me 50 cents provided

00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:02.000
 I'd go over to his house and get a delivery bicycle he has and take it to McCall's drug

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:07.000

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.440
 Who do you think showed up?

00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:23.140
 Do you think you can get him to take the bicycle over?

 You go over to your dancing after all your only young one.

00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:13.020
 Harriet, you're just the person I want to see. Could you take the package of ice cream into the Allison's house here?

00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:14.520
 What are you doing?

 They're serving?

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:23.820
 Harriet, the Allison's are giving a party in there and they're waiting for their ice cream and I haven't been invited and...

00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:26.220
 And so you'll just have to take it in for.

00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:29.020
 What else I'm late for a bridge party over at the Anderson?

00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:33.120
 But don't you understand, dress the way I am, I don't want to go into the house.

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:37.360
 And frankly, need to do I. They'll only think I'm trying to crash their party.

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:43.160
 Now, Harriet, do you remember on your 13th birthday when you were too bashful to ask Bill Townsend to your party?

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:47.800
 And I did it for you. And you swore you'd do anything in the world for me anytime I asked you?

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:48.640
 No.

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:50.600
 Harriet, you did so.

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:53.140
 Well, look, you're going right over by Maple Street.

00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:56.440
 Could you at least lead this model of cost here up at 227?

00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:57.600
 Is it important?

 It's very important.

 Because she has decided her son is young only once,

 Mrs. Olbridge has consented to return a bicycle for Henry

 Hello, Elizabeth.

 This is Will.

00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:04.940
 Will your husband?

 I can't find that bicycle of Henry's.

 Did you look all over there, Yarn?

00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:12.940
 I've walked into every tree out there and there's still no sign of it.

00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:14.940
 Well, Will, where are you now?

00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:16.940
 I'm in the orchard's front hall.

00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:20.940
 And Elizabeth, I'm in my house slippers and I'm standing in water.

00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:25.940
 I can't be responsible if they aren't more careful where they put their bases of flowers.

00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:28.940
 Well dear, you just got to find that bicycle.

00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:31.940
 Oh, Mrs. Henny was very much concerned about getting the heat being taken back,

00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:35.940
 and he won't enjoy the dance one bit if he knows who falls out on him.

00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:38.940
 I'll give him ten more minutes and then I quit. Good-bye.

 Goodbye.

 Is this Homer? Where are you?

 It isn't Homer. It's Henry.

 It is. Well, this is Mr. Brown.

 Mr. Brown, she was going to get the wrong number.

 Excuse me, leave it.

00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:20.240
 Could you give me some information?

00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:21.940
 What is your like to know, lady?

00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:26.440
 Well, have you and the idea where number 227 would be here on Maple Street?

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:29.140
 No, let's see now. Isn't it this house right here?

00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:32.540
 No, I was just in there and they haven't had a cold all year.

00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:33.540
 What's that?

00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:40.040
 227 Maple Street ordered this cough syrup and I'd like to get rid of it so I can go to a bridge party.

00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:42.240
 How about trying that house across the street?

00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:46.940
 I tried that one too. They said they don't think there is any 227.

00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:48.620
 Let's see the address on your package.

00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:49.620
 Here you are.

00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:50.620
 Hmm.

00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:53.340
 That's 227, all right?

00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:54.340
 Or 277?

00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:55.340
 It was?

00:20:55.340 --> 00:20:58.420

00:20:58.420 --> 00:20:59.420
 Marble?

 Well, I wouldn't get discouraged, lady.

 Yes, sir. I'd like a chocolate frosted.

00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:23.820
 A chocolate one?

00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:24.820
 Frosted.

00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:27.020
 Oh. That's something to drink, isn't it?

00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:30.820
 It certainly is. It's made with chocolate syrup, milk, and ice cream.

00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:31.820
 Yes, and that's all.

00:21:31.820 --> 00:21:33.420
 And then you put it in that mixing.

00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:35.420
 Yeah, well, that sounds easy enough.

 Now, let's see.

00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:49.520
 I guess the logical thing would be to start with the chocolate.

00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:51.120
 Chocolate.

00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:53.020
 Chocolate.

00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:56.020

00:21:56.020 --> 00:21:56.820
 No, thank you.

 But of course, lemons, that's for a little.

00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:05.540
 Maybe they keep a chocolate in one of these bowls.

00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:08.260
 Oh, no, that's the cherries.

00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:10.420
 How would you like to have me throw a cherry in?

00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:11.660
 No, thank you.

00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:12.980

 Isn't that whipped cream?

00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:23.460
 So it is.

00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:26.340
 I'd grab a long time since I've seen any whipped cream.

00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:28.300

 My goodness, isn't that quite a lot of chocolate?

00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:41.060
 Are you going to have room for the milk?

00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:42.740
 Oh yes.

 Isn't there a scoop?

 Is that vanilla?

00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:19.660
 No, yes, you can't fool me on vanilla.

00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:21.660
 Well...

 All you have to do is pull that little jigger

00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:24.860
 and the ice cream drops right out.

00:23:24.860 --> 00:23:26.940
 Yes, I'll realize that.

00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:32.860
