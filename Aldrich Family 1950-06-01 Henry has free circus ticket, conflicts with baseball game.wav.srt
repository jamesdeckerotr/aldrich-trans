00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,240
 Jello everybody is a Jello family of desserts presents...

3
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,760
 Henry Henry Olgrich!

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:18,800
 Coming mother!

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:24,960
 [Applause]

6
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,600
 Yes it's the Olgrich family based on characters originated by Clifford Goldsmith.

7
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:33,600
 And starring Ezra Stone is Henry with Jackie Kalka's home.

8
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,600
 And yes, it's the Jell-O family.

9
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,600
 [music]

10
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,600
 Oh, the big red ladder stand for the Jell-O family.

11
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,600
 Oh, the big red ladder stand for the Jell-O family.

12
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,600
 That's Jell-O, yum, yum, yum.

13
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,600
 Jell-O puddings, yum, yum, yum.

14
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,600
 Jell-O papp, the yoke up putting yesteries.

15
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,600
 And now for the Aldridge family.

16
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:06,200
 family. The memories of our youth are often lost in the fog of maturity. The

17
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:10,760
 best way to recapture those memories is to know a real teenage boy like Henry

18
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:14,800
 Onge Ridge. The scene opens on the Onge Ridge front porch at his early morning.

19
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:22,280
 "Little girl, hey you out there on roller skates! You who?" "Oh you who, me you who!"

20
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:25,960
 Yeah, could you just skate up our walk to the porch here a second?

21
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:26,960
 Sure.

22
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:27,960
 Hi.

23
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:28,960
 Hi.

24
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:29,960
 Don't I speak pretty good?

25
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:30,960
 Sure, but you can-

26
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:31,960
 My name's Elsie Hopkins.

27
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:32,960
 Hi, I'm Henry.

28
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:33,960
 Henry?

29
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:34,960
 Hi.

30
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:35,960
 Hi.

31
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:36,960
 We just moved into that house down the block.

32
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:37,960
 That's fine.

33
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:38,960
 Welcome to Centerville.

34
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:39,960
 But you see what I- Thank you.

35
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,960
 You're welcome too.

36
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:41,960
 Thanks.

37
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:44,160
 Elsie, how would you like to do me a favor?

38
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,160
 A favor?

39
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:48,360
 Yeah, and while you're doing it, I'll run in and see if I can find you a piece of candy.

40
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,160
 Gee, I don't need candy just for doing a favor.

41
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,760
 Well, if it's one thing our whole darn family does,

42
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,760
 it's things for nothing.

43
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,600
 Well, sure, but you're not--

44
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,440
 We've been brought up.

45
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,340
 That's fine.

46
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:59,840
 What kind of candy?

47
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,560
 The tree time.

48
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,760
 And all I want you to do is skate down to the corner

49
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,000
 and see if a certain fellow's coming down the street.

50
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,800
 What fellow?

51
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,920
 Well, he's about so high, see.

52
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,960
 And he hasn't had a haircut recently.

53
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,040
 So from a few feet off, he may look

54
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,640
 as though he's walking backwards.

55
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,320
 No kidding.

56
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,160
 He really does.

57
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:16,680
 Yeah.

58
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,480
 He looks the same coming and going, north and south.

59
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:19,980
 Yeah.

60
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,980
 So will you please skate down to the corner?

61
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:24,260
 I don't have to, I just came from there.

62
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:24,760
 Huh?

63
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,560
 And there wasn't a person in sight.

64
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,820
 Not even going to look the same from all angles.

65
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:30,820
 Oh, I'll be darned. Excuse me, Elsie.

66
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:31,820
 But just a day!

67
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:32,820
 I have in time. Mother!

68
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,160
 I'm in the kitchen, do you?

69
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,620
 Mother, you're sure Willy didn't call while I was upstairs putting on my tie?

70
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,820
 No, dear, and please don't slam the door.

71
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:44,220
 I have a cake in the oven for the sewing circle meeting this afternoon, and I don't want it falling.

72
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:44,860
 Yes, Mother.

73
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:47,980
 Gee, would you think Willy would have more consideration than to be late?

74
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:51,680
 Especially when you take into account that he's going to the circus on my past.

75
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,180
 There, perhaps you should have consulted me before you're invited, Willy, to go with you.

76
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,080
 Consalted you?

77
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,080
 Yes, dear.

78
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,280
 But who else could I invite?

79
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,080
 Homer's out of town for the weekend.

80
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,080
 Henry, I'd like you to just look out this window here.

81
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,080
 The kitchen window?

82
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:05,880
 Yes.

83
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,880
 What do you see?

84
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,380
 Nothing, Mother.

85
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:10,080
 Just Mary lying in the hammock.

86
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,280
 That's just the point.

87
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,480
 Can't you notice anything?

88
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,480
 She's put on weight.

89
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,080
 No, dear.

90
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,780
 She's very unhappy.

91
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:18,780
 She is?

92
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,740
 Yes, I'm surprised you didn't notice.

93
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:24,740
 Her mother, her being unhappy, isn't nearly as obvious as the weight she's put on.

94
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:28,780
 Dear, she hasn't put on weight, but since Kermit went out of town, she's had nothing

95
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:29,780
 to do.

96
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:33,220
 And I think the least you could have done is invited to go to the circus with you.

97
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:34,220
 Instead of Willy?

98
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:35,220
 Yes, dear.

99
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,300
 But I can't just disinvite Willy.

100
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,420
 It would just hurt his feeling.

101
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,900
 Dear, I'm not suggesting anything like that.

102
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:46,060
 I'm just suggesting that in the future you might keep your own family and mine.

103
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,300
 You're right, mother.

104
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:51,740
 And meanwhile you might tell Mary a swell new picture opened at the colony theater yesterday.

105
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:52,740
 It's really good?

106
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:57,540
 Well all I know is Agnes Lawson saw it and boy she said she never cried so much in all

107
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:58,540
 her life.

108
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:00,340
 She said that, oh boy is that the door?

109
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,820
 But Willie I'll be right there.

110
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,220
 There that's the telephone.

111
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,220
 The telephone.

112
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,220
 He's calling?

113
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:06,220
 Excuse me.

114
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:08,220
 Mary could I speak to you?

115
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,220
 The father.

116
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:10,980
 I thought sure that, yes sure Bob.

117
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,820
 Father that isn't Willie on the phone is it?

118
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:13,820
 Yes Bob.

119
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:14,820
 Yes Bob.

120
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:15,820
 Father.

121
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:16,820
 I say Bob.

122
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:24,620
 Excuse me, Bob. What is it, Henry? Is that Willie? It's Mr. Ferguson. It is. Well, naturally, Bob, if you can't play golf, you can't.

123
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:30,940
 But did I tell you that they're using the new green on the third hole and... Oh, of course, if you can't, you can't.

124
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:35,820
 No, don't forget it, Bob. There are things I can do around the house. Goodbye.

125
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:39,820
 Well, that's a fine say. Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

126
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:45,020
 Does that clock actually say 1215? Yes. But the elephants get married at 130.

127
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,280
 The Who Get Mary?

128
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,820
 Number please.

129
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,380
 Helm 913 please.

130
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:51,940
 Helm 913.

131
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:52,780
 Who gets married?

132
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:54,860
 Elephants father in the circus.

133
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,820
 They're going to have the whole ceremony,

134
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:59,340
 including two chimpanzees who throw rice.

135
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,100
 You don't say.

136
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:03,100
 Sure in a giraffe in a starch collar who's the minister.

137
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,060
 Yeah?

138
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:05,020
 Well, Henry.

139
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:05,660
 Yes, Father.

140
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,580
 That passed to the circus.

141
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:08,900
 Is it for two or three?

142
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,100
 Two.

143
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:10,660
 Oh.

144
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,100
 Why, Father?

145
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:12,620
 Nothing.

146
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,060
 I just thought if it were for three,

147
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:16,600
 - Yeah, that's all right.

148
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,980
 There's quite a bit of work I have to do in the garden.

149
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:19,820
 - Hello?

150
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,180
 - Listen, will he, is that you?

151
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,460
 - Oh boy, Henry, I've got you.

152
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:23,620
 - You're darn right, it is.

153
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:25,140
 And let me ask you one question.

154
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:26,500
 Where the heck are you?

155
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,340
 - Here.

156
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,780
 - Well, what kind of an excuse is that?

157
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:30,260
 Why aren't you here?

158
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:31,420
 - Well, that's the whole thing, Henry.

159
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:32,580
 I was just about to call you.

160
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:35,100
 I'd run into what you might call a minor snag

161
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,700
 about the circus this afternoon.

162
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,060
 - What minor snag?

163
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,820
 - I can't go.

164
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,500
 - What, why not?

165
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,140
 - I don't even know how to tell you.

166
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:48,820
 tell me what? It's pretty darn embarrassing. What is? Well, I'm going to spend the afternoon

167
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:58,140
 with my father. What? At the ball game. Isn't that embarrassing? But, but, Gee whiz, do

168
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:02,860
 you know what they've got this year at the circus? An entire family from five years old

169
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:08,980
 to 60 who do nothing but hang by their teeth. They do? Sure. One night under the other.

170
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:11,940
 Don't you think that would be educational?

171
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:13,740
 Well sure it would, sure it would,

172
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,580
 but my father's got feelings, see.

173
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:16,420
 - He has?

174
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:17,260
 - Sure.

175
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:19,100
 - Feelings are something that run in our family.

176
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,700
 But Willie, what about my feelings?

177
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,700
 It's late, who else can I dig up?

178
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:25,020
 - Willie, what's that father?

179
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:27,980
 But I'm still talking to, just a minute, Henry.

180
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:30,860
 Are you gonna explain to him about my going alone, Willie?

181
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:31,700
 Willie?

182
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:32,540
 - Hello, Henry.

183
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:33,620
 - Is that you, Mr. Marshall?

184
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:36,020
 - Yes, and would you excuse Willie if he hangs up?

185
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,220
 We wanna get out to the park

186
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,700
 and time to see infield practice.

187
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:43,520
 Sure have a good time, Mr. Marshall. And don't worry. I just remembered Mary

188
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:50,180
 That Norman Marshall. Let me speak to him. Mr. Marshall my father wants to speak to you and father

189
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:55,860
 Did you notice if Mary was still unhappy in the hammock? No, I didn't. Hello Norman. Say normie

190
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:58,360
 Have you noticed what a perfect day and Mary?

191
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:02,780
 I thought I asked you to be careful of my cake. My mother. I have to find Mary

192
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:07,260
 I'm taking her to the circus. Did she just let to see the new movie the new movie?

193
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,660
 But mother, it's terrible.

194
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:12,160
 Terrible? You told me Agnes cried.

195
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:17,660
 Oh sure she did, sure she did, because she was so mad about spending her last 35 cents on it.

196
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:23,660
 Same mother. Did you mention this morning that you hadn't seen a circus since you were practically a child?

197
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:29,660
 There, if you're thinking of inviting me, I'm taking that new Mrs. Hopkins down the street to our sewing circle meeting.

198
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:30,660
 You are?

199
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:35,660
 But, Jane mother, when will you ever get another chance to see a couple of elephants get married?

200
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:45,660
 [Music]

201
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:47,660
 But Sam, why can't you take it?

202
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:48,660
 Because Alice, I can't.

203
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:51,660
 An hour ago I would have been glad to go to the circus with him.

204
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:53,660
 I was anxious to go, but now I can't.

205
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:54,660
 Why not?

206
00:07:54,660 --> 00:08:00,660
 Because... because the person I'm playing golf with is going to a great deal of trouble to arrange things.

207
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,660
 Why doesn't he call some of his friends?

208
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:06,900
 He has, dear, that's all he's been doing, and no one seems to be free.

209
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,300
 Boy, if that is not a fine thing.

210
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,300
 What, dear?

211
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,300
 Olivia Marlowe, mother.

212
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:14,100
 Olivia Marlowe, she has no consideration.

213
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:17,260
 For months, she's been saying, "Call me up sometime, Henry.

214
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:18,660
 Call me up."

215
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,100
 When I do what happens.

216
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,300
 She turns you down?

217
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,420
 No, she's got the mumps.

218
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:26,220
 That is very inconsiderate, over.

219
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:28,740
 I'll say, she was my last hope.

220
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,820
 Henry, couldn't you go alone?

221
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:31,820
 Alone?

222
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:34,820
 By myself, independently.

223
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:40,820
 Gene, mother, even popcorn tastes different if it isn't eaten in mixed company.

224
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,820
 Well, excuse me.

225
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,820
 Where are you going?

226
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:47,820
 Nowhere, just outside.

227
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:50,820
 Toss this tennis ball against the porch roof.

228
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,820
 What else is there to do?

229
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,820
 Just be careful of the window.

230
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:57,820
 Sam, just enjoy yourself, dear.

231
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:58,820
 Yes, mother.

232
00:08:58,820 --> 00:08:59,820
 Hi.

233
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,620
 Huh? Oh, hi.

234
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:05,420
 I'm L.C. Hopkins. Remember? You forgot to give me one of those chewy's.

235
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,420
 Chewy's?

236
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:09,820
 The candy that you promised if I went down to the corner to see if someone was coming

237
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,820
 or you couldn't tell which way he was moving.

238
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:12,820
 Huh?

239
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:16,020
 Oh sure. Well, I don't have any on me, L.C.

240
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:18,820
 Oh. What you doing with that tennis ball?

241
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:21,820
 Nothing, just trying to practice pitching.

242
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:24,820
 Yeah? Are you the best pitcher in town?

243
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:25,420
 I?

244
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:28,020
 You certainly look like you were the best in town.

245
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,520
 Yeah?

246
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,520
 Well, I wouldn't go so far as...

247
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,840
 So far as...

248
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,860
 Listen, Elsie.

249
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:37,860
 Listen, did you know there's a circus in town?

250
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:38,680
 Sure.

251
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,260
 What happened dying to go?

252
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:41,220
 You have?

253
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:43,420
 Well, how would you like to go with me?

254
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,420
 Me with you?

255
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:45,220
 Sure.

256
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:46,120
 You with me?

257
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,820
 Sure. This afternoon.

258
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,200
 Boy, would I?

259
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,160
 Would I?

260
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,600
 I'll say would I?

261
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,940
 That is if my mother will let me skip my nap.

262
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,600
 Yeah, well...

263
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,840
 [audience laughter]

264
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,100
 Go home and ask her.

265
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,860
 Sure sure I'll skate right home. I'll be back.

266
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:02,420
 Oh, I'll just get dressed.

267
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:03,620
 Wait for me else.

268
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:05,140
 Oh, Elsie.

269
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,220
 Oh boy.

270
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:08,780
 I'll pick up that garbage and tomorrow.

271
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:09,860
 Oh, raw.

272
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:12,140
 How many do you have at your house, Elsie?

273
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:14,820
 Henry, old reach that wasn't a bit nice.

274
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:15,940
 Why wasn't, mother?

275
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:18,460
 No matter how badly you feel you had no right

276
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:21,500
 knocking that little girl over.

277
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,100
 Oh, mother, I'm not going over that,

278
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,020
 Elsie Hopkins.

279
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:25,540
 I'm taking her to the circus.

280
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:26,380
 You are?

281
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:27,660
 Do you think that's why?

282
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,660
 Why?

283
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:33,140
 Well, she may be a very nice little girl and all that, but children her age can get to

284
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:35,340
 be a nuisance if you're not used to taking care of.

285
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:38,660
 Mother, she won't be a nuisance, and at least she's someone to go with.

286
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:39,660
 Hey, Henry!

287
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:40,660
 She was, is that Willie?

288
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:41,660
 Okay, Henry, let's go.

289
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:42,660
 Let's go.

290
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:43,660
 Where to?

291
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:44,660
 The circus, where do you think?

292
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:45,660
 Willie, you're going to the ball game.

293
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:46,660
 Oh, no, I'm not my father.

294
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:49,660
 Let me talk him out of it without his feelings being heard at all.

295
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:50,660
 Willie, that's wonderful.

296
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:53,660
 Sure, he's going to help out your father and play golf with him.

297
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:54,660
 That's swell.

298
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:55,660
 Come on, Willie, let's go.

299
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:56,660
 Henry, just a moment.

300
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,660
 What about Elsie Hopkins?

301
00:10:58,660 --> 00:10:59,660
 Elsie?

302
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:00,660
 She was, Mother.

303
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,660
 You're right.

304
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:02,660
 I'll just cancel her.

305
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:03,660
 Henry.

306
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:04,660
 Well, I can't take her and willy both.

307
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:05,660
 Henry, you'll do no such thing.

308
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:08,660
 But Mother, what do you mean you don't want me to go?

309
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:09,660
 The willy, dear.

310
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:12,900
 She was seeing a family hang by their teeth might be an experience I could carry through

311
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:13,900
 my entire life.

312
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:18,180
 Henry, naturally, you can do what you want, but I'd like to point out that that little

313
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:20,140
 girl has feelings.

314
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:21,660
 Even though she's only 11?

315
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:22,660
 Yes, dear.

316
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:23,660
 Okay.

317
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:28,780
 Just to save her feelings, suppose I send her a nice letter telling her I suddenly became

318
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:29,780
 indisposed.

319
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:31,780
 Sure, from in this position.

320
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:34,780
 The letter won't be delivered until tomorrow.

321
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:36,220
 Well, how about a telegram?

322
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:37,220
 Willy.

323
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:38,220
 The kind with bluebirds on it.

324
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:42,020
 Henry, if you're going to make excuses to that girl, you're going to do it in person,

325
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:43,380
 and so she won't be hurt.

326
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:47,580
 But, mother, gee whiz, don't you realize the elephants are practically coming down the

327
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,660
 aisle this very minute?

328
00:11:49,660 --> 00:12:00,660
 Oh, the Big Red Letter Stand for the Jell-O Family

329
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:04,660
 Oh, the Big Red Letter Stand for the Jell-O Family

330
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,660
 That's Jell-O, yum, yum, yum, yum

331
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,660
 Jell-O, putting, yum, yum, yum

332
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:12,660
 Jell-O, putting, jus-a-ree

333
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:15,660
 Yes, sir-ree, there's nothing like getting to the circus

334
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:22,280
 It says they're seeing all the animals diving into the pink lemonade and popcorn and peanut brittle nothing like oh, yes

335
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:29,220
 There is what why jello Agnes Lawson? What did you say I say you can fix up lots more exciting things eat in your own home

336
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:35,540
 And you can get it a circus like that peanut brittle pudding. I made the other night bomb Agnes you made it yourself

337
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:37,020
 By sure it's easy

338
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:43,460
 I'll you do is fix a package of jello chocolate pudding as usual and then before you serve it you fold in a third of a cup of

339
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:47,300
 A crushed peanut brittle, and add a lot of whipped cream.

340
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,300
 Bye!

341
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,980
 That sounds wonderful, Agnes.

342
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:54,220
 But then, jello puddings are wonderful in all three flavors, chocolate, butter, scotch,

343
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:55,220
 and vanilla.

344
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:58,180
 All three have real old-fashioned homemade goodness.

345
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:01,700
 They're nourishing made with milk and take only about five minutes to cook.

346
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:03,340
 That's jello puddings.

347
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:05,740
 The happiest ending a meal ever came to.

348
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:19,740
 [Music]

349
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:22,740
 And now getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldrich.

350
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:25,740
 The scene opens in the Hopkins living room.

351
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,740
 But heck, Father, you should have told me sooner.

352
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,740
 Elsie, I didn't know sooner.

353
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,740
 Mr. Marshall just gave me the tickets.

354
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,740
 I thought you liked ball games.

355
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:37,740
 Well I do, Father. What will Henry think if I stand him up for the circus?

356
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:41,740
 He'll think you're a well-brought-up young lady who'd rather go with their father than anyone else.

357
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:44,740
 Father, you put everything on such a maldon plane.

358
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:49,740
 Okay, okay. If you'd rather spend the afternoon with a total stranger than your own father, well that's okay with me.

359
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:52,740
 But Father, she whiz.

360
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:55,740
 Elsey dear, I'd like to have a little talk with you.

361
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:59,740
 But first, Mother, could you speak to Father and point out that he's not seen my side at all?

362
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:04,740
 Well, dear, I'm afraid you're not saying his side either, and you're not very considered of his feeling.

363
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:07,740
 Well, mother, why can't Tommy go with father to the ballgame?

364
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:11,740
 Because Tommy's an older girl and much more... much more...

365
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:14,740
 Well, she sort of lost her interest in baseball.

366
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:15,740
 But, hey.

367
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:20,740
 Elsie, I can't order you to go with your father, but if you'll take my advice, you'll cancel your appointment with Henry.

368
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:21,740
 Yes, mother.

369
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:22,740
 And don't say heck.

370
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:24,740
 And see you at the door, dear, while I start lunch.

371
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:25,740
 Yes, mother.

372
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,740
 Yes, sir, Rhee.

373
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:31,340
 But speaking of mysteries, Danny, I wish you clear one up for me.

374
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,840
 Why jello and Harriet?

375
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:38,840
 Why is it you talk about jello desserts, but never say a word about the beautiful warm weather salads you can make with jello?

376
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:41,240
 Well, say that's right, Aunt Harriet. Have you any suggestion?

377
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,540
 Indeed I have. One that Alvin--

378
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:45,740
 Oh, I mean my friend, Mr. Springer--

379
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:47,740
 says he's the best he ever tasted.

380
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:48,540
 But tell us more.

381
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:56,240
 Well, for a delicious fruit salad, all you do is dissolve a package of lime jello in two cups of hot water and pineapple juice.

382
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:02,720
 When it's slightly thickened, a diced canned pineapple, a diced apple, and a sliced banana.

383
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:07,120
 Then you chill it in individual moles and serve on crisp lettuce.

384
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,120
 It's one yeah.

385
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:12,040
 Well, that I believe because Jell-O's such a treat in all six delicious flavors,

386
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:15,000
 strawberry, raspberry, cherry, orange, lemon, and lime.

387
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 All six flavors have wonderful fruit-like goodness,

388
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,360
 flavor that can't get out till your first tempting spoonful.

389
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,960
 So better take Aunt Harriet's advice and enjoy Jell-O's salads all summer.

390
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:29,340
 [MUSIC]

391
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:32,620
 And now getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldrich.

392
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:36,580
 It is later the same day in the scene opens on the highway outside center room.

393
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:40,020
 >> Sam, are you sure you're still on route five?

394
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,340
 >> Positive Alice.

395
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,700
 Henry, pass me another sandwich, please.

396
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:44,700
 >> Another sure father here.

397
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:45,300
 >> Thank you.

398
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,540
 >> Don't thank me, father.

399
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:48,140
 You're into Homer's share now.

400
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,660
 >> [LAUGH]

401
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:51,380
 >> Henry, considering I missed my lunch.

402
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:55,420
 >> Father, it's not that I mind sacrificing the food, but where's the bus?

403
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:57,780
 Sam, do you suppose it might have turned off somewhere?

404
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:59,140
 Not if he's following his route.

405
00:15:59,140 --> 00:15:59,940
 Father, look!

406
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:00,440
 Where?

407
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,820
 That little roadside place we're coming to see that song?

408
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:04,540
 Trucks and buses welcome.

409
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:05,380
 Sam, stop!

410
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:07,140
 What for?

411
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:10,540
 Father, it won't hurt to ask whether the bus went by here.

412
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:12,700
 Well...

413
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:13,620
 Hello there!

414
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,100
 Hello, folks!

415
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,140
 Thanks, your nice lunch!

416
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:16,860
 No, thank you.

417
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:19,180
 We'd just stop to ask if the mystery bus has been here.

418
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:20,100
 Mystery bus?

419
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,660
 Don't even know what it is.

420
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:23,540
 Although, look, if some of the buses come in here,

421
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,980
 It's a mystery that let them on the road.

422
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:28,300
 That's the name of the bus we're looking for.

423
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,860
 Oh, well there hasn't been more

424
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:31,500
 in one bus stopped here today.

425
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,420
 And that was loaded to the gums with kids.

426
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:34,900
 Kids, father, that's it.

427
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:35,900
 Where did they go?

428
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:38,020
 Well, they were headed for an outing up at the state park.

429
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:39,540
 Oh, boy, father, let's get going.

430
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,740
 And now just a moment, Henry.

431
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,180
 Do you realize how many buses

432
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,820
 there probably are with youngsters in them

433
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:44,740
 on a Saturday morning?

434
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,300
 Well, don't you think it's worth taking a look?

435
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:47,140
 Now, Henry.

436
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,220
 Sam, what can we lose?

437
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:50,980
 Alice, the park is 25 miles square.

438
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:53,540
 There are at least a dozen different picnic grounds on it.

439
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:55,320
 Father, can I just ask the lady if,

440
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:59,020
 ma'am, was there a fellow on that bus about my size

441
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:01,120
 but with a very small head?

442
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,420
 (audience laughing)

443
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:05,360
 Well, I couldn't say, but if you do catch up with them,

444
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,900
 you might take this along and give it to whoever dropped it.

445
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:08,900
 Well, I'm not sure that we--

446
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:11,060
 What, I mean, that is, Father, that's Homer's.

447
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:12,180
 It is? Sure.

448
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,580
 Henry, what would Homer be doing

449
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:14,980
 with a box of curry powder?

450
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:16,660
 It was part of our lunch.

451
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:17,500
 What?

452
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,900
 Lady, you said the state part.

453
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:19,740
 That's right.

454
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,740
 Wow, Father, what are we waiting for?

455
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:35,740
 Come on, Acne Homer! You had to do it again!

456
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:36,740
 I'm not going to.

457
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:39,740
 No, and that's all there is to it.

458
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:40,740
 But that's not fair.

459
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:43,740
 I don't care. I'm not going through the mill again.

460
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:46,740
 But we reached that game of Ghost Fair and Square.

461
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:47,740
 No, you didn't.

462
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:50,460
 I was free!

463
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:53,100
 Uncle Homer, he wouldn't do that to you.

464
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:57,180
 You know, during well, if you started spelling apple sauce, it would end up on me.

465
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:58,580
 (crowd cheers)

466
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:01,940
 Girl listen, girls, can't you skip rope or something?

467
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:03,540
 Well, I sit down and rest.

468
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,820
 I felt nice, she doesn't have to ring.

469
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:09,180
 But your scout mask is a lady, she's used to this.

470
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:10,780
 Why don't you go away with the bus?

471
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:12,860
 Just to pick up some milk for all of you.

472
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:14,700
 Uncle Homer, I know why.

473
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,460
 Let's play half a long capacity.

474
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:17,780
 (crowd cheers)

475
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:18,780
 Nothing.

476
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:19,780
 Oh, wait.

477
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:20,780
 Now, brownie.

478
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:21,780
 Ow!

479
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:25,780
 Listen, who's the wise guy that threw this last shot?

480
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:26,780
 She was, girls.

481
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:29,780
 Will you currently remember that you're ladies?

482
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:30,780
 Oh, look.

483
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:31,780
 Here comes the car.

484
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:32,780
 Oh, where?

485
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:33,780
 She was.

486
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:34,780
 That looks like...

487
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:35,780
 Oh, boy, it is.

488
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:36,780
 Mr. Aldrich!

489
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:37,780
 Mr. Aldrich!

490
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:39,780
 Oh, Homer, where are you going?

491
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:40,780
 Goodbye, girls.

492
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:41,780
 And have a very night.

493
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:42,780
 Oh!

494
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:43,780
 Now, listen.

495
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:44,780
 Who tripped me?

496
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:45,780
 We didn't trip you.

497
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:46,780
 You're still laughing.

498
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:48,780
 Who'll get it off me?

499
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:51,780
 When I go home or hop along, never let this man get away.

500
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:54,780
 But girls, now cars, they're driving away.

501
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:57,780
 Mr. Aldrich, you can't leave me like this.

502
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:00,780
 Who girls, please? Mr. Aldrich, wait.

503
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:03,780
 The girls, won't you please?

504
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:05,780
 Now listen, you little brownies.

505
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:07,780
 Let go of that robe.

506
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:10,360
 (upbeat music)

507
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:19,660
 - Why don't Uncle Homer have to go to Crystal Brook?

508
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:21,380
 - To meet the mystery bus.

509
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:22,980
 - But who's going to be our leader?

510
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:26,740
 - I suppose, I suppose I am your leader temporarily.

511
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:27,580
 - You are?

512
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:29,340
 (crowd cheering)

513
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:30,540
 What's your name?

514
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:33,580
 - I guess you can just call me Uncle Sam.

515
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:34,420
 - Uncle Sam.

516
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:36,860
 - How do you do?

517
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,800
 And now that we've been properly introduced,

518
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,000
 but one of you mind untying me?

519
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,580
 (upbeat music)

520
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:52,520
 But Mr. Fuller, don't you, hello?

521
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,360
 Hello?

522
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,200
 - I'm still here, Al.

523
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,480
 - Well, don't you think I've waited long enough for that kid?

524
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,200
 This was supposed to be a five minute stop

525
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,880
 and I've been here for more than a half hour.

526
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,120
 - Well, Al, are you sure you looked everywhere?

527
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:02,960
 - Everywhere.

528
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:03,800
 - Did you look at that?

529
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:06,040
 - Of course, that was the first place I checked.

530
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,120
 (audience laughing)

531
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:11,660
 This kid just disappeared off the face of the earth. Mr. Fuller the other kids are getting pretty restless

532
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:15,360
 They are sure they're starting their picnic right on the bus. They got their lunches open

533
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,560
 They've even got a phonograph going they're dancing in the aisle

534
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:22,760
 What sure when I left the gym team was trying to build a pyramid I'll get started quick

535
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:25,680
 Well, that's another thing mr. Fuller unless so much time here

536
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:28,760
 I don't see how I'm gonna make it the crystal brook and still get back at a decent hour

537
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,640
 Oh

538
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:34,080
 Now I'll have any of those kids found out where they're going well now mr. Fuller

539
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,680
 you know me better than that.

540
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:38,320
 Well then, maybe you better go up to the state park instead.

541
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,600
 Okay, and Mr. Fuller, while I got you on.

542
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,600
 Yes?

543
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,280
 Is there any chance am I getting back on that straight downtown run?

544
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:55,360
 [MUSIC]

545
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,000
 Come on, Henry, admit it.

546
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,320
 You don't know where you're going.

547
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:58,960
 Sure I do.

548
00:20:58,960 --> 00:20:59,680
 Sure I do.

549
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:02,040
 This dirt road leads to the main highway.

550
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,400
 Now, boys, this is all rich.

551
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,320
 He's your son.

552
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,080
 Hasn't he got a terrible sense of direction?

553
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:10,040
 Homer, for a person who started out on a mystery bus trip

554
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,640
 and ended up with a load of brownies,

555
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,040
 you're a fine one to talk.

556
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,040
 Now, boys, suppose we all relax

557
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,960
 and keep our eyes open for a sign.

558
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,880
 OK.

559
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,840
 Mrs. Allrich, would you like to finish the sandwich?

560
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:22,640
 What?

561
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,320
 Homer, don't you feel well?

562
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,880
 Not very.

563
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:29,000
 Well, Homer, I told you not to sprinkle all that curry powder

564
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,080
 on the only sandwich there was.

565
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,680
 She was what a terrible day.

566
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:37,680
 Now Homer, when we get to Crystal Brook, I'll say that you get a nice hot lunch.

567
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:40,680
 Frankly, I think I'd prefer something nice cold.

568
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,080
 And they're there.

569
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:42,580
 What?

570
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:45,480
 You see that farmhouse? That's the second time we passed it.

571
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,380
 Homer, you're crazy.

572
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:47,280
 I am not.

573
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,280
 Here, are you sure?

574
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,280
 Of course. I remember it had a red barn.

575
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:54,680
 Homer, did you ever see a farmhouse that didn't have a red barn?

576
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,780
 Plenty of them.

577
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:58,080
 Well, that just shows how much you know about agriculture.

578
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,480
 Now, Henry, let's not run around in circles.

579
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,380
 Suppose you just go in there and ask.

580
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:04,680
 Okay, but it's just a waste of time.

581
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,480
 Tell me if they look like nice people.

582
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,680
 See if they'll give you a glass of water.

583
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,880
 Okay, oh my goodness.

584
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,280
 My goodness, I hope I don't have this much trouble

585
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,780
 when I drive back to pick up Mr. Aldrich.

586
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:17,180
 She was, I forgot all about him.

587
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:19,680
 Do you think he'll hold it against me, Mrs. Aldrich?

588
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,680
 Hold what there?

589
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,480
 He's getting stuck with those kids.

590
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,680
 Oh, of course he won't.

591
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:26,280
 Why, Mr. Aldrich is very fond of children.

592
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:29,680
 Yeah, what is he fond of Hoppler and Cassidy?

593
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:32,720
 I don't know but I'm sure he's having the time of his life.

594
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,840
 She was locked.

595
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:34,880
 Is that a bus?

596
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:35,840
 Yeah.

597
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,160
 And I'll be darn if it doesn't look like.

598
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,240
 She was it is. It's the mystery bus.

599
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:40,960
 Are you sure?

600
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,080
 Positive.

601
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,840
 But what's it doing all the way up here?

602
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,120
 Oh my don't waste a second.

603
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,520
 Go right in there and get Henry and I'll stop the bus.

604
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,440
 Henry, Henry come quick.

605
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,320
 Stop! Stop!

606
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,040
 What's the matter lady?

607
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:55,920
 Bridge out?

608
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:59,120
 No but I've got two passengers that belong on your bus.

609
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,840
 On this bus? The mystery bus?

610
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:01,540
 That's right.

611
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:02,240
 They fell off?

612
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:02,880
 No.

613
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,280
 You mean they jumped out of a window?

614
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,120
 And the no.

615
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:05,980
 But where are they?

616
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:07,280
 I'm way behind.

617
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,080
 Holy smoke.

618
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:08,840
 Look at this.

619
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:09,520
 My goodness.

620
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,600
 It's another bus.

621
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,000
 Hey, who's that?

622
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,120
 Charlie, is that you?

623
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,200
 Well, yeah.

624
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,880
 What are you doing way up here?

625
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,240
 Well, it's a long story, Charlie.

626
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,040
 Would you mind backing up and letting me buy?

627
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,000
 Oh, well, I think you better back up.

628
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,480
 You see, I've got to get this milk back to my brownies.

629
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,000
 But, Charlie, you don't know what these kids are doing to my bus.

630
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,800
 I've got to get them to someplace where they can get out.

631
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,800
 I know, but wait a second.

632
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,800
 If we could get this car out of the way,

633
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,000
 Lady, could you move that car over a little?

634
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,560
 Well, my son took the keys, but he should be right out.

635
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,400
 Is that him now?

636
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,760
 No, that--

637
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,240
 Oh, where's Henry?

638
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,120
 Does all of it something terrible has happened?

639
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,200
 Oh, my goodness, what?

640
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,880
 Him who went into the bathroom to get me a drink of water,

641
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:49,640
 see?

642
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,520
 And--

643
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,020
 Him?

644
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:52,280
 Oh, no.

645
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,240
 Yes, ma'am.

646
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,960
 He's stuck in there again.

647
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,960
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

648
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:07,640
 And Mrs. Aldrich, I want to thank you for taking the trouble to come down here.

649
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:11,960
 Why, Mr. Fuller, it was nothing. I just wanted to be sure those two drivers wouldn't have

650
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,040
 to take all the blame.

651
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,040
 I understand.

652
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:17,440
 Because if it wasn't for our car being stuck in the first place, that driver would never

653
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,400
 have tried going through the field.

654
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:22,680
 Well, it was a rather unusual situation.

655
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:27,200
 My goodness, yes. I certainly never heard of anyone trying to raise rice in this state

656
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:33,200
 before. No. And as far as the other bus is concerned, I'm afraid I was the one who suggested

657
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:37,640
 that he drive in and pull the first one out. Mrs. Aldrich, I'm sure your intentions were

658
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:42,720
 the best. As a matter of fact, you had your own problems at the time. Yes. Well, how did

659
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:48,920
 they get your son out of there? Why, the Jim teen built up lovely pyramid. Oh, here's

660
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:53,320
 Henry now. Hello, Mother. Oh, hello, Mr. Fuller. Hello, son. I hope your class wasn't

661
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:56,560
 to disappointed about the mystery bus ride ending up like that.

662
00:24:56,560 --> 00:25:00,640
 She was. No. They say they had a wonderful time right there on the bus.

663
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:06,560
 Yes. So I heard that reminds me I have to call AC and ask him the name of that company

664
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,640
 that wanted to buy some of our old buses.

665
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,240
 Excuse me, Mr. Fuller.

666
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,040
 Yes, Ms. Arnold.

667
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:15,440
 I've just had a call from a little grocery up near the state park in regard to that bus

668
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,120
 load of brownies.

669
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:17,800
 They've been found?

670
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,400
 Yes. They just arrived at this grocery store.

671
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,120
 In the bus?

672
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,220
 No, they just came down the road marching and singing.

673
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:27,320
 For heaven's sake, tell them we'll send a bus right out.

674
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:31,020
 Well, the person who calls says they want to hike all the way into town.

675
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:31,720
 They do?

676
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:36,920
 Yes, except there's an old man with them who refuses to budge another step.

677
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:37,820
 What?

678
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:39,620
 Oh boy.

679
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:44,420
 Miss, would you please call back and tell that old man that his wife is on her way out to get him right now?

 [Music]

681
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:58,420
 Hi, Ho, Ho, wait a minute!

682
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:01,420
 She was stuck, and here comes Stringbean Kid, and she was...

683
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:02,420
 Too late.

684
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:04,420
 Hi, Homer. Hi, Henry.

685
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:08,420
 Say, I want to ask you both to party, I'm throwing for the gang tonight.

686
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:09,420
 Well, I'll tell you Stringbean.

687
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:11,420
 You can see it's this way, Stringbean.

688
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:13,420
 And we didn't hear about the swell, each were having.

689
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:18,420
 Oh, oh, we are sure, and I made it myself.

690
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:20,420
 A big batch of brownies.

691
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:23,420
 All you want to eat, brownies.

692
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:25,420
 Now listen, string bean.

693
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:28,420
 Well, now maybe Homer's fed up for the moment on that word,

694
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,420
 but I know a word, kids, can never hear too often,

695
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:32,420
 and that's jello for dessert.

696
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:35,420
 Yes, jello, in those six delicious flavors,

697
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:38,420
 strawberry, raspberry, cherry, orange, lemon, and lime.

698
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:41,420
 All six rich with wonderful locked-in goodness.

699
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:45,420
 so tempting and fruit-like, it reminds you of a cherry orchard on the berry patch.

700
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:50,420
 So look for those big red letters on the box. They spell "Jello" and "Jello" spells a tree.

00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:53,420
 The name "Jello" is a registered trademark of general food.

702
00:26:53,420 --> 00:27:05,420
 The Aldrich family starring Ezra Stone is Henry with Jackie Kalka's Homer.

703
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:09,420
 It's written by Norman Tocar and Ed Jourist with music by Jack Miller.

704
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:13,420
 Mr. and Mrs. Aldrich, our house, Jamison, and Catherine Roth.

705
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:15,420
 And this is Dan Seymour in New York saying,

706
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:19,420
 "The Aldrich family is brought to you by the Jell-O family."

708
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:23,420
 Oh, the Big Red letters stand for the Jell-O family.

709
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:27,420
 Oh, the Big Red letters stand for the Jell-O family.

710
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:28,420
 That's Jell-O.

711
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:29,420
 The Union, Union.

712
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:30,420
 Jell-O puddings.

713
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:31,420
 Yum, yum, yum.

714
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:36,420
 Jell-O, that's Be-O, the puddings just are here.

715
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:46,460
 Friends, our governmental independence drive going on right now reminds us all over again

716
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:51,100
 that buying United States savings bonds is the safest savings plan in the world and a

717
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:52,960
 very profitable investment.

718
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:58,180
 For every three dollars invested in e-bonds today, you receive four dollars in ten short

719
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:59,180
 years.

720
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:01,560
 Buy more United States savings bonds.

721
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:04,920
 It means security for you and for your country.

724
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,800
 It's new, it's new, it can't be beat.

725
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:17,240
 The grandest treat you ever did eat.

726
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:19,240
 Post, sugar, crisp.

727
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,600
 As a cereal, it's sandy.

728
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,520
 For snack, it's so handy.

729
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,560
 Or eat it like candy.

730
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,320
 As a cereal of sandy.

731
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,880
 Or eat it like candy.

732
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,520
 Post, sugar, crisp.

733
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:35,520
 Look for the red, white, and blue cellophane bag with the three little bears.

734
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,220
 That's post-sugar crisp.

735
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:40,520
 Today, enjoy this honey of a new cereal that's fun to eat.
