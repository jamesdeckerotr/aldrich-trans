 Do you remember when you were in your teens?

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 Well, when you listened to Henry Aldrich and his pals,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 We think you sort of be able to detect a little of yourself.

 For Henry Aldrich is a typical American boy from a typical American family.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 Just listen and see if I am not right.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
 It's noon in Centerville, and as the scene opens,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 Henry and his pal, Dizzy Stevens, are just coming down the stone steps of Central High School on their way to lunch.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 Well, Dizzy, what I want to know is where it could have gone.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 Listen, a lunch box isn't something a person just overlooks.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 Well, you certainly overlooked yours.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 Oh, no, I didn't.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 Somebody took mine.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 Boy, I didn't need any breakfast this morning.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
 Can't you buy anything?

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 How am I going to buy anything?

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 The only thing I've got in my pockets is this knife.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 Gee, where's Henry?

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 You wouldn't like to sell that knife, would you?

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 Oh, no.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
 It's got two blades, a quark screw,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 and a combined can opener and nail file.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 I'll give you 20 cents for it.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 No.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 I'll give you 30 cents.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000
 No.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.540

 (audience laughing)

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.380
 Did she just slap you again?

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.940
 No, wait till I tell ya.

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.040
 She just asked me to be a partner at the class picnic.

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.880
 She did?

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.460
 Sure.

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:21.740
 Who are you going with?

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:23.660
 Oh, I haven't asked anyone yet.

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:24.500
 You're not supposed to.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.020
 You have to wait until a girl asks you.

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.860
 I do?

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:29.620
 Sure, hasn't anyone asked you yet?

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.980
 Well, I've been too busy for anyone to ask me.

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.640
 How could they even find me when I've been here, there, and everywhere looking for something?

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.140
 I found you.

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:48.740
 Do you happen to know the name of that girl in our class with blonde hair?

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:50.140
 With blonde hair?

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.640
 Yeah.

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.440
 That's the way half of them are.

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:58.240
 No, she's the one that when she speaks, it's in sort of a low voice.

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:59.440
 Oh!

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:00.440
 You know who I mean?

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:01.540
 No.

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.000
 Well, I'll tell you, Dizzy.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.340
 She wears high-heeled shoes, and everyone Cooper is crazy about her.

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.180
 Oh, I think I know the one you mean.

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:14.900
 That's on, girl, Henry.

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:16.540
 What's the matter with her?

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:19.540
 Boy, I wish she'd asked me to go to the picnic.

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.660
 Henry, do you realize what you're doing with that knife?

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.380
 Well, you just cut your tie in, too.

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.420
 She whizzed, and that was one of my best.

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:30.260
 Henry, you ought to sell that knife before you

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:31.820
 do some real serious damage.

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:34.820
 No. I'll give you a 50 centrere.

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:35.820
 Yeah?

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.820
 Yeah, with 50 centre you can buy out the school cafeteria.

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.820
 (audience laughter)

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:42.820
 I'm hungry, but I'm not going to sell this knife.

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:45.820
 And besides, look, what is it? I just found 10 cents in my pocket.

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.820
 Are you sure that is in mind?

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:51.820
 How would your dime get in my pants pocket?

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:53.820
 Well, I had a dime and changed this morning.

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:54.820
 - It's coming off it!

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:56.820
 - She was busy staying in front of me quick.

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:58.820
 What's the matter? Come on, let's go across the street to the Havens drugstore.

00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:59.820
 Howdy, yup, Tiffany.

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:00.820
 - Hey, wait for me, Henry!

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:03.720
 - Hey Henry! - Somebody's calling Magnus Lawson.

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.820
 She ruins every one shower I have.

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.320
 You know, I'm gonna leave you before she ruins mine.

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:27.020
 -

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:29.420
 You'd like to take me to the picnic.

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:31.620
 You mean you haven't got any of those things, will you?

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:33.620
 Of course I haven't!

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:35.420
 Would you like to be my partner, Henry?

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:37.220
 Well, the only thing is...

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:39.920
 Oh, has somebody else asked you?

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:46.020
 Well, somebody asked me not to accept any offers until I see about something else.

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:47.720
 I love to put up a lunch, Henry.

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.120
 I just get the biggest kick out of it!

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.920
 Don't talk anymore about food, Agnes.

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:54.420
 I'm starved.

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:56.820
 The last class I had was in nutrition.

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:59.880
 Oh, hey, that's too bad, Henry.

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:04.960
 She was, I'm hungry enough to eat a well-balanced lunch.

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:06.720
 Say Agnes, you know who that was

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:09.020
 that just went into the Havens drug store there?

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:09.860
 Just now?

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:12.720
 Yep, that girl with blonde hair and high-heeled shoes.

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:14.200
 Oh, come on, let's go in and see.

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:16.880
 Oh, I don't think you better go into 'em.

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:19.200
 Going into me to couple of the fellas in here.

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:20.440
 Oh, you are.

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:23.480
 Well, would you let me know about the picnic, Henry?

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:25.780
 Give me three days, Agnes.

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:29.020
 But if you'd rather not wait that long, I'll understand.

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:30.780
 Goodbye, Henry.

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:31.780
 Hey, Henry.

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:32.820
 Hiya, Homer.

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:34.780
 Henry, come over by this table in a minute.

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:35.900
 What do you have?

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:38.340
 Do you know who that girl is sitting at the counter?

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:39.180
 Which one?

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:41.140
 The blind with the blue eyes.

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:43.740
 Yeah, isn't she a beauty girl?

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:45.900
 You couldn't know me a dime, could you?

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:47.980
 That's all I got myself, Homer.

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:50.020
 I'll pay you 25% interest.

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:52.580
 No, I've got to go over to the counter and get my lunch.

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:54.580
 I saw a first though Henry.

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:55.580
 Yeah.

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:58.580
 What do you have?

00:06:58.580 --> 00:06:59.580
 Oh yeah.

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:01.580
 I guess this young lady was here first.

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:03.580
 Oh well I haven't decided yet.

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:04.580
 Oh.

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:06.580
 Mr. Is that big ham there?

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:07.580
 Yes sir.

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:09.580
 What's that next to it?

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:10.580
 Those big.

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:11.580
 Oh.

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:12.580
 What's this?

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:13.580
 It's fried chicken.

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:16.580
 Well I'll take apple pie.

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:18.580
 Apple pie.

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:20.580
 A small piece.

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:21.580
 That's a nickel isn't it?

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:24.580
 - Yes, sir. - Put a scoop of ice cream on it.

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:27.580
 Could I trouble you for a paper nap, can you?

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:30.580
 Oh, oh, sure. How many would you like?

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:32.580
 Just one.

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:35.580
 Here, she was. Take the whole container.

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:38.580
 Uh, do you want whipped cream on that pie?

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:41.580
 Well, no extra charge. Shoot the works.

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:43.580
 Hey, um...

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:45.580
 Not bad.

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:47.580
 That'll be 15 cents.

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:48.580
 15 cents?

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:51.580
 Nickel for the pie, dime for the large ice cream.

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:53.580
 Yeah, well, that's fair enough.

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:57.580
 Only, uh, can I have the water ice cream in the first place?

00:07:57.580 --> 00:07:58.580
 You don't want this?

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:01.580
 Well, would it be an awful lot of trouble if I didn't take it?

00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:03.580
 You mean I got a dismantle, is it?

00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:05.580
 [laughter]

00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:07.580
 Well, I'm afraid so.

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:08.580
 Listen, what do you want?

00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:09.580
 Well...

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:11.580
 Could I have the menu, please?

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:12.580
 Oh, sure.

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:17.580
 You wouldn't like a piece of apple pie on me, would you?

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:20.180
 I don't think I should.

00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:21.740
 Well, why not?

00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:26.260
 Gee whiz, Mr. One apple pie and I think I'll take the same.

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:27.260
 Just plain?

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:28.260
 Yes, sir, plain.

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:33.020
 Well, it certainly seems good to have spring here.

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:34.860
 I like spring.

00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:36.780
 I like to go on picnics, too.

00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:37.780
 You do?

00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:38.780
 Yeah.

00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:40.700
 Are you going to the craft picnic?

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:42.180
 I'm not saying yet.

00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:46.260
 Well, what's the idea of shaking pepper all around?

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:47.260
 Gee whiz, Mr.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:48.860
 I know I had it in my hand.

00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:53.060
 Would anyone mind if I could take ice cream on my pie?

00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:54.600
 You want ice cream too?

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:55.800
 Vod you're small.

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:58.400
 Well I think I'll take the small.

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:00.300
 Not large?

00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:01.980
 How about you buddy?

00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:05.700
 What was the matter of fact I don't think I'll eat anything at all?

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:07.940
 I must be hungrier than you.

00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:09.180
 Yeah.

00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:12.180
 Frankly I was just going to eat to kill time anyhow.

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:14.980
 Oh could I have a chocolate mold or two?

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:15.880
 A chocolate mold?

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:16.880
 One cup!

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:21.520
 (audience laughing)

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:24.320
 Yes, one chocolate maul.

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:25.880
 - What is your name?

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:27.560
 - My name is Henry Albridge.

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:30.880
 - My name's Geraldine Love.

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:31.880
 - It is?

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:33.240
 - Mm.

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:36.800
 - She was Geraldine Love.

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:38.920
 (audience laughing)

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:40.000
 - Who takes the check?

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.800
 - Oh, I'll pay for it.

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:43.960
 I wonder, I wonder if--

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:45.280
 - Who are you looking for?

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:47.920
 I just thought there might be someone in here I know.

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:48.920
 Who?

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:49.920
 Why, you're...

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:53.160
 Wonder whether there could be anyone outside looking for me.

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:56.320
 Would you mind excusing me for just a second while I step out?

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:57.480
 How about this test?

00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:58.400
 I'll be right back!

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:00.840
 Busy?

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:02.560
 Hey, Busy, why don't you have?

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:04.800
 Come here, I'm in a terrible position.

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:05.760
 What happened?

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:06.840
 Hurry up.

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:07.560
 Here's my knife.

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:08.640
 Give me that 50 cents.

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:10.560
 I haven't got 50 cents anymore.

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:11.200
 No?

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:12.640
 No, I've been getting something to eat.

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:13.720
 Haven't you anything?

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:14.880
 Just 30 cents.

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:16.980
 Well, she was, I don't make 40 cents, give it to me.

00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:17.820
 Here's the knife.

00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:19.840
 Oh, I didn't give the side to eat after all.

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:21.080
 Only in a way I did.

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:22.440
 Oh, he had teeth, thanks.

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:23.240
 So long.

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:24.880
 Yeah, I've got to go back in.

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:28.200
 - Was anyone out in front?

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:29.400
 - Was there?

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:31.320
 And was it a good thing I saw him?

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:34.840
 - That'll be 20, 30, 40 cents.

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:35.680
 Huh?

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:37.000
 That'll all.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.440
 - Aren't you gonna eat anything?

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:41.160
 - See, if you could have seen the lunch I brought from home.

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:42.520
 - Oh, you've already eaten?

00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:43.960
 - I stuffed myself.

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:46.160
 Hey Henry, what do you have, Disney?

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:47.460
 Your mother's out here.

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:48.460
 My mother?

00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:50.700
 Henry, I've been looking all over for you.

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:51.760
 Is somebody sick for you?

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:52.600
 No, dear.

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:54.800
 You let your lunchbox at home in the living room.

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:55.640
 Mother?

00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:58.040
 Well, dear, you can't go all day without anything to eat.

00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:00.240
 For mother, I've had more than enough.

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:02.280
 I left that box home on purpose.

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:03.280
 Hi, Geraldine.

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:04.480
 Is that you in there?

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:06.040
 Oh, hello, where are we?

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:07.640
 And where did you come from, Erwin?

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:09.160
 I see you find your box, Henry.

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:10.380
 Now maybe you can eat something.

00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:12.960
 Henry, mother, do you mind if I change the subject

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:15.680
 for just a minute. I want you to meet Geraldine Love.

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:17.880
 Hello. Come on, Henry. Let's go over to school.

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:20.680
 Okay. It was nice when I saw Henry.

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:23.720
 She wish she's gone.

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:25.440
 Who is that young woman, Henry?

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:27.760
 She's the best looking girl in school, mother.

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:29.800
 She's hardly the best man, Ed.

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:31.520
 But you don't really know her.

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:34.160
 And while I appreciate your bringing this lunchbox,

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:36.920
 I do think it could have handed it to me more cautiously.

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:39.720
 Henry, Agnes Lawson's mother phoned this morning.

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:41.800
 Well, she said, "I wanted to know whether you wouldn't like

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:45.480
 to go to the class picnic with Agnes. I hope you didn't tell her I would.

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:49.360
 Why wouldn't you dare? I couldn't possibly. Why not? Because.

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:52.320
 Henry, there isn't any girl you know quite as nice as Agnes.

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:55.240
 But mother, she can't begin to compare with Geraldine.

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:59.260
 I'm sure he isn't as rude as that young woman. You're just jumping at the conclusion.

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:03.280
 Henry Agnes' mother has always been so nice to you. And so is Agnes.

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:07.200
 But she's still not my idea of a girl I might go on a picnic with. Then I don't

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:09.760
 think you should accept any more of her hospitality.

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:13.020
 Henry! Say! Henry! Aren't you going to be late to class?

00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:13.860
 Oh, hello Agnes!

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:15.460
 Oh, hello Mrs. Olgritte!

00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:17.820
 The light film may ring any minute, Henry!

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:19.700
 Well, there's still lots of time, Agnes.

00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:23.200
 Henry, don't you think this would be a good time to tell Agnes what we were just discussing?

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:25.260
 For Mother, look at the clock. I didn't know it was so late.

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:26.980
 It won't take one minute.

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:28.260
 What is it about?

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.540
 Well, Agnes...

00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:35.160
 Would you like to have me go to the picnic with you?

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:38.160
 Oh, Henry, of course!

00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:40.400
 Well, I'd like to go with you.

00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:42.360
 See that, there it didn't take one second.

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:44.740
 Oh, I'm so glad you can go Henry.

00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:46.240
 I think I'd better hurry.

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:48.280
 Oh, do you mind if I walk with you?

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:49.580
 No.

00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:50.480
 Goodbye, dear.

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:51.480
 Goodbye, mother.

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:53.080
 Goodbye, little girl, Bitt.

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:54.820
 When are you going to eat your lunch?

00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:56.220
 During music.

00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:57.920
 Dilly.

00:12:57.920 --> 00:12:59.420
 Look, hurry across the street.

00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:00.760
 Oh, Henry, all of it.

00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:02.320
 Oh, she was Geraldine.

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:04.860
 Could I see you alone, Henry?

00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:05.660
 Oh, wait for you.

00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:07.260
 Right at the entrance, Henry.

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.520
 You better go right on in, Agnes.

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:10.620
 Henry.

00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:11.420
 Well.

00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:14.460
 Henry, everyone Cooper can't go to the picnic.

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:17.020
 Would you like to be my partner?

00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:19.200
 I...

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:20.800
 be your partner.

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:22.600
 Of course.

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:23.980
 Well, gee, where is...

00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:25.440
 Would you?

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:26.340
 The only thing is...

00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:28.380
 Has someone else asked you?

00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:30.740
 I can fix it, all right.

00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:32.340
 I can fix it, I'm sure I can.

00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:33.040
 Really?

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:34.140
 Of course.

00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:35.880
 Oh, Henry.

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:38.480
 Henry, I'm so thrilled you can go.

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:39.980
 She was. Think how I feel.

00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:41.480
 I'm going with you.

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:47.580
 Boy, I'm going with you.

00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:49.480
 Can you bring the long Henry?

00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:52.280
 I bring you.

00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:54.380
 Oh, I just hate to put up an old lunch.

00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:56.280
 Sure, I'd be very glad to.

00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:57.880
 Oh, my goodness. We better hurry.

00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:00.380
 Henry, hey, Henry, I've got a message for you.

00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:00.980
 Come here.

00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:01.980
 What is it, Dizzy?

00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:02.680
 Come here.

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:04.480
 Could you excuse me, Geraldine?

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:06.040
 You won't forget Henry.

00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:07.040
 Forget?

00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:08.320
 How could I?

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:11.120
 Listen, Henry, let me tell you, boy, you're gonna pass right out.

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:12.120
 Why?

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:13.560
 I fixed it up for you.

00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:14.600
 You fixed what up for me.

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:15.960
 To go to the picnic.

00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:16.960
 With whom?

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:19.880
 The girl you said you wanted a meat.

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:21.560
 But I just met her.

00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:24.840
 Oh, no, Henry, that isn't the girl you wanted a meat.

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:26.560
 I just talked to the one you want.

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:28.360
 She's crazy to have you go.

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:30.720
 But, Dizzy, I've already got a date with this one.

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:33.000
 It's too late to tell the one I have talked to you.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.400
 You can't go, Henry.

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:36.160
 She busted a date purposely.

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:38.880
 Boy, on eye your pal?

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:41.800
 I'll say you're my pal.

00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:45.160
 That makes three girls and one picnic.

00:14:45.160 --> 00:15:03.280
 You know, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls of Henry's age often say

00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:06.120
 and do a lot of things that puzzle parents.

00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:07.680
 But among the most surprising things

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:11.600
 about all boys and girls is their strange powers of hearing.

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:14.080
 Your own son, for instance, may be just upstairs

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:16.840
 in his room when you call him from the kitchen.

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:18.200
 - Tommy?

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:20.920
 Oh, Tommy, come down here a minute.

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:22.320
 Tommy!

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:25.080
 - But no answer, so you call again.

00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:26.840
 And this goes on for several minutes

00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:28.600
 until you finally say to yourself.

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:31.520
 - Well, I did think he might want this extra dish

00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:35.520
 of jello chocolate pudding if he doesn't, I'll eat it myself.

00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:37.520
 Wait a minute, Mother, here I am.

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:39.520
 Where is it?

00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:40.520
 Uh-huh.

00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:45.520
 You see, it just goes to prove that all you have to do is mention just barely whispered

00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:50.520
 jello chocolate pudding, and folks young and old will come running.

00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:54.520
 Because seriously, ladies and gentlemen, jello chocolate pudding is a mighty delicious treat.

00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:58.520
 It's a grand satisfying dessert, delightfully smooth and creamy,

00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:03.840
 me, and every tempting spoonful is rich with swell, chocolaty flavor. You'll be glad to

00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:08.920
 know, too, that jello chocolate pudding is easy to make, and that it costs only a few pennies.

00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:14.040
 So try some real soon. For keen, luscious enjoyment, jello chocolate pudding is in a

00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:15.120
 class by itself.

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:29.120
 [Music]

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:33.800
 Now getting back to Henry Alvich, when we left him Henry through no fault of his own,

00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:37.040
 was dated with three girls for the class picnic.

00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:39.120
 Now the scene opens on the morning of the picnic.

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:42.800
 Henry wearing an apron is working in the Alvich kitchen.

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:45.360
 Mother, is this all the wax paper we have?

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:47.600
 Well, Henry, you've already used two rolls.

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:51.240
 But I'm making the sandwiches big.

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:54.160
 May I ask how big Geraldine's mouth is?

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:59.640
 Look, Mother, look at this well bottle of stuffed olives.

00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:01.840
 Where did you get enough money to buy those?

00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:03.840
 I sold a picture that was up on my wall.

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:07.440
 Mother, I wonder why Geraldine doesn't like to put up a lunch.

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:10.680
 What did Agnes say when you told her you couldn't go with her?

00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:11.960
 Very little.

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:14.440
 Well, Henry, I still don't like it.

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:16.760
 But don't you think it was alright for me to tell a girl,

00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:18.760
 dizzy, fixed up for me that I couldn't go?

00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:20.760
 That was entirely different, huh?

00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:25.200
 Henry, what's the trouble of the portable phone of grass that was up in my room?

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:27.200
 Mary, I meant to speak to you about that.

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:29.200
 Do you need it today?

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:33.200
 What's more, I'd like to know what became of that pillow that was up in my room?

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:35.200
 Well, which one?

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:36.200
 The Princeton one.

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:39.000
 Couldn't I borrow that if I take very good care of it?

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000
 I'm going to rent a canoe, Mary.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000
 Why can't you take my Harvard pillow, Henry?

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000
 She was, though I could ask any girl to sit on Harvard.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000
 Why not, Henry?

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000
 Well, in the first place, it's coming out at the seams.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000
 No, Agnes will notice that.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000
 Agnes, I'm not going with Agnes.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000
 I thought you were.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000
 Mary, didn't you tell Agnes?

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.000
 How are you?

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.000
 Mary.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000
 Mary, the message I gave you.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.000
 When you were going over to her house yesterday, I cooled downstairs to you.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.000
 I didn't hear you.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.000
 But you must have.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:14.600
 I said Mary, will you please tell Agnes I can't take her to the picnic because I have a very urgent engagement

00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:20.840
 Well, I certainly didn't understand you had a G whiz if that doesn't leave Agnes in an embarrassing position

00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:28.340
 Why Agnes why Agnes she'll have to eat her lunch alone. Oh, no, she won't dare mother

00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:35.120
 I couldn't take her you certainly will the level Geraldine thing you've known Agnes a great deal longer than you had Geraldine

00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:37.120
 My mother haven't you caught on?

00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:39.120
 I'm not fond of Agnes.

00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:42.120
 If I take her I'll be embarrassed the whole afternoon.

00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:44.120
 Mary, could you let me speak to Henry alone, please?

00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:45.120
 Yes, mother.

00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:48.120
 But I fully disapprove of the whole thing.

00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:50.120
 That's because neither one of you is a boy.

00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:54.120
 And what's more you've never had to take out Agnes?

00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:59.120
 Henry, I realize Geraldine must be a very pretty girl.

00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:00.120
 She's beautiful, Mother.

00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:03.120
 Well, that's Grant. She's the most beautiful girl that ever lived.

00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:06.120
 But don't you see how Agnes is going to feel?

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:08.120
 And her mother's always been so nice to you.

00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:10.120
 Oh, don't misunderstand me, mother.

00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:12.120
 I'm very fond of Agnes's mother.

00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:15.120
 In fact, if it were a choice, I'd rather take her.

00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:21.120
 I'm sorry, dear. I'm not going to say anything more, I see.

00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:24.120
 Does that mean yes or no, mother?

00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:25.120
 I've said, "All I'm going to."

00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:27.120
 Henry, get me, sister, front door!

00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:30.120
 Hey, Henry! I'm calling, Des.

00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:32.520
 Henry, I'm in an emergency.

00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:34.360
 (audience laughs)

00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:35.200
 What's the matter?

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:36.480
 Do you wanna buy this knife?

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:38.480
 I'll let you have it for 50 cents.

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:39.640
 It isn't worth 50.

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:41.480
 You try to sell it to me for 50.

00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:42.480
 (audience laughs)

00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:43.320
 And if you don't buy it,

00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:45.040
 I won't have any lunch at the picnic.

00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:45.920
 Why not?

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:47.280
 My girl can't go.

00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:48.400
 She can't, doesn't she?

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:49.240
 No.

00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:50.960
 It would be your...

00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:51.880
 Listen, busy.

00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:55.280
 If I'll fix you up with one of the slullest girls

00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:56.680
 you ever met in your life,

00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:57.720
 will you give me that knife?

00:19:57.720 --> 00:19:58.640
 Are you kidding me?

00:19:58.640 --> 00:19:59.720
 Do you like fried chicken?

00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:04.560
 And peanut butter sandwich and devil leg. Oh sure I do. Give me the night

00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:08.660
 This here. Who is it? Come here while I tell up on boy. Are you one luck?

00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:10.540
 Hello operator

00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:13.000
 She was what she liked. She's a dream

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:17.080
 Yeah, and she's got the swallest mother

00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:24.800
 Operator I want one at three seven three one. Let's freeze now wait a minute Henry

00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:28.800
 Isn't that Agnes's number

00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:35.560
 Dizzy, her mother can cook. I know, Henry, but I'm not interested. She's got a lunch basket

00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:49.380
 that's really a laundry hamper. She has? Mm-hmm. A operator? The line's busy? Well, will

00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:56.360
 you let me know when it isn't? Boy, am I going to have a swell time with Geraldine. You know

00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:57.360
 What I'm going to do, Dizzy?

00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:58.360
 Why?

00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:00.360
 Well, I'm going to rent a canoe.

00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:01.360
 Where'd you get the money?

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:04.360
 I sold a set of books I never read.

00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:07.360
 And hey, look at this phonograph.

00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:09.360
 Gee whiz, what did you sell?

00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:10.360
 I get that.

00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:11.360
 Oh nothing.

00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:13.360
 Want to listen to something swell?

00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:21.360
 Ever hear anything like it, Dizzy?

00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:24.360
 I got a pillow from Princeton, too.

00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:26.960
 Yeah, I'm gonna let Geraldine sit on it.

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:29.760
 Right in the middle of a canoe.

00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:32.360
 And then you know what...

00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:33.360
 And then what?

00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:36.960
 Well, you know that capicle...

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:39.360
 ...weild on the far side of the lake?

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:40.660
 Yeah...

00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:43.560
 Boy, is that a swell place to eat lunch?

00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:46.160
 She would.

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:48.660
 Hello?

00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:52.560
 Hand me what happened to the racquet?

00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:54.160
 Hello, Agnes?

00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:59.160
 Agnes, how would you like to have me arrange a very pleasant surprise?

00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:03.160
 How would you enjoy going today with Dizzy Stevens?

00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:06.160
 What does she say, Henry?

00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:09.160
 Oh, no, Agnes, I think you've got the wrong idea of him.

00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:11.160
 What's that?

00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:15.160
 Oh, no, Agnes, he isn't like that.

00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:16.160
 Hang up, Henry.

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:18.160
 Maybe who are you talking?

00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:20.160
 Agnes, Mrs. Orrich.

00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:22.160
 Henry, you are not to tell her you can't take her.

00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:23.420
 - Can't take her. - Yep, but mother--

00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:24.660
 - Did you hear me?

00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:25.900
 - Yes.

00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:27.020
 Hello Agnes.

00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:29.460
 I'd like to go with you.

00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:32.500
 No, I'd be very glad to.

00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:36.860
 I'll pick you up in about an hour.

00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:37.700
 Goodbye.

00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:42.060
 Henry, could I have my knife?

00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:43.420
 She was.

00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:45.200
 Am I gonna have a swell time?

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:48.020
 Agnes and Geraldine both at once.

00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:50.760
 (dramatic music)

00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:55.760
 (crying)

00:22:55.760 --> 00:23:00.760
 (crying)

00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:01.760
 (crickets chirping)

00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:03.760
 Do you see anyone coming, Agnes?

00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:05.760
 Maybe she changed her mind, Henry.

00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:08.760
 I'm sure Geraldine is coming. She told me she was.

00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:10.760
 Aww, couldn't we get into the canoe here?

00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:13.760
 You know, I've always wanted to go in a canoe.

00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:15.760
 Haven't you ever been in one?

00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:17.760
 No.

00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:18.760
 Can you swim?

00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:20.760
 No, I can't.

00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:21.760
 Is that right?

00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:25.760
 Oh, gee, look who's coming down the path.

00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:26.760
 Who is it?

00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:27.760
 Geraldine.

00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:29.760
 I'll be back in the second magnet.

00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:32.760
 Oh, gosh, Henry, why don't you wait here on the top?

00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:34.760
 I've got to help her carry your sweater.

00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:36.760
 Hello, Henry.

00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:39.760
 Oh, I saw you came.

00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:41.760
 Let me carry your sweater for you.

00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:43.760
 I think you have it so much.

00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:46.760
 Henry, who's that down on the dock?

00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:49.760
 Well, it seems Geraldine there was a misunderstanding.

00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:52.760
 Henry that girl isn't going with us, is she?

00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:54.760
 Geraldine, she's just a friend of a family.

00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:55.760
 But I asked you to go.

00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:57.760
 Well, I'm here to go with you.

00:23:57.760 --> 00:23:59.760
 She's really going just for my mother.

00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:01.760
 Hi Geraldine.

00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:02.760
 Now look over here.

00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:05.760
 Oh, Erwin Cooper. I thought you couldn't come.

00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:07.760
 I'm here though. Hi, Henry.

00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:09.760
 Glad to see you, my boy.

00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:10.760
 I'm glad to see you.

00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:12.760
 Oh, I'm glad to see you.

00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:14.760
 Henry!

00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:17.360
 Who's that calling you Henry?

00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:18.560
 It's just a girl.

00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:19.560
 Tell me!

00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:20.560
 Yes Agnes!

00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:21.560
 Tell me!

00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:22.560
 What's the matter?

00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:23.560
 You Henry look!

00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:27.660
 He's got one foot on the dock and one foot on the canoe and he's holding your lunch bag

00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:29.160
 get right over the water!

00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:30.160
 Agnes!

00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:32.160
 Pull your legs together!

00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:33.160
 I'm going to fall in!

00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:36.160
 Oh, put that lunch bag down Agnes!

00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:38.160
 I'm going to fall in!

00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:39.160
 Oh, put that lunch bag down Agnes!

00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:40.160
 I'm going to fall in!

00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:41.160
 Oh, put that lunch bag down Agnes!

00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:42.160
 I'm going to fall in!

00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:47.160
 I'm going to... (screams)

00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:48.160
 No!

00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:50.160
 (crowd laughs)

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:52.160
 I'm going to be lucky, so I am!

00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:54.160
 I'm going! I'll pull her out.

00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:55.160
 It's only three feet deep.

00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:57.160
 Grab a canoe, Agnes!

00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:58.160
 Stand up!

00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:00.160
 Get your head out of the water!

00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:03.160
 (crowd laughs)

00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:05.160
 Agnes, don't be childish.

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:07.160
 Just get off your knees.

00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:09.160
 - What's that lot?

00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:11.160
 Then wait in.

00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:13.160
 I'm coming Henry.

00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:16.160
 Open your eyes. You're waiting the wrong way.

00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:19.160
 Oh, James, wait a minute.

00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:21.160
 You're giving me your hand, Agnes.

00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:23.160
 All right. Here.

00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:25.160
 Come on out.

00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:27.160
 Oh.

00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:29.160
 There.

00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:31.160
 Don't drip in the lunch basket.

00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:37.160
 Oh, I won't, Henry. I'll just squeeze my dress out a little here and there.

00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:44.160
 [audience laughter]

00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:46.160
 I'll be alright!

00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:50.160
 Now look Agnes, don't you think you want to go right straight home?

00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:53.160
 Oh no, this sounds awfully warm.

00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:57.160
 We can get in the canoe and I'll be jive by the time we get to the other side of the lake.

00:25:57.160 --> 00:25:58.160
 Where's Geraldine?

00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:00.160
 Oh, there she is! Look!

00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:03.160
 And I'm the lake with Erwin!

00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:04.160
 She was...

00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:06.160
 ...the Renekindo.

00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:09.160
 And they took my lunch basket.

00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:11.160
 Come on, come on, Henry.

00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:13.160
 Get in this canoe with me, huh?

00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:14.360
 Sure.

00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:16.160
 I'll get in.

00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:21.160
 Isn't this lucky you had this crimson pillow for me to sit on?

00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:22.160
 Yeah.

00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:26.160
 Say, did you know your hair has all come down?

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:29.160
 I let it down on purpose!

00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:34.660
 And me, you mind if I played its phonograph while I lean back in the sun?

00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:37.960
 Well, if you have to

00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:54.460
 As we lucky everything is ended up beautifully

00:26:54.460 --> 00:27:13.460
 [Music]

00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:17.460
 You know, ladies and gentlemen, when folks get to talking about favorite desserts,

00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:21.460
 there's one they never fail to mention, and that's "Butterscotch pry."

00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:27.060
 Yes, the butter scotch pie is a mighty swell treat, and it's marvellously easy and inexpensive

00:27:27.060 --> 00:27:30.980
 to make too when you make it with jello butter scotch pudding.

00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:35.460
 Because when you use jello butter scotch pudding for the filling, you do away with all guessing.

00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:40.820
 You save time and effort, and you make certain that every single pie will be a grand success.

00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:45.700
 Furthermore, this rich, taffy-colored pudding gives you a pie filling that's as creamy and

00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:48.180
 satin smooth as can be.

00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:53.180
 You'll be delighted with its golden butterscotch flavor, its zestful, satisfying goodness.

00:27:53.180 --> 00:27:56.180
 So furlough the lead of so many smart modern housewives.

00:27:56.180 --> 00:28:03.180
 Tomorrow night, treat the family to a luscious butterscotch pie made the easy way with jello butterscotch pudding.

00:28:03.180 --> 00:28:08.180
 Ask your grocer for several packages of this tasty dessert, but be sure to say jello butterscotch pudding.

00:28:08.180 --> 00:28:13.180
 Because only jello butterscotch pudding can give you such rich mellow enjoyment.

00:28:13.180 --> 00:28:16.160

00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:02.640
 I'm sorry mother, but I'm through with them forever.

00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:03.640
 Really, Henry?

00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:07.640
 I've never seen a girl yet that didn't turn out to be a disappointment.

00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:08.640
 Why?

00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:09.640
 I don't know.

00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:10.640
 I don't know.

00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:13.640
 Maybe I'm just hard to please.

00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:16.640
 Oh, could you put some more sunburned lotion on me?

00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:18.640
 I'll ask Mary to.

00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:20.640
 Don't let Mary get near me.

00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:23.640
 She'll put it right where my poison ivy is.

00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:32.640
 [Music]

00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:39.640
 The Aldrich family starring as the stone is written by Clifford Goldsmith, original music composed and conducted by Jack Miller.

00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:46.640
 Mrs. Harry Bonsell speaking and wishing you good night for the puddings that are tops in taste, jello puddings.

00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:49.800
