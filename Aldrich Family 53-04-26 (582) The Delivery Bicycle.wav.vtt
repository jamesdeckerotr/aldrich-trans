00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
 Now it's the Aldrich family on NBC.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.000
 [MUSIC]

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 Henry Aldrich, coming mother.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
 [APPLAUSE]

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
 Yes, it's the Aldrich family, it's transcribed, written by Clifford Goldsmith.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:41.000
 [Music]

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 The wonderful thing about the teenage time of your life

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
 is the fact that you can experience it twice.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 Once in your own growing up, and more or less continually thereafter,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 the misadventures of your own are your neighbors Henry Aldridge.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.300
 The scene opens in the Aldridge living room. The time this evening.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.300
 Sam, I don't think you're looking at this from Henry's point of view.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.800
 You're quite right, I'm not.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.200
 I'm looking at it from Mr. McCalls or whatever his name is point of view.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.100
 And if you'll remember Alice, I'd buy it, Henry, in the first place not to take that job,

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.800
 unless he was sure he could stick to it.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.600
 Well, dear, that's the whole point.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.700
 Henry isn't working tonight because he isn't supposed to work.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.600
 He's taking yellow note of the spring dance of the country club.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.000
 Yeah? Only what's all the fuss about.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.720
 Well, there isn't any fuss.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.720
 Mr. McCall, down at the drugstore, phoned a few minutes ago and wanted to know where the bicycle is.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:30.800
 A what?

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.680
 The bicycle Henry delivers packages on.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:34.920
 You mean he's lost it?

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.320
 No, no, Sam. Of course he hasn't.

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.680
 The bicycle is right out on the front porch.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:40.840
 Well, what's wrong with that?

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.400
 Well, nothing to hear.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.040
 Except that Henry didn't understand that he was to return it tonight.

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.480
 And don't you think Mr. McCall could be reasonable and let him bring it back tomorrow?

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.280
 Because there isn't any other way to get it back.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.880
 Is there?

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.680
 Alice, you...

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:03.520
 You want by any chance leading up to the suggestion that I take the bicycle back, are you?

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.520
 Why, dear, that hadn't even ended my head.

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.720
 Would you want to?

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.400
 I would not.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.160
 Can Alice, if his employer wants that bicycle, Henry should take it to him no matter how far it is?

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.240
 But, dear, do you think his employer realizes that Henry is only young once?

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.240
 And that this is one of the most important dances the club is having all season?

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.440
 No, I don't imagine he does.

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:28.840
 Do you?

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.340
 Do I want?

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.840
 Yes, I realize a boy is young only once,

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.640
 and a man reaches my age only once.

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.640
 And I'm going to sit in this chair and read this paper and not deliver any bicycle.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.040
 Mother, Mother, are you supposed to fix my necktie, please?

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.040
 No, Henry.

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.440
 Sit down on the arm of this chair while I straighten it.

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:48.440
 Okay.

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.140
 Did I just hear you and Father talking about Mr. McCall's bicycle?

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:52.140
 You did.

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.840
 Well, look, Father, be sure to remember this.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.440
 When you first push back on the break, your feet will go all the way around once, but the second time around you'll stop.

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.040
 [laughter]

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.240
 At least you'll usually stop.

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.240
 I won't stop at all.

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:07.240
 You won't?

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.440
 You mean Mother didn't have a chance to explain things to you?

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:14.740
 Henry, if I gave you the impression that I was going to ask your father to take that bicycle back for you,

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:17.380
 I'm afraid you misunderstood me.

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.820
 I'm going to ask Mary to do it.

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:20.700
 Mary?

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:21.820
 Mary isn't even here.

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:22.460
 Well, she will be.

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:23.740
 She'll be back any minute.

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:24.380
 Why, you sure?

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:27.180
 Because I feel very responsible for that bicycle.

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.100
 And onor.

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.820
 And the dance.

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.660
 Well, you haven't one thing to worry about.

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.460
 Now, you run upstairs and put your coat on.

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:33.260
 Yes, mother.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:33.760
 Sure.

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:34.820
 Thanks very much.

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:35.980
 Oh, Sam, did you see that?

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:36.900
 Did I see what?

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.460
 How can't she and you see his?

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:41.180
 Well, he wouldn't even put his coat on until I assured him

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.260
 that Mary would take care of the bicycle.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.620
 Alright, Alice, just so Mr. McCall gets it back tonight.

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.420
 You, Sam, you talk as though returning a bicycle

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.320
 with the most awful problem in the world.

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:52.720
 Mother!

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.360
 Oh, yes, Mary, I'm coming.

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.300
 My goodness, Mother, look at what I've just done

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.220
 to my brand-new stockings.

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.100
 Mary Orridge, how did you do that?

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:03.180
 I'm that old bicycle out on the front porch.

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.260
 And, Mother, I was planning to wear these stockings

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
 to the dance tonight.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.260
 Well, Mary, you didn't tell me you were going to the dance.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:11.380
 Well, Mother, don't you remember?

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.100
 I told you at breakfast this morning,

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:15.180
 and I'm late as it is.

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.020
 - Well, you mean you haven't timed two?

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.860
 - Two.

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:19.180
 - I haven't timed two what?

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.820
 - Nothing, dear.

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.420
 You're only young once, go on up and get your clothes changed.

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:27.180
 I've gotta put in a phone call.

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:28.380
 - Number please.

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:29.740
 - Elm 232.

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.860
 - Elm 232.

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.340
 - Mother, don't you think it'd be all right

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.340
 if I tell Henry he has to pay for these stockings?

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.700
 - Mary, Henry only earns 50 cents

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:40.660
 for a whole afternoon's work

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:43.020
 and those stockings cause 98.

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.420
 No, Mother, they cost a dollar fifteen.

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:48.220
 Well, that makes it worse, aren't you, shame?

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:49.820
 Hello, Mrs. Brown speaking.

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:51.420
 Oh, hello, Elizabeth. This is Alice.

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:52.520
 Is Homer there?

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.120
 Why, just a minute, Alice.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.620
 Homer, you're one of the kind of phones.

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:59.120
 Alice, why is it only way down, I want to ask you.

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.020
 Did you know about the Alice's party?

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:02.920
 The Alice's? Are they giving a party?

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:06.120
 Yes, dear. I understand they've invited scads of people.

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.220
 Really? When is it?

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:08.320
 It's tonight.

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:09.820
 Tonight, Elizabeth?

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:10.920
 Well, aren't you invited?

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:12.420
 No.

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:14.220
 You mean you want either?

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:15.620
 Well, no.

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:17.220
 No.

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:19.920
 Well, I guess you and I just aren't included.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:21.420
 Well, isn't that terrible?

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:23.320
 I'm not surprised about myself, Alice,

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.720
 but after all, you'll be entertained, the Alice.

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.820
 Well, that's the way things are, Elizabeth.

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:28.720
 You never know.

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:29.720
 Oh, just a minute, Alice.

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:30.520
 Here's Homer.

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:31.820
 Hello.

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:33.720
 Why can't you say hello, Mrs. Orange?

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.320
 I didn't know it was Mrs. Orbridge.

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:37.120
 Hello, Mrs. Orbridge.

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.120
 Hello, dear.

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:40.520
 Mother, could you be lacing my shoes?

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:42.320
 How are you, Mrs. Orbridge?

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:45.280
 Homer, how would you like to earn a little money?

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:47.280
 Some money? Boy.

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:50.680
 Well, it won't be very much, but it'll probably come in very handy.

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:53.080
 Okay, sure. When do you want me tomorrow morning?

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.360
 No, dear, tonight.

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:55.360
 Tonight?

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.600
 Yes, dear. You can do the whole thing tonight.

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.360
 Well, I'm not working tonight, Mrs. Orla.

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.520
 Do you want me to act in the country club?

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.520
 You're going to the dance?

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:07.800
 Well, are you sure you wouldn't like to do just one little errand?

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.440
 Oh, do you know I've got to save myself to dance?

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:14.440
 Well, I suppose you're only young once.

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:15.440
 What's that?

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:16.440
 Nothing, Homer.

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:17.440
 Goodbye, dear.

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:18.440
 Mother!

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:19.440
 Oh, come here, Henry.

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.440
 I'm afraid I have something I have to tell you.

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:22.440
 You have, Mother?

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:23.440
 Boy, how do I look?

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:24.440
 How do you like my hair this way, huh?

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:25.440
 Henry.

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:28.440
 I can't begin to tell you how much I appreciate you're fixing things up for me.

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:29.440
 Are you sure, Mary?

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:30.440
 I'll be back in time.

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:31.440
 Mary's already back.

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:32.440
 The only thing is...

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:35.440
 Boy, Mother, there isn't another guy in this town who has a mother that...

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:38.440
 You know what I mean?

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:41.440
 Henry, you don't have to hug me quite so tight.

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:42.440
 Oh.

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:43.440
 What was it you wanted to say to me?

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:44.440
 Why...

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:46.440
 Nothing, dear.

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:48.440
 You go right on and have a good time.

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:49.440
 Okay, good night, mother.

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.440
 Good night, and don't stay out late!

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:55.440
 Okay, and you explain to me how responsible I feel about that bicycle.

00:06:55.440 --> 00:07:07.440
 Well, hello there, Mrs. Aldrich.

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:11.040
 Don't tell me you're out wheeling a baby this time of night.

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:12.540
 Good evening Mrs. Hooper.

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:14.140
 No, this is a bicycle.

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:15.140
 A what?

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:16.640
 A delivery bicycle.

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:17.940
 It has a sidecar.

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:19.440
 Oh, yes.

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:23.240
 Well, I recognize your face, but I couldn't place the sidecar.

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:26.240
 [LAUGHTER]

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:29.740
 I'm just bringing it over here to Mr. McCall's drugstore.

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:31.740
 It was very good exercise.

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:35.840
 Yeah, something I can do for you, madam.

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:39.040
 - Why, yes. Are you Mr. McCall? - Yes, ma'am.

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:42.640
 - Well, I've just returned your bicycle for Henry Aldrich. - Oh, yes.

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:45.840
 Well, where is Henry? I got a couple packages for him to deliver.

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:48.840
 Tonight? Well, I didn't know he was supposed to...

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:53.440
 Why did you think I wanted the bicycle? I understood the boy was responsible.

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:55.640
 Mr. McCall, let me make one thing clear.

00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:58.640
 Henry feels most responsible about his work here.

00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:03.040
 Yeah. All right. Can you get him on the phone and tell him to come down here?

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:05.540
 I'm sorry, but he left the house before I did.

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:07.040
 Yeah, you assist him.

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:09.040
 The sister? Why, I'm his...

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:11.040
 Do I really?

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:15.040
 Yeah, look, I've got a new story here.

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:18.040
 And I am trying my best to please my customers.

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:21.040
 A couple orders come in and I promise them and then your brother lets me down.

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:23.040
 Now, what am I going to do?

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:26.040
 Well, Henry's going to be put in the position of...

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:29.040
 You mean I really look like...

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:32.040
 Where did the packages go?

00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:35.040
 You mean you take them out for me?

00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:36.040
 Well, I'll...

00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:40.040
 There's a dollar forty-two on this ice cream and ninety cents on this cough, man.

00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:43.040
 And look out for the break on the bicycle.

00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:46.040
 The bicycle? Oh, you don't mean I have to ride it?

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:47.040
 Do you?

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:50.040
 Ladies, you realize how far you have to take those packages?

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:53.040
 Oh, my goodness!

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:56.040
 Hello, McCall's Pharmacy.

00:08:56.040 --> 00:09:00.040
 This is Mrs. Allison. May I ask about my ice cream?

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:08.040
 This is who Mrs. Allison over on North Street and I have a whole dining room full of gas waiting for that ice cream you promised to send over.

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:12.040
 Yeah, oh yes Mrs. Allison the girl just left with it.

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:24.040
 Gee, I don't know if this sure is a swell dance.

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:26.040
 Boy am I having a good time.

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:29.040
 So am I Henry. I never had a better time in my life.

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:31.040
 - Hi Eleanor. - Hello Homer.

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:32.720
 Can I have the next dance with you?

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:35.120
 Oh I'm sorry, Homer, but I promised it to Henry.

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:38.360
 You have? Boy, am I having a bum time?

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:40.400
 - What's the matter, Homer? - Agnes, Agnes.

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:42.920
 You know what she did? She was so anxious to get here,

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:46.040
 she ran out of her front door and rolled right down the steps.

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:50.000
 So she had to go back and change her clothes all over again.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.040
 - Really? - I'll see you later, Homer.

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:56.960
 - Hello, Mary. - Mary? My sister?

00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:58.540
 Yes, there she is.

00:09:58.540 --> 00:09:59.540
 Was she coming here?

00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:00.540
 Hello, Eleanor.

00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:02.240
 Oh, Mary, do you have any trouble with that break?

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:03.040
 Well, what break?

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:04.820
 Well, didn't you notice how your foot flips off the pedal

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:06.340
 the first time?

00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:07.540
 My foot what?

00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:09.440
 Mary, don't you know the bicycle?

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:11.040
 I certainly do know about it.

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:12.040
 I tripped right over it.

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:14.740
 And you owe me a brand new pair of stalking.

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:15.540
 I do?

00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:17.740
 Just for taking it back to Mr. McCall?

00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:18.840
 For taking what back?

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:19.440
 The bicycle.

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:20.140
 The bicycle.

00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:21.040
 Didn't mother tell you?

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:24.040
 She didn't even mention it, Henry.

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:25.240
 Oh, boy.

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:26.540
 Henry, where are you going?

00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:27.540
 I'll be right back, Eleanor.

00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:29.880
 Just as soon as I get something straight now.

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:31.300
 Homer, hey Homer.

00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:32.140
 - What, Henry?

00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:33.860
 - As long as you're waiting around for Agnes.

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:36.100
 How would you like to earn 50 cents?

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:38.680
 (upbeat music)

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:47.520
 - Alice.

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:50.380
 Alice, are you upstairs?

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:51.820
 (phone ringing)

00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:52.660
 Alice.

00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:56.420
 Hello, Sam always speaking.

00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:58.320
 Sam, this is Alice.

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:00.420
 What's that Alice? When did you leave the house?

00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:03.220
 Why, you're quite a while ago, dear.

00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:06.220
 And dear, I hate to bother you when I know you're reading your papers,

00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:09.020
 but I'm afraid you'll have to come over and get me.

00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:09.820
 Get you?

00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:13.120
 Yes, I have a flat tire.

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:14.520
 You mean you took the car?

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:16.620
 Oh, no, dear. I am.

00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:18.220
 Well, I took...

00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:19.020
 Well...

00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:19.820
 You what?

00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:21.820
 And nothing, Sam. Just forget it.

00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:22.920
 Goodbye, dear.

00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:24.920
 Dennis, what are you talking about?

00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:26.920
 Alice, where are you?

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:38.920
 Hello, can you hear me, Mother?

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:43.920
 Yes, Humma, and I'm sorry, but your father says he absolutely won't help you out.

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:45.920
 But Mother doesn't he understand what's happened?

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:50.920
 Henry gave me 50 cents, provided I go over to his house and get a delivery bicycle he has

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:53.120
 and take it to McCall's drug store, see?

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:53.960
 - Yes.

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:55.480
 - And just after I took the 50 cents

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:56.720
 and bought some punch with it,

00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:58.360
 who do you think showed up?

00:11:58.360 --> 00:11:59.200
 - Who?

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:01.160
 - Agnes with a different dress on.

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:04.200
 And before she'd even dash, she had to have some punch.

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:06.440
 Boy, she went right through 20 cents.

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:07.360
 (audience laughs)

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:08.560
 And I wondered where the father

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:10.840
 wouldn't be willing to deliver that bicycle for me.

00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:13.400
 Provided I'd give him part of next week's allowance.

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:15.760
 - You're afraid Agnes will be hurt if you leave.

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:17.680
 - Well sure, wouldn't you be?

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:20.440
 - Well, do you know, I'll have a talk with your father.

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:22.740
 Only he has his shoes off and you know what that means.

00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:24.740
 But mother, you know how to handle him.

00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:27.180
 She was all you have to do is talk to him the way you do

00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:29.180
 and you can get him into his shoes.

00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:30.180
 [LAUGHTER]

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:31.620
 Don't worry.

00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:33.300
 You go on when you're dancing.

00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:35.300
 After all, you're only young one.

00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:37.300
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:48.860
 Get over on your own side of the street.

00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:52.540
 Suppose you get over on your side, you big...

00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:57.180
 Alice, oh, could you set you on that machine?

00:12:57.180 --> 00:12:58.180
 Harriet!

00:12:58.180 --> 00:12:58.940
 Aah!

00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:00.220
 Look out, I'll run over you.

00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:02.180
 What's the matter, can't you stop?

00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:04.700
 Not the first time I back up my seat!

00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:09.300
 There.

00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:10.940
 Now help me off.

00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:14.580
 Alice, Colbridge, may I ask what you're doing?

00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:16.540
 Harriet, you're just the person I want to see.

00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:20.040
 Could you take this package of ice cream into the Allison's house here?

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:21.740
 What are you doing?

00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:23.320
 Delivering packages.

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:24.640
 Packages?

00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:25.740
 For the poor?

00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:27.940
 Harriet.

00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:33.040
 The Allysons are giving a party in there, and I have got their ice cream, and I haven't been invited.

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:33.840
 And...

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:35.740
 Well, so you'll just have to take it in for me.

00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:38.740
 But, Allison, I'm late for a bridge party over at the Anderson's.

00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:40.340
 But don't you understand?

00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:42.940
 Dress the way I am. I can't go into the Allysons.

00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:46.640
 Frankly, you're the canines and only think I'm trying to crash their party.

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:53.340
 Now, Harriet, do you remember on your 13th birthday when you were too bashful to ask Bill Townsend to your party

00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:58.940
 and I did it for you and you swore you'd do anything in the world for me any time I asked you?

00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:00.240
 No.

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:03.240
 Harriet, you did not?

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:05.640
 Well, anyway, you're going right over by Maple Street.

00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:08.640
 Could you at least leave this bottle of course here at the 227?

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:09.940
 Who is it important?

00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:10.940
 It's very important.

00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:13.500
 And you see, Mr. McCall just started a new drugstore,

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:15.340
 and Henry's trying to help him out.

00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:16.940
 Well, all right.

00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:18.860
 And Alice, if you don't want to see the Alice's,

00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:21.260
 why don't you just leave the ice cream on the front porch,

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:22.580
 ring the bell, and run?

00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:24.860
 Because there's $1.40 on it.

00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:27.900
 Oh, and there's $0.90 on the coalf syrup.

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:30.220
 And don't lose it in the bridge game.

00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:33.660
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:36.240
 (upbeat music)

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:46.500
 - Hello, my car's pharmacy.

00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:49.320
 - Oh, lady, I sent that call, sir,

00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:50.780
 about nearly 40 minutes ago.

00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:52.720
 I've got a new delivery girl, see?

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:54.080
 And she is.

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:55.440
 - What?

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:56.760
 What's that?

00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:59.400
 - Oh, yes, well, when the girl gets there,

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:01.680
 you give her the other bottle you want refill,

00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:03.940
 and tell her to bring it back here.

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:04.880
 (laughs)

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:07.040
 Forget it, no trouble at all.

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:08.380
 Come by.

00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:09.220
 - Good evening.

00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:10.880
 - Yo, hey, hey, yes, good evening,

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:12.080
 something I can do for you.

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:13.980
 - Well, could you tell me,

00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:16.180
 have you seen my wife this evening?

00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:17.520
 - Your wife.

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:19.920
 - Isn't this where Henry Aldrich works?

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:22.320
 - This is where he's supposed to work.

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:23.300
 - Well, what I mean is,

00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:25.800
 did my wife bring a bicycle down here?

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:28.200
 - Oh, you, Henry's brother-in-law, how do you do?

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:29.600
 (audience laughs)

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:30.440
 - I beg your pardon?

00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:33.000
 I don't want to complain about your wife, sir,

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.840
 but I sent her out with some packages nearly an hour ago.

00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:36.560
 Some packages?

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:38.400
 And I've got some more for her to take out,

00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:40.360
 and she hasn't come back yet.

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:42.600
 You mean, Alice, by wife?

00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:45.160
 And what I want to know is what you're

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:46.760
 going to do about it.

00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:48.240
 What I'm going to do about it--

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:50.680
 I thought your family was the kind that could be relied on.

00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:52.480
 We are the kind that can be relied on.

00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:54.000
 That's why we're helping you out.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.080
 What do you mean by we?

00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:57.520
 I haven't seen you do anything yet.

00:15:57.520 --> 00:15:58.200
 What, sir?

00:15:58.200 --> 00:15:59.600
 Listen, I'm going out and delivering

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:00.940
 a couple of these orders myself.

00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:02.680
 You stay here and take care of the store.

00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:03.520
 - What's that?

00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:05.880
 - And if there's anything you can't find just that.

00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:08.340
 - That's, that's cool.

00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:10.920
 (upbeat music)

00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:19.840
 - Eleanor, do you mind if I suggest something?

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:20.680
 - What Henry?

00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:22.440
 - Well let's hit this next dance out.

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:23.280
 - All right.

00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:24.120
 - As a matter of fact,

00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:25.320
 let's go out in the porch and get some air.

00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:26.160
 - All right.

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:29.320
 - Boy, do I feel good.

00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:32.480
 Ever since I got home we're lined up to take that bicycle back for me.

00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:34.560
 It just goes to show.

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:36.800
 What goes to show?

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:40.040
 I mean, you've got a job, see, and you're conscientious about it.

00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:40.800
 It pays.

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:43.120
 Now I was just talking to Mr. Scott a few minutes ago

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:45.560
 and he asked me whether I wouldn't like a job working for him.

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:46.520
 Really?

00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:48.720
 Provided I can give him some good references.

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:50.440
 Gee, I wouldn't hesitate a minute,

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:52.120
 ask you Mr. McCall for one.

00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:54.320
 Henry, isn't that Agnes Lawson?

00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:55.000
 Where?

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.800
 At the end of the porch there in the moonlight.

00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:00.520
 You know who you suppose that boy is.

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:02.180
 Hey, let's walk down and see.

00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:03.360
 Wait until I tell Homer.

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:06.120
 Just wait until I tell Homer.

00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:08.920
 Now listen, Hannah, you keep away from here.

00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:09.920
 Homer, is that you?

00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:10.600
 Come on, Max.

00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:11.680
 Let's get away from her.

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:13.840
 Yeah, but then Homer, how about my bicycle?

00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:16.640
 And don't you realize my whole reputation's at stake?

00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:18.640
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:20.640
 [APPLAUSE]

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:28.640
 [applause]

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:31.640
 We'll return to the Aldrich family in just a moment.

00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:33.640
 Tonight, Theatre Guild on the air

00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:37.640
 raises the curtain again on another fine dramatic presentation.

00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:42.640
 George Orwell's 1984 starring Richard Whitmark.

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:45.640
 This is another performance by some of the superb actors

00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:49.640
 Theatre Guild has teamed up with the outstanding plays of the past and present.

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:56.640
 Of course, no Sunday would be complete without a visit to those two happy householders, Phil Harris and Alice Fay.

00:17:56.640 --> 00:18:04.640
 This curly-headed wonder of the airwaves can usually get himself involved in something that requires Alice's talented hand to unravel.

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:12.640
 And then your two regular NBC thrillers, Dragnet and Barry Craig, confidential investigator, come along next.

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:17.640
 Barry, played by William Gargon, clears up a real thrilling mystery.

00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:24.640
 While Dragnet with Jack Webb as Sergeant Joe Friday offers another case history from the files of the Los Angeles police.

00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:30.640
 So for the tops in radio entertainment, stay tuned to NBC.

00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:47.640
 [Music]

00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:50.640
 Now getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldridge.

00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:53.640
 Because she's decided her son is young only once,

00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:56.640
 Mrs. Aldridge has consented to run an errand for Henry

00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:59.640
 in order that he may go to the country club dance.

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:02.140
 The scene opens in the Aldrich front hall.

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:04.340
 Homer Brown's father is on the phone.

00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:06.640
 Hello, hello, hello.

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:08.640
 Hello, Mrs. Brown speaking.

00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:09.640
 Elizabeth, this is Will.

00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:10.640
 Who?

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:11.640
 Will, your husband.

00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:14.140
 I can't find that bicycle of Henry's.

00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:15.640
 Oh, did you look all over there, your aunt?

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:19.140
 I walked into every tree out there and there's still no sign of it.

00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:21.140
 Well, where are you now?

00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:22.640
 I'm in the Aldrich front hall.

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:26.140
 And Elizabeth, I'm in my house slippers and I'm standing in water.

00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:27.140
 In water?

00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:31.140
 Well, I can't be responsible if they aren't more careful where they put their faces of flowers.

00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:33.140
 [audience laughter]

00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:35.140
 Well, me, you just got to find that bicycle.

00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:39.140
 Always says Henry was very much concerned about it being taken back.

00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:43.140
 And he won't enjoy the dance one bit if he knows who fallen down on him.

00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:45.140
 Well, I'll give him ten more minutes, and then I quit. Goodbye.

00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:46.140
 Bye.

00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:47.140
 [door opens]

00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:48.140

00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:49.140

00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:50.140

00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:51.140

00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:52.140
 [door opens]

00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:54.140
 Hold your heart here!

00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:55.140
 [door opens]

00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:56.140
 Hello.

00:19:56.140 --> 00:19:58.940
 - And what was this you, Father? - Homer, where are you?

00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:02.340
 - This isn't Homer, it's Henry. - Oh, it is. Well, there's Mr. Brown.

00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:05.940
 Mr. Brown, she was hot. I get the wrong number. Goodbye, Father.

00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:08.340
 - I mean, goodbye. - Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Where's your bicycle?

00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:10.340
 Hello? Hello?

00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:24.740
 Excuse me, but could you give me some information?

00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:26.140
 What is it you'd like to know, lady?

00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:30.240
 Well, have you any idea where number 227 Maple Street would be?

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:32.440
 Let's see now. Isn't it this house right here?

00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:35.540
 No, I was just in there and they haven't had a cold all year.

00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:36.640
 What's that?

00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:42.740
 227 Maple Street ordered this cough syrup and I'd like to get rid of it so I can go to a bridge party.

00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:43.940
 How about the house next door?

00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:47.840
 Oh, I tried that one too. They said they don't think there is any 227.

00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:49.240
 Let's see the address on your pack.

00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:50.240
 Here you are.

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:52.140
 That's 227, all right.

00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:53.840
 Or 277.

00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:56.440
 - Is what? - And that certainly says maple.

00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:57.480
 Or is it marble?

00:20:57.480 --> 00:20:59.040
 Marble Street!

00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:01.640
 Don't get discouraged, lady. You're on the right track.

00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:13.720
 Now then, I'm sorry to keep you waiting, lady.

00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:15.280
 Is there something I can do for you?

00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:17.720
 Yes, sir. I'd like a chocolate swab.

00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:22.040
 A chocolate swab?

00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:24.280
 - Prostance. - Oh.

00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:25.800
 That's something to drink, isn't it?

00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:29.440
 - Certainly is. It's made with chocolate syrup, milk, and ice cream.

00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:33.400
 - Yes, and that's all? - Yes, and then you put in that mixer.

00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:35.240
 - Here's what that sounds easy, enough.

00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:37.800
 Now then, lady, we'll get a glass.

00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:41.560
 Ah, here we are. - Oh, isn't that a Sunday dish?

00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:44.800
 - Oh, I see. You want a big drink? - That's right.

00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:48.480
 - Well, now, here, how's this size?

00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:51.120
 - Oh, my goodness. Do I get one that thick?

00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:52.880
 I think this is a drinking glass.

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:55.120
 Couldn't be just an ornament, good, eh?

00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:56.600
 [LAUGHTER]

00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:57.520
 Now then, let's see.

00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:01.080
 I guess the logical thing would be to start with the chocolate.

00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:02.880
 Chocolate.

00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:05.040
 Chocolate.

00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:06.600
 You would miss it in strawberry, would you?

00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:08.160
 No, I don't.

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:10.120
 I got strawberry right here.

00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:11.520
 A lemon?

00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:12.880
 That's parilla.

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:15.880
 Maybe they keep the chocolate in one of these bowls.

00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:18.200
 No, that's the cherries.

00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:20.080
 Don't you like to have me throw a cherry in?

00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:22.640
 No, thank you. How about that other bowl?

00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:23.540
 This one?

00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:26.000
 Yes, that's a good one.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.320
 Well, I never saw anything like that before. It's sort of a lather.

00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:32.680
 Isn't that whipped cream?

00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:39.320
 Oh, so it is. It's been a long time since I've seen any whipped cream.

00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:42.720
 We're both wrong. It's mayonnaise.

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:43.920
 That chocolate right here.

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:46.880
 Oh, yes. Good for you, lady.

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:49.880
 Well, here we go.

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:52.140
 (barking)

00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:56.680
 - My goodness, this is not quite a lot of chocolate.

00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:58.880
 Are you gonna have room for the milk?

00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:00.600
 - And if we don't, we'll get another glass

00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:01.920
 and I'll drink part of it.

00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:03.160
 (audience laughing)

00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:05.640
 - Have you ever done this before?

00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:08.400
 - Not as a general rule.

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:10.000
 Actually, I'm a lawyer.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.000
 - Oh, and you have to take this job night.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.880
 (audience laughing)

00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:17.800
 - Well, I have to take it tonight, anyhow.

00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:18.920
 Now then, let's see.

00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:20.000
 Here's the ice cream.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.400
 I wonder what they take it out with.

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:23.840
 Wasn't there a scoop?

00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:27.200
 No, and I certainly don't want to use my hand.

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:28.840
 My goodness, no.

00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:30.160
 Oh, here's the scoop right here.

00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:31.840
 Is that vanilla?

00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:32.720
 Oh, yes.

00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:35.840
 You can't fool me on vanilla.

00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:39.760
 Well, the ice cream won't come out of the scoop.

00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:42.000
 Well, all you have to do is squeeze that little jigger

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:43.200
 and it drops right out.

00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:45.440
 Yes, I realize that.

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:51.120
 But for some reason, for some reason, would you excuse me a minute

00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:54.280
 while I go out and back and see whether I can find a screwdriver?

00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:56.760
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:59.760
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:08.320
 Good evening.

00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:09.000
 Good evening.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.600
 Are you Mrs. Allison's maid?

00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:11.920
 I am.

00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:13.960
 Don't tell me that's our ice cream.

00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:14.840
 I'm afraid it is.

00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:16.340
 I was a little delayed on the way.

00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:17.600
 You were delayed?

00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:19.560
 Well, isn't that you I saw standing right out

00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:21.920
 in front of the house for the last 15 minutes?

00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:22.680
 Yes.

00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:25.560
 I was trying to get some boy to--

00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:26.640
 that is, I'm sorry.

00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:28.360
 But here's your ice cream if you don't want it,

00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:29.240
 you don't have to take it.

00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:30.240
 Thank you.

00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:32.040
 And there's $1.40 due on it.

00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:33.040
 All right.

00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:34.440
 Now wait right out there.

00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:37.280
 That's just what I intend to do.

00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:38.040
 Oh, Amy.

00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:38.960
 Yes, Mrs. Dallas.

00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:39.960
 And he's finally here.

00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:42.720
 And they want to collect $1.40.

00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:43.760
 All right.

00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:45.600
 Tell a boy I'll be right out and pay him.

00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:47.160
 It isn't a boy, it's a girl.

00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:47.960
 A girl?

00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:49.600
 Yes, ma'am.

00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:53.140
 Now then, young woman, here's your $1.40 and $0.10

00:24:53.140 --> 00:24:54.080
 for yourself.

00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:55.760
 Although you've been so long getting here,

00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:57.680
 you certainly don't--

00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:00.680
 Oh, my goodness, is that you, Mrs. Aldrich?

00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:02.560
 No, oh, yes, yes.

00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:03.960
 Good evening, Mrs. Allison.

00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:06.680
 Where's the young woman I'm supposed to give this to?

00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:07.600
 The young woman?

00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:09.120
 The one who brought the ice cream.

00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:09.960
 What did she do?

00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:11.440
 Going back to the store?

00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:13.840
 Well, I... Well, yes, yes.

00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:14.960
 Yes, I guess you must have.

00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:17.080
 I'm so glad you decided to come.

00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:18.440
 Where's Mr. Aldridge?

00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:19.280
 Well, come in.

00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:20.920
 Oh, no, I couldn't think of coming in.

00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:22.840
 Why not? We'd love to have you.

00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:24.760
 You're just in time for ice cream.

00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:25.960
 No, thanks, Mrs. Allison.

00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:28.560
 As a matter of fact, I don't know why I came over at all.

00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:30.280
 Was there something you wanted, dear?

00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:32.080
 Oh, no, no, just forget the whole thing.

00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:32.920
 Goodbye.

00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:33.760
 Goodbye.

00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:36.600
 (loud clattering)

00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:37.600
 My goodness.

00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:39.360
 Did you hurt yourself, Mrs. Aldridge?

00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:41.400
 No, no, I just fell over my bicycle.

00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:44.400
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:53.120
 Say, isn't anybody in charge of this store?

00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:55.040
 Of course, just went around and back again.

00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:56.000
 Oh, yeah?

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:57.440
 He's been mixing in your chocolate

00:25:57.440 --> 00:25:59.480
 frosted for the last half hour.

00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:00.920
 You ran into the little trouble.

00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:01.760
 Oh.

00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:03.160
 Mr. McColl, hello there.

00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:04.240
 I'll be right out.

00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:05.080
 Only half a minute.

00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:06.400
 I've got to get back home.

00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:07.800
 Now, then, what can I do for you?

00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:09.000
 But here's what I want to ask.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.640
 That bicycle.

00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:12.320
 Sam Ulrich.

00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:13.360
 Hello, well, Brown.

00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:14.760
 What are you doing in that apron?

00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:18.160
 Why, Sam, I can't find Henry's bicycle anywhere.

00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:19.000
 Where is it?

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.000
 Oh, that's all right, Alice, has it?

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:22.560
 Alice has it.

00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:23.680
 She's out delivering.

00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:25.440
 She's what?

00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:27.600
 Listen, Sam, have you bought this drug store?

00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:30.280
 Mr. McCall, Mr. McCall.

00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:32.920
 Oh, my Sam Ulrich.

00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:34.320
 Harriet, where did you come from?

00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:36.720
 Sam, I finally found 227 Maple Street.

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:38.840
 But the lady says I can't have my 90 cents

00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:41.440
 until I get this bottle filled for them.

00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:42.280
 - What's it for?

00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:45.880
 - I don't know, but I've got a bridge game waiting.

00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:48.400
 - For just a minute, Harry.

00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:50.320
 Hello, McCall's pharmacy, good evening.

00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:51.720
 - Oh, Mr. McCall, this is Henry.

00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:52.560
 - This is who?

00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:55.680
 - Henry, all but remember, I've called up the Say I resign.

00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:57.680
 - Henry, this is your father.

00:26:57.680 --> 00:26:58.720
 - Is that your father?

00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:01.160
 He was how to get the wrong number, goodbye.

00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:04.520
 - Henry, Henry.

00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:06.920
 - What is that, Mike, last in chocolate?

00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:09.220
 Just a minute, lady. I'll be right with you.

00:27:09.220 --> 00:27:11.620
 Here, we'll get behind the counter here and give me a hand.

00:27:11.620 --> 00:27:12.620
 Who? What?

00:27:12.620 --> 00:27:13.620
 Mr. McCall.

00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:14.620
 Mr. McCall.

00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:15.620
 Is that you, Alice?

00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:16.620
 What?

00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:17.620
 Sam Paul, Richard.

00:27:17.620 --> 00:27:20.120
 How did you have to leave the house in the dirty apron?

00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:25.020
 You want me to get chocolate all over my suit?

00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:27.320
 Dear, if you've got a dollar for me because if you have,

00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:30.020
 give it to Mr. McCall right away because I'm quitting.

00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:31.020
 You're what?

00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:34.420
 Hello, McCall's pharmacy. Good evening.

00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:35.420
 Is this McCall?

00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:36.420
 It is.

00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:40.020
 - Mr. McCall. - Henry, don't you know your own father when he speaks to you?

00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:43.020
 Listen, Father. I thought you said this was McCall.

00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:45.420
 How do I keep getting the wrong number? Goodbye.

00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:48.020
 Henry! Wait!

00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:49.420
 Yes, Father, do you want me?

00:27:49.420 --> 00:27:51.020
 Why are you quitting your job down here?

00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:52.820
 Because I've got a swell one with Mr. Scott.

00:27:52.820 --> 00:27:55.820
 - Doing what? - Oh, it's nice outdoor work mixing cement.

00:27:55.820 --> 00:27:57.620
 Don't you think mother would want me to thank you?

00:27:57.620 --> 00:28:00.820
 Henry, you're not getting your mother mixed up in any cement.

00:28:00.820 --> 00:28:13.660
 [applause]

00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:18.060
 The years of World War II are beginning to fade in many memories in America.

00:28:18.060 --> 00:28:24.460
 Children are growing up who don't remember the names that made the rest of a shutter like Pearl Harbor, Iwo Jima, Anzio.

00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:26.820
 It's easy to forget over here.

00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:29.900
 But in Europe, the scars of World War II are still raw.

00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:31.460
 Hunger still stalks the land.

00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:35.160
 Children are starving, and old people are dying from malnutrition.

00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:39.180
 There is one organization that helps in the battle against the war-born hunger,

00:28:39.180 --> 00:28:41.440
 Care, C-A-R-E.

00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:46.900
 Care prepares scientifically selected and packed food parcels for distribution overseas.

00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:52.200
 Delivery is guaranteed, and mass purchasing and planning provides the greatest economy.

00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:55.980
 Care is the best way to send parcels to relatives of friends abroad.

00:28:55.980 --> 00:28:59.540
 For those who wish to help care, select families abroad to receive

00:28:59.540 --> 00:29:02.340
 parcels donated for anonymous recipients.

00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:05.620
 If you want to aid the fight against Tonga, send your dollars and

00:29:05.620 --> 00:29:08.420
 dimes to Care, New York.

00:29:08.420 --> 00:29:12.700
 And if you have people in the war-torn lands, remember, show them

00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:14.860
 you care through care.
