00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 Some weeks ago our listeners were made acquainted with young Ezra Stone.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 Meeting member of the cast of the judge have a comedy success, thought of life,

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 and a scene from that play.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,800
 The occasion was pleasant. Some joy in fact that we commissioned Kevin Dole Smith, author of What A Life,

6
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:43,200
 to ride a new sketch based on the same patterns. Chief of which is Henry Aldrich, age 17, and constantly in hot water.

7
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:50,400
 Your head was out now with Lea Pemun, Betty Field, and Clyde Fillmore supporting Mr. Stone.

8
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:55,400
 as a stone in the early life of Henry Aldrich.

00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:14,400
 The time 7.30 in the morning, the place the Aldrich home, located in any American town.

11
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,000
 As our coven rises, Henry, son of the house,

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 is apparently on the wrong side of a door,

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,400
 as he greets the day with a mean determinant song.

 [SINGING]

17
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,400
 Yes, Father?

18
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,400
 How much longer do you want to be in that bathroom?

19
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,400
 I'm practically small now.

20
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,400
 Oh, don't say so.

21
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:47,440
 I'm the case of none of the other members of this family kid who was what's that father nothing just hurry up and get out of there

22
00:01:47,440 --> 00:02:02,520
 Not bothered me

23
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,760
 Yeah, well, oh go away

24
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,520
 I didn't even know when Harriet was here.

25
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,520
 Well, she is.

26
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,520
 You arrived in the night.

27
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,520
 Well, well, well.

28
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,520
 I have a no parent to be here.

29
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,520
 That is a no parent to be here.

30
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:21,520
 That is a no parent to be here.

31
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,520
 That is a no parent to be here.

32
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,520
 That is a no parent to be here.

33
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,520
 That is a no parent to be here.

34
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,520
 That is a no parent to be here.

35
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,520
 That is a no parent to be here.

36
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,520
 That is a no parent to be here.

37
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,520
 That is a no parent to be here.

38
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,520
 What do you want?

39
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:41,020
 Honey, my vanishing cream is right there on the glass shelf.

40
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:44,020
 There is an enigmatic vanishing cream on the glass shelf.

41
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:46,020
 Evidently, it must have vanished.

42
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,020
 [LAUGHTER]

43
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:50,020
 It isn't 8 o'clock yet, while I be saying by 9.

44
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,020
 [LAUGHTER]

45
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:53,020
 I can tell you one thing you'll be saying,

46
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,520
 if you're not afraid, I can get out of there.

47
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:57,520
 Dad, please, I can give you my vanishing cream.

48
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,520
 [LAUGHTER]

49
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,520
 There it is.

50
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,020
 My gosh.

51
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,520
 You're welcome.

52
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,020
 Mary?

53
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,020
 Yes, Mother?

54
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:07,420
 Did I hear him the order come out of that bathroom?

55
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:10,420
 You did, but he went back in again.

56
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:12,820
 He just came out to see what months it was.

57
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,420
 [LAUGHTER]

58
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:16,720
 When he comes out, he'll hear him all over the scene.

59
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,620
 He made a clothing you were asking what he gave to the car

60
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:21,620
 to the electric toaster.

61
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:22,620
 Henry?

62
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:25,620
 Well, he wants to know what he did with the car to the toaster.

63
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,220
 Ask him to watch the toaster.

64
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:30,220
 So the only toaster we had.

65
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:33,520
 He took the car down in the basement for something last night.

66
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,360
 What's that?

67
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,200
 Henry!

68
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,720
 What did you do with the cord?

69
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,480
 I didn't do anything with it!

70
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,880
 I can fix it!

71
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,540
 I think...

72
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:41,540
 You think?

73
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:44,440
 That's a pretty picture!

74
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,280
 We can't wash our own bathroom!

75
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,480
 And we can't even have toast for breakfast!

76
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,760
 We might all be living in a restaurant!

77
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,720
 Shaggy!

78
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,680
 Now watch, sweetheart!

79
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,040
 Please hand me some of my facial tissues!

80
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,240
 You're hand me this!

81
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,200
 Hand me that!

82
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,480
 No wonder I can't get anything done!

83
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,480
 What do you think I do work here?

84
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:08,480
 If you ever do any work, it'll have to be in there.

85
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,480
 After all, if you want to take possession of that, please, you've got to take some of the responsibility to go with it.

86
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:17,480
 Listen, I'll give you your face and watch him of course, if you'll go get me my neck tie.

87
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:21,480
 So, that's what you've been doing in there. You're dressing!

88
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:24,480
 Father, please get him out of there!

89
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,480
 Just how would you go about it?

90
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,480
 I don't know, but it must be some way.

91
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,480
 You should talk.

92
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:32,480
 You watch everything you want in here three times a day.

93
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,480
 [laughter]

94
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:38,480
 And if I want to watch no more than my right hand,

95
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:41,480
 the whole family jumps on me.

96
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:44,480
 Anybody thinks that anybody else under this fair point

97
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,480
 was committing a major offense.

98
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,480
 [squeaking]

99
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,480
 Say you're right. What'd you do? Get your left hand with?

100
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,480
 Is that so?

101
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:55,480
 Here, look out. I want to speak to you.

102
00:04:55,480 --> 00:05:06,720
 I'm calling you for. Why did this entirely aside from the issue? What did you do with

103
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,560
 a lawnmower when you finished with it yesterday? I didn't do anything with it. I put it right

104
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,120
 back in the garage. I see. Yes sir.

105
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:21,560
 I'm calling you for you. Henry Alvarish. Yes, Father. The next time I'm speaking to you,

106
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,560
 I'm sorry, I thought you were finished.

107
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:28,560
 Supposing you look at the bathroom window and see what you see the same thing I just saw.

108
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,560
 Out the bathroom window?

109
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,560
 You're in the bathroom, aren't you?

110
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,560
 Yes.

111
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,560
 Holy gee.

112
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,560
 Why don't you think I'm the one that left that out there?

113
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,560
 No.

114
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,560
 A point of the lawn.

115
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,560
 I got up in the middle of the night and went out there under its own power.

116
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,560
 You don't think you could have left it out there, do you, Father?

117
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,560
 I could have left it out there.

118
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:53,120
 I could have left it out there and they just paid two dollars and a half to have that machine started.

119
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,040
 Did that guy charge two dollars and a half of a lousy job he did?

120
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:00,440
 Well, I too thought leaving it out in the rain would improve what he did.

121
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,200
 Oh, I'll pay for it.

122
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,280
 I'll have what?

123
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,360
 If you've got any money coming, suppose that you pay me with your own me.

124
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,160
 Sure.

125
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,240
 That's a nice way to start the day.

126
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:14,000
 Go around reminding everybody of the death failure, even before they're watched.

127
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,360
 Well, if I remember correctly, your hands were in any too clean when you asked to borrow that money

128
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:23,960
 from me. Mary, is Henry still working you live? I don't know whether he's still

129
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:28,560
 watching or not but he's certainly still in there. I'm practically thrown now.

130
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,820
 Henry, yes, ma'am. When you took that call down to the basement last night's

131
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:36,960
 thoughts, did you do with it? What do you mean why I do with it? Whatever it was,

132
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:41,160
 you paid for it. I want to know how the excuse of the elliptic I thought happened

133
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:46,560
 to be burned out. Holy Jesus, that's not flash one.

134
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,560
 Then you do know something about it.

135
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,560
 Is this the only place where that has of importance can be discussed?

136
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:55,560
 After all, I am supposed to go downtown sometime this morning

137
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,560
 When I arrive at the office I would at least like to have my hair combed.

138
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,560
 Would you like to have these subjects come under the door, John?

139
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:05,560
 Yes, please do. I can make my apartment out in the hallway.

140
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:09,560
 Did he say he did want me to or he didn't want me to?

141
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:14,560
 You wait young man until you're taught to learn to be unched back to the stand of all night.

142
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:21,880
 Yeah, hmm, the guy in shoes was really warm and the cream of his coffee has sour. You are the sour cream in my car

143
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:27,540
 And we all we can come out of that bathroom and run over the car and get your father some cream

144
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:33,280
 What condition you're in you come out of there? I got to do something about this

145
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:42,480
 I am oh father you back of course. I'm back. Have you finally finished?

146
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:45,880
 Just the old homesteader, or that he's grown too interested

147
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,980
 since he went in there.

148
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:48,480
 - Maria, there he is!

149
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,480
 - Uh, could I have some money, Father?

150
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,780
 What are we going to do, Charge?

151
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:54,280
 You mean we're going to that bathroom?

152
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,280
 (audience laughs)

153
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:01,480
 I've got to have enough money to get a bottle of cream before.

154
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:04,180
 - Something happened to the ice box last night,

155
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:07,080
 but you haven't any idea what the trouble was.

156
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,080
 - Sure.

157
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,480
 - Well, I guess it was my fault, Father,

158
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,580
 and I shouldn't you pay for the cream out of your own money.

159
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:14,020
 Well, I guess I should.

160
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:16,580
 Could you pay me that 75 cents,

161
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:19,260
 you owe me for carrying out the ashes last winter?

162
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:20,100
 Mary.

163
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,620
 - I won't be but a minute, Father.

164
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,420
 - Can you imagine that?

165
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,900
 Now respect it all.

166
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:29,060
 - Henry, you left your Roman history book in here.

167
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:30,900
 - Well, don't lose my place.

168
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,900
 (audience laughing)

169
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:39,540
 And another thing, Henry,

170
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:40,940
 I hope that one of these days

171
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:44,620
 assume a few responsibilities after all when you take the card of the toaster

172
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:47,780
 downstairs we're ready not to bring it back up when you're through with it I

173
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:51,860
 thought I did you thought you did I suppose you thought the icebox would run

174
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:56,740
 with a fuse blown out I suppose you thought that the one more you know what

175
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:01,580
 you did last night you put the code of the toaster on the flash I am and then

176
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:06,220

177
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:10,860
 the blame for it haven't you started wet Henry I'm just starting now but I

178
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,860
 I asked the father to take a look out the back window.

179
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:15,860
 I wonder whether he realizes he left the lawn mower out all night.

180
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:17,860
 When did I leave the lawn mower out all night?

181
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,860
 Oh, when did you see?

182
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,860
 I saw you go round to the garage myself and get it out right out the window.

183
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,860
 I've explained if I didn't.

184
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:27,860
 Could I keep the change to this dollar phone?

185
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:28,860

186
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:29,860

 Where'd you put this out?

188
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,860
 I didn't put it anyplace.

189
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:34,860
 There wasn't any soap.

190
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:37,860
 That's a terrible little dixie.
