3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 Jell-O everybody, the Jell-O family of desserts presents...

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
 Henry Henry O'Rourke!

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 Coming, Mother!

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 [Applause]

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 Yes, it's the O'Rourke family based on parages originated by Clifford Goldsmith

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 and starring Ezra Stone as Henry O'Rourke with Jackie Pelt as Homie.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 And yes, it's the Jello family. Oh, the Big Red Letter stand for the Jello family. Oh, the Big Red Letter stand for the Jello family. That's Jello, yum yum yum. Jello please. Yum yum yum. Jello, tap. Be out the pudding, yes, sorry. And now for the Aldridge family.

 [Music]

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 One of the things you remember best after you've grown up is the number of the house and the name of the street where you spent your teenage.

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 And no doubt it was something like 117L street where Henry Aldrich lives.

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 It is early morning and the scene opens in the Aldrich kitchen.

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 Sam!

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 I miss the base, Madalis.

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 I know, dear, and could you please shovel a coal a little more quietly?

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 You'll wake the kilners next door.

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 Alice, coal is not something you can shovel quietly.

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 Well, please try. It's just a quarter to six.

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 Mary, are Henry's pancakes done?

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 Dear, open your eyes before you stumble and fall into the skillet.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 Yes, mother. My goodness, I can't see why Henry had to force us all out of bed in the middle of the night

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,360
 the night simply because he has to go to work.

24
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,880
 - Dear, he didn't force us, we volunteered.

25
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,120
 - Who did I did?

26
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:53,960
 - Yes, dear.

27
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,560
 - Mother, I couldn't have.

28
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,440
 That's one thing Kermit impressed on me

29
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,000
 after he got out of the army.

30
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,360
 Never volunteer for anything.

31
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,480
 - Mary, if your own brother shows this kind of ambition,

32
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,360
 the least you can do is cooperate

33
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,960
 and see that he gets off on a full stomach.

34
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,240
 - Alice, where's the wisse broom?

35
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:14,840
 - Sam Oldridge, how did you get your pajamas that dirty?

36
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,560
 - I got into a landslide.

37
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,400
 Where?

38
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,400
 In the coal bin.

39
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,440
 Where's the broom?

40
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,160
 Hanging behind you.

41
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:24,320
 My goodness, you're certainly your son's father.

42
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,360
 When you're shoveling coal in the middle of the night,

43
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,480
 what can you expect?

44
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,600
 Now, Sam, don't you grumble too.

45
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,560
 You're the one who's always after him

46
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,960
 to show more initiative.

47
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,360
 Well, I didn't mean for him to show it.

48
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,720
 It's six o'clock in the morning.

49
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,560
 Now, Sam?

50
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,600
 Besides his schoolwork is just as important as his initiative.

51
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,520
 He and Hormone never get those circulars delivered

52
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,800
 before their first class.

53
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,320
 Sam, old, you certainly don't have much confidence

54
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:51,080
 your own son. Who on it? I'll get the phone. Would you like the pancakes too

55
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:55,120
 father? Mary pancakes are not something you eat when your stomach still asleep.

56
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:01,880
 Henry are you drinking your milk? I'm just starting to mother. Hello? Alice this is

57
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:07,240
 a bit brown. Has Will showed up at your house? Will. My husband. Is he on his way

58
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:11,800
 over? I don't know. He was half asleep and I sent him out for the milk and he

59
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,280
 opened the back door and just kept going.

60
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,760
 Oh my goodness.

61
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,960
 So if he shows up there, would you give him

62
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,160
 one of Sam's robes and some bedroom slippers

63
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,200
 and send him home?

64
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,600
 Yes, Elizabeth, goodbye.

65
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,500
 Goodbye.

66
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,300
 Oh, and Alice?

67
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,200
 Yes, Elizabeth?

68
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,360
 You don't think this job will be too taxing on Homer, do you?

69
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:28,960
 Taxi?

70
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,680
 Well, I took it for the doctor last month.

71
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:34,040
 And Alice, the poor boy has practically no metabolism left

72
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:34,960
 at all.

73
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,240
 I'm sure it'll do him a world of good.

74
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,000
 And I'll keep an eye open for Will.

75
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,600
 Goodbye.

76
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,960
 Goodbye.

77
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:44,960
 Mother, is there anything on that telephone table besides the telephone book in the memo pair?

78
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,960
 No, dear. What are you looking for?

79
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,960
 A perfectly wonderful letter I got from Kermit yesterday.

80
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:56,960
 I thought as long as I'm up I'd sit down and answer it so he could see the effect it's having on me as soon as possible.

81
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:00,960
 Dear, this is no time to be answering letters. Please see that Henry gets his pancakes first.

82
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:05,960
 Yes, Mother. But I could very easily do that and write the first draft at the same time.

83
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:09,360
 Mary, the morning's complicated enough as it is.

84
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,960
 Henry, are you eating?

85
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:14,360
 Sure, Mother. Look, I'm already halfway through my half a grapefruit.

86
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,360
 That's fine, then drink your milk.

87
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,360
 Hey, Henry!

88
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:21,360
 In the dining room, Homer.

89
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,360
 Hi, Henry.

90
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,360
 Good morning, Mr. Aldrich.

91
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,360
 Homer, dear, it's me.

92
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,360
 Oh.

93
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,360
 Oh, sure.

94
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,360
 Oh, are you ready to start him?

95
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:35,360
 Just as soon as he drinks his milk and has his pancakes.

96
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,920
 I'll go see if I told him to mock.

97
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,680
 - Give me room at the table, Henry.

98
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,520
 - What are you doing?

99
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,720
 - Stuffing the rest of the circulars in these envelopes.

100
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,280
 - Gee whiz, Hummer, haven't you done that yet?

101
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,040
 - Henry, I'll be done by the time you're finished eating.

102
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,560
 - Here are your pancakes, Henry.

103
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,540
 - Oh, it's about time.

104
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:52,200
 Boy, don't you realize we have to be in school by 8.30?

105
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,120
 - Well, my goodness, that's a good example

106
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,800
 of the appreciation you get around here

107
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,480
 for working to the bone.

108
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,040
 Would you mind standing up?

109
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,240
 - Gee whiz, what are you looking for?

110
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,960
 - Nothing, you can sit down.

111
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,400
 I just thought the letter might be on your chair.

112
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,320
 - Henry.

113
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,160
 - Why?

114
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,440
 - Who was that?

115
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,520
 - Mary.

116
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,000
 - Your sister?

117
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,320
 - Well sure.

118
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,220
 - Well I'll be done,

119
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:15,760
 and over all those things sticking out of her head.

120
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,280
 (audience laughing)

121
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,320
 - The curlers.

122
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,520
 - Yeah.

123
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,520
 Boy, you have to get up pretty early in the morning

124
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,760
 to see what a girl's like under everything.

125
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,600
 - I'm calling.

126
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,600
 (audience laughing)

127
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,720
 - Homer, what are you doing?

128
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,040
 - Hey, circulars in the envelope.

129
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:29,880
 - No, you're not,

130
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,840
 you just stuffed a paper napkin into that top one.

131
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,840
 I did.

132
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,840
 Jane was open your eyes.

133
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,840
 What was that?

134
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,840
 Nothing.

135
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,840
 Just me and the whole clothes tree.

136
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,840
 You ran into it, father?

137
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,840
 No, it jumped out on a tech machine.

138
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,840
 Henry, I want to make one thing clear, no matter where you are.

139
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:54,840
 No matter how many circulars you have left to deliver, at 8.15 you're to drop everything and make tracks for school.

140
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,840
 But, father, we have to finish.

141
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,840
 Sure, we've already been paid too long.

142
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,840
 That's your responsibility.

143
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,840
 You're just to get to school on time.

144
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,840
 Is that clear?

145
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,120
 Yes, father. Come on, Homer. Let's start.

146
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:07,220
 But I'm going to finish stuff. You can do it all the way.

147
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:09,260
 Ben, where are the boys going?

148
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:11,560
 To work. Goodbye, everybody. Hi, homie.

149
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:15,560
 Good evening. It's all to work, we go.

150
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:19,200
 Hi. Goodness, Sam. Why did you let him go before he finished his milk?

151
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,400
 He'll survive, Alice. Now, come on.

152
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,120
 Where? Back to bed.

153
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,320
 Before we clean up?

154
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:27,280
 Before I fall flat on my face. Come along.

155
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,040
 Father, I can't find Kermit's letter anywhere.

156
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,040
 Mary, it's 650.

157
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,460
 Father, I have to find it.

158
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,460
 Suppose it falls into some strange hand.

159
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:36,700
 I suppose it does.

160
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,020
 Father, I just die.

161
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,940
 I'd lie right down and die.

162
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:42,100
 Good heavens, what sort of a letter did he write?

163
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,180
 Oh, mother, it was beautiful.

164
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:46,780
 When Kermit writes a letter, it isn't just a letter.

165
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:49,140
 It's got language in it.

166
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,100
 That's novel.

167
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,180
 [LAUGHTER]

168
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:55,540
 And it isn't the kind of language I'd like strangers to see.

169
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:58,020
 Well, if it was in the house, it couldn't have walked off.

170
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:59,300
 Now, where did you have it left?

171
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:02,580
 Oh, that's the whole thing. I'm positive I put it on the desk last night.

172
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:03,400
 On the desk?

173
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:03,900
 Yes.

174
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:07,780
 I know because Henry was sitting next to me putting circulars into those envelopes and...

175
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:09,300
 and...

176
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,300
 Oh, my goodness.

177
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,200
 Nah, Mary.

178
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,300
 Oh, my goodness.

179
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,500
 Mary, calm down.

180
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:18,700
 Calm down, mother, calm down when my private life may be spread all over town.

181
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:19,300
 Mary!

182
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,500
 Mother Kermit practically proposed!

183
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,900
 Father, out of my way!

184
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:23,700
 Where are you going?

185
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:26,300
 Out in Stalk Henry, before he roars my lawn.

186
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,800
 Mary!

187
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,700
 Sam's selfish.

188
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:31,700
 But you catch her death of cold and nothing but her night down at curlers.

189
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:44,700
 Hair doggy, nice doggy.

190
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:51,700
 Listen, dog, can't you go away from that gate and let me get up on that friend porch with this circular?

191
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:54,700
 But I've only got two more left.

192
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:57,700
 Please, dog, come on, be civilized.

193
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,060
 *snoring*

194
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:02,020
 Look, suppose I give you a peanut butter sandwich from my lunch.

195
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:03,700
 *snoring*

196
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,140
 A lot of pieces of lare can...

197
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:06,580
 *snoring*

198
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:07,540
 And orange...

199
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:08,500
 *barking*

200
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,780
 Even if I peeled it...

201
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:10,740
 *screaming*

202
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,340
 *screaming*

203
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:16,020
 What I can say is you will never get to be man's best friend.

204
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:18,420
 "Momer, what are you standing around for?

205
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:20,340
 Don't you realize schools in twenty minutes?"

206
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:24,980
 I realize, Henry, I realize the one that doesn't realize is Hilliard's dog.

207
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,580
 He won't let me through their gaze.

208
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:29,080
 Henry! Henry Aldrich!

209
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:29,680
 Who's that?

210
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,280
 Mrs. King.

211
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,280
 Across the street.

212
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,080
 Oh, sure.

213
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,580
 Hi, Mrs. King!

214
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:37,380
 Henry, your mother called and asked me to keep an eye open for you.

215
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,080
 You're to call home immediately.

216
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:39,680
 I am?

217
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,080
 And when he closes up...

218
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:44,480
 My father's probably worried about my being late for school.

219
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,980
 Mrs. King, would you call my house and say things are working out perfectly?

220
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:49,980
 Yes, sir.

221
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:53,980
 And if my mother's worrying, tell her I know I ran out without finishing it,

222
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,780
 but I'll get some at school.

223
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:57,780
 - Come on! - Milk!

224
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:59,780
 And thanks a lot, Mrs. King.

225
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:01,280
 [snoring]

226
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,780
 - Harry, why can't we skip this house?

227
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:06,780
 - Homer, we were paid to do this job right.

228
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:09,280
 The trouble is this dog thinks you're afraid of him.

229
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,780
 - He does? - Sure.

230
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:12,280
 - Well, he's a pretty smart dog.

231
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,780
 [laughter]

232
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:15,780
 - Here.

233
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:18,280
 Just watch me handle him.

234
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,780
 Listen, doggy.

235
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,780
 Get away from that gate and let me in.

236
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:26,780
 [crying]

237
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:29,780
 Well, I guess it won't hurt to miss just this one, pal.

238
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:30,780
 [crowd laughing]

239
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:35,780
 And we can leave the two circulars at that house where our old Miss Fletcher and her older sister live.

240
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:37,780
 Two? For one family?

241
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:39,780
 And we are here, then, not speaking to each other.

242
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:43,780
 We wouldn't learn one of them missing us while raising a blade sale, would we?

243
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:45,780
 No, I guess not. Come on, and let's hurry.

244
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:47,780
 What for? We've got plenty of time.

245
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:51,940
 I know, but I want to get to school up humanly to look over my composition.

246
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:52,940
 Composition?

247
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,940
 Let's do today for English.

248
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:56,540
 Didn't you write one?

249
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:57,540
 Not yet.

250
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:00,420
 I was playing and writing my own study period on my father.

251
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:03,020
 A whole composition and one period?

252
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:06,540
 Well, I'm not exactly writing a whole composition.

253
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:11,060
 I'm taking the one I wrote for history last week and where it says Abraham Lincoln, I'm

254
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:13,500
 erasing and writing in Will Brown.

255
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,100
 That's not a bad idea.

256
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:20,100
 I'm sure, especially if I keep a carbon copy to show my father.

257
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,100
 Let's cross the street.

258
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,100
 Okay. What's yours about?

259
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:28,100
 That trip we took to Washington last year. I spent three days writing it.

260
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:32,100
 It's even illustrated with the snapshots we took in front of the White House in places.

261
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,100
 No kidding, am I mentioning?

262
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:38,100
 I'll say. Let me read you what you said to that guard in the treasury.

263
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,100
 You go into that.

264
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:44,100
 The explainer didn't know the money was real till after I picked it up.

265
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:49,260
 I'll read you the hope the hope well to you was can't friend

266
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:52,660
 Hold my lunch while I go through the rest of my pocket

267
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,460
 Are you sure you wrote it in?

268
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:58,580
 I mean you don't suppose you just think you did Homer. It was no dream

269
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:02,420
 I put it right next to my plate this morning, so I wouldn't oh

270
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:11,540
 Boy, what's wrong? Oh boy Homer what besides that napkin did you stuff into those envelopes?

271
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:14,540
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

272
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:21,880
 Frank.

273
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:22,860
 Yes, Tim.

274
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:25,340
 Frank Anderson, please put down that paper.

275
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:27,500
 I know you don't like to be upset at breakfast,

276
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,500
 but this isn't a letter that can be ignored.

277
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,780
 Letter from who?

278
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:33,260
 Henry Eldridge to your daughter Kathleen.

279
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:35,780
 When I got up to close the window at 6.30 this morning,

280
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:37,980
 I saw him sneak up on our transport,

281
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,900
 put this letter in our mailbox, and then

282
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:44,700
 on the street. The only reason I happened to read it was it was in a plain white

283
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:49,980
 envelope and I thought it was a circular. Just read it. Now fill it up. Very well.

284
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:54,220
 But I think we should leave the kids alone. When they get to our age they'll

285
00:11:54,220 --> 00:12:00,420
 have trouble enough to do. Whose kitten face? What? Kitten face. That's the way it

286
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:07,500
 starts. Dear kitten face and it's signed Honey Bunny Boo. Dear it's what's in

287
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:11,140
 between kitten taste and honey bunny boo that scares the daylights out of me what

288
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:14,060
 could a couple of kids right that could that could

289
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:19,180
 well good heavens good heavens indeed but did you read this part about about about

290
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:20,980
 what we'll never mind

291
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:26,140
 this is practically a proposal I know what are we going to do we're not going to do

292
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:30,860
 a thing what trouble with you fill it is you don't recognize a joke when you see

293
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:34,580
 it Joe of course no kid could possibly write a thing like this in all seriousness

294
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:40,580
 Well, I'm sorry, Frank, but I can't bring myself to regard the possibility of Henry Aldrich as a son-in-law, as a joke.

295
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:43,580
 Yes. Well, if you like, go ahead.

296
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:44,580
 Go ahead and what?

297
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:45,580
 Speak to Kathleen.

298
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:46,580
 Me?

299
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:48,580
 And make it quite clear I'm behind you 100%.

300
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:51,580
 Well, Frank, I was planning on you talking to her.

301
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:52,580
 Me?

302
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:53,580
 My goodness, what the father for?

303
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,580
 Well, to have Amanda Mantors.

304
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:56,580
 Oh, but Frank!

305
00:12:56,580 --> 00:13:00,580
 Now, really, don't look at me that way. Just remember, I was the one who wanted a son.

00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,080

 Hello, Acme Cut Red Dress.

00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,480
 Hello, look, I only have a few minutes before the first bell rings.

310
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,680
 Church bells? No, we don't carry them.

311
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,280
 Why?

312
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,980
 No, I'm calling about your circulars.

313
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:23,280
 Oh, yes! Our special this week is two packages of razor blades for 24 cents.

314
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,580
 I know, I folded them.

315
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:25,480
 A razor blade?

316
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,780
 No! The circulars.

317
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:30,740
 Oh, God. How many packages shall we send up?

318
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:33,140
 - What packages? - Aren't you calling to order?

319
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:35,820
 Mr. You're not listening. I'm one of your boys.

320
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,980
 Oh, no wonder you didn't make sense.

321
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:40,180
 - Huh? - As far as a fret.

322
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:41,580
 - What? - Why aren't you in school?

323
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:43,700
 I am, and I'm not one of your sons.

324
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,300
 - Oh. - Why was delivering for you?

325
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,700
 If you speak louder, we seem to have bad connections.

326
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:50,660
 Has anyone called and said they found

327
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:53,900
 my exciting and educational trip to Washington,

328
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,460
 in with one of your circuaries?

329
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,180
 Washington, you're going to Washington?

330
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:58,780
 - What? - Well, have a nice time.

331
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:00,980
 - Come on, huh? - Don't miss the bureau of standards.

332
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:03,520
 - He don't understand. This is for class.

333
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,060
 - They're all going? - What?

334
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:07,720
 - Now I get you the whole class is going to Washington,

335
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,520
 including my boys, Horace and Fred.

336
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,920
 - Mr. Please. - Fine idea.

337
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,120
 It'd be nice to get them out of the house for a few days.

00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,620
 - Look, if he was listening to me.

 - Good morning, Mrs. Todd. Come right in.

341
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:26,880
 Thank you.

342
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,540
 I wonder if you could spare a cup of powdered sugar.

343
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:30,480
 Of course.

344
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,600
 You must excuse my appearance in my kitchen.

00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,920
 I got the most peculiar piece of mail today,

346
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,560
 and I'm afraid I've spent most of the morning

347
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,120
 trying to make head or tail of it.

00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,000
 I think I finally got it figured out, though.

350
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,280
 I think it's a sort of travel advertisement.

351
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,400
 It is?

352
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,440
 Well, the thing that threw me off is the clever way it's done.

353
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,880
 You see, it's supposedly written by this young boy

354
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,960
 who'd never been to Washington before.

355
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,760
 Well, that is clever.

356
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,560
 And judging by the grammar and some pictures that are on it,

357
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:01,000
 it's obviously a refugee child who hasn't been in this country long.

358
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,560
 [LAUGHTER]

359
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,320
 Well, you don't say.

360
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,320
 Well, I got a very strange thing in my mailbox, too.

361
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,080
 A travel ad?

362
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:08,880
 No.

363
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,320
 It was a plane quite envelope with a paper napkin

364
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,960
 and half a pancake in it.

365
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,360
 [LAUGHTER]

366
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,280
 You won't say.

367
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:20,880
 You don't imagine it is something to do with those jackpot radio programs.

368
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,920
 Like so?

369
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,920
 Oh my goodness, maybe I ought to go home and sit by my phone.

370
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:25,920
 Oh, dear, what's wrong?

371
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,920
 You just reminded me of something I forgot to do.

372
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:29,920
 Excuse me.

373
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:30,920
 Number three.

374
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,920
 L-3-0-3.

375
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,920
 L-3-0-3?

376
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:35,920
 Yes, please.

377
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:36,920
 Thank you.

378
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:40,920
 Mrs. Ulrich called me this morning to keep an eye out for Henry and I forgot completely about calling back.

379
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:41,920
 Hello?

380
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,920
 This is Mrs. King. Is Mrs. Ulrich there?

381
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,920
 No, this is Mary. Mother's going through the attic.

382
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:47,920
 Brain cleaning?

383
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,920
 No, she thought it might have gotten up there somehow, but I'm sure Henry took it.

384
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,040
 - You're Henry, Chuck.

385
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,920
 - Oh, well, it's about Henry, I'm calling.

386
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,360
 As near as I could figure out,

387
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,720
 he wanted me to tell your mother

388
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,920
 that he expected the school to run out of milk.

389
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,600
 - Mrs. King, you saw Henry?

390
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,200
 - Yes, he was buying here this morning.

391
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,720
 - Oh my goodness.

392
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,560
 Did he leave anything in your mail box that he shouldn't have?

393
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,080
 - It was Henry who left that?

394
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:09,980
 - You got it?

395
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:10,820
 You got it?

396
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:12,560
 - Yes, but this is King I beg of.

397
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,200
 You, I beg of you, please tear it up.

398
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,040
 - Hear it up.

399
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,200
 - Don't read it.

400
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,240
 - But I really can't see what--

401
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,880
 - I beg of you, and thank you.

402
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,040
 You don't know what a load this is of my mind.

403
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,040
 Goodbye!

404
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,880
 Yes, well, goodbye.

405
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,880
 What was that all about?

406
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,120
 I'm to tear up that travel ass!

407
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,280
 Really?

408
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:35,520
 I wonder if I'm to tear up the napkin in 10k too.

409
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:46,880
 Oh, the Big Red Letter stands for the General Family.

410
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,400
 Oh, the Big Red Letter stands for the General Family.

411
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,240
 That's Jello!

412
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,160
 Yum yum yum yum!

413
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,060
 Jello pudding!

414
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:53,960
 Yum yum yum!

415
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:54,860
 Jello tap!

416
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:56,260
 Be-o-ka pudding!

417
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,560
 Just-a-ree!

418
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:00,660
 Yes, Sari, and say, Mr. Seymour!

419
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:01,700
 Why, Jello!

420
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:04,840
 It's Mr. Dehaven, our esteemed Santaville drug is.

421
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:07,580
 Why, sure, and I thought you'd like to know about a new concoction

422
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:10,420
 we're serving at the lunch counter these days, it's making a big hit.

423
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:12,580
 Well, you know, Mr. Dehaven, my favorite dessert is...

424
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:13,980
 Oh, sure, I know!

425
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:17,780
 That's why I wanted to tell you about this new idea all the kids are crazy for.

426
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:18,680
 Jello?

427
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:21,760
 Well, you might call it jello and.

428
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,300
 Well, go on, jello and what?

429
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:25,320
 Jello and ice cream.

430
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,280
 Sure, you just fixed the jello as usual.

431
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,000
 See, in any of the red flavors.

432
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,600
 When it's slightly thickened, you fold in softened, vanilla ice

433
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,600
 cream, and chill and sherbet glasses.

434
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,520
 It looks so pretty and tastes so tasty.

435
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,920
 Why, even the ladies have been thanking me for the tip.

436
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,480
 And so do we, Mr. Dehaven.

437
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,760
 Jello's such a favorite.

438
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,600
 We're all glad to hear of delicious new ways to serve it.

439
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,840
 Now, those red flavors, as you call them,

440
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,240
 would be strawberry raspberry and cherry, of course.

441
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,480
 And there's also orange, lemon, and lime.

442
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,480
 There might be good too.

443
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,080
 You bet.

444
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,120
 So look for the big red letters on the box.

445
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:57,720
 They spell jello and jello spells a treat.

446
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:01,640
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

447
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:05,040
 And now, getting back to the troubles of Henry Olridge,

448
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,040
 it is later the same morning in the scene opens

449
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,920
 in the corridor of Central High School.

450
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,800
 Miss Eddie, Miss Eddie, could I please speak to you,

451
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,600
 with Sarcum?

452
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,440
 And the I'm late for my next class.

453
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,400
 Good morning, Miss Eddie.

454
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,560
 Oh, good morning, Gloria.

455
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:20,160
 But, Miss Eddie, there's something very important I have to tell you.

456
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:20,660
 What is it?

457
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:21,560
 The truth.

458
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,760
 I beg your pardon?

459
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,760
 Yes, ma'am. I knew you'd be impressed.

460
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,460
 It's like I told Homer.

461
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:27,360
 Why?

462
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:31,160
 Miss Eddie may not give you that impression, but under everything that's on top,

463
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:34,360
 she's a person who appreciates the truth.

464
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:38,160
 And they just what am I being oiled in preparation for?

465
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,560
 For...

466
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,960
 Oh, nothing, Miss Eddie.

467
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,960
 I just want to explain about my composition I was supposed to turn into you today.

468
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:45,760
 You haven't done it.

469
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,260
 No.

470
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,260
 That is yes.

471
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:54,020
 I mean, you see, Homer and I were walking down a downtown yesterday and there was this sign

472
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:55,260
 in the window, "Boying" wanted.

473
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,260
 Your competition is about a trip downtown.

474
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:58,260
 No, it's about Washington.

475
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:00,260
 The one who's the father of our country?

476
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:02,260
 No, the one that's D.C.

477
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:06,260
 This place was having a sale on razor plates.

478
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:07,260
 What plate?

479
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,900
 We were delivering for.

480
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:11,260
 Only I think Homer started into one of the envelopes.

481
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:12,260
 Just a moment.

482
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:13,260
 Just a moment.

483
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:16,260
 Oh, you mean you understand, Miss Eddie?

484
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:17,260
 No, I do not.

485
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:21,260
 And I've taken about as many of your complicated explanations as I'm going to.

486
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,260
 But, Miss Eddie...

487
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:24,260
 Oh boy, is that Mr. Brabbe?

488
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:26,260
 It is. And suppose you make your explanations to him.

489
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:29,260
 And I'll expect an excuse from him or your composition.

490
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:30,260
 But, Miss Eddie...

491
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:31,260
 And I've been looking for you.

492
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:39,260
 Mr. Brabbe, would you be willing to listen to a very simple explanation of something very complicated that happened to me this morning?

493
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:40,260
 Not at this moment.

494
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:41,260
 Please take this.

495
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:42,260
 What's that?

496
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:51,260
 a quart of milk. Your mother dropped by with it a few minutes ago. Well, gee, it was. I hope this isn't a subtle form of criticism of the milk we serve in the school cafeteria.

497
00:19:51,260 --> 00:20:00,260
 Well, gee, it was no. Oh, and about that explanation. Henry, please take the milk. The moisture's running off and taking this touch out of my cups.

498
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:04,260
 Oh, yes, sir. And what? Oh, and what a... What a principle is expected to do. Mr. Brab, and what?

499
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:09,260
 I expected to count erasers, settle differences between teachers, men, leaky pipes. Mr. Brab, and what a...

500
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:10,260
 Mr. Brad.

501
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:11,260
 He keeps pipes.

502
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:13,580
 Good heavens, I forgot all about the leak in the boy's locker room.

503
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:14,580
 Excuse me.

504
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,580
 But Mr. Brad?

505
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:17,220
 Later, Henry, I have to call the plumber.

506
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:19,980
 But look, I even have a circular to prove my story.

507
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:20,980
 One circular?

508
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:21,980
 This one, look.

509
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:22,980
 Oh, I see.

510
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:23,980
 Very well here.

511
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:24,980
 Oh, what's this?

512
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:25,980
 50 cents.

513
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:26,980
 You can get me four packages.

514
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:27,980
 Yeah.

515
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:28,980
 What?

516
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:32,220
 And in the future, Henry, please do your razor blade selling outside of school hours.

517
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,220
 Mr. Brad, wait.

518
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:35,580
 You're not giving me a chance to tell the truth.

519
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:38,000
 (jazz music)

520
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:46,180
 - I hope I'm not taking your way

521
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:47,540
 from anything Mrs. Zoldridge.

522
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:50,620
 - Oh no Mrs. Anderson, things have calmed down beautifully.

523
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:51,900
 - Oh that's fine.

524
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:54,460
 The reason I called,

525
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:57,220
 the reason I called.

526
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:58,180
 - Yeah?

527
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:00,300
 - Well, you see Henry left something

528
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,940
 in our mailbox this morning.

529
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:03,380
 - Yes I know.

530
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:04,220
 - You do?

531
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:05,220
 - Of course.

532
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:07,820
 Well, how do you feel about it?

533
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:10,020
 Oh, I approve completely.

534
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:12,020
 You do?

535
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:15,620
 You really approve of his leaving a thing like that in our mailbox?

536
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:17,020
 Why not, Mrs. Anderson?

537
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:19,620
 He left one in practically every mailbox in town.

538
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:20,820
 Why?

539
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:23,220
 Are you upset with Henry, Mrs. Anderson?

540
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:24,220
 I can't see it.

541
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:26,120
 The boys fall entirely.

542
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:31,120

 Oh, thank you, Mr. Bradley.

 Take a chair.

547
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:44,820
 Thank you.

548
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:48,900
 I hope you'll pardon my appearance, but we had some difficulty in the boy's locker room

549
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:55,420
 and I was giving the plumber a hand and, well, I'm afraid I got quite a dowsing from one of the joints.

550
00:21:55,420 --> 00:22:00,620
 Well, I wouldn't intrude on your time like this, Mr. Bradley, but it is rather important.

551
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:06,580

553
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:18,100
 he agreed if the boy's family feels that way that is well could you look into Kathleen's

554
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:22,060
 marks and tell us if it would be all right if we were to send her to my sister and Chicago

555
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:27,460

 - You mean this is my--

567
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:04,740
 - And if you're going to leave personal things

568
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:07,060
 in our mailbox, might I suggest you address it

569
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:08,820
 to the person to whom it's intended?

570
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:11,580
 - Oh boy, Mrs. Anderson, you don't know how I've been

571
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:14,340
 trying to put my hands on this.

572
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:16,780
 - Mr. Bradley, please excuse my bawaging right in,

573
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:18,980
 but this is a matter that simply can't be overlooked.

574
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,340
 - Miss Eddie, I have a visitor.

575
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:22,780
 - Yes, and I apologize, but Mr. Bradley,

576
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:24,540
 My radiator is knocking against it.

577
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:26,340
 Eddie, I can't discuss it now.

578
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:27,140
 But Mr. Bradley...

579
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,820
 You just go back to your class, Miss Eddie,

580
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:30,980
 and I'll get to your knocking as soon as I can.

581
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,460
 Okay.

 Oh, uh, Miss Mercedes, I've got good news for you.

583
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:38,140
 Mrs. Anderson, just located my composition.

584
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:40,580
 Composition? You were all fat in the composition.

585
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:41,460
 Oh, sure.

586
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:42,900
 But let me have it, Henry.

587
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,740
 And don't be late for class.

588
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:47,500
 We're going to read these aloud in alphabetical order.

 That's going to be red in class?

592
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:55,480
 Sure, Mrs. Anderson.

593
00:23:55,480 --> 00:24:03,180
 Well, I don't like to boost my own talents, but I think the class will say that's one of the most interesting compositions they've ever heard.

 Would you like another cold compress for your head, Mary?

597
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:23,280
 Come on, first. Mother, the only thing I want from my head is a shotgun.

598
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:26,480
 Now, Mary, you're taking this whole thing much too seriously.

599
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:31,080
 Too seriously when every person in town knows my entire private life?

600
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,280
 Mary.

601
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:39,880
 Mother, if that's a certain person, tell him that as far as I'm concerned, he and I are no longer in the same family.

602
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,280
 Mary, really.

603
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:46,280
 Oh, that's so came, Mother. Mary has every right to feel the way she does.

604
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:50,280
 Boy, if I had a letter of mine that read in the book.

 [indistinct chatter]

606
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:56,280
 Henry, and I just want you to know, Mary,

607
00:24:56,280 --> 00:25:00,280
 I made a mental note of every kid in that class laughed.

608
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:04,280
 And it'll be all on day before I'll even give them a short hello.

609
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,280
 Oh!

610
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,280
 Henry, I think you better leave Mary alone.

611
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:10,280
 Yes, Mother.

612
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:14,280
 Mary.

613
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,280
 No, what?

614
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:21,280
 Well, if it'll make you feel any better, I got an "A" for your letter.

615
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:24,280
 For sincerity and atmosphere.

616
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:28,280
 I'll get the phone.

617
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:33,280
 Don't come in here, Homer. Mary's not in the mood for a human company.

618
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,280
 I don't think.

619
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:38,280
 Listen, Henry, don't get mad. I mean, you know how these things happen.

620
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,280
 What thing?

621
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:42,280
 Well, I've got kind of bad news for you.

622
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:45,540
 You know that $2 we were paid for delivering the circulars?

623
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:46,400
 You lost it?

624
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,060
 No.

625
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:48,720
 It just disappeared.

627
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,480
 I'll be done if I know where it went or if.

628
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,180
 Sure I had it this morning.

629
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:57,720
 Homer, you mean I went through all that I did today and I'm not getting any money besides?

630
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:00,360
 Well, my goodness. Some people are so lucky.

631
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,960
 That was Mrs. Scott on the phone.

00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,820
 Mrs. Scott?

633
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:09,160
 Yes, she got a paper napkin in the mail this morning and she unfolded it a while ago and there were two dollar bills in it.

634
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,560

 For Agnes, invitation, what are you talking about?

 Now listen yourself, Homer.

651

 Right now, Mary won't even speak to me.

652
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:58,320
 We're out the two bucks we made this morning and now...

653
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:03,320
 And just what else did you stop in those envelopes this morning, Homer?

654
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:06,320
 Yes, things can get complicated like that.

655
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,020
 But haven't you noticed this, ladies?

 No matter how many things there are to do around the house if they never gets too complicated,

657
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:15,520
 to turn out one of those easy to fix jello desserts.

 Yes, jello and those six delicious flavors, strawberry, raspberry, cherry, orange, lemon and lime.
