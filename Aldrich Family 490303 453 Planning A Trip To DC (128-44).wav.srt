1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 And now the Jell-O family presents...

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 Henry... Henry Olgrich!

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 Coming, mother!

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 Yes, it's the Oldridge family based on characters originated by Clifford Goldsmith

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,500
 and starring Ezra Stone as Henry with Jackie Kelka's home.

6
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:39,000
 And yes, it's the Jell-O family with its three famous desserts.

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 Jell-O in those six delicious flavors, regular Jell-O puddings,

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 with that old-fashioned homemade flavor, and Jell-O tapioca puddings,

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 a miracle of goodness, a marvel of speed.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 Oh, the big red letters stand for the jello family

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 Oh, the big red letters stand for the jello family

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 That's jello, yum yum yum

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 Jello puddings, yum yum yum

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 Jello tat the ode of puddings, yes sir

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 And now for the Aldridge family

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 [Music]

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 A typical teenage boy like Henry Aldrich lives in a world all his own.

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 A very special world which adults can only understand and enter when they remember their own youth.

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 The scene opens in the Aldrich bedroom. It is early morning.

20
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,520
 morning. Alice! What now Sam? I can't find my socks. Now they are calmed down. But I can't go to

21
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,640
 Washington DC without my socks. It wouldn't be dignified. You've already packed them. I have? Oh,

22
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,760
 how about my ties? I know I didn't pack them. They're right there on the bed beside your suitcase.

23
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:02,880
 Oh, yeah. Say why do we have to pack now? Our train doesn't leave until six o'clock. Alice,

24
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,200
 this is one trip we're going to start in an orderly fashion. That's the trouble with women.

25
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,720
 They never do things systematically. Where are my handkerchiefs? In your top drawer.

26
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,220
 Mother!

27
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:13,220
 Father!

28
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:15,320
 Oh dear, Henry, what's wrong?

29
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,320
 Nothing!

30
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,320
 I just don't weigh enough!

31
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,320
 [laughter]

32
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,320
 Did he say "way"?

33
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,820
 I'd better go see what's wrong.

34
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:23,820
 No, Alice, you haven't started to do your own packing.

35
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:24,820
 I'll go.

36
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:25,820
 Very well said.

37
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:28,820
 And while you're packing, will you look onto the bureau for my other slipper?

38
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:30,820
 Now, Henry, what's the trouble?

39
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:33,320
 I can't get this darn thing closed.

40
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,820
 Henry, what are you doing with that steamer trunk?

41
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,320
 Gee whiz, packing it.

42
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:40,820
 So would you be willing to give me a hand and help me sit on my lid?

43
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:46,200
 Hepney may I remind you we're only going to Washington for a week. We're not moving there permanently

44
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,120
 I know it may look like I'm taking an awful lot father

45
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:54,920
 But I give you my word all I've packed is the everyday necessities of life. You don't say sure

46
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,120
 Would you mind lifting the lid?

47
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,120
 Lifting it so I can examine the necessities of life

48
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,040
 But father if I lift it things will start popping out all over the place

49
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:08,220
 I'm gonna have to carry my pajama bottoms in my overcoat pocket as is

50
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:12,120
 Good father. Yes, sir

51
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:18,340
 Well father before you say I would hardly call a baseball glove one of the necessities of life

52
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:22,180
 But gee whiz no one's ever been able to do it do what?

53
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:25,000
 Catch a ball thrown from the top of the Washington Monument

54
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,880
 Don't you think I owe it to my country to at least try and re get rid of it, but father also get rid of this hunting knife

55
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,140
 But I'll need that for.

56
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:37,800
 I hardly think so from what I've heard the hauntings pretty lean in Washington these days.

57
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,040
 But suppose I want a sharp and a pencil.

58
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,520
 Henry, please pack all your things in one suitcase.

59
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,040
 But father, I won't fit.

60
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:47,640
 You will if you forget the necessities of life and take just the luxuries,

61
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,720
 like socks and shirts and underwear.

62
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,960
 Sam, will you please answer the phone?

63
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,720
 Yes, Alice. Now hurry, Henry.

64
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,800
 But I don't know how I'll ever manage.

65
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,720
 You don't organize things properly.

66
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,600
 Alice, did you find my other slipper?

67
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,040
 Yes, and I packed both your razors.

68
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:03,760
 Why, too?

69
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,760
 A deal you always need one on the train.

70
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,560
 You need one to leave in the hotel.

71
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,360
 [LAUGHTER]

72
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,040
 Hello.

73
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,320
 Sam, this is Will Brown and Sam.

74
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,440
 Homo won't need his longies, Willy.

75
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,000
 That's what?

76
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,080
 Longies, Sam.

77
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,040
 Longies.

78
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,120
 Elizabeth says he'll need them in Washington,

79
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,480
 and I know he won't.

80
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,680
 Washington?

81
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,560
 Homer's going to--

82
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,840
 So what do you say, Sam?

83
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:28,120
 Pack them or don't pack them?

84
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,240
 Sam.

85
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,880
 Are you there?

86
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,760
 Yes, Will.

87
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,360
 I'm here.

88
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,960
 What do you say, Sam?

89
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:34,560
 Say?

90
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,880
 About longies.

91
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,280
 Why?

92
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,920
 Suppose you ask Alice and call me back.

93
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,000
 Yes, Will.

94
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,080
 I'll call you back.

95
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,080
 Goodbye.

96
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,120
 And Sam, I certainly want to thank you,

97
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,440
 but taking home her along.

98
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,560
 You don't know what this means to our family.

99
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,080
 Yes.

100
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,080
 Goodbye, Will.

101
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,320
 Enryme.

102
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,200
 He went up to the attic for Mary suitcase.

103
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,520
 When he comes down, tell him I want to speak to him.

104
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,360
 Sam, you sound upset.

105
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,200
 - What's that, Alice?

106
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,520
 That was Will Brown on the phone.

107
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,880
 - Oh, yes.

108
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,160
 How is he?

109
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,360
 - Jubilently happy.

110
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,480
 - He is?

111
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,360
 - I would be too if Homer were my son

112
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,240
 and I thought I was packing him off to Washington for a week.

113
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,240
 (audience laughing)

114
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,520
 - Sam, may I explain one thing about that?

115
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,120
 - Then you knew, Alice?

116
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,680
 - Sam, please sit down.

117
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,880
 - Yes, Alice.

118
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,160
 I'm seated.

119
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,560
 - Well, you see, dear?

120
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,840
 - Yes, Alice?

121
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,640
 - Well, you see Henry in Homer

122
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:31,480
 talked a whole thing over, but it wasn't entirely Henry's fault.

123
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,320
 You don't say it.

124
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:37,080
 Now, Sam, it was only natural for them to say how nice it would be if Homer could go.

125
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,880
 And I agreed with them and...

126
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,000
 Do you know how the Browns jump at conclusions?

127
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 I see.

128
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,320
 But that's the whole story, Sam.

129
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,800
 I see.

130
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,800
 May I stand up now?

131
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,800
 Yes, dear.

132
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,160
 Not suppose you sit down.

133
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,160
 But dear...

134
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,160
 Alice?

135
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,160
 Yes, Sam, I'm seated.

136
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,960
 Alice, before I begin, I'd like to make one thing clear.

137
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,720
 I have nothing against Homer.

138
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,680
 I'm really very fond of him, under it all, way down deep.

139
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,120
 But this is more than a business trip.

140
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,600
 I've been looking forward to it as a welcome change.

141
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,240
 Yes, sir.

142
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,680
 And one of the most welcome changes

143
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,840
 was going to be an entire week without Homer.

144
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,720
 Now that doesn't sound unreasonable, does it?

145
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,520
 No, sir.

146
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,160
 Besides, Alice, you don't realize all the trouble I went to

147
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,280
 to get the train tickets and make hotel reservations.

148
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,200
 I simply can't go through all that again.

149
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:32,200
 Dear, I admit it was probably a mistake, but the thing is Henry's God's heart set on Homer going with us.

150
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,200
 And you just have to once set it.

151
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:38,200
 Letting Homer come along would be like taking your mother-in-law on your honeymoon.

152
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:42,200
 Sam Aldrich, there's absolutely no comparison.

153
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:54,200
 Homer, let's not argue. Pack those longies.

154
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,960
 What father, they tickled me.

155
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,460
 They tickled me too.

156
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:01,320
 But your mother showed me a map and it's just as far north as it is south.

157
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,680
 My longies are?

158
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,200
 No, Washington.

159
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,120
 I can't get them in my suitcase.

160
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,040
 Sure you can if you pack intelligently.

161
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:08,840
 What father?

162
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,440
 Let me at that suitcase.

163
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:15,240
 Now we'll take some of this stuff on the bottom and put it on the back.

164
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,600
 Oh my, what's this?

165
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,720
 My rattlesnake.

166
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,680
 What?

167
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,360
 He stuffed father.

168
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:25,960
 Homer, what makes you think Mr. Orleans will take both you and a stuffed rattlesnake?

169
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:30,040
 But I'm gonna donate it to the Smithsonian Institute. He's an antique.

170
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,080
 Now, Homer.

171
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:34,760
 Sure he is. She was, I've had him nearly five years myself.

172
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,000
 Homer, are you in your room?

173
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,040
 Sure, Hen.

174
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:41,320
 Now, Homer, remember what I said. Don't forget your longies.

175
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,840
 Hi, Homer. Oh, time.

176
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:47,080
 Hi, Hen. Boy, you came just at the right time. Could you help me close this bag?

177
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:52,080
 Well Homer... Every time I try to sit on the lid it proctopy fills me over the end of the bed.

178
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,780
 Hm-hmm. Something I have to tell you. Yeah, why?

179
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:03,480
 Well, first I have a little something for you. For me? Sure. My honey knife.

180
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:07,480
 Gee, you're giving me that? Sure old pal.

181
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:12,480
 And Gee, when you think of my father, just remember he's been working pretty hard lately.

182
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,780
 He has. And Gee was. Homer, I give you my word.

183
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:21,940
 Underneath it all he really likes you. He does. Underneath it all.

184
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:33,460
 Henry old timer. Yes, Homer old pal. Look me in the eye. There. Now tell me the truth. Is something wrong?

185
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:45,700
 I'll say there is. Homer, you're not going with us. Oh, oh, oh. Homer, don't take it that.

186
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,460
 - That way. - One way.

187
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,500
 She was on her taking it anyway.

188
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,900
 - You're not? - She was just because

189
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,180
 I've been looking forward.

190
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:55,620
 I mean, it isn't so tragic.

191
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:56,940
 Look at me.

192
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,020
 I'm smiling.

193
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:00,960
 - You are? - I'm not.

194
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,980
 - Sure you are, Homer.

195
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:05,460
 And why don't you sit down

196
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:08,540
 while I unpack your rattlesnake for you?

197
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:11,120
 (upbeat music)

198
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,700
 (upbeat music)

199
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:20,600
 - Henry, is that you?

200
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,160
 - Yes, mother, it's I, all right.

201
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,280
 - Here you look terrible.

202
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,400
 Go in the kitchen and have a banana.

203
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,160
 (audience laughs)

204
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,000
 - A banana?

205
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,640
 - It'll cheer you up.

206
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,960
 - Mother, I give you my word.

207
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,360
 I couldn't force a thing down my throat.

208
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,280
 And mother.

209
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,480
 - Yes, dear.

210
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,320
 - I know you've been looking forward

211
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,360
 to all of us seeing Washington together,

212
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:45,040
 But would you mind very much if I didn't go?

213
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,160
 - Now Henry.

214
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,280
 - She was, what's the capital of our country without Homer?

215
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,120
 (audience laughs)

216
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,880
 - You don't want to make your father feel badly, do you?

217
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,440
 - Father, it's Homer that can't go.

218
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,040
 - But that's why your father feels badly.

219
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,160
 Just because he doesn't come out and say so

220
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,360
 doesn't mean he isn't terribly upset by the whole thing.

221
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,520
 - Mother, are you still talking about my father?

222
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,600
 - Yes, Henry.

223
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,640
 He simply happens to be the kind of man

224
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:13,800
 who has more character than we have and can hide his feelings.

225
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,280
 She was, is that right?

226
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,640
 Of course.

227
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,480
 Then why doesn't he just say, "Sure Homer can go with us

228
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,840
 and stop suffering?"

229
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,320
 [LAUGHTER]

230
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,320
 Oh, I can't keep a fine mark.

231
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:24,820
 Oh.

232
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,640
 Sam, I'm having a talk with Henry,

233
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,120
 and he understands, don't you, Henry?

234
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,840
 Yes, mother and father, I'm certainly sorry you feel so awful.

235
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,420
 I?

236
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:36,440
 And from now on, I won't mention the subject again.

237
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,120
 Oh, this whole on earth was all that about.

238
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:42,680
 Dear, I was just explaining to Henry that it's your place to make the decision

239
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:46,480
 and that whatever you decide will be what you think is for the best.

240
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,200
 Well, thank you, Alice, for seeing my side.

241
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,520
 Was that the song?

242
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,160
 Yes.

243
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,000
 Well, dear, why don't you answer it?

244
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,120
 I'd like to finish packing.

245
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,360
 Sam, I'll be only too glad to finish for you.

246
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,360
 Alice, I'd much rather...

247
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,680
 I'm sure it's for you.

248
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,400
 You are?

249
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:02,120
 That is, I have a feeling at my feet.

250
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:02,840
 Hello?

251
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,320
 Hello, Sam. This is Harriet.

252
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,000
 Who?

253
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,840
 Harriet, your wife's sister.

254
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,380
 Oh, yes, Harriet?

255
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,640
 Bon voyage.

256
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,500
 A mega pardon?

257
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,780
 Bon voyage, Sam.

258
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:13,000
 Bon voyage!

259
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,700
 On your trip to Washington.

260
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,640
 Thank you, Harriet.

261
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,140
 And Sam, let me tell you.

262
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:18,780
 When you first started courting Alice,

263
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:20,540
 I was the only one in our entire family

264
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:22,320
 who stood up for you and said you weren't.

265
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,020
 Word what?

266
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:24,020
 Stubborn.

267
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:26,520
 And I don't think you're really being stubborn now.

268
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,780
 You just happened not to have it

269
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:30,060
 from the standpoint of your patriotic duty.

270
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,160
 Harriet, I don't see--

271
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,460
 Sam, every red-blooded American boy

272
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:35,020
 should be given the opportunity to see

273
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:38,260
 the capital of his country at least once in his lifetime.

274
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:42,380
 Harriet, just what red-buttered American boy are you referring to?

275
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:45,060
 Why, er, anyone?

276
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:46,660
 I see.

277
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,700
 Harriet, let me tell you something.

278
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:49,740
 You were wrong.

279
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:50,240
 Wrong.

280
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,140
 I am stubborn.

281
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,620
 I'm as stubborn as they come.

282
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:55,700
 And Homer is not going with us, and that's that.

283
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,020
 I see.

284
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:59,940
 Well, that's still no excuse for insulting my mother, Sam Aldrich.

285
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:00,540
 Your mother?

286
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:02,860
 She never went on anyone's honeymoon, and you know it.

287
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:12,860
 [Music]

288
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:13,660
 Hello?

289
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:16,060
 Hello, am I speaking to Harold Green?

290
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:16,980
 Yeah, who's this?

291
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:19,180
 Will Brown over in Centerville, Harold?

292
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:21,980
 Oh, hello, Will. We were delighted to get your notes

293
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,580
 so you could come out for the weekend.

294
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:26,540
 Yes. Well, Harold, that's why I called.

295
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:28,460
 And don't forget to bring your golf clubs, Will.

296
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:31,580
 Golf clubs? No, no, I won't forget.

297
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:35,580
 And look, do you mind if I bring Homer too?

298
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:36,580
 Homer?

299
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:37,580
 Yes.

300
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:38,580
 Your son?

301
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:39,580
 Yes.

302
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:42,580
 He caddies for me all the time you see and I just thought...

303
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:45,580
 But well, I thought Homer was going to Washington with the Aldrages.

304
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:48,580
 I thought so too, but now it seems they can't take him.

305
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:52,580
 So we're stuck with him, we can't very well leave him alone all weekend.

306
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:56,580
 Well, in that case, naturally bring him along.

307
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:57,580
 You don't mind?

308
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:58,580
 Not at all.

309
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:02,140
 There won't be any other youngsters around, though.

310
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:03,140
 - Not at all.

311
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:04,940
 - That's the way we planned this weekend.

312
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:07,280
 No youngsters, just adults.

313
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,120
 - Oh.

314
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,220
 - But bring 'em along, Will.

315
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,940
 We'll find something he can do.

316
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:13,220
 - Sure, that's one thing about Homer.

317
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:15,860
 You can hand him a magazine and then forget about him.

318
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,220
 - Sure.

319
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:20,020
 What made Sam change his mind about taking him to Washington?

320
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:23,220
 - Well, you know how much trouble an extra boy can be.

321
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,580
 - Homer, trouble?

322
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:27,380
 - Well, Homer.

323
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:29,780
 Isn't only that, naturally, it's...

324
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:32,540
 Well, I just checked the ticket office myself,

325
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:35,140
 and there isn't a birth to be had on the train Sam's taking.

326
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:35,780
 But will I?

327
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:38,260
 And Homer's so disappointed about the whole thing

328
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:40,500
 that I'm sure if we brought him up to your place,

329
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,980
 it might help to cheer him up.

330
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:43,580
 But will, wait, wait, wait.

331
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:45,180
 Why should Homer be disappointed?

332
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,380
 Let's sit down and think.

333
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:48,980
 (upbeat music)

334
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:57,540
 Hello.

335
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,540
 Hello, Homer, goodbye.

336
00:13:58,540 --> 00:13:59,540
 What's that?

337
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:00,540
 This is Agnes.

338
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:03,340
 Goodbye, kid, and have a nice trip.

339
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:04,340
 But Agnes.

340
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:10,260
 Boy, when I think of you being awake for a whole week, boy, I don't know how I'll stand

341
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:11,260
 it.

342
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,260
 But that's just it, Agnes.

343
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:14,660
 I'll be miserable at the dance Saturday night.

344
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:16,220
 Look, about the dance.

345
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:17,220
 Forget it, kids.

346
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:22,660
 What's being miserable compared to you and Washington expanding your mind?

347
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:23,660
 But that's it, Agnes.

348
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:26,220
 I've suddenly decided not to go.

349
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:30,780
 I've been thinking about it and gee what's Washington?

350
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:35,960
 I mean it's a place everybody's dying to go to sure, but what is it?

351
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,380
 Homer tell me the truth why aren't you going?

352
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:42,540
 Well Agnes have you tried getting on a train lately?

353
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:46,420
 Boy and hotels, hotels Agnes.

354
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:47,340
 What about them?

355
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:49,440
 Gee they're worse than trains.

356
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,640
 Besides there's my schoolwork.

357
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:55,300
 You don't think I could leave my education for a week with a free mind.

358
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,820
 Isn't Henry leaving here?

359
00:14:56,820 --> 00:15:00,700
 Sure, but he has official permission from Mr. Bradley.

360
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:03,300
 So I guess I'll be taking you to the dance

361
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,300
 Saturday night after all.

362
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,500
 The dance?

363
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,160
 How can you?

364
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,700
 I've got a heavy date with Charlie Clark.

365
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,900
 What?

366
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:12,900
 You are standing me up to--

367
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:13,700
 Hey, you're home.

368
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,220
 Mama, we'll figure out something.

369
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:16,060
 Goodbye.

370
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,060
 Goodbye.

371
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:17,940
 Boy, I'm your old pal.

372
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:19,740
 Have I got good news for you?

373
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,620
 I'm going to Washington.

374
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:22,980
 Not exactly.

375
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:25,580
 But I've arranged a swell weekend for you.

376
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:28,540
 You're staying with my Aunt Harriene.

377
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:29,380
 - Why?

378
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:31,300
 - Gee, you'll have a swell time.

379
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,220
 You can play cribbage with her

380
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:34,940
 and watch her do needle point.

381
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:38,700
 - Now listen, and you'll be a big help to her too.

382
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,620
 - See, what with her rheumatism acting up

383
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,740
 against she can hardly lift a thing.

384
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:43,580
 - Yeah.

385
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:44,420
 - How does that sound?

386
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:45,260
 - Terrible.

387
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:47,060
 (audience laughing)

388
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:49,180
 - But Homer, when I suggested it to your father,

389
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:51,260
 he thought it was a great idea.

390
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:52,100
 - He did.

391
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:57,020
 If your folks can unload you on my Aunt Harry if they can go up to the Greens for the weekend

392
00:15:57,020 --> 00:16:00,820
 Homer

393
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:07,520
 You don't want me my parents don't want me Agnes doesn't want me okay, okay?

394
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:14,980
 Okay, but if you think I'm gonna stay home with your Aunt Harry it's rheumatism while you're having the time of your life in Washington

395
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:22,060
 You're crazy. Oh, I'm just never mind feeling sorry for me. Goodbye Henry Aldrich. Homer. You're shoving me up

396
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:23,460
 - Oh, here. - What's this?

397
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:25,580
 - You're a hunting knife. You can't bribe me.

398
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:27,580
 - Listen, Homer. - And here's that key chain

399
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:29,140
 you gave me for Christmas.

400
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:31,060
 It only cost a quarter anyway.

401
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:33,660
 - But Homer-- - Besides that fall-leaf clover

402
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,300
 on it never brought me luck anyway.

403
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,300
 Goodbye.

404
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:39,740
 - Homer, Homer, you're not listening to reason.

405
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:42,320
 (upbeat music)

406
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:48,580
 (audience applauding)

407
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:56,340
 And now it's time to listen to a little reason from Meredith Wilson and his talking people.

408
00:16:56,340 --> 00:17:03,340
 "Inermission, inermission shall we dance?"

409
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:04,340
 Now wait a minute here.

410
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:14,340
 "Jello, bono, tapioca, jello, tapioca, jello orange, that means orange, coco, but..."

411
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:19,340
 Well, I guess you could take over any intermission singing about jello tapioca puddings.

412
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:22,340
 Well, we accept the compliment.

413
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:23,700
 And now back to the audience.

414
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,980
 Hey, hey, wait a minute here.

415
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:27,820
 If we didn't tell everybody that Jellotapioca puddings

416
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:30,820
 are a marvel of goodness and a miracle of speed,

417
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:34,060
 we would be derelict in our duties to the public.

418
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:34,900
 Wow.

419
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:35,500
 Yes.

420
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,700
 Whatever we do, let's don't be whatever that was you said.

421
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:39,700
 OK.

422
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:43,540
 And why are Jellotapioca puddings a marvel of goodness?

423
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:45,900
 Because of three wonderful flavors--

424
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:49,380
 chocolate, vanilla, and orange.

425
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,100
 That means orange coconut.

426
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,460
 I know what it means.

427
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:56,460
 And why are jello tapioca puddings a miracle of speed?

428
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:59,740
 Because they cooked a perfection in just about five minutes.

429
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:02,100
 And what is your favorite polka?

430
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:08,580
 The tap, leooca polka, jello, vanilla tapioca, jello

431
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:12,700
 chocolate tapioca, jello orange.

432
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:15,020
 That means orange coconut.

433
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:17,020
 And now back to the Aldrich family.

434
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:27,220
 Yes, getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldrich.

435
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:29,020
 Mr. Aldrich has made it clear

436
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:32,060
 that taking Homer on the family's trip to Washington

437
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:34,060
 is an impossibility.

438
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:36,380
 Unfortunately for Mr. Aldrich,

439
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:39,580
 neither Henry nor Mrs. Aldrich nor Mr. Brown,

440
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:42,260
 nor a good many other people in San Diego

441
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:45,060
 seem to understand his point of view.

442
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:47,580
 The scene opens in Mr. Aldrich's office.

443
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:49,140
 It is later the same afternoon.

444
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:50,220
 Take a letter, Miss Thompson.

445
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:51,380
 Yes, Mr. Aldrich.

446
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:54,100
 Frankly, I'm a little surprised to see you in the office today.

447
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:57,220
 Well, I thought it might be a good idea to get out of the house.

448
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:59,900
 And well, if I go to Washington with unfinished business

449
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:00,740
 hanging over you.

450
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:01,740
 Yes, Mr. Aldrich.

451
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:05,060
 Take a letter to Mr. J.B. Fletcher, home industries

452
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:07,060
 development corporation, dear Homer.

453
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:07,900
 Dear who?

454
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:10,660
 A Fletcher, dear Mr. Fletcher.

455
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:16,960
 The years of the 18th received and I can readily understand the difficulties involved in changing your entire suitcase.

456
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:17,760
 Entire what?

457
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,560
 Filing system.

458
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:24,660
 However, I feel that once the facts have been weighed and is stand taken,

459
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:29,360
 it is unwise to listen to those who may not be as familiar with the many sides of the problem as you are.

460
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,960
 Yours truly Samuel Orridge. That makes sense, does it, Ms. Thompson?

461
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:35,760
 Yes, Mr. Orridge. Although, have you ever thought of it this way?

462
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,160
 Two boys are a lot easier to entertain than one.

463
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,960
 Now, just a moment, Ms. Thompson.

464
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,320
 But with just a suggestion, Mr. O'Brien.

465
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,920
 - I've had all the suggestions I can use.

466
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:43,760
 Thank you.

467
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,120
 Come in.

468
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,840
 - Am I interrupting, Mr. O'Brien?

469
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,360
 - Oh, no, Mr. Bradley.

470
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,200
 Come in.

471
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,080
 - Thank you.

472
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,600
 - Mr. Thompson, suppose you get that letter off.

473
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,600
 - Oh, yes, Mr. O'Brien.

474
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,920
 Good one.

475
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,280
 - I can only stay a minute.

476
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,520
 I was on my way home and just dropped in to say

477
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,280
 that as far as the school is concerned,

478
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,040
 we have no objection.

479
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:02,880
 - I beg your pardon.

480
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,600
 - I'm sure a trip to Washington will do

481
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,960
 Homer a great deal of good,

482
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,600
 and it certainly can't do the school any harm.

483
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:12,040
 [laughter]

484
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:17,200
 Now, just a moment, Mr. Bradley, I have nothing against Homer Brown.

485
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:22,200
 But this is one trip I'm going on alone with just my family.

486
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,600
 You mean Homer's not going?

487
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,800
 Definitely not.

488
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,600
 Well, I didn't mean to fear that he's...

489
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:30,800
 I got the idea from Agnes that all that was necessary was my official permission.

490
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:34,200
 Agnes was wrong, Mr. Bradley, and I'm sure you can appreciate my position.

491
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,000
 Of course.

492
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 Well, run along.

493
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 Next week was going to be such a pleasant change with Homer and Henry in Washington.

494
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 Goodbye Mr. Bradley.

495
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 Bye.

496
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 I've got him at Thompson.

497
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 Hello.

498
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 Sam, this is Harold Green.

499
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 Oh yes Harold. I'll say those contracts of yours will have to wait until I get back from Washington.

500
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 Oh that's okay but that isn't why I call.

501
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 Sam, I've got you all fixed up.

502
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 Fixed up, huh?

503
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 A very good friend of mine is the passenger agent for the railroad and is a favorite of me.

504
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 He really buckled down and got him.

505
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 Got him.

506
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 Got what?

507
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 Four birthes for Washington.

508
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 What?

509
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 Only you'll have to take another train that gets in 12 hours later.

510
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 What?

511
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 But at least 15 minutes earlier.

512
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 No, wait a minute.

513
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 And make a note of this sale.

514
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 You change trains at four in the morning in Pittsburgh.

515
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 No, wait a minute!

516
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,880
 Excuse me, I'd like to pick up some tickets for Allrich.

517
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,400
 Hi there, Mr. Allrich.

518
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,400
 God!

519
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,200
 What are you doing behind the ticket window?

520
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,400
 Selling tickets?

521
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,200
 It's my new job, Mr. Allrich.

522
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,600
 Nice indoor work.

523
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,800
 Well, would you?

524
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,000
 Meet a nice class of people here.

525
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,800
 You never see the same face twice.

526
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,200
 You come to pick up your ticket, sir.

527
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:55,400
 Oh, yes. Three birds on the six o'clock train.

528
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,800
 You're cancelling the four on the five forty-five?

529
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:59,800
 I am.

530
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,800
 All right, if you say so.

531
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:06,240
 So you go into Washington, DC, yeah?

532
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,960
 Nice town, Washington.

533
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:08,960
 I'm sure.

534
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,200
 Real credit to the country.

535
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,680
 I was there for the inauguration, you know.

536
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,680
 That's so.

537
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,680
 It's a rebub.

538
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,440
 I had quite a time.

539
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:21,440
 McKinley turned out to be quite a president, too.

540
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,240
 But McKinley.

541
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:27,320
 William-- or was it Taft?

542
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,880
 Let's see.

543
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,160
 There's back in Art 8. No question, there's Art 1.

544
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,560
 - Gus. - Or was it Teddy Roosevelt?

545
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:37,620
 - Gus, I'm sure I-- - Well,

546
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:40,100
 there's back when we had a Republican. I remember that.

547
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:44,140
 Artly a man is now alive.

548
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:45,140
 [laughter]

549
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:46,640
 - It's Sir E. Bob.

550
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,640
 [laughter]

551
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,040
 You ought to have a real nice time.

552
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:55,240
 - Well, frankly, Gus, I'm not too sure. - Not sure, boy.

553
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:58,520
 All I've heard all day is Homer Brown. Homer Brown.

554
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,720
 gets pretty discouraging.

555
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,720
 Yes, I can see where it would.

556
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:04,220
 Gosh, you have no idea the pressure that's been put on me,

557
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:06,620
 but Gus, I'm not going to but.

558
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:08,220
 That's right, Mr. Orange.

559
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,820
 A man, if he is a man, that is,

560
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:13,220
 has got to be free to make up his own mind.

561
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:15,520
 Well, I'm glad to hear someone say that.

562
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,420
 Here's your ticket.

563
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:17,520
 Oh, thank you.

564
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,720
 Only, if you don't mind my mention in it,

565
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,120
 there's no overlook in the fact that travel,

566
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,320
 it broadens a young man.

567
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,420
 Now, just a minute.

568
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:28,420
 I got to agree with your missus there.

569
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:31,220
 - Yes, I'd have to get back to my family in the waiting room.

570
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:32,860
 - Okay, have a good time.

571
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:33,940
 - Thank you.

572
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:35,660
 - Oh, it was Coolidge.

573
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:38,420
 Grace Coolidge's husband, Kelvin Coolidge, that's all.

574
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:41,500
 (audience laughing)

575
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,340
 - What?

576
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:44,300
 - I've been looking all over the station for you.

577
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,340
 - Now just a moment, Homer.

578
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,340
 - Mr. Orter, I've been thinking it over,

579
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:50,700
 and she was why be a sore head?

580
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:51,540
 - What?

581
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:54,340
 - I mean, she was, we've been friends for a long time,

582
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:58,100
 and well, now that you're really on your way,

583
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:00,540
 Have a good time, Mr. Aldrich.

584
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:01,540
 Here.

585
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:02,900
 What?

586
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,700
 A basket of fruit.

587
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:05,500
 Yes, sir.

588
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,420
 To eat on the train.

589
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:09,300
 If there seemed to be a few pieces missing,

590
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,580
 I just wanted to be sure everything was fresh.

591
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:13,460
 [LAUGHTER]

592
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:15,820
 Homer, I hardly--

593
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:16,320
 Hard--

594
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,420
 And here's something else I'd like you to have, Mr.

595
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:21,020
 Aldrich, a map of the city of Washington.

596
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:22,660
 I rode away for it last week.

597
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:23,580
 Thank you, Homer.

598
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:24,980
 I've got it all marked, see?

599
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:26,900
 You start at the White House the first day,

600
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:29,540
 and follow the red line. Then the second day you started to...

601
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:32,100
 Well, you really got this all planned out, haven't you?

602
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:36,340
 I've sort of been fooling around with it all week. Here.

603
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:38,340
 Oh, well.

604
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:40,980
 Find voyage, Mr. Aldrich.

605
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,340
 And...

606
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:43,380
 Shane.

607
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:44,220
 A Homer...

608
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:45,540
 Shane, Mr. Aldrich.

609
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:46,620
 Yes, Homer, Shane.

610
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:47,620
 Shane.

611
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:48,620
 Shane.

612
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:49,620
 And Homer...

613
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:50,420
 Yes, Mr. Aldrich.

614
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:52,820
 Homer, all of us make mistakes sometimes in our lives,

615
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:56,020
 and I'd like to say that this is one time I've made one.

616
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:57,080
 You, Mr. Olmuth?

617
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:01,860
 Yes, me, Homer. I know it's too late now, but I sincerely wish you were going with it.

618
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:03,400
 You really want to take me?

619
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,160
 Yes, if it weren't too late.

620
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,660
 Gee, why is it too late?

621
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:09,800
 But why, you would have to go all the way home and pack it.

622
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:13,200
 No, I wouldn't. I've got my suitcase checked right here in the station.

623
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,100
 [laughter]

624
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:15,600
 What?

625
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,400
 Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

626
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,780
 Homer, what's the matter?

627
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:20,300
 Homer.

628
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:22,640
 Wait a year, wait a year, Henry.

629
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,040
 Why?

630
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,040
 Guess who's going to Washington?

631
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:40,640
 [Music]

632
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,200
 Sam, Sam are you up?

633
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,300
 Mmm...

634
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:47,000
 Sam wake up, we're coming into Pittsburgh.

635
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,100
 Pittsburgh? How else we're going to Washington?

636
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:53,340
 Yes dear, but this is where we change trains.

637
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:55,340
 Oh, oh yes.

638
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:57,340
 Is it four in the morning already?

639
00:25:57,340 --> 00:26:00,340
 Yes, the boys are getting our bags out to the platform.

640
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:01,340
 Are you dressed?

641
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:04,340
 I did none dress. Four in the morning.

642
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:06,340
 Sam, I'm very proud of you.

643
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:07,340
 Yes.

644
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:12,340
 After all the pressure we put on you, you're really taking the whole thing very nicely.

645
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:17,340
 Forget it, Alice. I had a feeling all along I was fighting a losing battle.

646
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:22,340
 Now you don't worry. I'm sure Homer won't be any trouble at all.

647
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:24,820
 Why so far you could hardly tell he's along.

648
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:28,340
 You could hardly tell he's along, but he's been sleeping right above me.

649
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:32,340
 Three times he went to the washroom.

650
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,060
 For a glass of water.

651
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:37,460
 Three times he managed to step on my face, getting down.

652
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:41,220
 You're come quick!

653
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:43,540
 Hand-ready, quiet! You wake up the whole car.

654
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:45,780
 But it's Homer, mother. There's something wrong with him.

655
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:46,660
 Oh, dear.

656
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:50,660
 He's just sitting on his bags down there at the end of the car and he won't say a word.

657
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:52,460
 Sam, do you suppose he's train sick?

658
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:55,060
 With all the water he's been drinking, it's more like with sea sick.

659
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:57,660
 We've got to go see what's wrong.

660
00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:01,460
 Homer?

661
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:03,260
 Homer, dear, what's happened?

662
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:05,860
 Jean, Mrs. Allrich, I feel terrible.

663
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:07,460
 What is it, Homer, old-timer?

664
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:09,060
 Your sinus again?

665
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:10,060
 No.

666
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:12,660
 You didn't try to finish that whole basket of fruit, did you?

667
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:13,660
 It isn't that.

668
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:14,660
 It's the wheels.

669
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:15,660
 What wheels?

670
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:16,660
 Of the train.

671
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:17,660
 Listen to them.

672
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:20,760
 Clickety-clack, clickety-clack, clickety-clack.

673
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:21,860
 They make it dizzy?

674
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:22,460
 No.

675
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:27,660
 They just made me realize we're getting further and further away from Sanneville all the time.

676
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:28,060
 What?

677
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:30,060
 Further away from all my friends.

678
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:30,860
 It's not home.

679
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:33,260
 Further away from my mother and father.

680
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:34,160
 Home.

681
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:39,660
 Mr. Alberch, when we get off at Pittsburgh, can I get a train going back the other way?

682
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:41,660
 Now, wait a minute!

683
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,660
 (applause)

684
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:58,620
 - Hi, Henry, hi, Homer.

685
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:01,100
 - Well, Gee, it's Willie Marshall.

686
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:02,980
 - Willie, what are you doing on this train?

687
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:03,940
 - Going to Washington?

688
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:05,380
 Are you fellas going to?

689
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:07,100
 - Oh, boy.

690
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:11,140
 - Boy, Henry, going to Washington with Willie tagging along

691
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:15,020
 like having your mother-in-law and your honeymoon.

692
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:20,820
 Well, here I come along with some good news about the wonderful new Jello Rice pudding.

693
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:25,300
 Yes, Jello Rice pudding, newest member of the famous Jello pudding family.

694
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:27,900
 The quickest, easiest rice pudding you ever made.

695
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:31,540
 The richest, creamiest rice pudding you've ever dipped a spoon in.

696
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:34,540
 All you do is add milk and boil gently for 10 minutes.

697
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:39,020
 No fussy mixing, no bothersome custard, no cooking for hours on end.

698
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:43,780
 You can have it baked or boiled, thick or thin, easy directions on every package.

699
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:45,460
 So buy it, try it.

700
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:47,120
 The 10-minute marvel.

701
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,820
 Look for it on your grocer's dessert shelf.

702
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:56,340
 Jello Rice Pudding, America's newest dessert miracle.

703
00:28:56,340 --> 00:29:01,060
 The Aldrich family starring as Ruston as Henry with Jackie Kalkas Homer is written by Norman

704
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:04,020
 Tokar and Ed Juris with music by Jack Miller.

705
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:07,460
 Mr. and Mrs. Aldrich are House Jamison and Katherine Roth.

706
