00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000
 Great nuts and great nuts plates present. Henry! Henry all great. Coming mother. The All-Great Family.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
 [applause]

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 [music]

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
 Young by your minute, great nuts like Star Wars by your minute,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.800
 Sugar roasted, new and better there,

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.440
 Richard now in sweet monster,

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.200
 Sugar roasted, good by your minute,

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.400
 Great nuts, great young young by your minute,

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:38.000
 The Aldrich family based on characters originated by Pippert Goldsmith,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.400
 and starring as Ruston as Henry with Jackie Calcas Homer,

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.400
 is brought to you by great nuts and great nuts, right?

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.400
 Hey, I hear they should have roasted!

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.600
 And now put the Aldrade family.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:01:10.080
 A teenage boy may have his ups and downs, but he's never half way between.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.640
 Henry Aldrich wins the never walks when he can run and never smiles when he can laugh.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.640
 And when he's late for dinner, he's good and late.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.640
 The scene opens at the Aldrich dinner table.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.640
 Sam, can I get you another piece of pie?

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.640
 Oh, thank you. What time is it now?

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.640
 It's a little after 6.30 here.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.640
 Oh, yes. Seems to me it was a little after 6.30 half an hour ago.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.640
 Well, now that I look again, yes, it's getting on towards 7.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.640
 I'm sure, Henry, you'll be home any minute, Father.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.640
 Why don't you put him right out of your mind into just your coffee and newspaper?

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.640
 Mary, I can think of nothing more enjoyable than being able to put Henry right out of my mind.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:57.640
 Look, there, for all dear, he's only a little late, and a little late, when we've already finished dinner?

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.640
 Well, I'm not trying to defend him, but we did eat quickly.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.640
 And my goodness, Father, Henry was much later than this the night before last, and you didn't say a thing, Mary.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.640
 He's been late for dinner three days in a row, and he's late for breakfast every day.

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:10.640
 It's time I put my foot down.

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.640
 Well, the only thing is, the adults think I'm criticizing,

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.640
 but couldn't you just put your foot down gently all the time

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.640
 instead of standing it down only every once in a while and scaring us all to death?

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.640
 Are you insinuating that I'm not a good father?

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:25.640
 I know, dear.

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.640
 My goodness, of course you're a good father, father.

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.640
 Of course you are, dear.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.640
 But won't you let me handle Henry this once?

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.640
 You've been having Henry too long as it is.

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.640
 Sam, are you insinuating that I'm not a good mother?

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.640
 My goodness, Father, look out the window! Here he comes!

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.640
 See, he's coming up the street, pulling a wagon.

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.640
 Yes. What time is it?

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.640
 It's a little after 6.30, Sam.

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.640
 Look at him.

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.640
 Ambling as long as we had all the time in the world.

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:58.640
 Well, yes, but...

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:59.640
 As he got on that wagon.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.640
 It looks like pop bottles.

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.640
 Now what's he stopping for?

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.040
 He's probably tying his shoe lace.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.360
 He's picking a bottle up out of the gutter.

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.880
 [laughter]

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.440
 Look at him standing there looking at it.

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.120
 It's all right, Sandy, he's putting it back in the gutter.

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.360
 Mother, do you think I should go out and tell him to hurry?

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.360
 You say where you are, Mary.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.920
 This is very interesting.

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.000
 Look at that.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.360
 But you're what's wrong with stopping to pet a dog.

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.000
 Look, isn't that thoughtful of him?

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 He's offering the dog a candy.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
 Probably it won't take it.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
 I dare say the dog knew enough to go home in time to get his dinner.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
 Mother, oh, I know dear.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 Henry, come in here.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 We let him eat first father before we scold him.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
 Oh, everybody, his dinner ready and boy, I'm starving.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 I'll go and eat something up.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000
 Alice, say here.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
 Boy, what a time I've been having.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
 Father, are you going to get us a prize?

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
 Henry, are you going to get us a prize?

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 Henry, do you realize what time it is?

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000
 Why?

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.500
 You've been eating your meals here for a good many years now and you're aware of the fact that your mother served in a promptly at six o'clock.

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.300
 You mean it isn't six o'clock yet?

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.500
 Sam, why don't you buy him a watch?

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.000
 Henry, according to your mother, it's a little after six thirty.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000
 It is?

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.100
 Well, gee whiz, I have to be someplace at half past seven.

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:17.800
 I'll have to eat dinner in a hurry.

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:21.100
 If you've been interested in dinner, you would have been here at six o'clock.

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:22.200
 Now please go to your room.

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.900
 You're not going to eat dinner in my room?

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:25.800
 [audience laughter]

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.900
 I mean, son, you're not going to eat dinner at all.

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.900
 You mean you weighed everything up?

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:32.900
 [laughter]

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.900
 Henry stop arguing and go up to your room.

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:36.900
 Sure Father.

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.900
 But that's perfectly alright.

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.900
 I'm not going anywhere.

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.900
 So, supposing I go and sit in my room...

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:44.900
 Good.

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.900
 ...until a quarter after seven.

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:48.900
 You will sit in your room until I tell you to come out.

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.900
 But Father, I have to be someplace and have past seven.

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.900
 When you were rummaging around the streets picking up bottles,

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:57.900
 it had occurred to you that you had to be someplace at six o'clock.

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.000
 Father, I was a...

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.200
 Now look, I told you to do something.

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:01.700
 But Father, yes Father.

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:06.600
 And I hope you enjoyed your dinner.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:10.200
 That roast meat certainly smells good.

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:13.600
 Sam, hold it, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.300
 Ashamed? What should I be?

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:19.400
 As a matter of fact, Alice, I believe I will have that piece of pie now.

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:20.200
 Yes?

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.100
 Well, you'll find it in the kitchen.

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:32.100
 [Music]

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:37.100
 All right, mother. The coast is clear. Good. You go on downstairs, Mary, and be on the lookout for your father.

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:42.100
 As soon as I get this sandwich, end the Henry. I'll come down too. All right, mother. Henry.

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:49.100
 Oh, Henry? Yes, mother. Alice? Oh, dear. Alice, what on earth are you doing?

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:52.100
 I'll just stand in here eating a sandwich there.

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:53.100
 Yeah?

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:55.100
 Would you like a bite?

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:58.100
 No, thank you, Alice. I just finished my dinner.

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:00.100
 Mother, what did you call me for?

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:02.100
 I didn't call you, Henry.

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:04.100
 Are you eating something, Mother?

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:05.100
 Yes, I'm...

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:07.100
 A sandwich.

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:08.100
 Is it good?

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:09.100
 Yes.

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:11.100
 It's delicious.

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:13.100
 Hey Henry.

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:15.100
 Come along, Alice.

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:17.100
 This is Henry's apparently room, Homer.

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:19.340
 I think we finished this dinner, Mrs. Oliver.

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:20.340
 You know he hasn't.

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:22.740
 The home I don't meant to think to it.

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:23.740
 Why not?

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:25.940
 Hey Henry, are you in here?

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:26.940
 Yeah.

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:27.940
 Behind.

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:28.940
 Behind.

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:30.940
 She, does that roast beef you had for dinner smell good?

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:32.500
 Boy, my one chance.

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:36.860
 My one big chance to earn that pipe I've been wanting at the Havens drug store.

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:37.860
 A pipe in here?

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:40.060
 Yeah, and I have to stay here in my room.

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:43.540
 She was, do you think I'm old enough to smoke a pipe too?

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:46.940
 It isn't for me, it's for my father's birthday next week.

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:49.940
 Oh, well I guess he's old enough.

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:52.940
 Gee whiz, Mr. Dehaven gave me a job to do,

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:55.940
 and all I have to do is have it done by nine o'clock from night,

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:57.940
 and he'll pay me the price.

00:06:57.940 --> 00:06:59.940
 What's the job, Henry? Is it mixing sodas?

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:02.940
 Maybe I could do it for you, if it's mixing sodas.

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:06.940
 Point Homer, would ya? You see the small pile of overdue bills?

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:10.940
 All you have to do is go around and collect them all by nine o'clock.

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:13.940
 Oh, well I don't think I'd be any good at collecting money.

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:15.940
 I'm not going to get any allowance at all.

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:20.940
 But look, Homer, I've already collected five bills, and that's not counting Mrs. Clark,

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:23.940
 who paid me off with a wagon load of ginger ale bottles.

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:28.940
 I'd like to, Henry. Only my doctor says I have to take it easy.

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:30.940
 Okay. That's all right, Homer.

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:32.940
 I'm not going to get any allowance at all.

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:35.940
 But look, Homer, I've already collected five bills, and that's not counting Mrs. Clark,

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:38.940
 who paid me off with a wagon load of ginger ale bottles.

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:42.940
 I'd like to, Henry. Only my doctor says I have to take it easy.

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:44.440
 That's alright, Homer.

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:47.600
 Naturally, I can't force you to help me.

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:50.240
 And will you please stop swinging on my bed pose?

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:53.640
 I will hurt myself, and we have been doing this since I was a kid,

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:55.640
 and I've never fallen yet.

00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:56.540
 Ouch!

00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:59.140
 Boy, I did that on purpose.

00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:01.740
 Henry, stop that racket!

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:03.240
 Now, look what you did, Homer.

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:04.740
 My father thought that was me.

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:06.340
 He thought that...

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:06.940
 Homer!

00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:08.940
 Henry, you're choking!

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:11.540
 Homer, my father thought you were me!

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:13.140
 Don't you realize what that means?

00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:14.140
 It means he's crazy.

00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:15.340
 And let go.

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:20.940
 Listen Homer, if you were to stay here in my room for an hour or so, see, and move around

00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:21.940
 from time to time.

00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:24.740
 Oh no, Henry, oh no.

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:26.440
 Homer, who'd know the difference?

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:30.940
 I could get out the back way and collect those bills and all you'll have to do is sit here.

00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:34.940
 But Henry, my doctor says I should be out getting some exercise.

00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:42.940
 (Music)

00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:46.940
 Yes? Good evening Mr. Collins.

00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:50.940
 Oh, is that Henry Olridge? Yes sir. How are you anyway sir?

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:52.940
 I'm fine thank you. And Mrs. Collins?

00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:54.940
 She's fine thank you. And the children?

00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:56.940
 What children? Oh.

00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:57.940
 (Laughter)

00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:02.940
 Well, speaking of children Mr. Collins,

00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:09.320
 You watch some ice cream and saw from Mr. Dehaven last October. I don't remember that about two dollars worth

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:17.240
 Well, there'll be more exact exactly two dollars worth. Here's the bill. Mr. Collins. Yes, it must have slipped your mind

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:23.560
 The only thing is Henry. I'm a little short tonight, but look do you know mr. Dixon over 23 maple stream?

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:29.020
 I don't think so he owes me 250 so you going over there and collect from him and say I sent you 250

00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:31.020
 And you just give me 50 cents.

00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:34.320
 Oh, Zee was the only thing is I have it much time.

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:37.420
 I sort of have a friend sitting in for me at home.

00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:41.220
 I mean, are you sure I'll be able to collect for Mr. Dixon?

00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:42.120
 Sure thing.

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:45.320
 Well, here's your 50 cents, but, Vee, I sure--

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:47.320
 And Henry, when you get back to the drugstore,

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:49.720
 would you tell the Haven to send me up a carton of cigarettes?

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:50.320
 Sure.

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:51.920
 Would you like to pay me for them now?

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:52.620
 No, no.

00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:53.720

 No, and I tried standing here in the doorway and talking, man.

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:10.720
 I had to go to his high school girl.

 When Henry arrived home late for dinner,

 Mr. Aldrich felt he should be punished, but the reason for Henry's lateness was that he was trying to earn a pipe for his father's birthday present.

 What $10?

00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:55.180
 The one down in this hole, father under the grading, it blew out of my hand.

00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:56.780
 Do you realize that you disobeyed me?

00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:59.180

 No father, it was her father.

00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:14.180
 Well, he didn't know it to me.

00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:15.180
 He owed it to another man.

00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:21.500
 I gave him 50 cents because it was a bill from last our told me are you trying to tell me that you owed somebody 50 cents since last October

00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:26.740
 After all the times I told you never to borrow money. No, father. I just borrowed the baby and then it fell down this grading

00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:34.300
 What the not the baby the ten dollars? Oh boy my father just let me explain one thing to me

00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:39.000
 Let me explain one thing to you. You're a smart right straight home and go up to your room and stay there

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.180
 Do you understand my father that ten dollars belongs to a man over at 23 maple store?

00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:46.640
 Now get the ten dollars out of here, all I have to do is reach in for it.

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:47.640
 Now go on home.

00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:48.640

 I guess you didn't understand.

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:42.260
 - Now, Henry, didn't you say you want to get a pipe

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:43.520
 as a presses for your father?

00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:44.520
 - Yeah, sure.

00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:47.560
 Gee, if I made that clear, that's all that matters.

 - No, for father's birthday.

 You can hide in my basement for the next few days.

00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:08.040
 Now, what am I?

00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:10.040
 He isn't going to do any such thing.

00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:12.040
 If Father said he was to go straight to his roof,

00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:16.040
 but Mother, I just have to collect six more of these bills before 9 o'clock.

00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:20.040
 Wouldn't you consider letting me go out for only half an hour?

00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:21.040
 No, dear.

00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:23.040
 Your father's going around saying that I spoil you.

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:24.040
 Look, Mother.

00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:29.040
 Do you suppose there's a way that I could collect the money and still not leave my room at all?

00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:39.040
 [Music]

00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:45.040
 Wait a minute. Now Mr. Olridge for the last time. If you don't stay down on your knees there's nothing I can do for you.

00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:48.040
 How long do you think I can hold this position? My back's nearly broken.

00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:51.040
 Well, you're going to get your arm broken if you don't hold it.

00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:56.040
 Well, then kindly hurry up. You realize I had to walk six blocks with this grate on my arm?

00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:57.800
 Yes, Mr. Allrich.

00:18:57.800 --> 00:18:59.960
 But I can say I like your attitude.

00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:03.000
 Do you realize I closed this hardware store two hours ago

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.840
 and I came from clear across town to help you?

00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:06.200
 Yes, of course I didn't mean that.

00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:07.920
 And I'm doing the very best I can.

00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:10.800
 I realize that, Mr. Jackson, and I appreciate it very much.

00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:11.800
 All right.

00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:13.440
 Now, see if you can hold still.

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:17.880
 Very well, Mr. Allrich.

00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:20.600
 If that's your attitude, you can go straight to the right sniff.

00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:28.600

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:31.100
 Hello Mrs. Walker, this is Alice Olgrich.

00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:35.600
 I just thought I'd phone and give you that chocolate cake recipe you've been wanting.

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:41.600
 Well, yes, it's always been a family secret, but I just decided there's no point in being selfish about it.

00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:48.600
 Oh, and by the way, Mrs. Walker, did you know that you owe the Haven's drug store $9.13?

00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:51.660
 Yes, of course you'd forgotten about it, dear.

00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:54.400
 Supposing I sent Homer Brown over to pick it up.

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:56.800
 And then he'll be glad to give you the recipe.

00:19:56.800 --> 00:20:04.800

00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:05.800
 Hello.

00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:08.300
 Hello, are you still there, Doris?

00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:09.800
 Well, I know I'm not home.

00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:12.800
 I'm sitting here in some stranger's house mining a baby.

00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:13.800
 [laughter]

00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:15.800
 No, dear, a baby.

00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:17.200
 I know, dear, but listen.

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:20.200
 I gave a young boy ten dollars and he was going to change it.

00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:22.560
 No dear, change the ten dollars.

00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:25.200
 Oh, but dear, you don't understand.

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:30.600
 Dear, goodbye, dear.

00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:32.080
 Excuse me, is your name right here?

00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:33.600
 Yes, are you the father?

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:34.440
 Right, yes.

00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:35.840
 Well, I'm certainly glad you're here.

00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:36.240
 Come on in.

00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:36.640
 Thank you.

00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:37.720
 Just a minute now.

00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:39.920
 If I can manage to get my bill pulled out.

00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:41.800
 I notice your arm is in a sling.

00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:42.600
 Were you in an accident?

00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:43.440
 Yes.

00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:44.680
 Here's your ten dollars.

00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:45.240
 Thank you.

00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:46.600
 I'll just get my coat up.

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:48.960
 Wait a minute. Where did you get the ten dollars?

00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:52.600
 Look, I'm trying to forget. Time to take the money and let's not talk about it.

00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:56.200
 Well, that's too clean. I'll drive into the heavens and pay that bill on my way home.

00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:57.000
 Good evening.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.300
 Oh, here. Wait. I'm leaving too.

00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:00.200
 Oh, no. No, you can't. You're wisest in home.

00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:01.500
 Oh. You'll have to stay with a baby.

00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:02.300
 Oh.

00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:02.800
 Good evening.

00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:04.000
 Good evening.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.600
 That's right. Wait a minute. What baby?

00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:16.600
 [Music]

00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:18.300
 Henry, what time is it?

00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:21.800
 It's... it's just a little after nine o'clock, mother.

00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:25.200
 Henry, it must be an hour since you said it was only a little before nine o'clock.

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:27.900
 Jim, sure father will be home any minute.

00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:30.400
 After all, he's only two hours late.

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:32.600
 Oh, let's see that pipe again, Henry.

00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:33.300
 Here.

00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:35.100
 Boy, isn't it a beauty?

00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:35.900
 I'll say.

00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:38.940
 And was Mr. D. Haven surprised when I took him all the money.

00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:39.440
 Yeah?

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:42.580
 He said to tell you you were the best bill collector he ever had.

00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:47.080
 Jean, mother, and to think that chocolate cake has been a family secret for generations.

00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:48.020
 Henry!

00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:48.920
 Yes, Mary?

00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:51.020
 I have a ticket paper out here in the kitchen.

00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:52.660
 Do you want to wrap father's pie?

00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:55.060
 Sure, Mary. Can we do it up real fancy?

00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:56.900
 You better step on it, Hinn.

00:21:56.900 --> 00:21:58.760
 So your father doesn't see it.

00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:00.460
 Oh, my, what time is it now?

00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:01.460
 Oh, there it is.

00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:03.660
 Oh, boy. I'm going home.

00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:04.900
 Who's going to name Mrs. O'Lor.

00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:06.400
 Are you in the living room, Alice?

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:08.000
 Sam, old Rick, where have you been?

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.500
 Alice, I can explain everything.

00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:11.600
 Oh, my goodness, your arm. You've been in an accident.

00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:14.700
 No, Alice, this wouldn't have happened if Mr. Jackson hadn't lost his temper.

00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:18.000
 All I said was out. You'd say out, too, if I was twisting his arm off.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.700
 So that's it. You've been fighting at your age.

00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:26.300
 Listen to me, Alice. This $10 bill fell down a grading, and I got my arm caught in it trying to reach the money.

00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:28.200
 Was Mr. Jackson trying to reach the money, too?

00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:34.600
 No, dear. I had to lift the whole grading off with my arm still in it, and then I had to get down into the hole and get to $10.

00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:36.200
 You mean Mr. Jackson pushed you in?

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:38.200
 No, no. I got in by myself.

00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:40.100
 And Mr. Jackson wouldn't let you out?

00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:41.500
 I was forget about Mr. Jackson.

00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:43.300
 Well, my goodness, you didn't yell.

00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:46.800
 Thank you, if that's the way you were, I don't blame him for hitting you.

00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:49.700
 Alice, listen. Mr. Jackson did not hit me.

00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:52.900
 Mr. Jackson didn't do a thing except fight my head off.

00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:54.200
 Then why are you so late?

00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:55.900
 Because I've been binding the baby.

00:22:55.900 --> 00:22:56.700
 What baby?

00:22:56.700 --> 00:22:57.700
 Well, you see, I went...

00:22:57.700 --> 00:22:58.600
 Mr.

00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:01.100
 Never mind, you wouldn't believe it anyway.

00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:05.200
 Mother, have you got a longer piece of ribbon I could tie around this?

00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:06.200
 Henry!

00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:07.200
 This...

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:08.200
 Oh, she wished.

00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:09.200
 Why aren't you in your room?

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:11.200
 Oh, I'm going, Father, but...

00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:14.200
 Do you mind my asking what happened to your arm?

00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:16.200
 Mr. Jackson did it, dear.

00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:18.200
 Henry, wait a minute.

00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:20.200
 What's that you're holding behind your back?

00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:21.200
 Oh, boy.

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:23.200
 Well, when isn't anything, Father?

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:24.200
 Just...

00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:25.200
 ...gonna just some tissue paper.

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:27.200
 Yes, in that case. Let me have it, please.

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:30.200
 Sam, Father, couldn't you just wait a day or so?

00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:31.200
 I mean...

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:32.200
 Yes, sir.

00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:34.400
 Watch in here, another pop bottle?

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:36.200
 No, sir, it's...

00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:37.200
 It's...

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:38.200
 Well...

00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:40.200
 Happy birthday, Father.

00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:43.200
 Only I certainly hadn't planned it this way.

00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:45.200
 You mean this is...

00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:46.200
 This pipe is...

00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:48.200
 It's your birthday present, Sam.

00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:49.200
 It is?

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:51.200
 Bye-bye, Bertie.

00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:53.200
 And Henry earned it himself, collecting bills.

00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:57.200
 That's why he left his room, and incidentally, if I was late for dinner.

00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:59.200
 Well...

00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:03.200
 Well, you see Alice? It's a pipe.

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:05.200
 [audience laughter]

00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:08.200
 Well, it's about the best looking one I've ever seen.

00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:10.200
 Boy, Father, do you really like it?

00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:12.200
 Yes, indeed, Henry.

00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:15.200
 Well, Mike's son.

00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:16.200
 He earned it, son.

00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:18.200
 Yes, Alice, I know.

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:19.200
 [audience laughter]

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:21.200
 Well, Henry, so you earned it.

00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:22.200
 Yes, sir.

00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:24.200
 Well...

00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:26.200
 And you know the next thing I'm going to earn, Father?

00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:32.080
 father a watch so I won't ever be late for dinner again well done you couldn't

00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:37.840
 help being late sometimes things happen Henry that are beyond our control but

00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:42.160
 just the same father it's not going to happen again you see the stack of bills

00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:46.480
 yes mr. de Haven sent them up here with Homer he said if I can do was good a

00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:50.800
 job collecting these he'll pay me a lot well I think that's very commendable

00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:55.120
 Henry when do you start right now father did you know you owe mr. de Haven

00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:57.520
 twelve dollars and a quarter from before Christmas.

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:11.120
 Hey Mr. East, I knew a character who prided himself on never being laid except once.

00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:12.720
 Well what happened that time Mr. Zipp?

00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:18.720
 Well his character sets up for his own wedding, 240 miles upstate, but along comes a blizzard and stops the train.

00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:23.520
 So he hires a horse and slave, but the horse gives up climbs up into the sleigh and goes down to sleigh.

00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:28.520
 Yes, so next he gets to slam the dog team, but the dogs wear out and give up.

00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:31.520
 So then my friend gets out, he skis, hugs free dogs under each arm,

00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:36.520
 and mush is all the way to the church just in time to prevent the best man from eloping with his girl.

00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:41.520
 Man, what energy! Why, he must have been eating great nuts!

00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:43.520
 He was! He told me!

00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:47.520
 Them sugar roasted great nuts! Any objections?

00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:49.520
 Nary a one, Mr. Pip!

00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:51.520
 I like a little mush in myself!

00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:58.880
 and friends, well you may not want to plow through blizzards, it's great to have the

00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:02.100
 energy so you plow through the day's work like lightning.

00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:06.560
 And it is great nuts for energy, great nuts for important bodybuilding food values of

00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:07.960
 the whole grain.

00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:12.960
 And don't forget this one delicious flavor comes in two delicious forms, great nuts,

00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:17.720
 crisp crunchy kernels, and great nuts flakes, empty toasty brown flakes.

00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:21.320
 Both sugar roasted, crisply toasted, and naturally nourishing.
