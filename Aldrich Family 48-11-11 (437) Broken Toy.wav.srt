 how about a lot of heart that plays a tabio kopoca look up and try to tell you

25
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,280
 henry does not even have a car

26
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:54,880
 who

27
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:55,760
 is

28
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,200
 uh...

29
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,900
 How would the tapioca polka sound on a bicycle bell?

30
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:05,360
 The tapioca polka would sound good anywhere because it stands for jello tapioca puddings

31
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,120
 and three wonderful flavors.

32
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,320
 What are the puddings with the personality?

33
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,840
 And dimples.

34
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,120
 And shall we dance?

35
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,280
 Why not?

36
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,280
 Jello!

37
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,800
 But it was tapioca.

38
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,080
 Jello chocolate tapioca.

39
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,320
 Jello orange.

40
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,440
 That means orange coconut.

41
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:51,440
 they cooked a perfection in just about five minutes. Jello tapioca puddings. But you won't like them. Whoa, no, not much. Hey, look at that clock. It's time for the old rich family based on characters originated by Clifford Goldsmith and starring Ezra Stone as Henry with Jackie Kelt as Homer.

42
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:55,440
 Henry! Henry Olridge!

43
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,440
 Coming, Mother!

44
00:01:56,440 --> 00:02:17,440
 The everyday life of an average teenage boy like Henry Olridge is always a highly involved affair.

45
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:22,440
 And no matter how hard his parents try, they rarely seem to simplify things.

46
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:27,440
 The scene opens on Kathleen Anderson's front porch. It is Saturday afternoon.

47
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,440
 Ring the doorbell, Homer.

48
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:33,440
 Boy, Henry, if Kathleen's father had barred me from their house for three weeks,

49
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,440
 I wouldn't come running back on my hands in these.

50
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,440
 Homer, Mr. Anderson had every right.

51
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,440
 He did.

52
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,440
 Well, sure. Quiet, Homer, I hear someone coming.

53
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,440
 Wipe your feet.

54
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,440
 Before we even off, we'll welcome.

55
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,440
 Oh, good afternoon.

56
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,440
 Good afternoon, Mr. Anderson.

57
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,440
 Good afternoon, Mr. Anderson.

58
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,440
 Oh, it's a nice afternoon, isn't it?

59
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,440
 It is?

60
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,440
 Yes, sir.

61
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,440
 It's such a nice afternoon.

62
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:05,440
 We thought, why not come over and pass the time of day with good old Kathleen?

63
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,440
 I see.

64
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,440
 And her family.

65
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,440
 Well, you're here, so come in.

66
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,440
 Kathleen Henry is here.

67
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,600
 - It is?

68
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,680
 Well, my goodness, time I'll be down in just a second.

69
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,400
 - She'll be down in just a second.

70
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,720
 - Yes, sir.

71
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,640
 Thank you, sir.

72
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:28,920
 - Well, well, it's a nice afternoon.

73
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:33,640
 It's good seeing you again, Mr. Anderson.

74
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,480
 - Again?

75
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,200
 - Oh, yes, it's been nearly a week

76
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,080
 since you've been here, hasn't it?

77
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,560
 - Why, yeah, I think it's closer to three.

78
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,560
 You don't say.

79
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,560
 Uh-huh.

80
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,880
 Time certainly passes quickly under favorable conditions.

81
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:51,320
 Did I mention that it's a very nice afternoon?

82
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,320
 You did.

83
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,520
 Now if you'll excuse me.

84
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,120
 You're leaving Mr. Anderson?

85
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,280
 It's such a nice afternoon.

86
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,840
 I think I'll go down on the basement.

87
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,840
 Oh Mr. Anderson?

88
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,840
 Yes, Henry.

89
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,200
 I just thought you'd like to know that this time I plan to keep an eye on my elbows every

90
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,680
 minute I'm here.

91
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,680
 Fine.

92
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,080
 Homer, stop walking around.

93
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,040
 I told you to keep your eyes on your feet.

94
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,040
 I am Henry.

95
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,960
 She was, I know, exactly where they are.

96
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,560
 Which is the lamp you broke?

97
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,200
 The table lamp there.

98
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,200
 No kidding.

99
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,520
 She can hardly tell it's been damaged.

100
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:25,400
 Homer, before it ran into my elbows, it was a floor lamp.

101
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:29,640
 Oh, she no wonder things get broken.

102
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:33,520
 Look at this toy lying here on the edge of the coffee table, right where anyone could

103
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,520
 knock it off.

104
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:38,080
 If Homer put it down, it probably belongs to Kathleen's little brother.

105
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,880
 I'm just moving it to a spot where it won't cause any trouble.

106
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,080
 But Homer.

107
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,880
 Oh, Homer.

108
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,280
 I knew it went off by itself.

109
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,080
 Oh, stop it.

110
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,080
 Oh, whack that button to gently.

111
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,880
 Oh, boy.

112
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,680
 Henry!

113
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,480
 Oh, she was.

114
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,680
 Yes, Kathleen.

115
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,080
 Would you please see who's on the phone?

116
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,480
 The phone?

117
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:00,880
 Kathleen, I think it must have been a wrong number.

118
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,680
 Homer, put that toy back where it was.

119
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,680
 Sure, Henry.

120
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:09,320
 Do you happen to know where this little man goes in the spring?

121
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:12,680
 Gee whiz Homer, where did they come from?

122
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,920
 Henry, I give you my word.

123
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:17,040
 I just picked a toy up and it came apart in my hand.

124
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,960
 Well, fix it, Homer, fix it.

125
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,440
 Or I'll never be able to look him in the face again.

126
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,240
 Henry, if worse came to worse, you could tell him I broke it.

127
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:24,760
 You?

128
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,320
 I don't mind not looking him in the face again.

129
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,400
 That wouldn't help, Homer.

130
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,360
 He always lumps us together.

131
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,520
 Now Bob, come along.

132
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,240
 Oh boy, it's Mrs. Anderson.

133
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,900
 Or grab the toy and let's beat it.

134
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,240
 Beat it, but we just came.

135
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,020
 Homer, we have to fix it before Mr. Anderson finds out.

136
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,940
 And this is no place to do it.

137
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:42,440
 Bob!

138
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,240
 I'm going to hide the toy under your jacket.

139
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,940
 Can we quit on ticklish?

140
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:46,940
 Here.

141
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,840
 Well, no, boys.

142
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,040
 How about Mrs. Anderson?

143
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,540
 Oh, Mrs. Anderson.

144
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:53,940
 Homer, aren't you putting on a little weight?

145
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,140
 Wait.

146
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:57,240
 I guess it's the way I'm built.

147
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,540
 More or less.

148
00:05:58,540 --> 00:05:59,540
 What's the down, boys?

149
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:01,240
 Make yourself comfortable.

150
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,040
 Sit down.

151
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:02,940
 Why, uh--

152
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:07,200
 We were just thinking of stepping out for a breath of air.

153
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,200
 Sure.

154
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:12,040
 I always take a breath about now.

155
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,880
 Shall I tell Kathleen you be right back?

156
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:19,600
 Why, that depends on how quickly that depends.

157
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,200
 Come on home.

158
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:23,000
 It's been nice seeing you again.

159
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,720
 Bob, you shouldn't have mentioned Homer's weight.

160
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,040
 The Browns are very sensitive about their shapes.

161
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:28,920
 That's strange.

162
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,960
 It's gone.

163
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:30,640
 What is?

164
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:35,440
 Herbert's toy. I put it here on the coffee table while I went down to the basement for a screwdriver.

165
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,380
 Is that why I found you working that jigsaw puzzle?

166
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:41,320
 I wasn't working it. I just happened to open it and...

167
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,980
 Phyllis, does this piece look like an ear or a mountain?

168
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:46,400
 Looks more like a part of a horse to me.

169
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,600
 Now Bob, I want you to find that toy and fix it.

170
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,760
 Every time Herbert picks it up, it practically comes apart in his hand.

171
00:06:52,760 --> 00:07:02,180
 [Music]

172
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:02,960
 Alice!

173
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,920
 Yes, Sam!

174
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,280
 Who was that on the phone?

175
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,140
 The phone? No one, dear.

176
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:08,200
 I thought I heard it ring.

177
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,300
 It must have been your imagination.

178
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,460
 Alice, you're not suggesting I'm hearing the...

179
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:13,360
 Mother!

180
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,420
 Yes, Mary!

181
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:16,520
 Please tell Henry to respect my property!

182
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:20,020
 Henry, your nail file is family property!

183
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:22,340
 Henry ordered what a terrible thing to say!

184
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:28,500
 Mary, if Henry's finally come to the point where he'd like to use a nail file, I don't think we should stand in his way.

185
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:32,020
 But that's just it, mother. He doesn't intend to use it for his nails.

186
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:32,660
 What's that?

187
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:39,060
 Look, mother, there's a quick repair job Homer and I are doing in the kitchen, and a nail file is just the tool we need.

188
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:42,100
 In that case, Henry, I'm afraid Mary's within her right.

189
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,620
 Yes, and I stand on them.

190
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:48,900
 Okay, Mary, okay. But just waitin' 'til you wanna use my baseball bat.

191
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,100
 Your baseball bat?

192
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,620
 Sure, to bang together her vanity table.

193
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:53,860
 Homer!

194
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:56,300
 Mary, did you hear the phone ringing a few minutes ago?

195
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:58,380
 Mary's nail file is out!

196
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:59,540
 That's where I heard about it.

197
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:04,660
 Why don't we just give up trying to fix this toy and throw ourselves on Mr. Anderson's mercy?

198
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:06,500
 But Homer, we're making progress.

199
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,260
 We are.

200
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:08,100
 Sure.

201
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:12,380
 Henry, how many springs will lose when we left the Anderson's ten minutes ago?

202
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:13,020
 One.

203
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:14,500
 How many are loose now?

204
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,260
 Three.

205
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:16,900
 I wouldn't call that progress.

206
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:19,060
 But we got the little man back on didn't we?

207
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,060
 Sure.

208
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:22,060
 But he's standing on his head.

209
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:25,620
 Homer, if he fits on that way, it must be right.

210
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:30,700
 Besides, I think a couple of the springs go in here like this.

211
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:31,700
 You see?

212
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,300
 What about that one?

213
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,620
 Gee, that one could go anyplace.

214
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:38,060
 Here, for instance.

215
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:39,860
 Well, I'll be done.

216
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,180
 Henry, you did it.

217
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:42,180
 I did?

218
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:43,180
 It's fixed.

219
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:44,180
 It must be.

220
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:46,180
 There weren't any springs left.

221
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:50,180
 -Cheetah even the bell works. -Well, what do you know?

222
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:54,180
 Henry, I never realized it before, but you've got a head.

223
00:08:54,180 --> 00:09:00,180
 Well, never mind that, Homer. Now, let's hurry and get it back into Kathleen's house before anyone notices it's gone. Come on upstairs.

224
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:01,180
 Okay, what for?

225
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:04,180
 I've got a swell shoebox up there. We can smuggle it back in.

226
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:07,180
 Operator, I distinctly heard the phone ring. Just now.

227
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,180
 Father, could Homer and I please pass?

228
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:12,180
 Oh, just a moment, operator. There.

229
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:15,180
 Thank you, Father. Homer, we've got to get back to Kathleen.

230
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:20,420
 Now see here operator. This is the second time this afternoon. My phone is wrong and there's been nobody there.

231
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:22,220
 I'll notify our repair department, sir.

232
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:23,660
 I wish you would. Goodbye.

233
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:26,300
 Sam, what's the matter? You're all slucked.

234
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:30,820
 You think the phone company would arrange it so that when a phone rings, there'd be someone at the other end.

235
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:31,820
 Oh?

236
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:34,220
 What do you mean by a statement like that?

237
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:40,220
 Nothing there. Only... Don't you think perhaps you've been working a little too hard recently?

238
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:42,500
 Alice, are you inferring... Are you...

239
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,660
 Don't be ridiculous. There.

240
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:45,920
 Better goes again.

241
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,820
 Sam, that's the doorbell.

242
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:48,520
 Oh.

243
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,160
 Mother, are the back doors ringing?

244
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:50,820
 Yes, dear.

245
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,020
 Would you please see who it is?

246
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,220
 I'm talking to your father.

247
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,000
 All right, mother.

248
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,460
 Alice, if you're going to talk to anyone,

249
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:56,660
 talk to the phone company.

250
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:59,180
 Dear, I'm not married to the phone company.

251
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,100
 Call me!

252
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,260
 Oh.

253
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,420
 Well, how do you do, Miss?

254
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:06,580
 Oh, my goodness, officer.

255
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:07,260
 What did we do?

256
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:09,540
 What did we do?

257
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,620
 Well, Miss, the police department

258
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:13,300
 is collecting old clothes and toys

259
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,540
 for Christmas bundles.

260
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:18,180
 Oh, my goodness, come in.

261
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:19,340
 Thanks.

262
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,740
 Now, let's see.

263
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:23,380
 Let's see what could I possibly give you.

264
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:26,500
 Would you be interested in some old pots and pans?

265
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,900
 No.

266
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:30,340
 Oh, well, let's see.

267
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:32,500
 Something like that old toy there on the kitchen table

268
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,820
 would be perfect.

269
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:36,220
 My goodness, where did this come from?

270
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:38,780
 It must be one of Henry's old ones.

271
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:41,300
 But I'm sure he'd be delighted to donate it to such

272
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:44,060
 a worthy cause here.

273
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:47,340
 Thanks a lot. Well, goodbye.

274
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:50,780
 Goodbye. And Officer, wouldn't you like to leave your phone number?

275
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:53,940
 I mean, in case I run into any more old things.

276
00:10:53,940 --> 00:11:09,060
 Bob Anderson, once and for all, you're not going to spread that jigsaw puzzle on my dining room table.

277
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:09,860
 Why not?

278
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:12,460
 Because you promised to fix Herbert's toy.

279
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:15,460
 She'll ask I've looked all over for it and I can't find it.

280
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:18,060
 Mother, where is he? Where did he go?

281
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:20,760
 Who, Kathleen? Henry, I can't find him anywhere.

282
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,660
 Oh, he left 15 minutes ago, dear, and he hasn't come back.

283
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:27,760
 Father, you didn't say anything to Henry to drive him away, did you?

284
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,560
 I hardly said two words to him.

285
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:32,460
 That's it, then, that's it. He thought you were still mad at him.

286
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:35,060
 This piece here must be here. I found part of a nose.

287
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,060
 Father, aren't you listening to me?

288
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,460
 Or is it the trunk of a tree?

289
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:40,660
 Father, how can you play with that childish puzzle

290
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:43,660
 When you may be driving a son-in-law right out of my life.

291
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:44,660
 What's that?

292
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,660
 Mother's stranger things have happened.

293
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:50,660
 And I think the least father can do is to let Henry know he didn't mean what he said.

294
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:52,660
 Very well, Kathleen. I'll talk to him.

295
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:54,660
 I'll act on the phone.

296
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,660
 Only if it's Henry, I'll just die of him there.

297
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,660
 So, where's the top of the box this puzzle came in?

298
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:00,660
 No, Bob.

299
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:01,660
 Hello?

300
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,660
 Look, Kathleen.

301
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:04,660
 Henry, is that you?

302
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:05,660
 Sure.

303
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:07,660
 And look, something terrible has just happened.

304
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,660
 Mary's just ruined everything.

305
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:13,780
 everything. What are you talking about? Look Kathleen the reason I suddenly left

306
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:18,780
 your house this afternoon. Henry I know all about that. You do? Yes and just as

307
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:25,500
 soon as my father comes down he's going to speak to you. Oh boy. I guess I better

308
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:29,220
 go straight down to the police department. What? Goodbye. Henry wait.

309
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:32,780
 Whatever my father said I'm sure he didn't mean it.

310
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:41,780
 [Music]

311
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:44,780
 But Henry, I'm allergic to police station.

312
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:48,780
 But Homer, we just have to get Herbert's toy back, and that's all there is to it.

313
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:52,780
 I know, only. These pictures on the walls give me the willy.

314
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:55,780
 - He's just don't look at them. - I can't help looking at them.

315
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:58,780
 Say Henry, look at this dead or alive picture.

316
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:01,780
 - Doesn't it look familiar? - It does? Sure.

317
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:05,780
 If you shave off the mustache, it looks just like one of our teachers.

318
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:06,780
 Which one?

319
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:07,780
 Miss Agalston.

320
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:08,780
 Homer.

321
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:13,780
 Well, who won and give $500 to get Miss Agalston back?

322
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:16,780
 Here's the room where the sergeant said they're keeping the toys.

323
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:17,780
 Larson, he's squat.

324
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:18,780
 Come on.

325
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:19,780
 Okay.

326
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:22,780
 But I'm expecting your father to defend me.

327
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:23,780
 For nothing.

328
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:26,780
 Boy, are we in luck, Homer.

329
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:28,780
 There's no one in here.

330
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:30,780
 Gee, look at all the toys.

331
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:32,480
 Look at all the toys.

332
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,980
 Homer, stop playing with them.

333
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:34,980
 I'm not.

334
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,580
 Isn't this a swell steam shovel?

335
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:38,780
 Oh, look!

336
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:40,280
 Here's Herbert's toy.

337
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:40,780
 Wait.

338
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:41,780
 At the bottom of the pile,

339
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,980
 see the little man poking out alongside that tiny--

340
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:44,980
 Oh, boy.

341
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:46,480
 Grab it, Henry.

342
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,280
 It's stuck under something.

343
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,280
 Henry, look out.

344
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:53,680
 Oh, boy.

345
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,480
 Henry, I've got it.

346
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,680
 I've got it.

347
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,280
 Let's feed it.

348
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,280
 Hello there, boys.

349
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,280
 Homer.

350
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,280
 It's a policeman. We'll get life.

351
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,780
 Look, Officer.

352
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:07,280
 Bring some toys down for our drive.

353
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:07,780
 Why?

354
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,780
 In a way we are.

355
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:10,780
 That's fine.

356
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:12,780
 Say, do you boys have a little extra time?

357
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:14,780
 Time. What for?

358
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:18,780
 Police toys have to be packed in barrels and sent to the firehouses and I could use a little help.

359
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:19,280
 Well...

360
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,780
 It'll only take a few minutes.

361
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:22,780
 Just drop that toy you have there in this barrel and...

362
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:24,780
 But, Officer, you don't argue dropping.

363
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,780
 Oh, boy.

364
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:29,780
 That's it. Now, let's start packing the rest of the toys on top.

365
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:36,780
 on top of it. Yes sir, no way they go. Oh boy.

366
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:58,280
 It's true folks, more people buy jello puddings than any other prepared puddings in the world.

367
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:03,320
 Try those grand new Jell-O tapioca puddings, newest members of the famous Jell-O pudding

368
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,320
 family.

369
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,320
 They're a miracle of goodness, a marvel of speed.

370
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:14,280
 Yes, Jell-O chocolate tapioca, Jell-O vanilla tapioca, and Jell-O orange coconut tapioca.

371
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:19,280
 All three are luscious, light and delicate, gloriously rich and creamy, and they're ready

372
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,280
 prepared.

373
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:26,200
 All you do is add milk, and they cook to mellow perfection in just about five minutes.

374
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:31,260
 Ask your grocer for Jell-O tapioca puddings and say, better ask for three packages while

375
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:34,420
 you're about it so you'll be prepared for the weekend.

376
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:42,200
 That's Jell-O tapioca puddings.

377
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:51,440
 And now getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldrich.

378
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:56,640
 Finally this afternoon, Henry and Homer took a toy from Kathleen Anderson's house under

379
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:59,440
 the misapprehension that they had broken it.

380
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:05,400
 When they finally repaired it, Mary inadvertently gave it away to the police toy drive.

381
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:08,040
 The scene opens in the center of her lamporium.

382
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,640
 It is later the same afternoon.

383
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:14,400
 "And if it were up to me, I'd let Mr. Anderson get mad and save my money."

384
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,760
 "Homer, I can't.

385
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:20,960
 Suppose some day Kathleen and I get, Kathleen and I get, get what?"

386
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,960
 Never mind.

387
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:25,880
 But you wouldn't want me to go through my married life not talking to my father-in-law,

388
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:26,880
 would you?

389
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,880
 Why not?

390
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:28,880
 That sounds like a nice arrangement.

391
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,880
 Oh.

392
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:33,840
 Besides, how do you know we can buy another toy exactly like her?

393
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,920
 Homer, we can at least try.

394
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,120
 Here's the toy counter.

395
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,280
 See, look at the swell stuff.

396
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,880
 Homer, put that thing down.

397
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,680
 Haven't you learned your lesson yet?

398
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:45,240
 I'm just admiring the construction.

399
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,040
 What do you think this button is for?

400
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,040
 Oh boy.

401
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,040
 Oh boy.

402
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,040
 Oh boy.

403
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,440
 Homer, now look what you've done.

404
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,840
 I hardly touched it, hen.

405
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,640
 It came right apart in my hand.

406
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,040
 May I help you, young man?

407
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,040
 Wait.

408
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,040
 I just picked this up, see?

409
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,040
 Oh, yes.

410
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,200
 That's one of the cleverest toys that's coming to the store in a long time.

411
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:07,040
 You just touch that button and it comes apart in your hands.

412
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,040
 It does.

413
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,040
 It does?

414
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:12,040
 And when you push it again, everything snaps right back into place.

415
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:16,040
 Children have their grandest time putting it together and letting it fall apart again.

416
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,840
 I can see where they would.

417
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,160
 I wrap one up for you.

418
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,440
 Well, I know, thanks.

419
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:24,200
 What we're looking for is a toy that has a sort of a little man on top, see.

420
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,600
 What does it do?

421
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,600
 Do?

422
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,040
 Mostly it just rings.

423
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:31,880
 Well, there is one under the counter here that...

424
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,520
 Is it something like this?

425
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,920
 Oh, boy!

426
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,400
 Homer, that's it!

427
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,760
 You're very lucky, sir.

428
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,480
 It's the last one like it we haven't stopped.

429
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,320
 We'll take it, Miss.

430
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,320
 How much is it?

431
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,320
 It's, uh...

432
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,920
 Oh, excuse me a minute while I check the front.

433
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,120
 Henry, you're sad.

434
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,120
 Homer, Doc.

435
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,120
 What's wrong?

436
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,120
 down that aisle and

437
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,500
 quick over this week but the time come back and get it later

438
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,540
 one dollar and forty not

439
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:57,340
 young man where are you going

440
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,100
 i think they

441
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:01,340
 excuse me miss one of the two boys here a moment ago

442
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:04,260
 by yes they just disappeared into notions

443
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:08,240
 may i help you with anything else well as a matter of fact that the reason i'm

444
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,360
 shopping it

445
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:13,260
 you sell jigsaw puzzles don't you know i guess we're having a wonderful sale

446
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:16,540
 right now i don't want to buy one i i just thought

447
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:18,800
 Well, you see the puzzle in this box here.

448
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,540
 Yes.

449
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:22,140
 Well, we seem to have lost the cover with a picture on it,

450
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:25,340
 and I wondered, could you sort of look over the pieces

451
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:28,240
 and give me a hint as to what it's supposed to turn out to be?

452
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,840
 Oh, I'm afraid I can't do that, sir.

453
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:31,440
 Oh.

454
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,240
 But if you'd like to leave it here for a few weeks,

455
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,240
 we could put our research department to work on it.

456
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,240
 Oh, never mind.

457
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,740
 Excuse me, Miss, but would you--

458
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:38,940
 Hello, Mr. Anderson.

459
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:39,740
 Hello, Mary.

460
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:41,640
 Say, if you run into Henry, would you tell him I'd

461
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,740
 like him to phone me?

462
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:45,040
 Henry and I aren't speaking, Mr. Anderson,

463
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,440
 But I'll see that he gets the message. Is it important?

464
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,280
 Well, Kathleen wanted me to apologize to him.

465
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,560
 My goodness, what for?

466
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,640
 That's what I don't know. Well, goodbye, Mary.

467
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,000
 And thanks for your help, miss.

468
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,840
 That's quite all right, sir.

469
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,680
 No, may I help you, madam.

470
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:01,440
 Well, there was a certain toy of my brother, you see.

471
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,160
 And I gave it away.

472
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,920
 Well, my goodness, you'd think he'd know it was for a wonderful cause.

473
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,680
 Well, what was this toy like?

474
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,760
 Well, it had a little man on top, you see.

475
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,400
 And a velvet bag.

476
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:19,400
 (music)

477
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:23,880
 Sam, it wouldn't hurt for you to take a few days old.

478
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,720
 Alice, I'll tell you I'm fine.

479
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:29,040
 Of course you are, dear. I wasn't insinuating that...

480
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:34,200
 I just meant that when you start to hear bells, isn't that the first sign of...

481
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,720
 The first sign of...

482
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,880
 Sign of what?

483
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,240
 Nothing, Sam.

484
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:42,240
 I suppose you just lie down and I'll make you some hot tea with some honey in it.

485
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,940
 Honey makes me lose my appetite.

486
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:46,140
 Yes, Sam, but it lines your stomach.

487
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:48,540
 Henry, is that you?

488
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:49,740
 Yes, Mother.

489
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:53,740
 My goodness, what have you two boys been doing? You look all worn out.

490
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:56,640
 Why, we took sort of a bicycle ride, Mother.

491
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,240
 But they didn't have any in Abbott City either.

492
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:02,240
 Oh, the way to Abbott City, my goodness.

493
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,740
 Oh, I'm making your father some tea. Would you boys like some hot milk?

494
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:06,740
 Hot milk.

495
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:08,740
 Henry, I think I'll go home.

496
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:12,740
 Oh, my God, Henry, Mary asked me to give you this package.

497
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:14,740
 Mary and I aren't speaking, Mother.

498
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:17,740
 We've broken off diplomatic relationships.

499
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:20,740
 Now, dear, I think this is a peace offering.

500
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:22,740
 Homer, would you like some butter in that hot milk?

501
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:24,740
 Butter?

502
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:28,740
 Well, Mrs. Aldrich, do you happen to have some strawberry syrup?

503
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:29,740
 No, I think so.

504
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:30,740
 And some club soda?

505
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:31,740
 Yes.

506
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:34,740
 Swell, and you can forget about the milk.

507
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:40,540
 My goodness you children never know what's good for him. You're gonna open it open my Mary's present

508
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:44,300
 See what she's offering for peace. Oh, it's probably just a couple of handkerchiefs

509
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:51,440
 Can me who do you suppose bought that toy right out from under? I don't know boy. I sure wish I could lay my hands on

510
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:55,820
 Homer what's ringing? I think it's Mary's handkerchief

511
00:20:55,820 --> 00:21:01,300
 Oh boy

512
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,040
 Stop the bell.

513
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,660
 I can't. The button's stuck.

514
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:06,500
 Here, jam my fountain pen against it.

515
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,340
 Okay.

516
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:11,540
 And where do you suppose Mary got her hands on this?

517
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:14,380
 Who cares? The important thing is we're all set.

518
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:15,220
 Henry!

519
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:16,900
 Oh boy, Homer, talk about toy back in the box.

520
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:17,860
 Quit headstock.

521
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:20,700
 Henry, Henry, you boys heard it that time, didn't you?

522
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:23,540
 Why, you heard what, Father?

523
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:25,060
 The phone ring.

524
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:26,620
 I didn't hear any phone ring.

525
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:29,140
 You didn't?

526
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:31,260
 Sam, your tea's ready.

527
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:33,860
 Alice, would you mind bringing it upstairs?

528
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:35,500
 - Upstairs. - I think the best thing

529
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,340
 for me to do is go right to bed.

530
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:40,100
 (dramatic music)

531
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:50,580
 Quiet, Homer.

532
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:53,420
 - Pen me, are you sure the Anderson's are in the dining room?

533
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:54,980
 - Sure, they're eating.

534
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,420
 So help me set up this stepladder

535
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:59,260
 under the living room window.

536
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:05,060
 Then all you have to do is climb up, open the window, and drop the toy in.

537
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:05,760
 Me?

538
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,760
 Why me?

539
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,560
 Homer, you mean you're scared?

540
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,560
 Sure.

541
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,560
 Homer.

542
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:14,360
 Henry, I helped you fix the toy and I put my head off to Abbott City,

543
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,960
 but I draw the line on holding off ladders.

544
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,060
 How could you fool?

545
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:19,260
 I'd manage.

546
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:22,360
 Okay, Homer, okay.

547
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,560
 I'll go up.

548
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,460
 Just hold the ladder steady.

549
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:26,260
 I am.

550
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:28,360
 When I get up, toss me the toy.

551
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,360
 Henry, who's that?

552
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,360
 I'm just Kathleen's dog Daisy.

553
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,360
 And stop rattling the ladder!

554
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,360
 But Henry Daisy's resented me

555
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:39,360
 ever since she caught me eating one of her dog biscuits.

556
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,360
 I'm Daisy, I apologize.

557
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,360
 I apologize.

558
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,360
 Homer, you're knocking me off!

559
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,360
 It's damn Daisy!

560
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,360
 Homer, never mind Daisy.

561
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,360
 Toss up the toys.

562
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,360
 She's got my pants.

563
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,360
 Come on, toss up the toys!

564
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:54,360
 There!

565
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,360
 Oh boy.

566
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,360
 Boy.

567
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,360
 Didn't you have the window open yet?

568
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,360
 Who is that?

569
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,360
 Who's there?

570
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,360
 Oh, my quick run.

571
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,360
 Daisy, let go!

572
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,360
 Who's there, I say?

573
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,360
 Oh, my...

574
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,360
 She's the let go.

575
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:12,360
 Daisy, please stop being a dog in the manger.

576
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:25,360
 Now, be sure and take plenty of warm socks, Steve.

577
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,760
 Alice, I'm only going to be gone a few days.

578
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,060
 Sam, it won't hurt to take an extra pay.

579
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:31,160
 Very well.

580
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:34,760
 And dear, I just want you to know I think you're doing the right thing.

581
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:38,360
 There's nothing like a fishing trip to get bells off your mind.

582
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:40,360
 Alice, that has nothing to do with it.

583
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:42,360
 I just heard it's the bass we're running and I thought...

584
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,360
 Well, I thought...

585
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,960
 Yes, dear, if you say so, I'll get your socks for you.

586
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,960
 I wonder if Will Brown would be interested in going along.

587
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,560
 Henry, is that you?

588
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,360
 Why, yes, Mother, has...

589
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,360
 Has there been a phone call for Homer?

590
00:23:54,360 --> 00:24:00,920
 I recently from home there anyone mr. Anderson say no dear no one's called

591
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:08,600
 Homer how did you get your pocket torn my pocket she was I guess Daisy did that Daisy

592
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:12,680
 My goodness young ladies nowadays don't behave the way they used to

593
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:19,920
 If you'd better both sit down and cool off boy Henry feel my heart. It's beating mine -

594
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:24,340
 Homer do you think mr. Anderson recognized us if he did he should

595
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:26,340
 We would have phoned by now.

596
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:27,340
 Oh boy.

597
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,340
 Henry, that must be him.

598
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:31,340
 Henry, please answer the phone.

599
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:33,340
 Aww, mother.

600
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:35,340
 Please, dear, I've got socks on my mind.

601
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:39,340
 But, G-mother, I'm not cooled off yet.

602
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:41,340
 Henry, please answer the phone.

603
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:43,340
 But it might be a wrong number.

604
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:44,340
 Henry!

605
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,340
 Yes, mother.

606
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:47,340
 Hello?

607
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:49,340
 Is that you, Henry?

608
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:50,340
 Oh boy.

609
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:51,340
 Yes, Kathleen?

610
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:53,340
 Henry, I'm phoning on behalf of my father.

611
00:24:53,340 --> 00:25:00,060
 Father. You are just a minute Kathleen Homer Mr. Anderson asked her to phone I'm

612
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:05,520
 going home you can at least give me a little moral support I can do that just

613
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:12,020
 as well from home hello Kathleen about your father my goodness Henry he's been

614
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:16,760

615
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:22,260
 apologize for him sure but you if you do what for I apologize for being so rude

616
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:29,260
 to you this afternoon. Kathleen, you mean? Well, I'll be dark. Homer, Mr. Anderson's been

617
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:33,060
 after me just to apologize. What? Henry, have you disappeared again?

618
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:38,100
 To the note, Kathleen. I'm right here. I think. My father would apologize personally,

619
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:43,020
 only he's very upset right now. Upset? Yeah, someone stole one of her bits toys and then

620
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:49,860
 threw it back through our living room window. Oh, who did a thing like that? That makes

621
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:51,860
 So many, doesn't know.

622
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:53,860
 He doesn't?

623
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:57,860
 Well, isn't that too bad?

624
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:02,860
 Look, Kathleen, to tell him not to worry, I don't know where he can get a pane of glass

625
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:04,860
 cheap for nothing, in fact.

626
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:06,860
 Well, that isn't what he's really mad about.

627
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:10,860
 You see, when the toy came through the window, it broke up his jigsaw puzzle.

628
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:11,860
 It did?

629
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:12,860
 And he's simply furious.

630
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:16,860
 He was almost positive it was going to turn out to be Ulysses S. Grant.

631
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:17,860
 Oh.

632
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:19,360
 - You're an alien, Rocky.

633
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,200
 - Huh?

634
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,600
 - So can I tell him you accept his apology?

635
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,600
 - Sure, Kathleen.

636
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,860
 He lives, that's the least I can do.

637
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:28,400
 - Oh, that's very nice of you, Henry.

638
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,080
 And you can come over and see me tomorrow.

639
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,280
 - Oh, boy.

640
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,280
 Sure.

641
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,440
 - Goodbye.

642
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,240
 - Goodbye.

643
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,440
 Boy, Homer.

644
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,880
 - Henry, I've never seen anyone so lucky.

645
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:41,880
 - I'll say.

646
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:44,640
 - Henry, how would you boys like to go fishing with me?

647
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,480
 - Me, Father?

648
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:50,200
 I thought it might be nice to have company you've been asking to go for years.

649
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:54,900
 Tea Father I'd like to only do you think I ought to leave town just when I've

650
00:26:54,900 --> 00:27:00,000
 cemented my relationships with Mr. Anderson? I'd be glad to go Mr. Aldrich.

651
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,680
 On second thought I'll probably have a good time alone.

652
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:07,880
 But thanks just the same father. Sure thanks Mr. Aldrich.

653
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:11,120
 Well I better go home and all time.

654
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,680
 Okay I'll walk you to the door. Thanks.

655
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:16,280
 Oh, before I forget Homer, where's my fountain pen?

656
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,480
 What fountain pen?

657
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,980
 That gave you to stick in the toy to keep it from rain.

658
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:21,980
 Henry, I never took it out.

659
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:23,980
 [audience laughter]

660
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:26,480
 Homer, you mean it's still stuck in the toy?

661
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,480
 I guess so.

662
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,980
 The one that went through the window and landed on Mr. Anderson's jigsaw?

663
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:31,980
 On his why?

664
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:33,980
 Oh, boy.

665
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:36,380
 Hey, what are you getting so excited about?

666
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:38,380
 That pen only cost you 50 cents.

667
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:39,580
 60, Homer.

668
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:43,580
 It cost me 10 cents extra to have my name in grave, Doc.

669
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:51,580
 Your name? Oh boy. Henry, Mr. Anderson wants to speak to you on the phone.

670
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:55,580
 He does? Well, look, Mother, would you please tell him I can't talk to him now?

671
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:59,580
 I'm just about to leave on a fishing trip with Father.

672
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:13,000
 Hiya fellas, whatcha doin'?

673
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,420
 Well Gee whiz, willy marshal, willy willy willy, where'd you come from?

674
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:19,420
 And me, let's pretend we don't see him.

675
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:22,520
 Okay, I betcha ratatoot, I was gonna lend you this pair of hip boots

676
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:25,560
 to go fishing with your father Henry, but now fat chance.

677
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:26,400
 Hip boots?

678
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,300
 Well, willy, I apologize.

679
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:28,960
 Oh no.

680
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:29,600
 But willy.

681
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,500
 Don't even coast.

682
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:34,640
 But willy, if you lend me those hip boots, I'll even ask you over for supper.

683
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,500
 Supper?

684
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,200
 What's in it for me? What's for dessert?

685
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,340
 Well, what a question. With the Aldrich family, it's sure to be one of those

686
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:45,420
 luscious shimmering jello desserts. They are a treat to eat in all six delicious flavors.

687
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:50,180
 Strawberry, raspberry, cherry, orange, lemon, and lime. Yes, you just can't beat jello

688
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:55,620
 for tempting fruit-like flavor. Because every jello flavor is rich with that famous locked-in

689
00:28:55,620 --> 00:29:01,580
 goodness. Flavor sealed right in so it can't get out till your first electable spoonful.

690
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:06,420
 No wonder jello is America's favorite gelatin dessert. So look for those big red letters

691
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:11,420
 on the box. They spell jello and jello spells a treat.

692
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:14,420
 [music]

693
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:20,420
 And this is Dan Seymour in New York saying the old rich family is brought to you by the jello family.

694
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:22,420
 [music]

695
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:34,420
 Boy desserts that are delicious. Boy believe me, you should know. They are made by famous J-E-L-L-O.

696
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:41,420
 [Applause]

697
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:45,420
 This is NBC, the National Broadcasting Company.

698
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:48,000
 (bells ringing)

699
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,580
 (gentle music)
