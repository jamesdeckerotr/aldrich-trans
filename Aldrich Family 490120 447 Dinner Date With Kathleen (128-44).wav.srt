 [Music]

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 And now the Jell-O family presents...

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 Henry...

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 Henry Oldridge!

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 Coming, Mother!

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 [Applause]

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 Yes, it's the Oldridge family based on characters

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,280
 by Clifford Goldsmith and starring Ezra Stone as Henry with Jackie Kelka's

9
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:37,280
 Homer. And yes, it's the Jell-O family with its three famous desserts. Jell-O in

10
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,280
 those six delicious flavors, Jell-O puddings with that old-fashioned

11
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:47,680
 homemade flavor, and Jell-O tapioca puddings, a miracle of goodness, a marvel of

12
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:48,680
 of speed.

13
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:58,720
 Everyone's a jello good fellow, a very good jello good fellow, so rich, so tempting and

14
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,720
 mellow.

15
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:04,640
 J-E-L-L-O.

16
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,360
 And now for the Aldridge family.

17
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:20,360
 [Music]

18
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:23,360
 The memory of our youth is a priceless possession.

19
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:31,360
 And whenever it starts to fade, there's no quicker way to brighten it up than to join the company of a teenage boy like Henry Aldrich.

20
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,360
 The scene opens in the Aldrich kitchen. It is almost any time.

21
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:40,500
 time. Henry Aldrich. I know mother and I agree with you. It's perfectly

22
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:45,140
 ridiculous for us to have a butler. My goodness. Especially this lathe. But

23
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:49,660
 couldn't we at least have finger bowls? Henry I'm using my best napkins and that's

24
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:54,660
 as far as I'll go. napkins mother? Just plain ordinary everyday napkins?

25
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:59,620
 They're their hen stitched and monogram. Alice! You know where the evening paper is.

26
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:02,780
 She wish father aren't even dressed yet it's nearly time.

27
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:04,100
 - Certainly I'm dressed.

28
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:06,140
 - You mean you're not wearing your best suit tonight?

29
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:07,540
 - Henry, if this suit is good enough

30
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:08,900
 for my business associates,

31
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:11,140
 it's certainly good enough for Kathleen Anderson.

32
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:14,860
 - I know, but mother, I just got another wonderful idea.

33
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:17,420
 Why couldn't Mary wait on table?

34
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:19,920
 - Henry, how'd he eat in the kitchen?

35
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,420
 Henry, I'm surprised at you.

36
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:22,460
 - Well, not Alice.

37
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:25,780
 We could buy Mary a maid uniform and let her earn her keep.

38
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:26,620
 - Now Sam.

39
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:29,260
 - Sure, father's got the right idea.

40
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:31,180
 - I often said children should work their way

41
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:32,060
 through the home.

42
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,060
 Sure.

43
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,660
 From now on, Henry, you can be the upstairs maid.

44
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:35,660
 What?

45
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:38,220
 Sam, will you please stop joking?

46
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:41,460
 In the first place, Henry, Mary isn't even going to be here for dinner.

47
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:43,500
 Mother, is that candle you're getting out?

48
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,500
 Yes, dear.

49
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,900
 Gee, that's swell.

50
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,660
 Could we serve them in gold candelabras?

51
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:50,140
 But I don't own any gold candelabras.

52
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:53,780
 You mean, after all, your years of drudgery fathers never bought you any?

53
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:54,780
 No, see, here.

54
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:57,740
 Dear, we have these very nice silver candelsticks.

55
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:58,740
 Oh, sure.

56
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:01,660
 And I don't mean they won't be fine, but do you happen to know anyone we could borrow

57
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:07,500
 gold ones from? Not without putting up collateral. Collateral? And Henry, what I plan to do just

58
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,740
 before Kathleen gets here is to bring in all our collateral and put it right in the center

59
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:16,780
 of the table. Gee whiz, father. Now you're kidding. Henry, please go in the dining room

60
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:20,660
 and put the chairs around the table. That's a good idea. And I'll give Kathleen the one

61
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:25,900
 with the good bottom. Fine. And don't go away, mother, because I just got another idea.

62
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:30,420
 Listen, may I ask what's brought on all this? There it seems that Henry and Kathleen saw

63
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:34,320
 movie of dinner at the White House and Kathleen was so impressed that Henry

64
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:38,580
 invited her to have dinner over here. I see. He felt it was the only democratic

65
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:44,220
 thing to do. Mother. Excuse me. I think I'll go and sit on the balcony. But Sam we

66
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:50,940
 don't have a balcony. All right Alice I'll build one. What? Mother did you know you

67
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:55,320
 didn't set enough places at the table? Of course I did. Mary's going out so that

68
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:59,480
 leaves just four of us. But what about Homer and Agnes? What about them? Where

69
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,780
 Are they going to sit?

70
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:01,780
 Henry.

71
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:04,960
 She was, you mean, I neglected to tell you I more or less invited home her an Agnes to

72
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,960
 dinner too?

73
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:10,600
 But Henry, do you realize I've made individual chicken pies and I only made four of them?

74
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,920
 Well, gee, couldn't you just whip up a couple more?

75
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,920
 Made with canned salmon?

76
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:18,400
 Henry, do you mean you definitely invited them?

77
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,520
 Sure, because Homer's loaning me a bowl of fruit.

78
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,520
 What for?

79
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,520
 To put in the center of the table.

80
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,840
 Now, dear, we have plenty of fruit without borrowing any from Homer.

81
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,640
 But what he's bringing is wax, the real stuff.

82
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,000
 Oh my goodness.

83
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,800
 And Homer wouldn't bring his fruit unless it included Agnes.

84
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,640
 But Henry, look at it this way.

85
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:39,480
 Would Homer and Agnes be invited to dinner at the White House?

86
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,000
 No, she was.

87
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,640
 Well, there.

88
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,680
 But neither would we.

89
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,600
 Oh boy, there's Kathleen now.

90
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,120
 Would you like me to go to the door?

91
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,360
 You mother and a thing like your apron?

92
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,240
 I'll get it mother.

93
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,080
 Then don't run, you'll get off like.

94
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:51,960
 Well, I'm not running.

95
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:52,760
 Where's my comb?

96
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,720
 Where's my comb?

97
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,440
 Oh, here it is.

98
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,280
 Oh boy, mother, where's a mirror?

99
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,040
 Henry, your hair looks fine.

100
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,240
 It's all over my face.

101
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,280
 Here, let me help you.

102
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,680
 Oh, she was mother. Where's my coat? I haven't got my coat on.

103
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,040
 Henry, it doesn't matter.

104
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,400
 It was here in the living room.

105
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,080
 There, please, answer the door.

106
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:10,040
 I'm like, Kathleen, walk right in on my shirt sleeve.

107
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:10,760
 Oh, here it is.

108
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:14,760
 Where's my sleeve? Where's my sleeve?

109
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,400
 I'm okay.

110
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,480
 I'll be out in the kitchen.

111
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:20,440
 Hello, cat--

112
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,200
 Henry, what took you so long?

113
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,960
 Oh, then what are you doing out here?

114
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:27,320
 I stepped outside to get the evening paper in the front door locked on me.

115
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,800
 A lot? But where's...

116
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,760
 See, I even combed my hair.

117
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,560
 That's why your face is all red.

118
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,560
 She was... no, I just got overheated.

119
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,680
 So maybe I'd just slip out of my coat for a minute.

120
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,040
 Don't throw it Henry, hang it up.

121
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,640
 Sure, Father, I was just going to...

122
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,680
 Oh, boy, there she is now.

123
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,800
 Father, will you please hand me my coat?

124
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,000
 It's only Homer.

125
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,480
 Homer?

126
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,000
 I saw him coming up the street.

127
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,240
 Oh, I should. I bother with a coat just for Homer.

128
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,360
 You mean you don't want it?

129
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,080
 No, thanks.

130
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,080
 Kathleen!

131
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,080
 Good evening, Henry.

132
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,080
 Jean, how did you get here?

133
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,080
 I walked.

134
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:02,080
 I know, but I know.

135
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,080
 I'm sorry about my shirt sleeves.

136
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,080
 Oh, my goodness, if I got the wrong night?

137
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,080
 No, Gee was. Come on in.

138
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,080
 Thank you.

139
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,080
 Boy.

140
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,080
 Thank you.

141
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,080
 May I take your hat?

142
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,080
 I don't have any yet, Henry.

143
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,080
 Oh, sure.

144
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,080
 Gee, Kathleen.

145
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,080
 How are you anyway?

146
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,780
 Just fine, thank you. How are you?

147
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:28,720
 Oh, I'm fine.

148
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,080
 Won't you come in the living room?

149
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,080
 All right.

150
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,460
 I'll just slip into my coat.

151
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:36,680
 There. Would you like to sit down?

152
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,880
 All right.

153
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,920
 Our sofa has one loose spring in it,

154
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,440
 as you'll eventually notice.

155
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,280
 But the chair you're getting at the dinner table

156
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,800
 is in excellent condition.

157
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,880
 (audience laughing)

158
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,880
 Do you couldn't smash it with an axe?

159
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:48,880
 Really?

160
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,520
 And boy, Kathleen, is my mother excited

161
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:56,720
 over your being here. All she's done today is talk about Kathleen Kathleen Kathleen.

162
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,680
 I hope you're saying something nice about me. Boy I'll say she was. You know what she was

163
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:07,800
 even discussing just a few minutes ago? Fingerballs. Really we're having fingerballs? No chicken

164
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:16,320
 pot pies. This is my favorite thing. Really? Have you ever had it made with salmon? Chicken

165
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,520
 mixed with salmon?

166
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,160
 No, just salmon.

167
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,160
 (audience laughing)

168
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,240
 That sounds very interesting, Henry.

169
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,840
 Sure, but a person like Homer

170
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,320
 would never know the difference then.

171
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,560
 Henry, did I tell you how much I've been looking

172
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,680
 for with Daventon over here tonight?

173
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,920
 Do you have?

174
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,680
 This is the first date we've had

175
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,720
 in about two months that Homer hasn't tagged along on.

176
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,560
 What?

177
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,200
 And not that I've minded Henry.

178
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,160
 Homer's really a very nice boy,

179
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,200
 but frankly, and that Agnes Lawson,

180
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,080
 my goodness, I've never been so glad

181
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,580
 to get away from two people for one night in my life.

182
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:48,420
 But Kathleen.

183
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:50,500
 Every place you and I go, they want to go.

184
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,420
 Kathleen, listen.

185
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:53,660
 Yes?

186
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:58,420
 Well, what I mean is, look, I don't think you understand Homer.

187
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:00,500
 I don't think anybody does how good they.

188
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,700
 They couldn't?

189
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,940
 Well, he's always seemed to come in between us.

190
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:07,100
 Frankly, Henry, sometimes I can't help but get the idea that,

191
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:09,580
 well, you think more of Homer than you do with me.

192
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:11,380
 Kathleen!

193
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:13,980
 Gee, that's the craziest thing I ever heard.

194
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:16,660
 - Why, know that now, Henry.

195
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:17,820
 - You do?

196
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,500
 - After you invited me, OBA to dinner,

197
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,740
 just so we could get away from him.

198
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,940
 - Well look, before we go any further,

199
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:25,740
 could I explain one thing to you?

200
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,420
 - Hey Henry!

201
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:28,620
 - My goodness, Homer's affected me,

202
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,420
 so I'm actually here as well.

203
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:32,220
 - Kathleen, could I please tell you something?

204
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,180
 - Well, where is everybody?

205
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,300
 - Oh, here you are.

206
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:36,300
 - Oh my goodness.

207
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:39,180
 - Well, Homer, imagine.

208
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:41,660
 - Listen, Henry, what are you so surprised about?

209
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:42,820
 (laughing)

210
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:43,780
 - I'm not surprised.

211
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:48,360
 Hi! Hi, and boy Henry, where do you see what I have for you in this bag?

212
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,520
 Homer. It's my mother's wax fruit.

213
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,780
 Yeah? Homer, could I speak to you out loud?

214
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:57,780
 The only trouble is my father left it on the radiator and the banana has sort of gotten out of cover.

215
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:59,780
 [laughter]

216
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:02,780
 Well, look. And the apple is practically shriveled up.

217
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:07,780
 But don't worry, him. My father says it's the best imitation of a baked apple he's ever seen.

218
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:08,780
 [laughter]

219
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:09,780
 Look. Homer.

220
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:12,280
 Oh, I forgot to tell you Agnes can't come.

221
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,280
 Who can't?

222
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:17,600
 Agnes can. She fell asleep by an open window and got a crick in her neck.

223
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,640
 Hi Kathleen, would you please shove over a little?

224
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,200
 Why? So I can sit down among you and Henry.

225
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,280
 Oh, Homer, could I please speak to you in the next room a minute?

226
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:29,520
 Oh, boy. You mean dinner's all ready?

227
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,520
 Dinner! Let's see. Let's see.

228
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:35,120
 Henry, oh, it's not two minutes ago didn't you tell me that Homer wasn't...

229
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,800
 I mean, oh me.

230
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,280
 Kathleen, I never said he wasn't. It was you.

231
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,600
 It was. I wasn't why.

232
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:47,600
 Kathleen, Henry, what are you both so upset about?

233
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,600
 Is it because Agnes couldn't come or because my banana melted?

234
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,600
 [audience laughter]

235
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,600
 Kathleen...

236
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:08,600
 [music]

237
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,200
 I've put the salt and the potatoes, Mrs. Aldridge.

238
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,400
 Thank you, Kathleen.

239
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,600
 And what can I do now?

240
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,000
 Not another thing, dear.

241
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,400
 And dinner won't be ready for another half hour.

242
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,800
 Why don't you just go back into the living room with Henry?

243
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:24,200
 Well, Mrs. Aldridge, would you be very hurt if I just stayed out here?

244
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,200
 In the kitchen?

245
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,200
 Well, as I said, Henry and I...

246
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,800
 Well, I just feel that you need some help.

247
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,600
 Kathleen, sit down.

248
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,400
 Yes, Mrs. Aldridge.

249
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,800
 Now, dear, I think I know what's happened between you and Henry.

250
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:41,800
 But do you really think you'll gain anything by staying out here and turning your back?

251
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,800
 But I have my pride, Mrs. Aldrich.

252
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:47,800
 Dear, would you mind if I gave you a little heart to heart advice?

253
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,800
 Well, no.

254
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:55,800
 There's one problem that every young woman, in fact every woman at any age, has to face sooner or later.

255
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,800
 You mean?

256
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,800
 And that's how to get rid of the undesirable friends of...

257
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,800
 Well, I'm sure your mother had to face it with your father.

258
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,800
 And I had... that is...

259
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,800
 You had to do the same thing with Mr. Aldrich?

260
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,800
 Mr. Orchard.

261
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,480
 And I didn't say that.

262
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,520
 But you might as well learn how to cope with the problem right now.

263
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,520
 Yes, Mrs. Orchard.

264
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:17,840
 Now, as a general rule, as soon as you tell a man not to do something, you can be pretty

265
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,160
 sure he'll do it.

266
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,160
 Really?

267
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,480
 And the more you object to his friends, the more he's going to continue seeing those

268
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,480
 friends.

269
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,480
 My goodness.

270
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,640
 Yes, that's men, Troy, your Kathleen.

271
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:30,480
 As nice as they are, they're born with that streak in them.

272
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,960
 You don't say.

273
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:36,640
 So my advice to you is to go back into the living room and be nice to Homer.

274
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,640
 Nice to home!

275
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,640
 Just as nice as you can be.

276
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:42,040
 Perhaps even a little nicer than you are the hen.

277
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,040
 Oh no!

278
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:47,040
 Believe me, Kathleen, I'm more experienced in these things than you are.

279
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,440
 Do you mean...

280
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,040
 And I can count on Henry to get jealous?

281
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,440
 Absolutely.

282
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:55,640
 And before you know it, he'll be asking Homer to leave.

283
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,240
 Oh my goodness.

284
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,040
 Now, go on back in the living room while I see what the potatoes are doing.

285
00:11:59,040 --> 00:11:59,640
 I know, but some more.

286
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,240
 Go on there and good luck.

287
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:05,240
 Oh.

288
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,440
 Oh.

289
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,840
 I didn't realize there was anyone in the dining room.

290
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,040
 I'm just...

291
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:13,160
 I'm just having sort of a discussion with my father.

292
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,720
 Good evening, Kathleen. It's nice having you here.

293
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,160
 Thank you, Mr. Aldrich.

294
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,560
 I'm sorry if I disturbed you.

295
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,560
 Is she gone, Father?

296
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,880
 Yes, you can turn around now.

297
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,480
 Isn't she speaking to you?

298
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,600
 No, Father.

299
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,560
 And don't you agree she's being unreasonable?

300
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:33,560
 Especially since I'm giving her the chair with a good bottom?

301
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:33,880
 Well...

302
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:37,460
 And since I even spent an hour washing all the windows here in the dining room,

303
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:39,680
 just so she'd have a swell time tonight.

304
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,180
 Well...

305
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,080
 Don't you father?

306
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,880
 Frankly, I'd rather not get involved.

307
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,780
 Oh, gee.

308
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:47,280
 Maybe if I explained to Homer in a nice way,

309
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,980
 he'd go home without any hard feelings.

310
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:51,180
 Now hold on a minute.

311
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,180
 Yes, father?

312
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:56,080
 Frankly, Henry, I'd hate to think that any son of mine would ever let a woman walk all over it.

313
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:56,880
 Oh, sure, but...

314
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,080
 Now, if you let Kathleen get the upper hand now,

315
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,080
 she'll never have the proper respect for you.

316
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:01,680
 She won't?

317
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,040
 There's one thing, son, that every man has to stick up for above all else.

318
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,040
 And that's his right to his own friend.

319
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:07,540
 You mean?

320
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:09,640
 Yes, Henry, I had to be firm with your...

321
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:13,560
 Well, what I should say is, every man has to put his foot down once in a while.

322
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,880
 You mean you had to be tough with mother?

323
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:18,320
 No, Henry, I haven't been tough.

324
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,680
 I've merely been firm with her.

325
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,880
 And she's been a happier wife for it.

326
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,960
 Gee, now that you mentioned that father, she does seem awfully happy.

327
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,440
 Listen to her singing out there.

328
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,040
 Certainly.

329
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:34,760
 My advice to you son is to march into that living room there and put your foot down on the subject of Homer.

330
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,640
 You think so?

331
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,760
 Simply assert your right.

332
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,200
 When Kathleen's my guest.

333
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,120
 Isn't Homer also your guest?

334
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,680
 Before you know it, Kathleen will be eating out of your hand.

335
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,720
 You mean I should ask?

336
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,480
 Not ask Henry.

337
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,360
 Tell her.

338
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,400
 I'll go on.

339
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,760
 Sure.

340
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,280
 Gee whiz, maybe you're right.

341
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:53,160
 Kathleen?

342
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,360
 That's the idea.

343
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,120
 Kathleen, you just see here.

344
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:00,520
 Before you speak to Kathleen, could I have a word with you out in the hall?

345
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,180
 Sure thing.

346
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:01,840
 Come on.

347
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,280
 What is it, Homer, old-timer?

348
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:06,420
 Henry, don't call me old-timer. I can't stand it.

349
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:09,600
 Listen, Homer, I just want you to know I'm putting my foot down.

350
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,240

 You?

00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,400
 Homer, you're my best friend.

355
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,720
 Sure. That's what makes it so terrible.

356
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,600
 What do you mean?

357
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:28,020
 Henry, you're looking at a guy that just kissed his best friend's girl.

 They're nourishing.

 Due to a slight misunderstanding with Kathleen,

 Henry accepted some advice from his father

414
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:45,280
 his father and went to work hoping to patch things up. Kathleen however was

415
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:50,360
 acting on advice from Mrs. Aldrich and the result was a black eye for Homer.

00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:10,820
 Boy...

531
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:11,820
 Yeah.

532
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:15,820
 And frankly father, I can't say your advice helped.

533
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:17,820
 Yes, I realize that now.

534
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:23,120
 But, son, the main thing we men have to remember is never to give in.

535
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,320
 Sure, Father.

536
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,320
 And when our first plan doesn't work,

537
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,320
 then we have enough sense to change our tactics.

538
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,320
 Yes, sir!

539
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,820
 Get your coat on. Here's what we're going to do next.

540
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,540
 Now then Kathleen, suppose we sit down.

541
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,140
 All right.

542
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:53,620
 Only, when do you suppose Henry, Mr. Aldrich, went?

543
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:56,380
 Dear, I don't know, and frankly, I don't care.

544
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:57,420
 You don't?

545
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:59,020
 Well, then naturally neither do I.

546
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:01,700
 You and I are going to enjoy our dinner, Kathleen,

547
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,340
 just the two of us.

548
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:04,900
 We're gonna have the time of our lives.

549
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,300
 Of course.

550
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,900
 We'll have a much better time without,

551
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:12,900
 without my the chicken pie smell lovely.

552
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,540
 Thank you, dear.

553
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:15,900
 Do you know what they remind me of?

554
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:16,740
 What?

555
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:18,060
 Henry.

556
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:18,900
 What's there?

557
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,740
 He's so crazy about them.

558
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,500
 So is Mr. Olrich.

559
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,900
 My, how that man eats.

560
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,620
 Henry does too.

561
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:27,180
 I made him some brownies once.

562
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:29,020
 And do you know how many he ate?

563
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:29,860
 No, dear.

564
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:32,740
 Well, he ate so many, he had to go home.

565
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:34,100
 Right afterwards.

566
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:36,780
 Now, Kathleen, don't cry into your pot pie.

567
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:37,780
 (audience laughing)

568
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:39,220
 Oh, of course not.

569
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:41,700
 Now then, may I have your plate?

570
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,460
 And would you mind entering the phone, Kathleen,

571
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:44,300
 while I so?

572
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,140
 All right.

573
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:45,980
 - Hey, back there.

574
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:48,380
 (phone ringing)

575
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:49,220
 Hello.

576
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:50,820
 - Hello, is that you, Kathleen?

577
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:51,660
 - Yes.

578
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:52,820
 - Guess who this is.

579
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:55,620
 - Homer, I can't waste time being nice to you now.

580
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:56,460
 - What?

581
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,020
 - Henry has needed a listen so it won't count.

582
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:58,860
 - Huh?

583
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:00,940
 Well look, I have bad news for you.

584
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:01,780
 - What is it?

585
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:04,020
 - I won't be able to mark it for dinner.

586
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:05,500
 - I thought you said bad news.

587
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:08,580
 - I have to take care of that creek and the nink of agus.

588
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:09,780
 - Homer, what are you eating?

589
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:11,180
 - Just a pork chop.

590
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:12,180
 (laughing)

591
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:15,100
 - Well, when are you in Henry going out together next?

592
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:17,100
 Well, we were going to go skating on Saturday.

593
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:19,100
 Okay, I'll see you over at the ring.

594
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,100
 What?

595
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,100
 So long.

596
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,100
 But Homer!

597
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,100
 Oh my goodness!

598
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,100
 Mrs. Aldridge!

599
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:26,100
 Yes, Kathleen, would that phone call for me?

600
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,100
 No.

601
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:30,100
 But my goodness, everything's just going from worst to terrible.

602
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:32,100
 But now, Kathleen, you just sit down and stop worrying.

603
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,100
 Mrs. Aldridge, I followed your advice.

604
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,100
 Where am I?

605
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:38,100
 I've driven Henry out of his home, and Homer's still tagging along.

606
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:44,100
 Now, dear, just because Henry and Mr. Aldridge have gone out for a while, well, there's nothing to worry about.

607
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:44,940
 There isn't?

608
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:47,540
 When men do that, it simply means they're sulking.

609
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:50,220
 They'll come back, Kathleen, on their knees.

610
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,220
 Really?

611
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:52,620
 If they were doing anything they felt

612
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:55,180
 had to be covered up, they'd have sent flowers.

613
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:56,020
 They would?

614
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:58,140
 Then we'd really have something to worry about.

615
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:59,100
 All right, good.

616
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,740
 You see, Kathleen, what did I tell you?

617
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:01,540
 Here they are now.

618
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:02,740
 I can show Mrs. Aldridge.

619
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:07,060
 Sam was locked out once before tonight.

620
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:07,580
 Oh.

621
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:09,140
 Mrs. Samuel Aldridge?

622
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:09,780
 Yes.

623
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:12,620
 Acme Flower Shop, these roses are for you.

624
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:13,580
 What?

625
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:16,380
 And is there a Miss Kathleen Anderson here?

626
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:32,620
 Boy, Father, just feel that air.

627
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:35,300
 It's the same air you've been breathing all day, son.

628
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:37,380
 It tastes better somehow.

629
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:39,020
 I know what you mean.

630
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:41,340
 Everything looks better after you've looked at problems

631
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:42,980
 straight in the eye and licked it.

632
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:46,100
 I'll say. They sure are, aren't they?

633
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:46,580
 Who?

634
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:47,020
 Women.

635
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:47,420
 What?

636
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:49,140
 A problem.

637
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:50,660
 I suppose so, Henry.

638
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:52,660
 The only man who hasn't learned to use his head.

639
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:56,220
 Boy, Father, and to think for a while today, I doubted you.

640
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,340
 You actually did.

641
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:58,060
 Sure.

642
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:01,620
 But boy, after this, I'll always know who to go to for advice.

643
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:02,540
 That's right, son.

644
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:04,580
 You can always profit by listening to someone

645
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:06,380
 who's had more experience than you had.

646
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:08,660
 Well, here we are, home again.

647
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:10,740
 I'll go in ahead of you, Henry, and we'll let your mother

648
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:11,660
 apologize first.

649
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:12,500
 Okay.

650
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:15,500
 - Oh Alice, I'm home.

651
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:18,020
 - So am I Kathleen.

652
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:18,860
 - Alice.

653
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:20,900
 Alice.

654
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:22,820
 - Mother, we're home.

655
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:24,140
 - So I see.

656
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:25,740
 Kathleen, have you got your coat on?

657
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:27,180
 - Yes Mrs. Aldrich.

658
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:28,020
 - Well, Alice.

659
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:29,780
 - Don't bother trying to explain, Sam,

660
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:31,300
 it won't do you any good.

661
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:32,140
 - What, Sam?

662
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:35,100
 - And Henry Aldrich, don't you ever speak to me again?

663
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:35,940
 - Who I?

664
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:38,220
 - Come along, Kathleen, we'll be late for the movie.

665
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:39,060
 - Alice.

666
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:39,900
 - Alice.

667
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:40,740
 - Kathleen.

668
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:44,460
 (audience laughing)

669
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:45,300
 - Well.

670
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:48,900
 - She was out of your account for a thing like that.

671
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:49,740
 - Why?

672
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:51,660
 - Point father, what do we do now?

673
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:53,340
 Change our tactics again.

674
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:56,420
 - Henry? - Yes, Father?

675
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:58,820
 - I've given you a good deal of advice today

676
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:00,620
 based on years of experience.

677
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:02,060
 - Yes, sir.

678
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,340
 - Now I want you to forget every word of it.

679
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:05,700
 - What's that, Father?

680
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,500
 - When it comes to handling women, Henry,

681
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:10,060
 I have only one last piece of advice.

682
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:11,060
 Yes, Father.

683
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:13,060
 Don't accept any from anyone.

684
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:39,060
 Boy, Homer, did you turn out to be a snake in the clover.

685
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:47,060
 "Could I ask you one thing? Are we gonna let women come between us and spoil a friendship of an entire lifetime?"

686
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:48,060
 "Women."

687
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:52,060
 "Hah! Sure, him. You're right. Women."

688
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:57,060
 "Hah! Ha! Shake! Ha! Shake!"

689
00:26:57,060 --> 00:27:04,060
 Okay, boys, but just remember this. It's the women folk you can thank for turning out those swell desserts you like so much.

690
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:08,340
 much, like those grand and gay treats of shimmering jello.

691
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:13,900
 Yes, jello looking so bright and colorful and tasting so rich and good, it reminds you

692
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:16,380
 of the real ripe fruit itself.

693
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:22,620
 In any of those six delicious flavors, strawberry, raspberry, cherry, orange, lemon, and lime,

694
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:25,820
 every jello flavor is an extra special treat.

695
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:29,820
 With that famous locked-in goodness that's exclusive with jello.

696
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:34,980
 seal right in so it can't get out till your first delectable spoonful.

697
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:39,180
 And that's why Jell-O is America's favorite gelatin dessert.

698
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:41,580
 Look for those big red letters on the box.

699
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:45,100
 They spell Jell-O and Jell-O spells a treat.

 Here's hoping you'll be in your living room and ours next week at this same time.

702
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,440
 Good night, folks.

704
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:26,940
 The Aldrich family starring Ezra Stone is Henry with Jackie Kalka's Homer,

705
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:31,540
 is written by Patricia Jaudry and Del Dinsdale with music by Jack Miller.

706
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:36,380
 Mr. and Mrs. Aldrich, our house, Jamison, and Catherine Roth.

 And this is Dan Seymour in New York, saying,
