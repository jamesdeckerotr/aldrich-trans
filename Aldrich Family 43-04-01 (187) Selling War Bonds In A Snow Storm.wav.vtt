00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.000
 [Music]

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.000
 Postum present Henry, Henry Oldridge, coming mother!

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
 [Applause]

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
 Postum presents the Oldridge family written by Clifford Goldsmith.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.680
 Entertainment for all the family brought to you by Postam,

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.600
 attempting wholesome drink for all the family.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:35.600
 Postam.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:55.200
 Have you noticed friends?

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:00.360
 how a mother can sing as simple a melody as that to a baby, and very often, even before

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.260
 she's finished the song, that baby is sunk in sweet sound slumber.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.800
 But as we grow older, many of us lose the ability to slip off to sleep quickly.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.280
 And isn't that particularly true about some of you who drink coffee?

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.120
 For coffee does keep many people awake, even though others can drink it without ill effect.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.680
 If you happen to be one of the wakeful ones, it might be sensible to switch to post them,

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:29.440
 contains no caffeine or other stimulant, nothing at all that can possibly rob you of sleep.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:34.200
 Postum has a grand flavor, you know, rich, full-bodied, the kind of drink that makes you

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.000
 fairly expand with satisfaction.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.500
 So if you think coffee disturbs your sleep, start now to make postum your regular meal

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.840
 time drink instead of coffee.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.680
 Give it a fair trial, and then see if you're not pleased as punch that you switched.

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:55.680
 First, because you're sleeping so much better, and second, because postum is such a really swell drink.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:15.680
 A boy is a boy, and that's all there is to it.

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.680
 He gets into difficulty somehow and he gets out of them somehow like Henry Aldrich.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.180
 But what happens in between is usually unforgettable.

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.180
 The scene opens at the Aldrich dinner table.

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.180
 - Will you have another piece of cherry pie, Sam? - No, thank you, Alice.

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.180
 - Sam, are you upset about something? - Why, Alice?

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.680
 No, what makes you think I'm upset?

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.680
 - Well, dear, you've hardly spoken during this entire dinner.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.680
 - Well, frankly, I don't for the life of me see why you had to invite Homer over here for dinner and to spend the night.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.840
 Sam I had to, his mother and father have gone over to Abbott City.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.400
 And besides, one more person certainly isn't going to make any great difference.

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.880
 But Alice, do you realize there's 20 minutes after eight,

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.920
 and we're finishing dinner, and Henry and Homer haven't even shown up yet?

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.480
 Yes, dear, and I'm going to speak to both of them.

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.800
 Although the only thing I feel bad about is these potato pancakes.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.560
 And that's another thing, Alice.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.120
 How did we happen to have potato pancakes?

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.520
 Well, I was going to have cream cauliflower, but Homer says he doesn't eat it.

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.560
 That's still no excuse for potato pancakes.

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.900
 Sam, they're one of Homer's favorite dishes.

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.980
 That's also why I went to the trouble of making a chariot pie.

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:20.280
 Homer loves cherries.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.280
 Then I said the least he could have done was to have been here in time to eat them.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.720
 Just where are the boys? Can't we phone them someplace?

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.180
 I don't know where they are.

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.120
 They left here right after school and went out to sell war bonds.

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.200
 They're selling war bonds?

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.080
 Yes, dear.

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.880
 They both been made minute men.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:34.880
 Minute men?

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.560
 Well, they're an hour and a quarter late.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.800
 Alice, how do you know something hasn't happened to them?

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.460
 Now, Sam, just be sensible.

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:43.360
 They certainly aren't very far away.

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.360
 Oh, that may be Henry right now. He wants you to come and get him someplace.

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.960
 You tell Henry that wherever he is he's to start for home at once.

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:54.160
 Yes, dear. Hello. Yes, Mrs. Kendall. This is Mrs. Aldrich.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.460
 Oh, really? Really? This afternoon?

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:02.360
 You don't say so. Well, Mrs. Kendall, I'll tell him.

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.560
 Thank you for calling. Goodbye.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.360
 Alice, did you tell him as dinner's getting called?

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.960
 Sam, that was Mrs. Kendall, and she's terribly upset.

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:09.960
 Yes, what's the trouble?

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:13.160
 Well, she just discovered Henry made out a war bond pledge for her to sign

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.160
 And she thought it was for a hundred dollars and it was for a thousand.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:16.660
 Yeah?

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.160
 And he also left one of his furlined gloves there.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.160
 At the candles?

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.160
 Alice, the candles live at least a mile and a half out of town.

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.160
 Yes, dear, on the north road.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.160
 But a mile and a half isn't so far.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.160
 I know, but it started to snow. It's snowing hard.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.160
 And I say they ought to be here.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:37.160
 (Dramatic music)

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:43.360
 (Dramatic music)

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.840
 - Did you get your folks Henry?

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.240
 - No Homer, Gee was the line still busy.

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.040
 - Boy, every time I call him it seems to be busy.

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.200
 - Boy, we just had a phone call for ya.

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:54.880
 - You did Mrs. Cooper for my father?

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.040
 - From your father.

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:57.160
 - No, for Mrs. Snyder.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.080
 She lives about a mile on up the road.

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.960
 - Mrs. Snyder?

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.440
 - Yes, she called ask whether you know

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.160
 You left one of your overshoes at her house.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:03.860
 We did.

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:05.660
 Oh boy, look, it's mine.

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:08.160
 Now listen, homie, you're getting more darn careful.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.260
 Well, I can't remember everything, Henry.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.920
 I have to carry all our pencils and all our bond information, don't I?

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:14.420
 Say.

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:16.620
 Aren't you boys sorta hungry?

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:17.440
 Hungry?

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.680
 I've got some nice corn, beef, and cabbage out in the kitchen.

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:20.760
 I could warm up for ya.

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:23.840
 Oh no, Henry's mother has a swell dinner waiting for us.

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.680
 She fixin' potato pancakes in a cherry pie.

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.120
 Just because I like them.

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:29.920
 Potato pancakes in cherry pie.

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:34.620
 Sure, as a matter of fact, I like any kind of cherries, just as long as they're canned.

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:36.820
 Well, you're easy to please, aren't you?

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:37.820
 Good Jane.

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:39.420
 Yes, well, I'll be right there.

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:42.220
 Can we don't you think you ought to try phoning your folks again?

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:43.720
 Well, I'll try, Homer.

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:47.720
 But my folks know we're out selling bombs, and if they aren't, why should we get upset?

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:59.720
 [MUSIC]

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:03.720
 I'll answer it, Alice, if that's the boys I want to speak to them.

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.720
 Hello? Yes, this is Samuel Orich.

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:06.720
 Oh, is it Sam?

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:07.720
 It's long distance.

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:08.720
 Oh, my goodness.

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:09.720
 Sam, who is it?

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:10.720
 Hello.

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:11.720
 Alice, it's Homer's mother.

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:12.720
 Oh, my goodness.

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:13.720
 From way over in Abbott City.

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:14.720
 Yes, Elizabeth.

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:15.720
 Homer's fine.

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:17.720
 No, he's no trouble at all.

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:21.720
 Mrs. Orich made some potato pancakes for him tonight and...

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:23.720
 You want to speak to him?

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:28.720
 Well, Elizabeth, right this minute, he and Henry stepped out for a few minutes.

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:31.720
 But there's nothing to worry about, I don't think.

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:35.720
 Yes, Elizabeth, we'll see if it wears his overshoes.

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:36.720
 Yes, goodbye.

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:39.720
 Sam, do you realize it's going on nine o'clock?

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:40.720
 Well, what if it is?

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:43.720
 But don't you realize it's snowing out and Henry has only one glove?

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:45.720
 I know it, Alice, but you told me not to worry.

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:49.720
 Dear, if Elizabeth Brown was worried enough to call all the way from Abbott City,

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:51.720
 it seems to me the least you can do is worry a little.

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:54.720
 Sam, let me answer it. I'll see who it is.

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:55.720
 Hello?

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.720
 Yes, this is Mrs. Aldrich.

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:04.720
 Yes, Mr. Edmonds. My goodness, two hours ago, his earmuffs.

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:06.720
 Well, thank you so much. Goodbye.

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:07.720
 Where is he?

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:11.720
 Henry left his earmuffs at the Edmonds out on the north road nearly two hours ago.

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:14.720
 At the Edmonds? That means they're getting farther and farther away from home.

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:17.720
 And Sam, just listen to that wind howl out there.

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:18.720
 Well, I know what I'm going to do.

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:19.720
 Sam, where are you going?

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:20.720
 Get my hat and coat.

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:21.720
 You mean you're going to look for them?

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:24.720
 But Sam, do you think you can drive the cars through this snowstorm?

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:26.560
 No, I don't worry about me, Alice.

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:28.000
 It's the boys you've got to think about.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:45.080
 Those boys comfortable in the room, Jane?

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:47.600
 Yes, Will. And Will, don't say anything.

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:48.960
 But I'm going to surprise them.

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:51.400
 Yes. I'm going to fix them some potato pancakes

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:52.600
 and open a can of cherries.

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:53.840
 Yeah. Was that all?

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:55.680
 Well, one of them says it's all he ever eats.

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:56.480
 Yes?

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:57.580
 Mr. Cooper.

00:07:57.580 --> 00:07:58.980
 Yes, sir. I'll be right there.

00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:01.780
 Mr. Cooper, are you sure your phone works alright?

00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:03.080
 I don't know why it shouldn't.

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:05.380
 You boys wouldn't like to stay overnight, would you?

00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:06.880
 Oh, no. No thanks.

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:10.880
 If we don't get home before long, my folks might begin to wonder where we are.

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:13.080
 Sorry, we couldn't buy a bomb from you boys.

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:16.580
 We only had some way to get our cow into town and sell her. I'd be able to buy one.

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:18.080
 You would, Mr. Cooper?

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:19.880
 Yeah, but my truck's broken down.

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:22.780
 Henry, why couldn't we help him get his cow into town?

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:25.000
 Sure, we could walk her in for ya.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.280
 Well, if you want to come out and get her someday, she's right out there in the barn.

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:29.520
 And you'll buy a war barn?

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:32.080
 We'll turn every cent we can get for in the barns.

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:33.780
 Well, where's the candle, sir?

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:35.540
 Just a minute, Jane, I'll be right there.

00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:39.020
 Boy, Henry, I bet if we could sell that cow, we'd get $50 for her.

00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:39.960
 $50, Homer.

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:40.800
 $50?

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:41.820
 Are you crazy?

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:43.420
 Is that too much for a good cow?

00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:44.920
 Too much, Homer.

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:47.520
 She was, I heard of a cow once going for $1,000.

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:48.460
 $1,000?

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:50.640
 Or maybe it was $2,000 or $3,000?

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:52.160
 Just an ordinary cow.

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:54.160
 What do you mean ordinary?

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:56.720
 She gave something like five tons of butter a year.

00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:58.460
 Does that sound very ordinary?

00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:00.300
 Five tons of butter?

00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:01.360
 Sure.

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:02.600
 Are you sure it was butter?

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:05.760
 Homer, the point is we can sell Mr. Cooper a bond.

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:09.480
 Oh, listen, Henry, is that the wind I hear outside?

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:12.120
 Boy, we ought to be getting started for home.

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:14.320
 What do you say we take a look at the front door?

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:15.560
 Put your things on first, Homer.

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:17.480
 I'm putting them on, I'm putting them on.

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:20.440
 Come on, let's take a look out here.

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:23.740
 Oh boy, can we just think we ought to go home tonight?

00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:24.740
 We've got to.

00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:27.240
 Don't you realize we're going to sell more bombs tomorrow?

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:28.640
 And we've got to get an early start.

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:29.640
 That's true.

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:31.640
 Well, let's get started.

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:33.640
 Oh, Mrs. Cooper!

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:35.640
 Mr. Cooper!

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:37.640
 I wonder where they are.

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:40.640
 Can we donate that door open like that closing room?

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:41.640
 Come on.

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:42.640
 Okay.

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:43.640
 Now don't push me.

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:44.640
 I'm not pushing you.

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:46.640
 I'm just hanging on to you.

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:48.640
 Listen, I've got an idea.

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:50.640
 Boy, if we can do it!

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:52.640
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:09:52.640 --> 00:10:09.640
 Good evening, Mrs. Edmund.

00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:10.640
 Good evening, Mr. Oldridge.

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:12.640
 What are you doing way out here?

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:13.640
 Come on in out of the snow.

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:14.640
 Thank you.

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:15.640
 Thank you.

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:18.140
 I understand Henry and the friend of his were out here,

00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:20.940
 I thought you might give me some information as to which way they went.

00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:23.380
 Well, as I recall it, they were here about six o'clock.

00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:25.180
 Mr. Edmonds bought a bond from them.

00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:26.820
 Oh, and incidentally, here are Henry's earmuffs.

00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:28.340
 Oh, thank you. Thank you.

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:30.980
 But I have no idea to which direction they went from here, Mr. Alden.

00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:31.900
 No.

00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:33.500
 You mind if I use your phone, Mrs. Edmonds?

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:36.100
 No, help yourself. It's right here.

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:36.860
 Hello.

00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:37.660
 Number, please.

00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:39.020

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:40.700
 Please.

00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:41.780
 You mean your boy's loss?

00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:42.500
 Oh, no.

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:45.460
 No, Henry isn't lost, but it's getting on toward 10 o'clock.

00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:47.060
 And naturally, we're a bit more comfortable.

00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:47.660
 Hello?

00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:48.780
 Hello is this you Alice?

00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:50.060
 Yes dear where are you?

00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:51.220
 I'm out at the Edmonds.

00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:56.140
 Well my goodness Sam they announced on the radio that the storm was getting worse and the cars were getting stuck.

00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:58.460
 And I phoned for a tow truck to go out and find you.

00:10:58.460 --> 00:10:59.660
 Alice why did you do that?

00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:01.580
 Because I hadn't heard from you Sam.

00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:02.580
 Did you find the boat?

00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:05.460
 No Alice I thought that maybe by this time you would have some word from them.

00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:07.940
 Well I've had one phone call Sam from the Joneses.

00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:08.660
 The Joneses?

00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:10.220
 They live out on the north road.

00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:16.140
 And Mr. Jones says Henry and Homer had been there and that after they left he found an automatic pencil with your name on it.

00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:17.060
 My pencil?

00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:18.060
 Yes, dear.

00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:19.060
 Well, that's a fine thing.

00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:21.060
 Now, listen, I'm going to have a talk with Henry.

00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:24.060
 Now, dear, let's not worry about a pencil at a time like this.

00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:25.060
 Let's find the boys.

00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:26.060
 All right.

00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:27.060
 Good-bye, dear.

00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:28.060
 Good-bye.

00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:29.060
 Mr. Edmonds.

00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:30.060
 Yes, Mr. Olrich.

00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:31.060
 Which direction do the Joneses live from here?

00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:33.060
 Well, you want to go on out this road about two more miles.

00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:34.060
 Two miles?

00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:35.060
 Yes.

00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:36.060
 Are the boys out there?

00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:37.060
 No, but they've been out that way.

00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:42.060
 Mr. Olrich, I've just been talking with Mr. Edmonds, and he's going to take his car and work in the other direction.

00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:44.060
 You sure it won't be too much trouble?

00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:45.060
 No, not at all.

00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:48.340
 a little early tonight but just as soon as he gets his clothes on he'll be starting.

00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:49.500
 Oh thanks.

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:51.020
 Some night out.

00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:52.020
 Mr. Aldrich.

00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:54.780
 Don't you want me to get you a paper bag to put those ear mops in?

00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:55.860
 No thank you.

00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:56.860
 I'll put them right on.

00:11:56.860 --> 00:12:12.660
 Boy is this some night homer?

00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:15.700
 Keep your head down Henry, sort of walk backwards.

00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:17.400
 What do you think I'm doing?

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:20.580
 Boy, Henry look ahead, there's a truck or something.

00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:21.420
 Where?

00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:23.100
 Right down the road, it's just standing there.

00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:24.620
 Oh boy, come on.

00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:25.460
 I'm coming.

00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:28.340
 It's only so fast I can go though, Henry.

00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:30.100
 She was on that Hercules.

00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:32.180
 Look, Homer, it's a tow truck.

00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:35.940
 Hey, Mr. Mr. Who's there?

00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:37.340
 It's Oz.

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:39.340
 Can you give us a lift, please?

00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:41.900
 Okay, if I can get out of this trip here.

00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:45.340
 Well, Gee whiz, are you going all the way into Sanderville?

00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:46.020
 Yep.

00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:48.820
 Yes, as soon as I find a car I'm out looking for her.

00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:49.860
 I'll burn the bag.

00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:51.420
 Well, look.

00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:54.580
 Do you have room for a cow on your truck?

00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:55.340
 What's that?

00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:56.660
 We've got this cow.

00:12:56.660 --> 00:12:57.580

00:12:57.580 --> 00:12:59.500
 We're taking her into town for a guy,

00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:00.940
 and we're going to surprise him.

00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:02.460

00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:03.220

 Shall I tell the boys to come into their supper?

 Not for another minute, Will.

 I want to get these potato pan takes a little bit brown here.

00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:32.700
 I knew all the time we'd find a can of cherries down the cellar.

00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:35.700
 Just the case of our keeping on, we located them.

00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:37.700
 Didn't I hear bass mowing when we came up from the cellar?

00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:41.540
 What if you did she's all right she couldn't warm out there in the barn.

00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:43.420
 Of course she is she likes the cold.

 You know Henry. She isn't a bad cow, is she?

 No, she isn't.

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:21.740
 And I think she likes walking better than she did riding on that truck.

00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:27.940
 Boy that wasn't a lot of work just nicely got her on the door and thing and he runs right into another drift

00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:32.580
 That driver was a nice guy though. It was very decent of him to promise to buy a bond promise

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:38.840
 Wait a second Henry wait a second. What's the matter have we gotten off the road a little? Oh boy

00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:44.560
 We're a disnow dip come from now. Wait Homer get around on the other side of him. Go try to back around

00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:51.440
 Wait a second Henry wait a second. I think she's getting cold around the ears. Well, what are you gonna do?

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:54.040
 Time may muffle around her head, what do you think?

00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:56.040
 Well, Chief, that's a good idea.

 No, ma'am.

 Hit me, she wouldn't want some corn too, would she?

00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:57.740
 No, Homer, it might upset her.

 Well, I can get you the potato cakes and the cherries,

00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:00.740

00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:14.240
 Get a daylight, brother.

00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:19.240
 First it made it always like a cow and then it swung around the building here and headed out toward the road.

00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:20.240
 I saw it was a big shaggy moose.

00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:23.240
 Homer, come on. Listen, Henry, I'm not going to chase any moose.

00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:24.240
 Where'd he go, Mr. Where'd he go?

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:26.240
 He headed right up the road there.

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:29.240
 Homer, aren't you coming? That's vast. Come on!

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:47.440
 I don't know, it begins to look as if Homer Brown would never get those potato pancakes,

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:48.440
 doesn't it?

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:52.640
 On the other hand, by the time he and Henry plow through another mile or two of cold and

00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:56.960
 snow, they may be lots more interested in something good and hot to drink.

00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:58.960
 And that could very well be Postam.

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:03.920
 For Postam is certainly a good drink, and served piping hot in the cup with cream or

00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:09.680
 top milk added to taste, Postam has a look that says, "Drink me in capital letters."

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:10.840
 That's the taste.

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:11.680
 It's my opinion.

00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:13.620
 There isn't a meal time drink made that

00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:16.000
 can beat that tantalizing goodness.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.640
 That lusty, robust, post-em flavor.

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:22.200
 A flavor that's really distinctive, really unusual.

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:24.520
 That means you mustn't expect when you try it,

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:26.760
 that post-em is going to taste like coffee,

00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:29.760
 any more than you'd expect coffee to taste like tea.

00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:33.080
 Remember, post-em has its own special goodness.

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:35.240
 And like is not, when you've once discovered

00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:38.240
 how very good that is, you and post-em

00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:41.520
 will be mealtime partners the rest of your days.

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:44.320
 So tomorrow, get Postam at your grocers.

00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:47.880
 And tomorrow night, get set to enjoy one of America's

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:50.800
 great mealtime drinks, Postam.

00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:53.380
 (upbeat music)

00:18:53.380 --> 00:19:03.400
 Now getting back to the troubles of Henry Olbridge.

00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:06.800
 Henry and its friend Homer, outselling war bonds,

00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:10.800
 I've been unable to get back home in time for dinner because of a heavy blizzard.

00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:14.800
 The scene opens on a road some distance outside Centerville.

00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:17.300
 The time is very late at night.

00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:23.300
 I'm Jim, Mr. Eldridge from Centerville.

00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:24.300
 I am?

00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:27.300
 Well, guess you're the fellow who sent out the tow in.

00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:28.300
 Oh, yeah?

00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:31.300
 How did you get your car sideways across the road like this?

00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:33.800
 Well, I've been out looking for my son and a friend of his.

00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:39.000
 I was driving along and I know you won't believe me but coming right up the road toward me I saw a bear.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.800
 What's that? A big black bear.

00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:45.300
 He was walking on all fours and I jammed on the brakes and swared around like this.

00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:48.700
 Well Mr. Aldrich, sir, aren't any of you there? It's this part of the country.

00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:51.300
 That's what I thought but I saw it with my own eyes.

00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:54.100
 What's that? Another car trying to get by?

00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:55.500
 Hey, what's the trouble there?

00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:58.700
 Is it fairly here, sir? He was just attacked by a bear.

00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:03.300
 What's that? Look, while you're hooking on, I'm going to this roadside stand here and phone my wife.

00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:05.300

 [SIGHS]

00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:10.300
 - Something I can do for you? - Good evening.

00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:11.300
 You have a telephone here?

00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:13.300
 Sure, right over there by that jukebox.

00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:16.300
 Well, by the way, you couldn't be fixing something up for me that's hot, could you?

00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:18.300
 Well, I've got a special on tonight, potato pancakes.

00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:19.300
 Potato pancakes?

00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:21.300
 No thanks, I'll just telephone.

00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:33.300
 (music)

00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:39.300
 Come on Homer, come on in the house.

00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:41.300
 I'm coming. Boy am I cold.

00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:43.300
 Mother don't fix us up with something right away.

00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:45.300
 Mother! Mrs. Aldrich.

00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:48.300
 Mother! Father?

00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:51.300
 She was... Do you suppose they'd gone out?

00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:55.380
 Henry let's see what's out in the kitchen. You know I think that's going to be very comfortable

00:20:55.380 --> 00:21:00.660
 where we left her. I don't know why she shouldn't be. Look Homer look in the ice box your favorite

00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:06.340
 food. What is it Henry what is it? Potato pancakes. And boy do I like them cold. And look Homer

00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:11.300
 there's half a cherry pie there. Oh boy we'll split it Henry. Here put it on here over on the

00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:17.300
 kitchen table. Okay oh boy what a dinner. Oh boy. Now listen Homer when you cut that pie at least

00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:20.660
 Choose a knife. It breaks alright Henry. It breaks very nicely.

00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:26.980
 In the potato pancake. Don't bother me Homer. I just found something. What?

00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:34.660
 No here. It's for my father. It says Sam, Harriet, call and think they might have gone to the movies.

00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:38.900
 Have gone down to the movies to look. Who wrote it? My mother. Who do you think?

00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:43.540
 Well, what if it's good pictures she's seen? Aren't you going to eat anything Henry?

00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:46.240
 Here Homer, use a fork. Remember you're a guest.

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:49.540
 I don't need a fork. I'm just rolling them up and slip them in.

00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:51.940
 Answer the phone. Well, I catch up with you.

00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:54.740
 Okay. Homer, won't you please hurry?

00:21:54.740 --> 00:21:56.040
 I'm going to answer it.

00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:58.540
 I got my mouth emptied first though.

00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:01.540
 Hello. Who?

00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:04.040
 Well, this is Homer Brown.

00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:06.540
 Oh, gee, was this that you, Mother?

00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:08.540
 Sure, this is Homer.

00:22:08.540 --> 00:22:11.040
 I haven't been any place.

00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:13.040
 Oh, we got a cow, see?

00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:15.040
 A cow!

00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:18.040
 We're gonna turn it into war bonds.

00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:23.040
 No, Mr. and Mrs. Old return here. They've gone to the movies.

00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:27.040
 Sure. And in a few minutes, I'm going to bed.

00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:42.040
 Sam, is that you?

00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:43.040
 Yes, Alice.

00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:45.040
 My goodness dear, where have you been?

00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:46.040
 Where have I been?

00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:47.040
 Where have I been?

00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:48.040
 Where are the boys?

00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:49.040
 Haven't you found them?

00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:50.040
 No, Alice.

00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:53.040
 All I found were these ear muffs, this overshoe and my pencil.

00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:55.040
 Where were you when I was trying to phone you?

00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:56.040
 Sam, didn't you get my nose?

00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:57.040
 What nose?

00:22:57.040 --> 00:22:59.040
 Oh, of course you didn't, dear. How could you?

00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:00.040
 I've been down to the movies.

00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:02.040
 You went to the movies?

00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:05.040
 Yes, dear. And I just called Harriet and gave her a piece of my mind.

00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:06.040
 What about?

00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:08.040
 She gets the silliest ideas, Sam.

00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:11.040
 First she called me and said she thought she'd seen the boys going to the movies earlier in the evening.

00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:15.080
 earlier in the evening and now what do you think she says but she says there's

00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:19.240
 a story going around that somebody saw a bear out on the edge of town what's

00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:22.040
 wrong with that

00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:27.760
 I saw a bear myself no I did Alice that's how I got stuck has something gone

00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:31.160
 wrong with the car no it's all right now I've got it out in front and what I

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:35.000
 want to know is where I'm going to look for the boys next

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:40.680
 you hear what I just heard no dear what was it well I'm not sure but it sounded

00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:46.240
 like a cow. Now Sam first you see a bear and then you come home and hear cows. I

00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:49.560
 don't know what it is I hear but it certainly something and I'm going off to

00:23:49.560 --> 00:24:00.760
 see what it is. But Sam. Hello. What's that Mrs. Edmonds? Mr. Edmonds is back home. He had

00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:06.720
 to leave his car on a hill. Oh isn't that a shame? Mr. Aldrich left. What is your

00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:13.680
 place his stop well thank you so much for calling goodbye that you down there

00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:18.960
 Henry all rich where are you she was I've been in bed did you see a good picture

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:23.880
 Henry what's happened to Homer I mean this is all rich all right I just have a

00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:27.120
 little stomachache for some reason mother we weren't able to get to sleep

00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:31.400
 may I ask where you've been selling bombs mother and it looks as though we're

00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:35.040
 going to break all the records boy I'll say we sold a burn to turn near every

00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:39.520
 place we went to. But, dear, look at my ear muffs. Did I leave these here before I

00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:45.440
 start off today? Henry, your father found those. Father? Where is he? He's outside

00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:49.200
 there. And when he comes in, I wouldn't bother him very much. Something wrong with

00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:53.880
 him, Mrs. Aldrich? He's tired, Homer. Very tired. And so much on edge, you even

00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:57.640
 thinks he hears a cow. A cow, mother? Yes, dear. He just stepped out to look for

00:24:57.640 --> 00:25:02.560
 one. She was, Henry, do you suppose best is calling us? Who? Best, mother, best. A

00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:06.480
 - A warbon cow. - Sure, Mrs. Old, which we're gonna surprise a farmer.

00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:09.840
 Surprise, a what? A farmer mother. We're going to sell us cow for him.

00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:12.800
 Where? Where? - Henry, where is the cow?

00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:16.960
 Out in the garage. - In the garage? - Sure, we brought her all away into town.

00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:19.920
 Through this door? - Yes, mother, but we kept her good and warm.

00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:24.560
 And we now have a cow out in our garage? - Sure, we even gave her some oatmeal.

00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:30.160
 Boy, did she laugh it out. Now, dear, oatmeal. - Sure, mother, we even put some milk on it.

00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:32.960
 No. You gave us some of our milk?

00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:36.560
 Oh no, Mrs. Aldrich. We do some off of her in pointing on the off-

00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:38.860
 [crowd laughs]

00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:42.860
 Oh boy, if I were you, I'd go back upstairs before your father comes in.

00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:44.360
 Right now, right now.

00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:47.760
 Will you promise to call us Mrs. Aldrich if he feels best once?

00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:48.660
 Yes, dear.

00:25:48.660 --> 00:25:52.260
 Come on, Homer. As a matter of fact, I'm beginning to feel a strain a little myself.

00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:54.760
 Same here. At least I want to lie then.

00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:55.360
 Alice.

00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:56.460
 Yes, Sam.

00:25:56.460 --> 00:26:00.220
 I know you'll say I'm seeing things, but there is a cow in our garage.

00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:02.260
 Well, yes, dear, of course there is.

00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:03.060
 But, sir?

00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:04.460
 The boys put her there.

00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:05.160
 But, boys?

00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:07.260
 Henry and Homer, they're upstairs and there.

00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:08.460
 Why didn't you tell me?

00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:09.860
 What did they bring a cow home for?

00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:10.460
 Well, Sam...

00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:10.960
 Of all...

00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:12.060
 Now, Sam, where are you going?

00:26:12.060 --> 00:26:13.260
 I'm going up and have a talk with them.

00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:14.460
 Now, Sam, come back here.

00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:15.160
 But, boy...

00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:17.860
 Don't you realize those boys have been selling bonds all day?

00:26:17.860 --> 00:26:20.260
 That's no excuse, Alice. Think of what I've been through tonight.

00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:22.060
 But do you think of what they've been through, too?

00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:24.260
 They sold a bond at every house they went to.

00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:24.860
 Yes?

00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:30.780
 And that cow Sam that upset you so do you realize what that cow is what a war-bond pledge

00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:35.580
 what sir yes dear and they let her all the way back to town through this storm and everything

00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:39.580
 they hadn't even had supper oh my goodness Sam don't you realize what that means

00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:41.980
 but Alice they might have given us a little consideration

00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:46.620
 Sam they hadn't even given themselves consideration there's only one thing that was important and

00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:51.420
 that was to sell just as many bonds as they possibly could that's the only spirit with which we've

00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:52.820
 You're gonna win this whole war.

00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:53.520
 Well...

00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:55.020
 Mother, yes, dear.

00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:56.720
 Could you come take a look at Homer?

00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:57.420
 At Homer?

00:26:57.420 --> 00:26:58.220
 Yes, please.

00:26:58.220 --> 00:27:01.020
 You just began to take the churries and that pie weren't pitted.

00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:22.800
 Friends you can get post-em in two forms, post-em and instant post-em.

00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:26.700
 Instant post-em is the quick and easy way to make one cup or six

00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:31.940
 because instant post-em dissolves instantly in your cup by just adding boiling water.

00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:34.840
 No matter which form of post-em you choose however,

00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:38.900
 you can count on enjoying a delightful and distinctive treat.

00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:43.900
 For post-em is one of America's great meal time drinks.

00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:51.900
 (music)

00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:53.900
 Hey, you are, Mrs. Cooper.

00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:54.900
 Yes, Mr. Holdrich.

00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:56.900
 Here's the money the boys got when they sold your car.

00:27:56.900 --> 00:27:57.900
 Well, thank you.

00:27:57.900 --> 00:27:59.900
 And now you can sign a pledge for a bond.

00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:02.900
 Well, it certainly was nice of you to drive all the way out here.

00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:04.900
 Won't you stay and have a little bite of lunch with us?

00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:05.900
 Can we, Father?

00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:06.900
 Well, fine, fine.

00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:09.900
 Alright, I'll go out to the kitchen and put the potato pancakes on.

00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:10.900
 The potato pancake?

00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:11.900
 Now, wait.

00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:23.900
 [Music]

00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:31.900
 Listen again next week, same time, same station, for another sparkling half hour with your favorite youngster, his family and his pals.

00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:34.900
 The oldridge family is written by Clifford Goldsmith.

00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:37.900
 The original musical score is conducted by Jack Miller.

00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:45.900
 And this is Dan Seymour saying, "Your host tonight is Postam, and Postam is one of America's great mealtime drinks."

00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:48.900
 It's good drinking. Good night.

00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:58.900
