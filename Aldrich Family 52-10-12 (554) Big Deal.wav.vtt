 [Music]

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 Henry Henry, old great coming mother.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 [Applause]

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
 Yes, it's the oldest family, transcribed and written by Clifford Goldsmith.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
 [applause]

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:34.000
 [music]

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
 Everyone knows Centerville, USA, because it's your own hometown,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 and everyone knows the Aldrich family because they're your very next-door neighbors.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
 And everyone especially knows Henry Aldrich,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
 Because he's your son's pal, your daughter's boyfriend, a real American boy.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 The scene is the Aldridge living room, the time is early evening.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 Henry, get washed, dinner's almost ready.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 All right, mother.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 Sam, I think Henry's getting ideas again about my birthday present this year.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 I hope you gave him a clear hint as to what I wanted.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 I did.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 A clear hint?

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 I told him you wanted Hemingway's new book, The Old Man in the Sea.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.600
 Is that a clear hint?

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.480
 Well, Henry, I'm not sure.

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.200
 Did he say anything?

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.640
 No, but I had a definite feeling

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.400
 he was wondering why you were interested

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.600
 in other old men when you had me.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.320
 Not dear.

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.480
 I just hope it sinks in.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.880
 I don't want another pair of Siamese fighting fish

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.200
 like last year.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.880
 It was depressing the way those two fish hated each other.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:39.800
 Father?

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.840
 I've been here with your mother, Henry.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.240
 Jimus, I didn't mean to interrupt.

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.360
 It's all right, dear.

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.600
 I was just telling your father how much I wanted to read the old man in the sea.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.720
 The old man and...

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.360
 What's that mother?

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.400
 Sam.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.960
 I'll try again.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.600
 Father, did I tell you what I'm going to put over on Charlie Clark?

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.480
 Boy, am I going to make money.

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:00.400
 Put over on him.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.040
 Henry, I hope you're not planning to do something you shouldn't.

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.880
 Oh, no.

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.520
 Charlie wants to buy this flashlight, see?

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:07.000
 And I'm going to...

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.080
 You're telling the flashlight I bought you this summer?

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.760
 Oh, no, sir. One just like it.

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:11.840
 Looks the same to me.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:12.960
 Well, sure.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.040
 They're both super ray hydrogent cosmic beams.

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.480
 Only this one doesn't work.

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:18.340
 Oh.

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.120
 Charlie wants to buy my super ray hydrogent cosmic beam.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.040
 Only I wouldn't sell it, see.

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.880
 But today I happen to be talking to another guy.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.320
 And he said, just casually, do you

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.120
 want to buy a super ray hydrogent cosmic beam?

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.400
 And it was exactly like mine, except for the difference.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.280
 So I said, I'll give you $0.25 for it.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.280
 He said, $30.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.720
 I said, no, $25.

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:39.240
 He said--

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.760
 How much did you finally pay for it?

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.160
 $0.30.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:48.160
 And now you have two super hyped something or other cosmic beams?

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.160
 Well, sure.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.160
 But isn't it clear, Father?

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:57.160
 I'll buy batteries for 25 cents, so one flashlight to Charlie for a dollar and make 50 cents clear for profit.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.160
 Mmm.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.160
 Father, would you care to take a look at it?

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.160
 Why should I look at it?

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.160
 Boy, just tell me, maybe you'd like to make an offer.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.160
 I have a flashlight.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.160
 But do you have one you can buy for a dollar?

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.160
 I mean, well, this one will help you see where you're going.

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.760
 I'm sorry, Henry, but I know where I'm going.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.760
 Mother, would you like to get in on the opportunity?

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.560
 Mother, I think the potatoes are ready.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:20.760
 Be right there, Mary.

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:21.660
 Would you, Mother?

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.160
 No, thank you, Henry.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.760
 You wouldn't be interested in owning something

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.560
 that could keep you from stumbling over stuff?

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:28.760
 Mother?

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.960
 Apparently she'd rather stumble.

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.560
 [LAUGHTER]

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.860
 Father, now that Mother's going, I can tell you

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.360
 why I'm making all this money.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:37.160
 Oh, all right.

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:38.360
 It's for her birthday.

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.560
 Well, I thought you had some money, at least enough,

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.560
 to give her that book she wants.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.800
 Well, I have, Father, but I certainly don't want to give her just a book for her birthday.

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:51.200
 After she's slaved over me all these years, she wants Hemingway's book, son.

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.880
 This flashlight is only the beginning. I'll make at least 50 cents on it.

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.880
 Then I'll invest that and double it. Then I'll invest that and triple it.

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.760
 She's by the time her birthday comes around, I can get her anything.

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.560
 What she wants, Henry, is the book.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:05.440
 Henry?

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:06.240
 Yes, Mother?

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.240
 Will you answer the phone, please?

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.240
 And if it's for you, keep it short.

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:11.540
 Dinner's in five minutes.

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.340
 Sure, Mother.

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.540
 You know, Father, I wonder why more people don't go into business.

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:18.440
 Please answer the phone.

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.940
 Yes, sir.

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.340
 I'm answering it.

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:22.240
 Hello?

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.340
 Henry, my mother said you wanted me to call you about something,

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.440
 and I'm also to say we've got to eat in three minutes.

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.640
 Oh, is that you, Charlie?

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:33.340
 Hello, Charlie, old timer?

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:34.640
 What do you want, Henry?

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.940
 It's a great opportunity, Charlie.

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.940
 I've located a swell super ray hydrojet cosmic beam.

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:41.940
 So what?

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.940
 Well, I might be willing to sell it to you.

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:46.940
 I don't want one anymore.

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:47.940
 You don't want one?

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.940
 I'm going to save up and get a camera.

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.940
 Oh gee whiz Charlie, that leaves me holding two super...

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:55.940
 That's no way to do business.

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:58.940
 Who's talking about business? I just want a camera now.

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.940
 Well, wouldn't you like a flashlight so you could see where you're going?

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.940
 I'd rather take pictures and see where I've been.

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:07.940
 But Charlie, so long.

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:09.940
 Oh boy.

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:11.940
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:26.460
 I've got to go to class, Henry.

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.060
 Either you do or you don't want to buy this camera.

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:32.460
 But home or $2 for a second hand camera?

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.420
 You sound like my mother at the meat market.

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:36.420
 Wait a minute.

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:39.380
 Would you take this Super Ray Hydro Jet Cosmic Beam for it?

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:40.380
 That?

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:41.380
 Well gee, let's see it.

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:43.380
 It doesn't like any ordinary flashlight.

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:44.380
 Well let's see.

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:48.140
 Just press the old Super Ray button here and well if you had a battery you'd get your

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:49.140
 cosmic beam.

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:50.140
 Oh boy.

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:51.660
 I don't want it.

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:56.180
 I'll wait a minute Homer.

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:58.140
 I'm not asking you to pay me for this.

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:00.300
 I'll give it to you for the camera.

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:04.460
 Well give me the Super Ray Hydro Jet Cosmic Beam and a dollar.

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:07.860
 I'll give you the super ray hydrojet cosmic beam in 50 cents.

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:08.360
 A dollar.

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:08.760
 Fifty.

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:09.360
 Seventy-five.

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:09.760
 Sixty.

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:10.860
 Sixty-five.

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:11.360
 So.

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:11.860
 So.

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:13.560
 [LAUGHTER]

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:16.460
 You know Homer, that's the way I like to do business.

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:19.660
 And if you see Charlie Clark, tell him I've got something for him.

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:21.660
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:30.560
 But she, wisdom, other Charlie's only coming over for a little while

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:31.160
 tonight.

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:33.360
 For how long, dear?

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:38.960
 probably haggle a little. How long will it take you to haggle? It depends on who's the best haggler.

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:44.560
 Only I'm sure I can out haggle him. Henry, your pardon by mentioning anything is unimportant

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:50.000
 his homework. It's perfectly all right, Father. Thank you. When are you going to attend to it?

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.680
 Just as soon as I've cleaned up Charlie. And don't worry, Father. The assignment tonight is a breeze.

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:59.920
 It's an essay and I've got it all down in my mind. And may I suggest you start transferring it

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:01.680
 it from your mind to paper.

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:02.880
 Pardon?

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:04.680
 Start writing.

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:06.880
 Well, it won't take me a half hour, honest.

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:09.320
 We all have to write about the profession

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:11.120
 I am preparing for.

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:12.320
 Well, that's fine.

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:14.600
 You know, I wasn't much older than you when I started

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:17.960
 thinking seriously about preparing myself for law.

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:18.800
 For law, huh?

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.280
 For law?

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:21.920
 Well, the only thing that really appeals to me

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:22.960
 is selling things.

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:24.280
 Selling things?

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:25.160
 Sure.

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:28.520
 I buy something for a little, and I sell it to you for a lot.

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:30.520
 Why do you want to do that, dear?

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:33.520
 Oh, she, mother, I guess I have an act for it, that's all.

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:38.020
 Maybe it's hereditary. Did we ever have any tycoons in our family?

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:43.320
 I don't mind your shooting, hi, son, but don't overlook the legal profession.

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:44.320
 Well...

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:45.820
 It isn't bad, you know.

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:49.820
 I provided a very comfortable home here, haven't I? As a lawyer?

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:51.220
 Well, sure, father.

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:54.120
 But wasn't the man that sold it to you a business man?

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:54.820
 He was.

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:56.020
 There you are.

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:58.520
 He's got all your money and all you got was this house.

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:01.720
 Boy, I hope that isn't Charlie yet.

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:03.040
 But you're expecting him.

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:04.680
 Only Toby's supposed to get here first.

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:06.840
 I agreed to Charlie, but Toby...

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:08.320
 He's part of the same deal, mother.

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:11.400
 If you want to see how big business operates, stick around.

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:12.000
 Bang.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.320
 Oh boy, Toby, for a minute I was afraid you were Charlie.

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:17.280
 Well, I'm not. I know it. Come on in.

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:18.960
 What do you want me to come over for?

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:20.680
 I want you to help me do something.

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:23.240
 Come on, Toby. We'll go in the dining room.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.500
 What's that about, Henry?

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:29.460
 First of all, you're positive you don't want to buy a camera.

00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:33.460
 Henry, I'm in the position of not being able to buy even a package or chewing gum.

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:36.580
 Well, look, maybe we can work a little commission out of this.

00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:39.180
 Charlie Clark does want to buy it, see.

00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:40.780
 But he'll try to get it from me cheap.

00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:42.060
 And what do I do?

00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:43.840
 You'll wait out here alone, see?

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:49.660
 And then when you hear Charlie make an offer on my camera, you come into the living room as though you wanted it, and offer 10 cents more.

00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:52.600
 But, Henry, I just explained my financial situation.

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:54.360
 You don't need any money, Toby.

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:56.360
 This is just a way to encourage business.

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:58.760
 Henry, you have another guess.

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:01.660
 Yes, mother, I'm getting things ready for him.

00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:03.160
 I raised Charlie 10 cents.

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:03.760
 Sure.

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:04.260
 OK.

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:05.360
 Now stay here.

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:06.560
 While I go into the living room.

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:07.260
 OK.

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:08.060
 Henry.

00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:09.360
 Coming, father.

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:10.560
 Hello, Henry.

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:11.960
 Hi there, Charlie.

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:14.260
 Sit on, my friend.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:17.460
 Oh, uh, mother, father, do you mind if we discuss

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:19.360
 a little business in front of you?

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:21.160
 Of course, someday when I have my own office.

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:21.660
 Thank you.

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:24.260
 but I think I'll do some work out in the garage.

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:25.560
 - Well, there's a frost tonight.

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:27.600
 Sam is too cold to work out there.

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:28.700
 - Then the basement.

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:29.960
 - But if you really like to stay here--

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:31.760
 - I'm not that bloodthirsty.

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:35.640
 - Sam, I wanna show you where I'd like another shelf for preserves.

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:40.340
 - What did your father mean about not being bloodthirsty?

00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:43.880
 - Well, it's just a family expression.

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:46.840
 Here, Charlie, take a more comfortable chair.

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:48.440
 - What's wrong with this?

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:51.080
 - Well, I just thought you'd feel better with your head, tip back.

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:52.080
 Nah.

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:54.080
 Um...

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:56.080
 How was it out, Charlie?

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:57.580
 Still cold?

00:09:57.580 --> 00:09:59.080
 Ice on the puddles.

00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:01.380
 Early for this time of year.

00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:02.380
 Mm-hmm.

00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:05.180
 How's your family?

00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:06.880
 They're pretty well.

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:10.080
 My sister was just vaccinated on her arm.

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:12.480
 Say that reminds me.

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:13.780
 Still need a camera?

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:15.580
 Know where I could get one?

00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:16.580
 A cheap?

00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:19.280
 I think I could put my hands on one.

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:21.680
 What's that in your pocket?

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:22.980
 This?

00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:24.180
 Well, I'll be dog gone.

00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:25.480
 It's a camera.

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:26.380
 Let's see it.

00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:28.080
 Too bad I can't sell it to you.

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:28.980
 You can't?

00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:29.780
 No.

00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:32.780
 Not for less than $2.00 anyhow.

00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:33.780
 Did you hear me, Charlie?

00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:36.080
 I say not for less than $2.00.

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:37.080
 I heard you.

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:39.580
 Of course, if you don't want it, I have someone that is interested.

00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:40.780
 Yeah?

00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:42.780
 In just a second.

00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:46.380
 I thought I heard something out toward the dining room.

00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:48.080
 Like what?

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:48.580
 Nothing.

00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:49.980
 I guess I didn't.

00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:52.780
 You offered me two dollars Charlie?

00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:54.880
 I can hear you Henry.

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:57.680
 I said two dollars Charlie?

00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:59.380
 I haven't got that much.

00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:02.080
 Oh, well how much have you got?

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:03.580
 50 cents.

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:06.580
 50 cents, that's all?

00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:08.580
 Yeah, take back your camera.

00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:10.680
 -But Charlie? -I thought you wanted a camera.

00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:13.480
 I do. Well how are you gonna buy it with only 50 cents?

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:15.580
 That's what I'm telling you, I can't.

00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:18.780
 But Charlie, don't you have any sense of responsibility?

00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:21.780
 Would you let me swap you anything for it?

00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:23.780
 What have you got?

00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:29.780
 Well, would you be interested in a thing that's at home in our attic that cost $8.95 when it was new?

00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:34.780
 Hey, what is it? A very good beach umbrella.

00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:36.780
 What?

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:39.780
 Didn't you ever hear of a beach umbrella?

00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:41.780
 What would I do with it? Sit under it!

00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:44.780
 So you don't get sunburned.

00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:47.780
 Don't you know anyone that wouldn't like to get sunburned?

00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:50.380
 Well, I might be able to do something with it.

00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:53.380
 It's still as good as new. It's hardly ever been sat on that.

00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:56.380
 You'll swap it for this camera and $1.

00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:59.480
 Now, wait, Charlie. You aren't supposed to be selling me anything.

00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:01.180
 I'm selling you something.

00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:03.180
 That's why I invited you over.

00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:07.980
 Look, I'll give you the camera and 50 cents for the umbrella.

00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:08.980
 50 cents!

00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:10.180
 60 cents!

00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:10.980
 Who said that?

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:12.180
 I said it.

00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:13.780
 But, you whizzer, you hear Toby?

00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:16.980
 Sure. Our father's banana and the kitchen, is it all art?

00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:21.140

 cold without your windbreaker on. Well it's only to get a beach umbrella mother

00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:52.900
 that costs eight dollars and ninety five cents. I'll be back before you know it.

00:12:52.900 --> 00:13:10.180
 Hello Mrs. Foye. This is Mary Aldrich. I'm not interrupting your dinner am I? Oh fine.

00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:14.820
 Yes, we finished quite a while ago too.

00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:17.540
 In a way, that's why I'm calling.

00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:20.420
 By any chance of you seeing my brother tonight.

00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:23.020
 He did.

00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:24.020
 Jerry, are you calling?

00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:24.860
 Yes, another.

00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:27.420
 Well, if he comes by again,

00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:29.580
 will you tell him to come home?

00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:30.940
 Thank you.

00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:31.820
 Goodbye.

00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:35.380
 Henry was there, and Mrs. Boy, he's all confused

00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:37.180
 because he went into a long rigamar

00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:39.500
 all about the dangers of winter sun.

00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:40.500
 - Oh, really?

00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:43.060
 Well, this time, Henry will simply have to go

00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:44.540
 without his dinner.

00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:46.140
 - Hi, everybody.

00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:47.300
 - Evening, mother.

00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:48.720
 - I don't even want to bite to eat.

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:49.560
 - Good.

00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:50.540
 I wouldn't even think of troubling you.

00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:53.340
 - Fine, and my conscience won't bother me.

00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:54.740
 - Henry, where have you been?

00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:57.060
 - We've phoned all over.

00:13:57.060 --> 00:13:59.320
 - Well, I think the last place.

00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:01.100
 Yes, I just came from Mrs. Ross's.

00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:02.460
 - Did she buy the umbrella?

00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:03.280
 - No, Mary.

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:04.480
 She says she won't need to keep the son offer

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:05.680
 until next July.

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:07.660
 Mary.

00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:14.620
 Henry for the tenth time I don't want to be Tumbrella. Get washed up Henry. I'll heat up some supper for you.

00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:20.860
 Mother I thought you said he was. I'm weak Mary. Now listen Mary you may not want an umbrella

00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:26.540
 but there are some birthdays coming along in a few weeks. I don't want an umbrella either. Nor do I.

00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:33.980
 Oh good evening father. Hi Henry. Alice I finished that shelf for your preserve downstairs. You want to see it?

00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:47.820

 Excuse me, I'll see who's at the door.

00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:08.140
 Skiing is kind of dangerous, isn't it?

00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:09.780
 I wonder if I could persuade you to go to--

00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:10.600
 I think I should--

00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:13.140
 How much have you put into that umbrella so far?

00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:15.660
 Well, so far, only a dollar and 90 cents.

00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:17.380
 But it's all from others present.

00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:19.700
 You're out, a dollar, 90?

00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:22.860
 Well, I'm out at the moment, but I'm hoping to come back.

00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:24.700
 From the limb?

00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:27.220
 Father, I think you're just looking at this

00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:29.300
 as though I weren't getting anywhere.

00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:31.620
 night before last i had a flashlight

00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:33.300

00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:35.540

00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:37.620

 That's an interesting hobby.

00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:02.420
 Mr. Aldrich, my hobby is men, not mayonnaise.

00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:04.580
 I need them for something else, Henry.

00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:06.460
 Well, there's some in the basement.

00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:07.900
 OK, Agnes, follow me.

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:10.340
 Be careful on the static.

00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:12.420
 Agnes, what do you do with the jars?

00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:13.700
 Just something.

00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:16.060
 I've been working my head off getting them.

00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:17.060
 Mayonnaise jars?

00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:18.700
 Isn't that a bore?

00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:21.140
 I suppose any jar might do except in the speech

00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:24.540
 that Congressman Mayday said mayonnaise jars.

00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:26.020
 You mean they're worth something?

00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:27.660
 Can you keep quiet about it?

00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:28.560
 Sure.

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:32.980
 I mean, because if more people realize the possibilities,

00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:36.500
 everyone in Sederville might start saving Mayonnaise jars.

00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:37.060
 What speech?

00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:37.900
 What Congressman?

00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:40.740
 It was just a squib in the newspaper a week or so ago.

00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:41.180
 Yeah?

00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:43.940
 It had to do with conserving tin, see?

00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:46.500
 And this congressman is trying to put through a bill

00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:49.300
 in Congress where sea rations for the army

00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:53.020
 will be put up in things like Mayonnaise jars, for example.

00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:54.540
 Instead of tin cans.

00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:55.620
 Very interesting.

00:16:55.620 --> 00:17:01.420
 And he said the government could help reduce taxes by buying them at low cost from the public.

00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:03.100
 Oh boy.

00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:04.420
 Do you think the bill passed?

00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:07.700
 Father said it was just nutty enough too.

00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:09.700
 How much are they going to pay for the jars?

00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:12.620
 Well, up to now I've just been collecting.

00:17:12.620 --> 00:17:14.500
 I've got nearly 200.

00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:16.940
 Gee.

00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:21.220
 Agnes, would you be interested in looking at something I have for sale?

00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:22.020
 Why?

00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:25.020
 It's in the seller closet here.

00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:27.420
 How would you like to own that beach umbrella?

00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:29.980
 Henry, where'd you get it?

00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:30.860
 You like it?

00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:32.260
 Henry, yeah!

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:34.540
 It's the best orange and green one I've ever seen.

00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:36.820
 Honey, it's beautiful.

00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:38.820
 Hey, hey, you're so pretty!

00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:41.260
 Yes, mother, I'll be right there.

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:44.780
 Listen, Agnes, how would you like to strike sort of a deal?

00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:46.020
 What kind?

00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:48.780
 How many of your jars would you give me if I let you have,

00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:52.580
 without any cost you whatsoever, this umbrella?

00:17:52.580 --> 00:18:01.320

 Now getting back to the troubles of Henry Org.

00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:11.060
 Henry, in setting out to raise money

00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:13.300
 for his mother's birthday present,

00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:15.300
 has gone through a series of intricate

00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:20.980
 business transactions only to end up with some mayonnaise jars and so far not a

00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:26.900
 cent of profit the scene opens in the Aldrich Hallway

00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:33.020
 hello it's Alice dear are you busy with anyone at the office no dear I just had

00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:37.140
 to call you Sam I was in Mrs Browning's gift shop this morning and I saw the

00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:39.420
 the loveliest China tea set.

00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:40.860
 - Oh.

00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:45.300
 - You can take that how much is it sound out of your voice, dear.

00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:48.540
 Mrs. Browning told me Henry had asked her to hold it for him

00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:50.760
 and Sam, it's $20.

00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:52.540
 And he told her the price didn't matter.

00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:54.700
 He was in a very successful business.

00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:56.980
 - Henry did seem pretty happy about something.

00:19:56.980 --> 00:19:58.140
 - You saw him today?

00:19:58.140 --> 00:19:59.580
 - You dropped by the office.

00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:02.660
 Wanted to borrow some of my business stationery.

00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:03.740
 Alice-- - Yes?

00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:07.060
 - Have you any idea why he'd be writing to Congress?

00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:09.060
 Good heavens, no.

00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:10.360
 Well, I thought maybe you might.

00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:12.560
 It seems to have something to do with your birthday.

00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:15.560
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:30.460

00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:34.460
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:35.260
 Alice.

00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:36.060
 Yes, Sam.

00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:37.980
 - What's this under the sofa?

00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:40.140
 - Mayonnaise jars.

00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:43.140
 - He's keeping, what's wrong with the cellar?

00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:46.180
 - I don't think there's any more room in the cellar.

00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:48.820
 - Mother, where's my laundry bag?

00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:50.620
 - Henry took it out with him.

00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:51.460
 - What's more?

00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:52.940
 - I got more jars, Mary.

00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:54.980
 - Well, my goodness, Henry, I certainly think

00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:56.780
 you're overdoing this.

00:20:56.780 --> 00:20:58.940
 - Must you put those bottles down right here

00:20:58.940 --> 00:20:59.780
 in the living room?

00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:01.300
 - It's only for a second, Father.

00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:04.540
 Mother, if you could have anything for your birthday

00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:10.060
 wanted what would you like if I could have anything not just a book you mean

00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:16.140
 yes it's just sort of a hyper theoretical question well to be honest it might be

00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:21.180
 a tea set I saw at Browning's gift shop with lavender flowers on the cups is

00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:25.540
 that right lavender flowers but I'm afraid it costs far more than I could

00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:31.100
 ever pay for it is that right what Mary you've got to take those mayonnaise

00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:32.820
 He drives off the front porch.

00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:35.180
 Father find a place to put them, Mary.

00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:39.060
 Mother, are you actually encouraging Henry?

00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:41.620
 Father, I want to make a proposition.

00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:44.020
 I do not want to buy any of those jars.

00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:46.220
 Oh, it isn't that, Father.

00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:48.100
 How would you like to invest?

00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:50.220
 Just invest in my business.

00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:55.020
 What are you doing, Henry, forming a mayonnaise monopoly?

00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:56.020
 Geez.

00:21:56.020 --> 00:21:59.700
 She may be I am becoming a sort of empty jar king.

00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:02.040
 Right now though I need some working capital.

00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:06.620
 Do you mean to say you've actually spent all you have on nothing but jars?

00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:08.540
 Well she was, why shouldn't I?

00:22:08.540 --> 00:22:11.100
 I'm going to get a swell present for a mother and I'll have a fortune to spend

00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:13.540
 when Christmas rolls around.

00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:16.860
 Father, do you still wish you could afford to build a wing on the garage for a swell

00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:18.460
 machine shop?

00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:21.140
 How much have you spent altogether son?

00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:23.940
 Just a little over seven dollars.

00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:28.020
 And enter there comes a time in every business when the investment must begin

00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:34.140
 to show a profit, otherwise a nasty little thing called bankruptcy rears its ugly head.

00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:38.060
 Oh, don't you worry. Just as soon as the government sends for the jars...

00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:39.060
 Government?

00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:40.420
 Just wait, Father.

00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:45.060
 Henry, do you know what happened to that large jar of mayonnaise I bought yesterday?

00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:48.340
 Yes, Mother. It's on a plate in the icebox.

00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:50.340
 - Henry, all great.

00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:53.340
 (siren wailing)

00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:58.340
 (siren wailing)

00:22:58.340 --> 00:23:01.340
 (whistling)

00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:03.340
 - Oh boy, the mailman.

00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:05.340
 - Henry, breakfast.

00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:07.340
 - Just getting the mail, mother.

00:23:07.340 --> 00:23:09.340
 Oh boy, it's here.

00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:13.340
 - Anything for me, Henry?

00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:15.340
 - Yes, sir, but I think it's for me, actually.

00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:17.340
 You see, I wrote it on your station area.

00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:22.300
 have it please yes sir but if you could read it aloud mmm i mean it'll concern

00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:27.900
 me and in a way sort of concerned mother mmm i don't understand there what is

00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:34.300
 it fam eat your cereal henry dear constituent this man isn't from our state

00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:39.740
 please go on father it takes a man of your large vision to see the wordiness of

00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:44.780
 the bill i presented to congress in the interest of conserving tin by using

00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:51.180
 glass jars for military ration. Oh boy. Unfortunately my bill has been killed in

00:23:51.180 --> 00:23:57.500
 committee. What? Moreover since my own party has not seen fit to renominate me

00:23:57.500 --> 00:24:01.660
 for the fourth. Oh boy.

00:24:01.660 --> 00:24:13.820
 Well Sam isn't it nice to come home and not find a house full of mayonnaise

00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:19.820
 -Where'd they all go? -I don't know. I simply came up the front walk this afternoon as a truck was

00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:25.820
 leaving loaded with them. -Mother, is there going to phone call for me this afternoon? -Not that I know of.

00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:33.820
 -Get a good bargain for your jars, Henry. -Boy, did I, did I? -Well, sure. I met a boy that lives out on a farm, see.

00:24:33.820 --> 00:24:37.820
 And I just happened to mention casually that I'd been saving mayonnaise jars for the government.

00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:41.820
 And right away he wanted to buy them. I hoped you told him the government couldn't use them.

00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:47.260
 use them. Mother, there wasn't any reason I should tell them was there. Dear, I think you should have.

00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:52.820
 Well, you didn't even ask me, Mother. And in business, if someone doesn't ask you something, you don't tell them.

00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:59.620
 How much did you make? Well, that part would be hard to say. I've got to do a little figuring first.

00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:04.820
 Didn't you sell for cash? Cash, Father? When I could get a better proposition?

00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:11.620
 What did you trade the jars for? Just a little something. And there's always a good market for it.

00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:15.620
 I hope you didn't have to pay anything in addition to the jars.

00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:16.620
 Just two dollars.

00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:18.620
 You've put two more dollars.

00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:20.620
 Everybody you want it on the phone.

00:25:20.620 --> 00:25:22.620
 I am? It's from me, Mary. Gee whiz.

00:25:22.620 --> 00:25:24.620
 I'll be right back, Father.

00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:26.620
 I'll be out if you can rise.

00:25:26.620 --> 00:25:31.620
 Hello? Is this the Senate Bill Meat Market?

00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:34.620
 Well, look. How much would you pay for a pig?

00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:37.620
 A pig.

00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:39.620
 How much a pound?

00:25:39.620 --> 00:25:41.620
 Is that all?

00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:44.620
 Well, gee whiz, my mother was complaining about the price of pork chops.

00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:46.620
 I don't see why she should have a whole pig o-

00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:49.620
 Oh, whole sale.

00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:53.620
 Well, well, I wish you'd come out and look at her.

00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:56.620
 Only remember, I'm in business to make money.

00:25:56.620 --> 00:25:57.620
 Yes, sir.

00:25:57.620 --> 00:25:58.620
 Goodbye.

00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:00.620
 Who were you talking to, Henry?

00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:04.620
 Mother, how did you say you were paying for pork chops?

00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:06.620
 Wait a minute, pork chops.

00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:08.620
 As an average, for the best?

00:26:08.620 --> 00:26:09.620
 for the best.

00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:12.380
 Alice, what do you think I just found out in the garage?

00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:13.380
 Why?

00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:14.380
 Ha ha!

00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:16.940
 Did you say a hog, Sam?

00:26:16.940 --> 00:26:18.860
 Yes, Alice, in the garage.

00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:21.380
 Father, let me explain.

00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:22.900
 You know where it came from?

00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:23.900
 Yes, sir.

00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:24.900
 All right.

00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:27.020
 I'll give you just five minutes to get it out.

00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:28.180
 It's my investment.

00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:34.540
 Alice, dear, would you mind if Henry and I had a serious talk together?

00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:35.540
 No, dear.

00:26:35.540 --> 00:26:36.540
 I'm afraid it's time.

00:26:36.540 --> 00:26:37.540
 Sit down, Henry.

00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:38.540
 Henry.

00:26:38.540 --> 00:26:39.740
 Well, I mean, I suggest something.

00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:40.540
 Sit.

00:26:40.540 --> 00:26:41.840
 Yes, sir.

00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:43.040
 This farm boy.

00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:43.840
 What's his name?

00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:44.840
 Billy Weber.

00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:45.540
 Oh, yes.

00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:45.840
 Weber.

00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:47.640
 I know his father.

00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:50.840
 He had a bad time of it because of the dry spell last summer.

00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:51.940
 I know.

00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:54.640
 Billy did say the pig was a little too thin to market.

00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:56.740
 Only I was hoping by the time Mother's birthday came around.

00:26:56.740 --> 00:26:58.240
 Henry.

00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:01.840
 Henry, I think you should give Billy back his pig.

00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:05.440
 Well, if he was dumb enough to buy those jars,

00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:08.560
 If I sell the pig, I lose only $4 now.

00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:11.400
 If I give her back to Billy, I lose everything.

00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:13.200
 Besides, I don't want those jars back.

00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:14.040
 - I don't need it.

00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:15.680
 - I've sunk every cent I have into this.

00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:17.560
 - I'm interested, Henry.

00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:19.760
 What are you going to do?

00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:21.920
 - I won't be able to give mother even a book.

00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:24.520
 I'll have to cancel the tea set.

00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:28.160
 I'll give him back the pig, Father.

00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:29.000
 - I'm glad.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:29.840
 (door slams)

00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:30.960
 - Anybody home?

00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:32.200
 - In here, Homer.

00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:34.400
 - Hey, you got any more mayonnaise jars to sell?

00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:35.240
 - Why?

00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:37.480
 You know that Billy, wherever you sold them to?

00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:38.560
 Hello, Mr. Albridge.

00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:39.400
 - Hello, Homer.

00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:40.840
 - Yeah, Homer, what happened?

00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:42.880
 He sold them, he sold them all.

00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:45.000
 3,000 of them at a half a cent each.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:45.840
 - To who?

00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:48.120
 - The state agricultural laboratories.

00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:49.640
 They grow cultures in them.

00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:50.760
 - Half a cent?

00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:52.880
 He made 15 bucks on the jars.

00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:54.400
 Plus what you paid them.

00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:55.480
 - Oh boy.

00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:57.760
 You know what?

00:27:57.760 --> 00:27:59.360
 I'm gonna make Billy take the pig back

00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:00.880
 and give me what he got to the jars.

00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:01.720
 - You are?

00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:02.880
 - Just because his family needs the money

00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:03.720
 shouldn't be any reason

00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:05.120
 why I should let him get away with it.

00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:09.500
 Naturally, especially since in the profession you are entering business is business.

00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:10.500
 Sure.

00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:13.160
 Supposing I've been poor and he's taken advantage of me.

00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:15.220
 How would I have...

00:28:15.220 --> 00:28:16.740
 I mean...

00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:19.140
 How would you have felt?

00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:20.260
 Well, it would have been...

00:28:20.260 --> 00:28:22.000
 The dirty trick.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:22.700
 Sort of.

00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:26.460
 And Henry, did I tell you about Agnes selling your beach umbrella?

00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:27.200
 To who?

00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:28.300
 To a junk man.

00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:29.940
 She got two dollars for it.

00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:33.440
 He's gonna put it on his wagon.

00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:37.440
 You think it's actually possible that I'm not cut out for business?

00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:39.440
 Henry, Henry, what do you think?

00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:40.440
 They're what?

00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:43.440
 Mr. Davis from the meat market just went out to look at your pig.

00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:44.440
 She did?

00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:46.440
 Henry, she's a mother! She's a mother!

00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:47.440
 She's a waltz!

00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:49.440
 I've got any little pigs.

00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:53.440
 If you want them off your hand, he'll give you $20 for the whole business.

00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:56.440
 $20? $20?

00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:59.440
 I'll break exactly even.

00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:02.440
 Father, didn't I tell you my investment would come out all right?

00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:09.440
 come out all right.

00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:21.000
 In this national election year, one obligation of citizenship heads all the rest.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:25.800
 The obligation of every qualified voter to go to the polls and vote.

00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:30.360
 The ballot you will receive this year is a symbol of your personal dignity.

00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:33.960
 There is no man whose ballot is more important than yours.

00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:36.680
 No man whose ballot will count for more.

00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:41.200
 On election day you will have as much power as much responsibility in the shaping of your

00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:46.400
 country and your way of life as the most influential person.

00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:49.240
 Don't ignore this priceless possession.

00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:53.920
 Vote as you please, but register and vote.

00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:54.680
 See you at the polls.

00:29:54.680 --> 00:30:08.060
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:30:08.060 --> 00:30:10.620
 Henry, I thought you were going to sell your pigs.

00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:11.420
 I did, Father.

00:30:11.420 --> 00:30:12.500
 I sold them all.

00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:15.220
 And what are those bags of feed doing out in the garage?

00:30:15.220 --> 00:30:15.860
 She was, Father.

00:30:15.860 --> 00:30:17.500
 That isn't feeding those bags.

00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:17.860
 No.

00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:18.760
 What is it?

00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:20.060
 Isn't it clear?

00:30:20.060 --> 00:30:22.060
 Mother's birth is only three weeks off.

00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:24.220
 I've gone back to collecting mayonnaise jars.

00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:26.220
 Now wait a minute.

00:30:26.220 --> 00:30:41.620
 The Aldrich family is transcribed as written by Clifford Goldsmith.

00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:45.220
 Henry is played by Bobby Ellis and Homer by Johnny Fiedler.

00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:48.420
 Mr. and Mrs. Aldrich are house Jameson and Catherine Rot.

00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:50.420
 Your announcer is Dick Dudley.

00:30:54.860 --> 00:31:01.220
 Good to the gun next week, same time, same station, for another sparkling half hour with the Aldrich family.

00:31:01.220 --> 00:31:02.420
 Good night, everybody.

00:31:02.420 --> 00:31:09.860
