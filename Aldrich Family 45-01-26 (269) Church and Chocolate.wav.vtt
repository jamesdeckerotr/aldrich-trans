00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.000
 [Music]

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.500
 Henry! Henry Oldrich!

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.000
 Coming, Mother!

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.500
 The Oldrich family, a special rebroadcast for you soldiers, sailors, and Marines of the United Nations.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:42.500
 [Music]

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:48.500
 And now for the Aldrich family with Dick Jones as Henry and Jackie Kalk as Homer.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:54.500
 No one can ever predict what a teenage boy like Henry Aldrich will do next.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:01.500
 The best you can do if you're a grown-up is to say that he'll do the sort of things you did when you were young.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.500
 The scene opens in the Aldrich living room. The time is Sunday morning.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.500
 Mary! Mary, I want you to run upstairs right this minute.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.500
 Yes, mother. My goodness, what for?

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.500
 And get me a clean handkerchief.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.500
 And Henry?

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.500
 Yes, mother. I'm already to start.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.500
 No, you're not there. You haven't even combed your hair.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.500
 Mother, I have combed my hair. I give you my word. I've combed my hair.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:29.500
 Dear, you've combed it only in front. Remember the kilmas are going to be sitting in the pure right behind us, and you know how the kilmas talk.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.500
 About my hair?

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.500
 Well, look, Mother. I've got a rubber band right here in my hand.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.500
 How about my wearing that on my head until we get about a block from the church and then taking it all?

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.300
 Now dear, if you can't be honest about combing your hair, especially when it's for church,

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.300
 then I'd rather you didn't go with me.

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.060
 Yes, mother, I'll go up and comb it.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.460
 Here, mother, here's your handkerchief.

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.060
 That's what you want me to get, isn't it?

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.940
 Thank you, dear. Thank you very much.

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:54.100
 And did you bring my gloves?

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.700
 Mother, you didn't tell me to.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.900
 Well, I certainly took it for granted you knew I'd wear them.

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.180
 And Mary, look at your shoes.

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.100
 Here you are, I'm going to wear those, are you?

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.100
 Why not?

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.100
 To church?

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.100
 Shoes like that?

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.100
 I wore them last time we went.

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.220
 Well, I certainly didn't know it.

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.560
 if I had I wouldn't have been comfortable one minute of the entire service.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.220
 Now please go upstairs and put on a sensible pair of shoes with toes in my mouth.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.220
 Yes mother.

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.920
 And bring down my gloves and on top of my bureau.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:21.520
 I think.

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:22.820
 They're on your bureau?

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:23.820
 Yes dear.

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.520
 Oh you might look and see if I left them on the foot of my bed as I went by.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.420
 Mother.

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.520
 Yes Henry is that you calling me?

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.720
 Is it all right if I borrow Mary's co-hosts?

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.420
 Henry, all this don't you dare use my co-hosts.

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.420
 Mary is that any attitude to take just before church?

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:39.140
 Alice!

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:40.060
 Yes, Sam!

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.020
 Why isn't everyone ready to go?

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.780
 We are ready, Sam. We're really just waiting for you.

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:45.780
 You're waiting for me?

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:46.760
 Well, I'm all ready.

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:47.820
 Come on, let's not be late.

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:48.860
 Now, Sam.

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:49.620
 What's the matter?

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.660
 You aren't going to wear that tie, are you?

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.920
 This tie? What's the matter with this tie?

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.540
 Now, dear, you know very well you're to take up the collection this morning.

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.900
 I certainly don't want you walking down the aisle with everyone looking at nothing but your necktie and Mary's toes.

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.100
 Mother, what was it you said I should look for on the foot of somebody's bed?

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.180
 And my necktie!

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.340
 I mean your father's shoe.

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.940
 My gloves, dear, and please hurry up.

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.640
 That is why I worry about your gloves.

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.140
 Come on, let's get started.

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.500
 Sam, I could no more walk into that church and bare hands

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.040
 than I could--

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.640
 do you think I want to enjoy the service?

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.740
 Now, please go change your neck size.

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:26.440
 Oh, well.

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:27.840
 I know like my hair, mother.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.140
 Hey, it looks fine.

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.040
 Now, dear, why can't you comb your hair that way every day

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.040
 and not just--

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.240
 dear, didn't I ask you to shine your shoes?

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.040
 Sure, mother, and I did.

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.920
 Look at the shoe polish on this one finger that wouldn't come off.

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.420
 Well, you may have some on your finger, but you don't have any on your shoes.

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:47.380
 And Henry, don't try to shine them on the back of your trouser leg.

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:48.920
 But it's a dark, loose suit, Mother.

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.620
 And a brand-new suit.

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.800
 I want you to march right out to the kitchen and finish shining them

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.200
 while your father is putting on a respectable tie.

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:56.700
 Yes, Mother.

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.000
 Only don't do anything in that good coat.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.900
 Hang it on the back of his chair before you go out there.

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.800
 Sure, that's a very good idea, Mother.

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.760
 - And Mary... - I'm coming, Mother.

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:06.640
 Here's your Bible.

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:07.900
 Who do you think I found it?

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.300
 Thank you, dear. Only where are my white gloves?

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.800
 I can't find them, mother. Do you have to have them?

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:18.000
 Now, Mary, I certainly hope you don't think I want to sit through the whole service with my hands on my mind.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.800
 Alice!

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:19.800
 Are you, Sam?

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.100
 Have you seen my gray stripe tie?

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:23.500
 Your gray stripe one?

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.500
 Or if you can't find it, dear, why don't you wear your black one?

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.600
 My black one? A black tie to take off a collection, Ed?

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.000
 Did you look on your neck tie, red collar?

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.800
 I did. No, I could find there was a pair of ladies' gloves.

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.720
 - You're glad, on your tie rack?

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.300
 Oh yes, then you'll find your great tie

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.280
 on the towel rack in the bathroom.

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.480
 - What you doing there?

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.000
 - It's hard to explain, Sam.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.680
 Only please hurry, or we'll be late when we walk in

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.200
 and everyone will look at us that much more.

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:54.680
 - Hello everybody.

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.000
 (audience laughing)

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.200
 - Toma Brown, what are you doing over here?

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.720
 - My mother made me brush my suit three times

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.400
 and I got sick of it.

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.920
 - Do you mind if I sit with you in church?

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:06.680
 Oh, we'd love to have you.

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:10.600
 Only, wouldn't your mother and father like to have you sit with them?

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.260
 My father isn't going.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.480
 It's his only chance to work on his income tax.

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:18.080
 And doesn't that mean your mother has to sit alone?

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.260
 No, that's what I'm explaining to you.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:24.280
 She's sitting with my aunt and uncle and three cousins and my grandmother.

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:29.640
 And when you get that many in our pool along with all our coats and hymn books, my feet go to sleep.

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:31.880
 Oh, is that you, Officer?

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:35.720
 You're all Henry Henry have you finished polishing your shoes?

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:40.720
 Well I was just going to tell you my all I can find is the brown poly

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:45.720
 Oh dear sometimes I get so discouraged Mary go out and help your brother find the black

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:49.600
 Polish yes mother apparently Henry has learned anything unless 12 people have a

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:50.200
 doing

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:53.200
 Now what Sam you have any change

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:56.720
 Handy that I can get Henry and Mary no dear don't you have any

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:00.000
 all I have is some dollar bills you mean to say they'll have to

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
 That is now Sam

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.280
 My goodness with my pocketbook. I don't get excited. It's right there on the piano here. It is mr.

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:12.800
 So old which here I'll get it for you Homer. What are you doing here? We're all going to church together, mr.

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.520
 Oldrich. Oh

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:18.640
 Well, Sam is some change put some up it in Henry's coat pocket

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:25.240
 Where are Henry and Mary? I do they keep us waiting like this Henry's helping Mary find a shoe polish mr.

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:27.240
 No, wait a minute.

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:28.240
 What's the matter, Sam?

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:31.240
 What on earth is this garb of stuff in Henry's coat pocket?

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:34.240
 Sam! Sam, oldridge, look at your hand!

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:36.240
 Can you make out what it is, Alice?

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.240
 Is that a chocolate drop or something?

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:41.240
 Chocolate, Mr. Oldridge? Did you say chocolate?

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:42.240
 Oh, I just keep away.

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:44.240
 Sam, you have to get it out somehow.

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:49.240
 Get it out, Alice. You realize the whole bottom of the pocket is nothing but soft chocolate.

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:51.240
 That doesn't make any difference, Sam.

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:55.260
 And if you think I can sit in that church with everyone in town that I know staring at my

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:59.620
 son and knowing that I let him come with chocolate all over the inside of him.

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:01.780
 Alice, I've got out what I could.

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:03.280
 Well, what did you do with it?

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:04.780
 I put it in the ashtray.

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:06.580
 At least I thought I did.

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:08.580
 That's all right, Mr. O'Hood.

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:09.580
 I got it.

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:10.580
 It's very good.

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:13.980
 You must have had a cherry filling.

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:16.180
 Homer, are you eating that?

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:17.680
 Oh, excuse me.

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:19.680
 Did you want some?

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:20.680
 I did not.

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:26.440
 you eating more. Oh dear. Sam look at me. Look at my glove. Have you got some more

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:31.040
 Mrs. Allrich? Alice I told you to keep your hands out of there. And I just finished

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:35.480
 washing these gloves. Now let's just let things drop where they are. Come on and

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:39.400
 let's get started for church. Sam I am not going to start looking as though I'd

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:44.080
 been making fudge with my gloves on. Oh my dear go up to the bathroom please and

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:47.280
 get the bottle of cleaning fluid that's on the top shelf of the medicine closet.

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:49.840
 Yes Mrs. Aldrich, it's a very good idea.

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:52.640
 Boy, look at my suit.

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:54.280
 How did that get on there?

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:56.520
 Don't waste time looking at your suit, Ron!

00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:58.200
 Father! Oh, what Mary?

00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:00.320
 Have you seen the shoe polish anyplace?

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:01.520
 The shoe polish?

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:04.480
 Alice, do you suppose that's what's in Henry's pocket here?

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:05.320
 I'm not fast.

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:06.600
 Is it Mr. Old?

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:11.160
 - It is not. - Shoe polish I've been eating.

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:14.400
 Because if it is, I want to know before I do anything else.

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:17.040
 No, Homer, please get the cleaning fluid.

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:18.880
 Mother, yes, Henry.

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:22.040
 Did I get your homework say he found the shoe polish?

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:22.960
 No, Henry.

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:24.760
 He thought he'd eaten it.

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:26.920
 The blocks you polished?

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:28.880
 Why'd he do that?

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:31.200
 Henry, will you please tell me what this is in your blue coat

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:32.040
 pocket?

00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:34.840
 Well, if it's a letter, Father, I'll tell you.

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:36.320
 I met her last summer, see?

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:37.880
 And why out of a clear sky I got--

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:39.960
 It is not a letter.

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:40.880
 It isn't?

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:43.680
 It's part chocolate and part Mariskino cherry.

00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:44.520
 For me?

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:46.320
 You mean she sent me a box of chocolate?

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:50.080
 Henry, dear, can't you see your pocket? Can't you see my glove?

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:51.920
 Oh, she wins.

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:54.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
 Oh, that.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:02.560
 Well, I tell you, Father, do you remember that box of chocolate covered cherries you brought home last week?

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:03.440
 I do.

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:07.640
 Well, I like chocolate, and I didn't know this had cherries in it, see?

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:08.360
 Go on.

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:12.680
 Well, last Wednesday afternoon, I happened to walk in there,

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:18.840
 And Mr. Carson, the minister, was here and the mother was passing him chocolates and she passed me one and I bit into it.

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:19.840
 Go on.

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:24.840
 Well, naturally with the minister here, I didn't want...

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:28.840
 Well, there wasn't any place left to print, so I put it in my pocket.

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:31.840
 Now, Henry, what's in that pocket? Isn't just one chocolate?

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:33.840
 No, that's what I was going to tell you.

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:37.840
 I tried one of them and I thought I'd try a couple more and see if I could hit one without cherries.

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:40.840
 And you apparently didn't hit one.

00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:42.840
 So I finally gave up.

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:44.840
 And that was the last I ever thought of it.

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:47.840
 Mrs. Aldrich, here it is. Here's your cleaning fluid.

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:48.840
 Thank you, Homer. Thank you very much.

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:50.840
 Who are you going to start on first?

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:53.840
 Henry or me or Mr. Aldrich?

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:54.840
 What do you mean on me?

00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:57.840
 Isn't that chocolate in your hair, Mr. Aldrich?

00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:59.840
 In my hair.

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:02.840
 Ben, look in the mirror. How did you get chocolate way up there?

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:04.840
 Father, don't you like chocolate covered cherries either?

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:06.840
 That's a fine thing.

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:09.840
 If you're looking for chocolate these days, you can never find any, but...

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:12.080
 Ah, look at my shirt.

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:14.080
 No, Sam, it's in your hair.

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:18.480
 It's also on my shirt, and this is the last clean shirt I have until the laundry comes tomorrow.

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:21.400
 Well, hold still until I get through cleaning out Henry's pocket,

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:23.480
 and then I'll see what I can do with you.

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:27.120
 And Henry, the next time you put something in your mouth that you don't happen to like,

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:31.920
 especially if the minister is here, I hope you'll be honorable enough to swallow it.

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:34.400
 You mean it was sort of deceitful of me to put it in my pocket?

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:36.600
 No, there are more than looking at what you're doing.

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:39.600
 You poured that whole can of cleaning fluid into Henry's pocket.

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:42.480
 Yes, here only don't stand there and tell me about it.

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:44.840
 Go get a towel or something so we can soak it up.

00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:46.240
 How long are you doing anything?

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:47.400
 You're just sitting around here.

00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:48.240
 Go get a towel.

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:49.600
 I'll keep pal married.

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:51.160
 Henry, go over and open that window.

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:51.840
 Yes, Father.

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:52.680
 No, Henry.

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:53.520
 Stand still.

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:54.440
 You're leaking.

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:56.880
 Yes, Mother.

00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:58.600
 Alice, let me tell you one thing.

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:00.040
 If you think I'm going to church,

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:02.040
 covered with chocolate like this, you're crazy.

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:03.440
 Now, Sam, you've got to go.

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:04.320
 I can't go.

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:05.160
 Why can't you?

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:07.080
 Smelling of cleaning fluid.

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:09.400
 Do you think I could sit through that entire service

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:13.400
 with a killman and back of me sniffing all right all right you can stay home to

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:17.040
 I'll go to the phone and tell mr. Carson that I can't help with the collection

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:21.320
 Mary can go and represent the whole family I can't represent it I can't

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:25.760
 possibly represent it why not I've got chocolate on my glove now Mary how on

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:29.240
 earth did you get chocolate on you that's what I can't understand I haven't even

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:33.640
 been near Henry well it's a funny thing but I haven't got a darn bit on me what

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:37.480
 do you mean you haven't got any on you go to that phone and call mr. cost what

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:40.480
 - Don't tell him the truth. He'll think we're making it up.

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:41.480
 - What shall I tell him?

00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:44.480
 - You can think of something. Tell him...

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:46.480
 make something up that sounds believable.

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:47.480
 - Mrs. Aldrich.

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:49.480
 - Don't you have that towel, yes?

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:54.480
 - That's why I came down to ask you. Do you want a face towel or a bath towel?

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:57.480
 Or one of those nice little guest towels with cherries on it?

00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:13.480
 [ Music ]

00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:20.480
 And I would also like to remind the congregation that due to the fact that next Friday is a holiday,

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:27.480
 the meeting of the ladies' Thursday evening reading club which generally takes place on Friday afternoon

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:31.480
 will take place instead on Wednesday at 3 o'clock.

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:38.480
 Remember the ladies' Thursday evening club next Wednesday instead of Friday.

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:47.480
 Also, I am sure the members of the congregation will be pleased to hear that Mrs. Taff is doing much better

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:52.480
 and before long she'll be back taking part in the activities of our church.

00:12:52.480 --> 00:13:01.720
 On the darker side of the picture, however, as I was leaving my study only a few minutes

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:08.880
 ago, the poem rang, and to make a long story short, the son of Mr. and Mrs. Samuel Oldrich,

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:15.920
 Henry, as to just what happened to him, no one seems to know, but at any rate Henry is

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:22.040
 being confined to his home. And while the immediate members of the family were most anxious to

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:27.800
 join us here in this service, they felt that their place at this time was beside their

00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:34.800
 song. Now, before I get up with an extra announcement, I would like to say that some of these beautiful

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:40.320
 flowers that grace our church this morning will be set to Henry immediately following

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:43.320
 Mr.

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:56.320
 Mother Earth, have you seen my overcoat anyplace?

00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:59.320
 Henry, what is it you want your overcoat for?

00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:00.320
 From going out.

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:03.320
 Have you forgotten? I'm invited over to Catlings for Sunday dinner.

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:06.320
 Then you are not going out of this house until church is over.

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:07.320
 And Sam?

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:09.920
 Alice, I'm just going out to get some fresh air.

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:12.320
 All I've been breathing this morning is cleaning fluid.

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:15.620
 And do you realize church doesn't get out until 12 o'clock?

00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:17.720
 All right. It's three minutes to 12.

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:19.020
 Look at my watch right here.

00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:21.720
 Well, you're going to stay here until at least five after.

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:24.320
 Suppose you met the kilmas on your way down the street.

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:25.820
 You'd never live it down.

00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:26.820
 Alice, where are you going?

00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:29.320
 Out of the kitchen, make sure your watch is right.

00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:44.040
 [Music]

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:45.720
 Oh, hello Mr. Carson.

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:50.360
 Hello. I'm sorry I was delayed. I did in my study getting out of my robe.

00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:53.640
 That was an excellent sermon this morning, Mr. Carson.

00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:54.280
 Excellent.

00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:55.800
 Hey, Drew. Thank you.

00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:59.240
 I've just been looking over the contributions here for this morning.

00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:01.720
 They seem to be unusually generous.

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:04.320
 And by the way, Mr. Kastner, if it'll help any,

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:07.400
 I'd be very glad to take those flowers over to the orgages.

00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:08.560
 Thank you, just the same.

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:10.400
 But one of the new members of the church,

00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:12.960
 who seems to want to take part in our activities,

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:14.880
 has already offered to take care of that.

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:18.720
 Well, that will be a very nice experience for a new member

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:20.240
 to meet the orgages.

00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:23.200
 Yes. Poor Mary Orgridge.

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:26.120
 Did you see her alone in her pew this morning?

00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:27.320
 Oh, really?

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:28.480
 Did Mary get here?

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:32.980
 She most certainly did, and there she sat just as though nothing had happened.

00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:36.080
 Yes? Well, well, where's my handkerchief?

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:38.680
 Mm-hmm. You got something on your hand?

00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:42.480
 I just picked up a numble up with the little chocolate or something on it.

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:45.580
 Yes? Mm. That's good.

00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:48.580
 I guess some little child is allowed to put that on the plate.

00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:52.380
 Well, as long as the spirit was there, that's all that's important.

00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:55.780
 Why is the way, did Mrs. Brown find her son Homer?

00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:57.580
 Homer? Has he been lost?

00:15:57.580 --> 00:16:03.700
 All I know is Mrs. Brown was waiting at the front door for quite a long time after the service and he didn't come out.

00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:06.620
 She shook hands with me three times.

00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:08.060
 Well, well...

00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:09.660
 Something the matter, Mr. Carson?

00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:13.180
 No, no, I just put my hand in my pocket and...

00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:15.620
 How do you suppose that got in there?

00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:16.700
 What is it?

00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:17.980
 Oh, I remember.

00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:22.660
 I was visiting the old riches this last week and Mrs. Oldrich passed some chocolate.

00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:27.380
 And I liked chocolate covered cherries, but frankly, I'd had quite a hearty lunch.

00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:29.980
 Well, I didn't want to put the chocolate back in the box.

00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:32.780
 You know, so I sneaked it into my pocket.

00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:37.580
 - Did it do much damage? - No, no, I think a little cleaning fluid will take it out, alright?

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:41.180
 I guess I better take care of it before I go over and call on Henry,

00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:44.380
 so I won't feel guilty when I walk into the Aldrich's house.

00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:57.760

00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:00.720

00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:32.800
 Now getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldrich.

00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:37.800
 Due to the fact that the entire family became covered with chocolate this morning,

00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:40.800
 just as they were about to leave the house for church,

00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:42.800
 only Mary attended.

00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:47.200
 Mr. Aldrich, in his attempt to explain the situation to the minister,

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:51.800
 gave the impression that a serious accident had befallen Henry.

00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:57.300
 The scene opens shortly afternoon of the same day on one of Santa Bill's streets.

00:20:57.300 --> 00:21:03.800
 Listen, Homer, do you mind walking a little faster, please?

00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:06.800
 I'm walking fast, Henry. What do you want me to do, Lunt?

00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:10.300
 Don't you realize I'm due over Kathleen's for dinner right now?

00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:15.180
 And all you want do is stop and look at things but Henry why not turn this corner here?

00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:21.920
 Why do we have to go by the church? Why shouldn't we go by the church? We can cut right across the lawns save almost half a block

00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:26.240
 Yeah, but remember Henry. We didn't go this morning and a foul over

00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:32.380
 She wished you want to bump right into that man. That's got his arm full of plan. Oh, excuse me. That's all right young man

00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:38.020
 I wonder whether you boys could give me a hand for just a minute. Oh sure is there something I'd like to have us do

00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:42.020
 There are some more flowers here on the steps of the church that I've got to put in my car.

00:21:42.020 --> 00:21:45.020
 I have to take them to several places and I'm a little behind schedule.

00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:48.020
 Sure, we'd be glad to help you put them in the car.

00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:50.020
 The only thing is, how about Kathleen?

00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:53.020
 He wishes Henry if it's for the church, don't you think we ought to help?

00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:56.020
 Well, are these the plants right here?

00:21:56.020 --> 00:21:59.020
 Yes, put them on the floor in the back of the car. I'm going into the church and get some more.

00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:01.020
 Are they for sick people, Mr.?

00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:06.020
 Yeah, some of them are for Mrs. Cap and some of her young man over on Elm Street, who's had an accident.

00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:07.020
 What?

00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:08.020
 On Elm Street?

00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:11.260
 Homer, who do you suppose that could be?

00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:12.820
 Probably little killer kid.

00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:15.700
 He's always falling down or something.

00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:16.700
 That's true.

00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:19.660
 And boy, my mother will probably make me go over and visit him.

00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:20.660
 Henry!

00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:21.660
 Henry, I'll get it!

00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:22.660
 Don't bother me, Mary.

00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:23.660
 Can't you see how I'm busy?

00:22:23.660 --> 00:22:24.660
 But you shouldn't be carrying those.

00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:28.060
 You want to be home receiving them.

00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:29.060
 Receiving them?

00:22:29.060 --> 00:22:30.940
 What do you mean by a statement like that?

00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:34.660
 I don't know what it was, Father told Mr. Carson, but you're supposed to be in a terrible

00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:35.660
 condition, Henry.

00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:37.740
 This is no way to show your appreciation.

00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:39.420
 For what? For what?

00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:41.260
 I don't want any flowers, Mary.

00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:42.780
 Kathleen's waiting for me.

00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:44.140
 That doesn't make any difference.

00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:47.020
 Mother's terribly upset and you've got to come home and be sick.

00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:49.580
 Come on, Henry. Don't you think we better go back?

00:22:49.580 --> 00:22:51.900
 Call the ground. You put that rubber plant down.

00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:54.620
 But, Mary, I thought you said it was for Henry.

00:22:54.620 --> 00:22:58.620
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:12.860
 Hello Harriet, can you hear me? This is Alice Harriet. Your sister Alice Aldrich. Have you

00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:18.660
 seen anything of Henry and Homer over your way? Well my goodness, I said Mary out to find

00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:23.620
 Henry nearly 45 minutes ago and we were expecting flowers to be delivered for him any minute

00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:25.540
 What am I going to do?

00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:28.180
 Harriet, I've got to hang up somebody's at the door.

00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:31.900
 Then the whole house simply wreaks of cleaning fluid.

00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:34.180
 I say cleaning fluid.

00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:37.540
 Then maybe that's the flowers at the front door right now.

00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:39.620
 The flowers, Harriet.

00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:41.140
 And Sam doesn't care a bit.

00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:43.940
 He's upstairs taking your Sunday nap.

00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:45.940
 His Sunday nap.

00:23:45.940 --> 00:23:46.700
 Goodbye.

00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:51.820
 How do you do?

00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:53.580
 Hello there, Mrs. Aldrich.

00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:56.180
 Oh, Mr. Carson.

00:23:56.180 --> 00:23:59.580
 Oh, Mr. Carson, it's you.

00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:03.260
 Well, isn't this a surprise?

00:24:03.260 --> 00:24:05.340
 Won't you come here?

00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:07.420
 I'm sorry, I was held up with a little matter

00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:08.260
 of Mrs. Aldrich.

00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:10.940
 I intended to get over here sooner, but...

00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:13.820
 Well, as you can see, I've come to see the patient.

00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:15.980
 Oh, yes, yes.

00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:20.820
 Well, let's go into at least the living room.

00:24:20.820 --> 00:24:21.660
 All right.

00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:26.380
 I'm just a little embarrassed Mrs. Aldrich.

00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:27.380
 - And embarrassed?

00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:28.460
 - I'll be frank with you.

00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:30.540
 I used a little cleaning fluid for something

00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:31.860
 before I started over here,

00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:34.900
 and I didn't realize I was really pouring it on.

00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:37.700
 I guess you think I've smelled up your whole house.

00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:40.820
 - Oh no, no, that's us.

00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:43.340
 (audience laughing)

00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:45.380
 Oh, don't try to be polite, Mrs. Aldrich.

00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:47.100
 That isn't you, that's me.

00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:48.540
 (audience laughing)

00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:50.540
 This is hardly the time for laughter.

00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:53.140
 No, no, I suppose not.

00:24:53.140 --> 00:24:55.740
 I'm so glad to see you.

00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:58.740
 Mr. Aldrich is upstairs lying down.

00:24:58.740 --> 00:25:00.740
 Oh, it's Mr. Aldrich?

00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:02.740
 It's Mr. Aldrich that's sick?

00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:03.740
 My, uh...

00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:05.740
 How could I have made a mistake like that?

00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:07.740
 I thought it was Henry.

00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:10.540
 Mr. Carson, do you mind my asking just what it was?

00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:12.940
 Mr. Aldrich told you when he phoned this morning?

00:25:12.940 --> 00:25:14.940
 Well, the fact is,

00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:15.940
 now that I think of it,

00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:17.940
 he did seem to be just a bit confused.

00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:19.440
 All I gathered was there

00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:23.320
 been quite an accident and the whole family was pretty much upset but I never

00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:27.040
 dreamed of the imagine. What is it you're laughing at?

00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:32.240
 Humans forgive me but I prayed for Henry. Well that's better than not though.

00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:36.440
 However I suppose the Lord will get it all straightened out.

00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:40.640
 Are you all

00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:43.640
 Who's making all that noise down there?

00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:47.840
 Mrs. Olrich I don't think you better let him come down even if I am here.

00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:54.460
 I'm not going to with you excuse me just a minute while I see if he's all right of course and you tell him I'll come up there and see

00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:56.460
 Well, that's fine

00:25:56.460 --> 00:25:59.260
 I think you'll hear me

00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:03.600
 Thank you quiet quiet quiet. I'm not making noise. Don't come any farther down the steps

00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:06.760
 You've got to go back and get into bed. What far I've had by nap

00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:11.980
 But the amisic caution has come to tell you how sorry he is you've had that accident. What accident?

00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:17.280
 How do I know? Just go back into your room and get into bed. How did you feel all right?

00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:21.680
 This isn't my fault. You're the one that cooked up that story.

00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:25.280
 Now go on up there and get into your pajamas and get under the cover.

00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:26.280
 What, Alex?

00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:30.280
 Sam, do you realize he even prayed for us? Now go on!

00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:33.280
 Oh, Mr. Carson!

00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:34.780
 Yes, Mrs. Orich?

00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:37.280
 I'm sorry to have kept you waiting, but...

00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:39.280
 How is the patient?

00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:45.280
 Why, he's fine. He seems a little restless. He wants to get up and around.

00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:51.480
 Well, Mrs. Aldrich, before I go up there, I went over to sit down in your sofa and I

00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:57.040
 moved that cushion and didn't look where I was sitting and apparently somebody left

00:26:57.040 --> 00:26:59.040
 the chocolate drop under there.

00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:00.040
 Oh, dear.

00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:02.200
 Have you sat on it?

00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:03.680
 That's all right, Mrs. Aldrich.

00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:05.400
 This is an old suit, anyhow.

00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:08.320
 Mr. Carson, I can't begin to tell you how embarrassed I am.

00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:10.080
 Oh, there's nothing be embarrassed about.

00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:13.840
 I happen to know that ordinary cleaning fluid will remove this sort of thing without any

00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:14.840
 trouble, whatever.

00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:16.840
 Yes, I found that out too.

00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:20.340
 Would you excuse me while I go out to the kitchen and see whether there's any left?

00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:21.840
 I mean... Mother!

00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:23.340
 Yes, Mary, is that you?

00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:24.340
 Yes, Mother!

00:27:24.340 --> 00:27:25.840
 Dear, I didn't know you were home.

00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:27.840
 Oh, yes, I've been upstairs with it.

00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:29.340
 Oh, is this...

00:27:29.340 --> 00:27:31.840
 Well, my goodness, I thought you were out looking for...

00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:35.840
 Mr. Carson, I'll get you cleaned up in just a minute.

00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:36.840
 Blandy!

00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:37.840
 Oh, hello, Mr. Carson.

00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:38.840
 Hello, Mary.

00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:40.840
 Say, why do your mother's getting the cleaning fluid?

00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:42.840
 Could my grub stairs and see the patient?

00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:43.840
 The patient?

00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:45.840
 Yes, let's go up and see how he is.

00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:48.240
 Tell me, Mary, how was he when you saw him last?

00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:49.440
 Oh, why?

00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:50.640
 He was fine.

00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:53.240
 But we've had quite a little trouble persuading him

00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:54.140
 to get in bed.

00:27:54.140 --> 00:27:54.940
 Yes?

00:27:54.940 --> 00:27:56.940
 Yes, he had an engagement for Sunday dinner.

00:27:56.940 --> 00:27:59.640
 And my goodness, he just insisted that he was going

00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:00.640
 to go no matter what.

00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:01.640
 Yes?

00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:03.640
 Well, I'll give him a good talking to him,

00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:05.740
 tell him to take care of himself.

00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:08.140
 You know, we've been thinking for a long time

00:28:08.140 --> 00:28:09.340
 of putting him on the board.

00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:11.240
 And I don't know but what this would be a good time

00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:12.040
 to bring it up.

00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:13.240
 On the board?

00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:14.740
 Isn't he a little young for that?

00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:16.300
 Your home, not a bit.

00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:18.100
 We need someone with his experience.

00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:20.500
 Oh, we'll hear this door right here.

00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:22.420
 I'll let you go in first, Mr. Carson.

00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:24.580
 All right.

00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:26.880
 Well, old man, how are you?

00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:28.280
 Oh, gee whiz.

00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:30.580
 Oh, what are you doing at Henry's bed?

00:28:30.580 --> 00:28:33.860
 Mary, when Henry left, he said it was just going to be flowers,

00:28:33.860 --> 00:28:35.180
 and then I could get up.

00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:38.160

00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:19.620
 Back to Henry Orrrich in just a moment.

00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:20.620
 But now here's...

00:29:20.620 --> 00:29:21.620
 Hi, you fellas.

00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:28.840
 This is your V-mail gal Jill saying "V-mail for some of you, V-mail for some more of you,

00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:31.840
 and for the rest of you who are getting too few dimensions."

00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:36.380
 Good night if you don't use vast V-mail, how do you expect us to get your letters answered

00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:37.860
 on the double?

00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:43.280
 And another thing, V-mail letters don't require an envelope, and you can make the notice short

00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:45.560
 as a GI haircut.

00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:50.160
 And now let's listen in on the olderages for a moment, exactly one week later.

00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:53.760
 Mary, I want you to run upstairs right this minute and get me a clean handkerchief.

00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:55.860
 Yes, mother, I'll get it right away for you.

00:29:55.860 --> 00:29:58.360
 And, Henry, why don't you have both your shoes on?

00:29:58.360 --> 00:30:02.560
 Well, that's what I was just going to tell you, mother. I can only find this run.

00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:05.460
 Mother, I don't think you have any clean handkerchief.

00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:08.760
 - What, Mary? - Come on, Alice. Is everyone ready to start?

00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:11.160
 Now, Sam, where are you going with that suitcase?

00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:12.660
 There's suitcase to church.

00:30:12.660 --> 00:30:16.060
 And it is a complete change of Thai shoes, socks, and handkerchiefs.

00:30:16.060 --> 00:30:18.060
 For everybody in the family. Come on.
