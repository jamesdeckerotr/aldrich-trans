1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 Hey gang, you got a minute? Good. I want you to hear the story that came to us in this week's surprise package. It seems as well known living room. Listen.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 Mary! Mary! Now Henry. Uh, Elizabeth, say I'm I'll take care of you. I'll take care of you just as soon as I have one more hands free.

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 In the meantime, let's all try to do a few things for ourselves.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,400
 I'm not a line, I'll fix my head to myself.

5
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,360
 Mother, could you speak to Mary, please?

6
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:30,800
 And tell her to hurry.

7
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,560
 Henry, I'm tying your tie just as fast as I can.

8
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,800
 Mother, it is if you aren't complaining about

9
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:39,040
 considering that this bow tie is a perfect stranger to you,

10
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,720
 you're doing fine.

11
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:41,880
 It's Mary.

12
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,200
 Mary!

13
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,800
 Mary, I'm scraping that tuxedo, Dr. St.

14
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:46,360
 as she can.

15
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:47,600
 Now please stop showing.

16
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,800
 Put another recording to my watch at 720 already.

17
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,680
 7, my name is in as early as I am.

18
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:56,580
 early father she was I should probably be walking through the door of Kathleen's

19
00:00:56,580 --> 00:01:00,640
 house right now well I could have been getting to go and then there's no and

20
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,000
 I hardly started I said there's a man how do I look

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,020
 Sam look at him I had me some man and I realize that technically the

22
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:13,560
 drama causes are evening clothes so no the dance committee look at it in the

23
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:19,240
 same life that's just that that's just it Mary's holding up my pants she's

24
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:22,200
 expressing with such seat over probably doing the best you can

25
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,600
 I'll just my turn now now do you know how annoyed you get when I'm not ready

26
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:31,960
 don't you want me to look my best yes I'm come here father you speaking before

27
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:35,280
 the businessman's club again business man's club I should say not

28
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,040
 it's more important than anything like how do we let's say good as come about

29
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,680
 chambers of something whole still that's a specific I'm speaking before the state

30
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,680
 I just want to say those poments on the pond and really stay lost.

31
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,680
 Dear, how can I fix your time to keep teaching me my time?

32
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:54,680
 I'm just putting my speech on my inside pocket. I don't want to leave that behind.

33
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,680
 Mary, have you finished my truck seat? Oh, no, I'm trying to tell you.

34
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,680
 You're going to. You want to tell her? Or the country club?

35
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,680
 What's that got to do with my pants?

36
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,680
 Well, my dinner's going to the country club. I won't have to worry about your child who's looking a little informal.

37
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:13,680
 She was married. Not you realize I haven't even tried them on yet.

38
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,680
 Henry, you mean whether that's Tuxedo without sitting at first?

39
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,680
 Well, how crime? I didn't find out.

40
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,680
 Father was using my Tuxedo until the day of her new.

41
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,680
 I'll adjust you though.

42
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,680
 Henry, go to your room and try those powders on at once.

43
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,680
 He asked mother, I'd be glad. Mother, what should I do with Henry's job?

44
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,680
 Lay it out carefully on the bake here and finish their thing if you want to be ready in time to go with your father.

45
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,880
 Yes, and I certainly wish any would get so I felt

46
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:44,680
 Then just look at you. Yeah, you're talking about it. You're putting the best all wrong

47
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,680
 Oh, how did I do that?

48
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,680
 You're linking your coat, take it off and do your best right.

49
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,680
 My opinion was gonna jacket should have been included in the emancipation confirmation.

50
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,680
 Don't hang it on the chair, they put it on the bed where I won't get much.

51
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,680
 Mother, is this concert properly well about to the touch seat out?

52
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,680
 There is no. Then I'll just let out my suspenders a little.

53
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:07,740
 This is a heartbeat of this.

54
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:09,700
 Then it's all its fits alright.

55
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,700
 It's just that if my best for shorter

56
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,700
 and my pants longer would be more equalized.

57
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,260
 Mary, would you ask for the phone, please?

58
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:18,620
 - Just in the phone.

59
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:20,220
 - No, no, no.

60
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:23,420
 Just put your robe on Mary, you're all busy in here.

61
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:24,540
 - And there you go, that looks like

62
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,260
 thanks to the Know-to-Go-Back market.

63
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:29,140
 - Miss, no, Gee, was these are my tickets to the dance.

64
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:30,700
 - You know, we should find a favorite place,

65
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,660
 Father, dear, you should have lived in there.

66
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:34,140
 - Henry, it's Homer.

67
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,580
 - Homer, thank you, Mary.

68
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:40,340
 And Mary, would you put these tickets in the inside pocket of my jacket while you're walking in that direction?

69
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:41,420
 My goodness, how are you?

70
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:41,980
 What am I?

71
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,180
 You're mad, too, you think?

72
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,780
 And thank you, Mary.

73
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:46,080
 Hello, homie.

74
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,180
 Hi, Henry.

75
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:51,180
 Now, look, before you say a single word, remember, it's my car.

76
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:51,980
 We're growing.

77
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:54,380
 I've got half a line not to go anywhere.

78
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:55,980
 What are you talking about, homie?

79
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,380
 You mean an unmasked man?

80
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:57,880
 Man?

81
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,380
 What am I going to be mad about?

82
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:02,380
 Well, I'm glad to see that you're looking at this intelligently.

83
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:03,380
 Sure.

84
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:04,380
 I know that.

85
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:06,380
 We'll have lean feel that way too.

86
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:07,380
 Feel now.

87
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:10,380
 From the last time I was late picking the Agnes up for revenge, she stepped on my feet

88
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:12,380
 all evening just to get even.

89
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:13,380
 Great.

90
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:15,380
 Wait, while you're crazy, it's only 7.30.

91
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:20,380
 You are the one who's crazy and recently half past eight.

92
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,380
 What?

93
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:22,380
 Do you mean my watch has stopped?

94
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,380
 Listen, Homer, what's the big idea?

95
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,380
 I'll pick you up.

96
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:26,380
 I'll pick you up.

97
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:27,380
 We can't waste the time.

98
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,380
 I'm going to get Kathleen's in three minutes.

99
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,380
 Three minutes.

100
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:32,380
 It takes me long to imagine if my father's car started.

101
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:35,380
 - Stop running. - Well, my thing's, why my thing's...

102
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:39,380
 - Don't stop me, Mother. I'm late. - Henry, stop running.

103
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:41,380
 - Henry, stop running. - Henry, stop running.

104
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,380
 - Henry, what's the matter? - Don't stop me, Mother. I'm late.

105
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:46,380
 - Henry, stop pushing me around. My hair's falling down.

106
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:49,380
 - Here's my jacket. Here's my jacket. - Mary, get Henry's jacket.

107
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:51,380
 - Don't give him your pocket, Mary. - Fine.

108
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:53,380
 - No, I'll do it. - Thank you, Mother. Thank you, Father.

109
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:56,380
 - Henry, you're forgetting a jacket? - Oh, she was. Thank you, Mary.

110
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:59,380
 - You got it, everybody. I'll put this on in my way now.

111
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:01,380
 - Henry, look after the news, walk in the hall.

112
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:03,380
 He found this. - Henry!

113
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:04,380
 The boy!

114
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:07,380
 Well, he's gone.

115
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,380
 Thank goodness!

116
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:12,380
 Now we can concentrate on ourselves for the rest of the evening.

117
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:25,380
 You mean she's gone, Mrs. Anderson?

118
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:26,380
 I'm appreciate her, Henry.

119
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:27,380
 Charlie Clark's that guy.

120
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:30,380
 He's happened to know you're starting to go along with him.

121
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:32,380
 Is that right? With Charlie Clark?

122
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:35,380
 Can I... I've got her tickets.

123
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:37,380
 Well, I'm Mr. Family at Home's tickets.

124
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,380
 Did you get to the two of you? You're yours.

125
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,380
 Oh boy, where's that Homer?

126
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:45,380
 Henry, isn't there a jacket? It's like a large, aren't you?

127
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:47,380
 Large, Mr. Anderson, the large.

128
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,380
 That's the latest style.

129
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:50,380
 It is? Yes, me.

130
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:52,380
 Each part fits a little different.

131
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:53,380
 Yeah.

132
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:56,380
 That's it. It's supposed to make you look casual.

133
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:58,380
 Well, you do look casual.

134
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:03,060
 I'll say that's not so that must be Homer now. Good night, mrs. Anderson

135
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:06,300
 No, don't bring that we hope you like my name. I want this is Anderson

136
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:13,580
 Gee whiz Homer what took you so long? I had a push my father's car from my house to main Street before I would start

137
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:19,380
 As I was mad she isn't even here. Don't know she went home, but she's got my ticket

138
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:24,700
 She and Kathleen left already with Charlie Clark. Come on. Oh, listen. Hey, who are you pushing?

139
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,900
 But we've got to get there before it's too late.

140
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:30,100
 Don't you realize Charlie Clark's the best dancer in the school?

141
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:34,100
 [CHEERING]

142
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:42,500
 Now, Sam, don't rush me.

143
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:45,260
 If it hadn't been for you and Henry, I'd have been good in 20

144
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:45,760
 at times.

145
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:48,020
 Alex, this is probably going to be one of the most important

146
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:49,420
 speeches of my career.

147
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:50,420
 I don't want to be late.

148
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:51,820
 We wrote the late, Sam.

149
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:54,100
 Your speech isn't scheduled until 1030.

150
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,100
 Now calm down.

151
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:58,100
 Mother, I'm already in the mirror with me, dear.

152
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,600
 Sam, you're putting it over, 'cause I'm over your desk.

153
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,100
 You don't even have your jacket on.

154
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,100
 Well, when did I say hi, Jack at all?

155
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,100
 I'm excited, you are?

156
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,100
 I'm not excited.

157
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,100
 Where is my clothes?

158
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,100
 I'm in, Father.

159
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,100
 Oh, yes.

160
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:13,100
 Oh, goodness, I've forgotten how lovely this round there with gown walls.

161
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,100
 The shame is wasted on just a speech.

162
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:17,100
 How do you mean that?

163
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,100
 Mary, I thought you wanted to hear your father make your speech.

164
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:23,100
 Oh, it's because I had a fight with Joe Graham and both my gate with him.

165
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:26,100
 I'm gonna start in here for a little speech practically analyzed.

166
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:30,100
 Are you about getting raped since an hour ago?

167
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,100
 No, no, be silly.

168
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:35,100
 Oh, if jacket seems to fit me tighter, it is tighter.

169
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,100
 I'll ask if it's Henry's jacket.

170
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,100
 What?

171
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,100
 Is it Henry's jacket?

172
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,100
 Is it Henry's jacket?

173
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,100
 Is it Henry's jacket?

174
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,100
 Here are his tickets in the inside pocket.

175
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:46,100
 Well, it's not really serious at all, most things.

176
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,100
 You're still quite with the button open, that's all.

177
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:51,100
 Alice, you realize my speech is in the other jacket.

178
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:53,100
 I've been a whole week, but there is.

179
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,100
 There you go.

180
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,100
 Who am I going to the country for?

181
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,100
 Divine Henry.

182
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,100
 Stay in Kentucky.

183
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,100
 But just get yourself all excited,

184
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:02,100
 and I won't have you getting up in front of all those people with your tasteline.

185
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,100
 But I...

186
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:08,100
 Now, Sam, there isn't any reason in the world why Mary couldn't go just as easily as you could.

187
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,100
 I love her!

188
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,100
 Thank you.

189
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,100
 Your father and I will drive on down to the mansion.

190
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,100
 How far you find him.

191
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,100
 And hurry, Mary, and give these tickets to Henry.

192
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,100
 Yes, Father.

193
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,100
 And don't come back without the speech.

194
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,100
 My entire reputation is at stake.

195
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:32,100
 [Music]

196
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:35,100
 Homer, can't you go any faster?

197
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:39,100
 Listen, Henry, we're getting there, and we know, but it's almost 9.30 already.

198
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:41,100
 I've got to take it easy.

199
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:45,100
 My father told me to do something to the car before we left, and I forgot what it was.

200
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:49,100
 You forgot, suppose it was important we're still moving, Ernie.

201
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:52,100
 You rushed me so I was lucky I didn't forget more.

202
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,100
 She was one healthy up in the first place.

203
00:08:54,100 --> 00:09:00,100
 Well after my mother and father left for that darn dinner at the mansion house, I couldn't find my black socks anywhere.

204
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,100
 You mean you're wearing colored socks with your tuxedo?

205
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,100
 You think I'm a fool, Henry?

206
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:07,100
 I took a great hair down to the clothing and dyed them.

207
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,100
 [audience laughter]

208
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:12,100
 Oh, Mark. Oh, we're stopped pulling around.

209
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:14,100
 You can't mean it. There's something wrong with the car.

210
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:19,100
 I'm going to call, do something, call the chow, the chow, the flower, some protein there.

211
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:22,100
 Homer, what did you call?

212
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,100
 The grate.

213
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,100
 What did you call his room?

214
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,100
 I call him a lump.

215
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,100
 It was a gas gauge, it's empty.

216
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:32,100
 You suppose that's what my father wanted me to do?

217
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,100
 Oh boy, are we in a fix?

218
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:37,100
 The nearest gas station is nearly two miles away.

219
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,100
 Why bother about that?

220
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,100
 Why not get a hit?

221
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,100
 You mean leave the car near you?

222
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,100
 Sure, he'd want to steal this car anyway.

223
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:50,100
 Well, if it's alright with you, old boy, I hate to think about adding something to my new shoes when I get there.

224
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:54,100
 How do you think I feel? Don't you realize, Charlie Clark's been after Kathleen for years?

225
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,100
 And now he's finally got his hands on?

226
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:01,100
 Can the hiccums across? Let's get out in the road, Homer, so we'll be sure and see it.

227
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:05,100
 Pinch, mister! Look out in the other, the good girl in the new house.

228
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,100
 Pinch!

229
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,100
 You stopping, Homer!

230
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,100
 Fire, Homer!

231
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:12,100
 Oh, gee, what is it, Homer? It's really partial!

232
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,540
 Boy, will you like a boat through the glute?

233
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:15,900
 I was brought up a van too?

234
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:16,800
 Is that where you're headed?

235
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,600
 Will it sure?

236
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,940
 Then you can ride us over.

237
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:19,440
 Sure.

238
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,240
 Get in, Homer.

239
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,680
 You're about 25 cents a peak.

240
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,680
 What?

241
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,440
 Boy, are you a crock, Willy?

242
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,680
 I mean, it actually charged friends of yours 25 cents.

243
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:32,080
 Or if you were friends, it would be 10 cents more.

244
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,580
 I'll bet you're attitude, Willy.

245
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:34,280
 Never mind.

246
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,020
 Homer, we've got no choice.

247
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:36,880
 Get in.

248
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,320
 All I can say is, Willy, this makes you practically

249
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,320
 a scavenger.

250
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,820
 Well, I've got to make a living.

251
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,820
 50 cents please.

252
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:48,820
 (music)

253
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:55,820
 (music)

254
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:59,820
 That's a sad try, not so sad, my dinner.

255
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:03,820
 Oh gee, what's happening is I've never got you in a lot of bad habits.

256
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:09,820
 You got a sad try, I'd rather dance than listen to this time if you don't mind.

257
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,060
 - Yes, though.

258
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:14,220
 You just had a lesson in some of our latest stuff there is.

259
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:17,500
 That Aldrich has only one step, a one step.

260
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,300
 (laughing)

261
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,500
 - He's got trouble.

262
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,740
 Well, my goodness, Henry Street made you a little odd

263
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:25,460
 for the kind of dancing you do, but he wants it signed.

264
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:27,420
 - Walt, that's what I mean.

265
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,580
 He's pretty historic.

266
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:29,580
 - That's what he means.

267
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:30,660
 That's what he means.

268
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,500
 - No, Aldrich, there's your brother.

269
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,500
 - He means he is.

270
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,860
 - No, you know, I'm currently invited to the dance.

271
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:37,500
 We have you been shown up yet.

272
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,980
 - You want to worry girls.

273
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,580
 I can manage the bull's doesn't he?

274
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:42,780
 Oh, but this is all because he's got the seats.

275
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,780
 Is that what Henry is making a seat?

276
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:46,780
 He took the jacket with my father's seats.

277
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,280
 And he's very upset.

278
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,280
 Henry, no, my father.

279
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,680
 He doesn't even have his tickets.

280
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,480
 Your father?

281
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,280
 No, Henry.

282
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,580
 What is the business on?

283
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:59,880
 Well, if I know Henry, he probably wound up with that other form of dance at the town hall.

284
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,680
 Oh, I couldn't do things out here.

285
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,580
 I did hear someone mention the town hall.

286
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:04,780
 Well, I've got a rush right over.

287
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,580
 And, Terri, let me hear in 10 minutes.

288
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:08,180
 I'll never talk to him again.

289
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:18,180
 [Music]

290
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:21,180
 Well, we're just about there.

291
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:23,180
 He was really looking out.

292
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:26,180
 Boy.

293
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:29,180
 Sunday driver.

294
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:33,180
 Well, he released his commute for 25 cents to get us there in 1P.

295
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:35,180
 That's all right. He was a country club now.

296
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:37,180
 I'm not a bad dog!

297
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:39,180
 Everybody out!

298
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:41,180
 I'm shoving you!

299
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:43,180
 Who I'm getting now!

300
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:45,180
 You think I want to get in at least one van?

301
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:48,180
 It's not a great for me! If we did, you'd probably charge us for it!

302
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:50,180
 We'll be away, or we'll eat!

303
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:53,180
 Biggest please! I have to get no one that's better without a ticket!

304
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:55,180
 Can I have your ticket, gentlemen?

305
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:57,180
 Yes, sir! Got them right here in my inside pocket!

306
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:01,180
 Excuse me, Mr. But would you know any nice quiet spot inside?

307
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:04,180
 Well, I could take my girl and sort of explain things to you!

308
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:07,180
 Sorry, we don't allow anything like that at our dance, as young man.

309
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:10,180
 I don't think you understand.

310
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:13,180
 Well, do you, is it that isn't the strangest thing?

311
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:14,180
 Can't you find your tickets?

312
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:16,180
 Well, I'll find them. I'll find them.

313
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:18,180
 You better, buddy. You don't find them. They don't get in.

314
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:20,180
 Now, listen, you may stop fooling around.

315
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:22,180
 I'm not fooling, Robert.

316
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:25,180
 The only thing I can find in my pockets are these darn papers.

317
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:28,180
 So, I'm trying to at least wait until I park the car.

318
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:30,180
 Homer, did you find them in the room?

319
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,180
 Or do you realize what these papers are?

320
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:37,460
 I want to a walk. My father speaks my father speaks somewhere in my father's speech instead of our speaker.

321
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:38,460
 Y'all?

322
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:42,220
 [audience laughter]

323
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:44,220
 Number one bet on me either, Henry.

324
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,060
 [audience laughter]

325
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:50,100
 Not at all. I don't know, but if my father doesn't get his speech back, there's no telling you all happen.

326
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,060
 What's up, fellas?

327
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:54,020
 Willie, Willie, how would you like to do me a favor?

328
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:54,940
 It's all the best.

329
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:56,620
 Ten, you think you could afford?

330
00:13:56,620 --> 00:14:01,420
 Willie, would you be willing to drive back and return the speech to my father and get high-tech?

331
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:03,820
 Well, that'd be an expensive proposition, Henry.

332
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:06,060
 Remember, we're steady customers, Willie.

333
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:07,660
 How expensive.

334
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,060
 I'ma put you back.

335
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,060
 Oh, no, Willie.

336
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:10,900
 How much?

337
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,900
 I'll figure on the way I'm carrying the car,

338
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:15,260
 plus gas and oil, of course, and blowing in my nothing

339
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,300
 half a day.

340
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,700
 I don't see how I can afford to do it for less than $2.

341
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:19,700
 $2?

342
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:20,700
 $2?

343
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,260
 Boy, you was crooked, Willie.

344
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:22,700
 That's it.

345
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:23,300
 Take it away.

346
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,380
 But $4, I mean, that was $2.

347
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:27,780
 Does that include the dolly only?

348
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:29,780
 I mean, that's a operating expense.

349
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:31,780
 what operating expenses

350
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:33,780
 have you ever seen a agency?

351
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:35,780
 [laughter]

352
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:39,780
 well, tell my father it would bancen me two dollars when you deliver the speech

353
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:41,780
 that would be 10 friends faster

354
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:44,780
 listen, will you can afford to throw that in for nothing

355
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,780
 ok, let me have it, I'll talk it up to good will

356
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:49,780
 here, and be sure my father gets this speech really

357
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:51,780
 neither rain nor fleek nor bloom of money

358
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:54,780
 never mind, will you ever mind just how old that's like

359
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:58,780
 if you're using it all, will you get the mansion now

360
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:01,780
 I'm not warning you, Sam. I'll roll off my run.

361
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:03,780
 You still don't have any tickets, hear me?

362
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:05,780
 Do we have to wait on your award comes?

363
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:08,780
 I don't think Agnes will hold out that line.

364
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:10,780
 I'm just as anxious as you are, Homer.

365
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:11,780
 Hi, Oliver. My eye should.

366
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:14,780
 You don't have two extra tickets, do you, Shorty?

367
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:17,780
 Hi. I just want to get my girl a start.

368
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:19,780
 Say, Oliver, should you and Kathleen have a fight?

369
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:21,780
 No, Julie, whenever you give me that idea.

370
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:24,780
 Oh, nothing except she and Charlie Clark have been awful.

371
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:26,780
 Chummy, darling. Oh, ladies.

372
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:28,380
 Well, see you later, old boy.

373
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,380
 Homer, we've got to get into that dance somehow.

374
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:30,980
 Look around.

375
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:34,080
 Homer, don't you realize Kathleen is in there with Charlie

376
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,980
 Clark dancing our head off?

377
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:54,980
 In a mission time and time to hear from two surprise vocalists,

378
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:58,980
 Loria de Haven and Frank Sinatra. Loria, you're on.

380
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:12,980
 And when I try to

381
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:17,980
 I love the new art

382
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:21,980
 They didn't believe me

383
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:26,980
 They didn't believe me

384
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:32,980
 You're in your eye, you're clearly dead

385
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:36,980
 I'm in a place beyond the contrary

386
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:40,980
 You're the hand you see

387
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:44,980
 I'm going to be

388
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:48,980
 I'm gonna tell you

389
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:51,980
 I'm on the road

390
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:54,980
 I'm going to tell you

391
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:59,980
 You lost the day of you

392
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:04,980
 You'll never be here

393
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:08,980
 I'll never be here

394
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:15,980
 That's the only thing you'll ever be

395
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:23,980
 I'll never be here

396
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:28,980
 I'm on top of the line before the night

397
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:31,980
 That you're the star

00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:36,980
 That you're the star that you are the star

 It never argues with your heart

 It isn't smart, it isn't sound

 Love gets around

414
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:50,140
 In short, it has happened to a ticket in a ticket.

415
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:55,140
 It has happened on a street call and a bus.

416
00:18:55,140 --> 00:19:02,140
 They have given me a dinner at a company to a funeral.

417
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:05,140
 While a stranger happens to a funeral.

418
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:08,140
 To a mama, a mama, a mama.

419
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:13,140
 He who are brothers in you and you have a good life.

420
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:20,140
 Since sin happens to the substance, it no longer is a substance.

421
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:24,140
 Why is this that happens to you all?

422
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:30,140
 It seems to me that there is no body happening to you.

423
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:35,140
 I'm right, and I'm the other.

424
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:56,140
 So, you go, oh, you go, that's all you find in the geeze, yes, I'm tangy. All six, you, it has happened to a kiddo at the dinner. For the main moto and a giant in just a little.

425
00:19:56,140 --> 00:20:06,140
 I want the steps for you, I'm sure you'll be too busy, why didn't it happen to you all?

426
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:11,140
 Oh, why shouldn't it happen to you all?

427
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:19,760
 There's no last chance you want, my friend.

428
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,820
 The moon is always in fashion, head away.

429
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:26,760
 So do you think you're going to be?

430
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:29,900
 Hey, it's Vixenbaum, happy day.

431
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:32,000
 A battle-buddling, the speeder.

432
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,440
 Yes, and very good.

433
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:38,640
 All three adults, all with little good money,

434
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,880
 starry, with matters.

435
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:46,720
 And the armadillos, the magic superfly.

436
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:52,400
 Why should I use to find the phone from all you do?

437
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:56,560
 Why shouldn't it happen to you all?

438
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:00,320
 I'll help you to please say that again dear

439
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:05,280
 Why shouldn't it happen to you all?

440
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:10,240

442
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,240
 Now getting back to the troubles of Henry Alders.

443
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:38,240
 Henry has inadvertently switched dinner jackets with his father,

444
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:43,000
 leaving his tickets to the dance in this jacket and taking a prepared speech of Mr. Alberts

445
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 as long instead.

446
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 So now Henry impatiently waits while Willie tries to return the speech and get the tickets.

447
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 The scene opens at the mansion house.

448
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,040
 We're very shortly Mr. Alberts is scheduled to address the state's Hindu complex.

449
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:59,040
 Now, stand calm down.

450
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,040
 Calm down?

451
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,040
 How can I calm down?

452
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,240
 There are 3,000 people in there from all over the state.

453
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,240
 They're not even so eager.

454
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:10,200
 They're bound to finish some time and you realize the position I'll be yet if I'm called upon and I'm not prepared.

455
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:13,200
 Everything will work out fine. You're always done.

456
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,100
 Oh, Mr. Alberts.

457
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:14,960
 You made a time?

458
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,160
 That's the phone call for you. You can take it right over there.

459
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:17,880
 Oh, thank you.

460
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,800
 Sam, don't run. You'll call and ruin your whole evening.

461
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,800
 Alberts, call well bound to stall and as long as possible.

462
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,320
 Hello.

463
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,120
 Let me speak to Mr. Alberts, please.

464
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,480
 Mary, this is your father.

465
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,220
 It is?

466
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:29,600
 Oh, the what shall I do now?

467
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,640
 Do, do. Get here with that speech at once.

468
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:34,120
 Oh, tell my father, Henry, set the picture.

469
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,000
 He's what?

470
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 This is the second that I've been at and I can't find him anyway.

471
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,400
 Have you looked carefully?

472
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:42,000
 Yes, Father. I've even had Joe Graham looking for it.

473
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:42,500
 Oh?

474
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:47,000
 And Joe Graham. He saw me in the bronze belt again and now there isn't anything he won't do to help.

475
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 Joe, don't you realize I'm speaking of my own father?

476
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,500
 [laughter]

477
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,500
 Well, how are you now?

478
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,500
 I'm at the town hall.

479
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,600
 What are you doing there?

480
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,900
 Haven't you went to the country club?

481
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:58,000
 He wasn't there either until I keep on looking?

482
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 Stop this town.

483
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,500
 [laughter]

484
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:03,000
 Never mind Mary I'll find him myself.

485
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 You will take your pill to get started.

486
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 I'll just tell him to keep stalling. Make excuses. Anything until I get back.

487
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 Sam, you're getting flush.

488
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 Alice, if I don't find Henry, I'll be flush for the rest of my life.

489

 Oh!

491
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,560
 Don't have to go to the mansion house for what I want to do for money

492
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:45,940
 Hey, if you think I'm gonna cram over that war in my touch seal your craze

493
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:47,940
 Oh, don't you realize what's happening?

494
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:53,520
 Kathleen's in there getting the wrong impression a Charlie Clark an Agnes homeless think of Agnes why?

495
00:23:54,680 --> 00:24:00,060
 She's probably inside by at least ten surrounded by at least ten fellas all trying to cut you out

496
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:03,100
 In fellas around Agnes sure crazy

497
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:08,980
 Agnes ever had ten fellas or is when she refereed that basketball game

498
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:14,500
 Well, I'll boost you up to the top of the wall and then you helped me and once we get up there were sex

499
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:21,220
 It's that simple sure you'll put your foot in my hand. So okay ready ready

500
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:24,380

501
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:28,940
 Now help me grab my hand

502
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:35,940
 I am pulling. I'm almost there. A little bit more handling. Yeah. Oh boy.

503
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:48,940
 Was that rip in your touch-to-do when you put it on? No, and this is my father's touch-to-do.

504
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:52,940
 Well, there isn't anything that can't be fixed. All you need is an eagle and thread.

505
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:55,940
 Unless you look at it in a certain light, you'll never know the difference.

506
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:57,940
 You can sew home, I'm sure.

507
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:59,940
 Let's get down off this wall.

508
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:00,940
 Okay, jump home.

509
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:01,940
 Jump? Me?

510
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:02,940
 Come on, yes.

511
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:03,940
 You mean you're scared?

512
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:04,940
 Scared?

513
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:06,940
 What makes you think I'm scared?

514
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:07,940
 I'm going.

515
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:08,940
 Okay.

516
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:09,940
 Go ahead.

517
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:10,940
 Go brush me.

518
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:11,940
 One.

519
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:12,940
 Two.

520
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:13,940
 Three.

521
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:14,940
 Four.

522
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:15,940
 Five.

523
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:18,940
 Are you all right, Homer?

524
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:19,940
 I'm sure.

525
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:22,940
 She's with what was I worried about.

526
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:23,940
 I'm not jumping.

527
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,940
 Okay, you're right come

528
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:29,780
 Come on, let's get into the dance.

529
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:31,780
 Homer, we'll have to go your way. There's a head seat.

530
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:34,260
 There is. There's one on this side too.

531
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:35,780
 Hey, who's in there?

532
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:37,780
 Old boy, let's try straight ahead.

533
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:39,780
 You know, you know, these hedges are all around us.

534
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:41,300
 How old are you?

535
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,740
 Something stuck in here.

536
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:43,540
 I hear you in there.

537
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:44,580
 Homer, I'm for it.

538
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:45,060
 Where?

539
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:46,180
 Straight ahead.

540
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,140
 Oh, shit.

541
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:49,620
 Hey, these bushes are coming with glory.

542
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:50,500
 Oh, I'm stuck.

543
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,700
 Keep going Henry.

544
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:52,660
 Come out of there you.

545
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:53,460
 Homer, stop.

546
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:55,460
 Pushing!

547
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:57,460
 Oh, look at all of you!

548
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:59,460
 We have a man's jacket and a ring round!

549
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:09,460
 Well, Mr. Gotta plant I see.

550
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:11,460
 Yes, you're perfectly right. I've got a plant.

551
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:13,460
 That's why I'm changing this tire.

552
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:15,460
 You better have to happen out here in the edge of town

553
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:17,460
 where there's no service station.

554
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:19,460
 Say, er...

555
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:22,460
 Aren't you going to ruin that tuxedo working in the bike there?

556
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:29,660
 I'm being careful that coldie or it looks a little tight. I've got it opened in front. Look, I'm in a hurry

557
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:35,060
 So if you just stand back, I'll tighten these bolts. You're going to bend over. How else would I do it?

558
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:38,980
 Okay, go ahead. You're a few more. I'm gonna tighten these bolts.

559
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:45,620
 That one bolt rusty. I'm getting it. I'm getting it.

560
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:48,940
 What was that?

561
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,940
 You don't need to worry about it.

562
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:53,940
 That's court's open, both front and back.

563
00:26:53,940 --> 00:27:05,940
 Henry, do you think it's safe to sneak into the dance, Carol?

564
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:08,940
 Let's make sure we finally lost that doorman.

565
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:09,940
 Do you see him?

566
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:10,940
 No.

567
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:13,940
 You're home. I'm going to get my father to sue the country club.

568
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:14,940
 No, please.

569
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:20,240
 Look at that jacket. Well, my father's saying even when Fred wants to fix that for if you're right, you know

570
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:23,180
 He's that more risk than Jack and also there you are

571
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:27,520
 Back here you go come on. We're talking to the lobby

572
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:32,980
 Click behind this

573
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:36,380
 Boy home when he ran my passport

574
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:39,380
 They're going to ask him when you're all doing trickling.

575
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:40,380
 He's finally got near.

576
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:41,380
 But carefully, much of his strength.

577
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:43,380
 No, I'm not in your heart of having fun.

578
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:43,380
 He takes me to a dark dark trickling.

579
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:45,380
 Is that this as mad as you are,

580
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:46,380
 Kathleen?

581
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:47,380
 No.

582
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:48,380
 Let's go home.

583
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:49,380
 That's right.

584
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:50,380
 That's right.

585
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:51,380
 I can't believe it.

586
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:52,380
 I can't believe it.

587
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:53,380
 I can't believe it.

588
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,380
 I can't believe it.

589
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:55,380
 I can't believe it.

590
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:56,380
 I can't believe it.

591
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,380
 I can't believe it.

592
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:58,380
 I can't believe it.

593
00:27:58,380 --> 00:27:59,380
 I can't believe it.

594
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:00,380
 I can't believe it.

595
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:01,380
 I can't believe it.

596
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:02,380
 We're late.

597
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:03,380
 We've been waiting for our tickets to arrive.

598
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:04,380
 It's just us.

599
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:06,380
 I have it. You have.

600
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:08,380
 No, baby, you are a good baby.

601
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:10,380
 You mean they've been here on our noses all the time?

602
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:12,380
 - Hey, Drey. - Well, Jean, where is Father?

603
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:13,380
 Where did you come from?

604
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:14,380
 I'm Henry.

605
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:16,380
 It's between the inside pocket and that jacket.

606
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:17,380
 - Quick. - To the inside pocket?

607
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:18,380
 Yes.

608
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:19,380
 Sweet pony.

609
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:21,380
 Probably as I don't have an inside pocket anymore.

610
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:24,380
 Henry, what have you done to my genitals?

611
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:26,380
 Father, why have you done the line?

612
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:29,380
 - And my speech, what's happened to it? - You really didn't find me?

613
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:30,380
 What have you got to do with it?

614
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:32,380
 I gave away two dollars to deliver your speech to.

615
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:33,380
 But where's Littie?

616
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:34,380
 I am.

617
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:35,380
 You let me in.

618
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,380
 Mary Chase, Mr. All, read my speech.

619
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:39,380
 Here, if you ask me, I'm entitled, "All were taught."

620
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:40,380
 Give it to my father, Willie.

621
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:42,380
 Quick, don't you realize he's late already?

622
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:45,380
 And they're how can I make a speech, nothing the way I do.

623
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:48,380
 You mean it matters how you're looking for all of this?

624
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:49,380
 Well, certainly it does.

625
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:51,380
 This is a very important affair.

626
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:53,380
 I've got to get another jacket somewhere.

627
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:57,380
 Father, I know one we might get, but it'll be expensive.

628
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:58,380
 Never mind that.

629
00:28:58,380 --> 00:28:59,380
 Just get it.

630
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:00,380
 Okay, father.

631
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:01,380
 Willie, would you be worrying to listen to me?

632
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:04,380
 Let me worry in the listen to an interesting proposition.

 Thanks a million to Henry Aldrich and family,

 and to Gloria de Haven and Frank Sinatra

637
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:25,180
 for coming along in this week's surprise practice.

638
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:28,020
 Well, we'll be seeing you again next week, gang,
