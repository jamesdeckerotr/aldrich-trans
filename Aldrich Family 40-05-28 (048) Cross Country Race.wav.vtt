 The Aldrich family, written by Clifford Goldsmith and starring Ezra Stone as Henry Aldrich,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 brought to you by the Puddings and our Tops in Tates,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:01:13.840
 Jello pudding. Do you remember when you were in your teens? Well, when you listened to Henry

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.480
 Aldrich and his pals we think you sort of be able to detect a little of yourself

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:24.200
 or Henry Aldrich is a typical American boy from a typical American family just

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.520
 listen and see if I'm not right it's six thirty in centerville and the scene

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:34.140
 opens with Henry taking dinner at the home of his pal busy Steven Mr.

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.840
 Stevens could I trouble you for the bread please oh yeah certainly Henry she was I

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.840
 I almost took two slices.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.840
 Well, wouldn't you like to take two?

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.840
 No, thank you. Never take more than one at a time.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.840
 Why only one, Henry?

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.840
 My mother has asked me not to, does he?

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.840
 Basil.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.840
 Yes, father.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.840
 Supposing you put back three of the four slices you took?

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.840
 Yes, sir.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:01.840
 And eat your broccoli.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.840
 Father, I don't like broccoli.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.840
 You aren't supposed to like it. Just eat it.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.840
 The only way I can make broccoli good down is with bread.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.340
 Mrs. Stevens, I'm very sorry to interrupt you, but could I have a second helping of broccoli

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:16.340
 good?

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:17.340
 Of course.

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.840
 Now that's the way I like to see a young man eat.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:20.840
 Thank you, Mrs. Stevens.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.640
 I just wish Basil had such nice table manners.

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.840
 I do, Mother, when I'm busy.

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:26.840
 Oh, yes.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.840
 But when I'm home, I like to relax.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:35.240
 And the only reason Henry is eating broccoli is so we can take Geraldine to the dance Saturday

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.240
 night.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.240
 Go to the dance with them unless you eat broccoli.

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:40.240
 She won't be able to.

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.240
 I see.

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.240
 That Mr. Stevens is why I have to have the typewriter.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:45.240
 The what?

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.240
 The typewriter.

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.240
 But I'm not worried.

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.240
 I'm almost positive I can get it.

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:52.240
 If I can only get the sleeping bag I need.

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.240
 A sleeping bag?

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.240
 Kind of a dance is this, Henry, a masquerade?

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:58.240
 Oh no, it's just a dance.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.240
 But before you can go to it, you have to eat broccoli

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.240
 and get a typewriter and a sleeping bag.

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:09.440
 Yes, sir. There's just one drawback. I can't get the bag if I don't pass my mathematics.

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.240
 Molly, may I have this all, please?

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.240
 Don't you understand, Father?

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.240
 That's why Henry has to win the cross-country race.

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:19.240
 Perfectly clear.

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.740
 Mrs. Stevens, do you understand?

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:22.740
 Well, it's entirely.

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:24.740
 There's just one point I missed.

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:26.240
 Which one was that?

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.240
 I don't know.

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:30.240
 I'll explain it to you again, Father.

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.240
 Eat your broccoli.

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:37.240
 Yes, sir. Mr. Stevens, I'm going to run an across-country race for Central High.

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:43.240
 And our track coach is my math teacher. That's why I have to win, or I don't pass my math.

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:47.240
 In which case you will or you won't need a sleeping bag.

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:48.240
 I will.

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:51.240
 Thank, will you have some more potatoes?

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.240
 I've lost my appetite.

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:56.240
 Didn't I tell you, Henry, you're too hard to understand?

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:01.240
 Father, if he doesn't pass in his math, his father won't give him his old sleeping bag.

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:06.700
 is that a punishment? If he doesn't give it to me, I won't be able to swap it for

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:12.600
 shorty woods as typewriter. In which case? In which case what Mr. Stevens? It's a

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:19.520
 field is choice. See the dance committee needs a typewriter and if I get the one

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:23.880
 they'll give me four tickets free. Oh well I'm glad you're that's true. Yeah and

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:28.200
 that's the only reason why Henry is eating his broccoli. My whole future depends on

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:32.560
 winning that race. That would be putting it mildly. Could I have some more please?

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:37.280
 Are you sure you're not eating too much there? Don't discourage him,

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.560
 Mother. I have just as much a steak on his winning as he has. Hey, Molly, don't ask

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.920
 Basel why. Well, it's just because... Well, it's just because... You don't want to know.

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:50.920
 But I want to... Yes, Mother. Would you like to have me tell you, Mrs. Stevens? No,

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:54.920
 Well then could I have a little more of everything please?

00:04:54.920 --> 00:05:11.920
 One, two, three, four, one, two.

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:16.920
 Let your knees high and we'll have to run like this even in a cross-country run, don't you want to develop?

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:17.920
 You want to develop?

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:19.920
 But this is going to over develop me.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:20.920
 One, two, three.

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:21.920
 Hiya.

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:22.920
 I've hit my chin.

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:23.920
 Dad.

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:24.920
 Wait a minute.

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:25.920
 Wait a minute, Henry.

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:26.920
 Basil?

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:28.920
 Are you in heavy upstairs?

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:29.920
 Yes, Mother.

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:31.920
 What are you doing?

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:33.920
 We're just talking a little something over.

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:37.920
 Well, is that noise you're making while you're talking necessary?

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:39.920
 I'm developing Henry.

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:42.920
 Why can't you develop him outdoors?

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:43.920
 It's raining.

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:49.300
 It's raining and besides if Henry would run on his toes as he should you wouldn't even hear him.

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.460
 Well, please ask him to.

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:53.260
 Get up Henry and start again.

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:54.100
 I'm quitting.

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:57.200
 You mustn't sit down Henry. Do you want to step him?

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.640
 I ate too much broccoli, does he?

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:03.580
 Besides, I don't think I'll ever be able to make time in your father's golf shoes.

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:04.900
 Why not?

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:07.380
 They weigh five pounds each.

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:08.980
 They've got spikes on the bottom.

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:12.060
 Sure they have. That's to give you a grip on the road.

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:15.960
 You want to go into a three and a half mile race slipping and sliding all over the course?

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:17.860
 I'm not in training anymore.

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:20.760
 So you don't want to go to the dance and take Geraldine.

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:24.060
 You don't even care whether you get the two tickets you promised to give me.

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:25.660
 No.

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:29.760
 Henry, do you realize what Middleton High did to us last year?

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:33.160
 The final score for the meet was 65 to nothing.

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:37.760
 But, Dizzy, why not leave our training and just let me go into the race fresh?

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:39.360
 Okay.

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:42.160
 Okay, if you know more about how to run them, I do.

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:43.160
 Okay then.

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:44.160
 Uh...

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:45.760
 Alright.

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:48.260
 What is it I have to do next?

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.460
 You have to run up and down the front stairs.

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:51.460
 But quietly.

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:53.060
 Were these shoes on?

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:55.860
 You will hate the stairs I spread newspapers on each step.

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:58.360
 I'm not gonna do it.

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:01.860
 Look, I'll go to the trouble of timing you with my watch.

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:04.860
 Come on, just five times down and five times up.

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:07.360
 Okay, five times but no more.

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:08.860
 Okay, get on your mark, Henry.

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:11.000
 Yeah, and remember the old toes.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.220
 Keep up on my toes.

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:13.180
 You're going down?

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:14.300
 It'll strengthen them.

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:15.900
 Oh, get on your mark.

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:17.180
 Yeah, get set.

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:19.220
 Go.

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:20.620
 What's the matter, Henry?

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:23.580
 There's one step there that doesn't have a piece of paper on it.

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:25.260
 Well, skip that one.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:26.620
 Come on, get on your mark.

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:27.460
 Get set.

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:27.960
 Go.

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:29.260
 I'm off.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:30.620
 Come on, Henry.

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:31.620
 Let her out.

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:33.140
 Come on, let's see what you can do.

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:34.900
 Now, come on, back up.

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:36.460
 Middleton's right behind you.

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:37.620
 She's posing in on you.

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:38.780
 She's gaining.

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:42.140
 You're crazy as to! Now stop down again!

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:44.780
 I know! What's going on here?

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:46.940
 Little town's starting to pass 'em!

00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:48.540
 Well, come down here!

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:50.940
 Oh, oh, oh! So my head!

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:58.540
 What is this?

00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:01.500
 Can we now look what you've done to the spass?

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:16.500
 [Music]

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:20.500
 But father, I'm not asking you to get track shoes and track pants for me.

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:21.500
 I thought you were.

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:24.500
 Oh no, you'd really be getting them for Central High.

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:25.500
 I see.

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:29.500
 Mr. Always, you realize that last year every men on the Middletown High School team

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:33.660
 school team finished before any of ours did. Did they? And we certainly don't want to

00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:37.860
 thing like that to repeat itself. Gee, after all, a thing like that involves

00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:41.900
 everybody in town. Everybody's pride is hurt. I see.

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:45.940
 Perhaps I could get the Chamber of Commerce to buy Henry's outfit.

00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:49.980
 Well, I'll certainly be handicapped if I have to run in any old thing.

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:53.980
 If worse came to worse, Mr. Orwood, you'll be willing to buy Henry just ordinary

00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:57.520
 sneakers. Didn't Henry tell you why I can't buy

00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:00.660
 Henry, if I were you, I wouldn't

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:02.660
 swing those Indian clubs here in the living room.

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:05.060
 Yes, Father, I didn't even realize I was.

00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:06.780
 You're not to swing them in this house.

00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:07.700
 No, Father.

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:10.460
 Henry, which way has your father decided

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:12.100
 regarding the other question?

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:15.580
 I've decided he may have neither shoes nor a suit.

00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:17.740
 I'm quite sure Henry understands why.

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:19.860
 Did you disobey your father, Henry?

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:21.980
 You were playing catch right out in front of a house.

00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:23.380
 Weren't you, son?

00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:24.020
 Yes, sir.

00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:25.340
 And I told you that if you didn't go,

00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:27.940
 Some other place should have an accident, didn't I?

00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:29.140
 Yes, sir.

00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:30.540
 Well, then.

00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:32.340
 What happened, Henry?

00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:34.940
 The ball went through this living room window.

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:36.140
 Yes.

00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:38.940
 And father was sitting right beside it.

00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:40.540
 Oh.

00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:43.340
 Father, I know I should be punished, but

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:46.540
 think of how I'll feel when I have to tell them at school.

00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:48.740
 Henry, let's not mention the subject again.

00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:50.340
 She was what's all that doing?

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:51.340
 Now, sir, I know.

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:53.540
 Well, it's something...

00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:55.940
 Now, here I go, Ben.

00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:59.840
 I know I've got the windows, I'm having a rally for the fact that it's tomorrow.

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:00.940
 Come on, let's go up.

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:03.340
 You go, Jesse, I'm going to stay here.

00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:06.940
 There goes Paul, how can you think I want him to see me?

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:09.540
 Which is more important, son.

00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:12.940
 Winning that race tomorrow or building some character in the year to come?

00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:15.040
 I suppose building some character.

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:19.840
 Mr. Orr, do you know if it would help me in the year 35 cents, I'd be willing to put towards a parish use.

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:21.340
 It's not a question of money.

00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:23.540
 Well, Henry, why aren't you in busy out with the crowd?

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:30.740
 Why should I mother father doesn't care whether I win or not Henry that isn't exactly fair is this still about track shoes?

00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:36.040
 Yes, mother. What do you think about it? I agree entirely with your father. You do mother. I'm sorry

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:41.500
 Come on, does he let's go upstairs? I guess the only thing to do Henry is train all the heart

00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:44.080
 I've trained to the breaking point as it is

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:50.240
 Sam well, I couldn't be let Henry get what he needs after we've told him he can't but Sam

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:52.540
 You've always wanted Henry to go in for our sledding.

00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:55.540
 Well, he may still go in, but he must also learn to obey.

00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:57.240
 But he always does obey.

00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:00.240
 Oh, every boy his age forgets now and then, dear.

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:03.840
 Very well, supposing we let him get some shoes and pants.

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:05.240
 How are we going to take faith?

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:08.240
 Oh, we can make out that came from Aunt Harriet or someone.

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:10.740
 I'm not so sure, Alice, we should do it.

00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:14.740
 Name one time Henry has recently deliberately disobeyed you.

00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:16.240
 When he threw that ball through the window.

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:17.740
 Oh, I mean one other time.

00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:19.740
 What's that?

00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:21.740
 It's an Indian club coming downstairs.

00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:22.740
 Yes.

00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:23.740
 Henry Orange.

00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:25.740
 I didn't realize it was going to slip, Father.

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:29.740
 Didn't I ask you only five minutes ago not to swing those clubs in this house?

00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:32.740
 Did that include the second floor?

00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:35.740
 Is the second floor in this house?

00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:36.740
 Yes.

00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:38.740
 Is there any reason you can't train out on the porch?

00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:39.740
 No, sir.

00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:40.740
 What's the trouble, Henry?

00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:41.740
 Come on down, Dizzy.

00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:42.740
 Okay.

00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:44.180
 What's the trouble, Henry?

00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:45.940
 Come on down, Dizzy.

00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:47.700
 OK.

00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:49.620
 Does your father want to speak to me, too?

00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:52.420
 Come on out onto the porch, Dizzy.

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:54.180
 Sam, may I speak with you in the living room?

00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:55.100
 I certainly do.

00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:57.060
 Mrs. Aldridge, were you speaking to me?

00:11:57.060 --> 00:11:57.700
 No, Dizzy.

00:11:57.700 --> 00:11:59.540
 I'm saying something to Mr. Aldridge.

00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:02.340
 Oh, excuse me.

00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:03.180
 Hey, Henry, wait.

00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:04.660
 I'll go out with you.

00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:06.540
 We can practice out here on the porch.

00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:07.740
 You hear what I heard?

00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:08.180
 Why?

00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:09.620
 Your mother said something to your father

00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:12.020
 that makes me think she's going to bring him around to your side.

00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:14.020
 Yeah, I think he's gonna work on it.

00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:17.020
 Boy, if you even get a pair of sneakers, you can't lose that race.

00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:19.020
 Look, Tizzy, look in the window.

00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:21.020
 Sure, they're talking it over. Your mother's even laughing.

00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:22.020
 Gee, maybe it's all set.

00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:24.020
 Come on, Henry, let's get back to work.

00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:25.020
 Yeah, what do I do now?

00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:26.020
 The whole routine.

00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:27.020
 Raise your Indian clubs.

00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:28.020
 Okay.

00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:29.020
 Out straight.

00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:30.020
 Begin.

00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:34.020
 Two, three, four, one, two, three.

00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:39.020
 - Oh gee, where's my club slipped?

00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:40.020
 - Henry Ora!

00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:43.020
 - I've gotta go home, Henry.

00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:46.020
 Is anybody hurt, Father?

00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:49.020
 - Not yet, but when you please come in the house.

00:12:49.020 --> 00:13:05.020
 [Music]

00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:12.020
 Well friends, it's just about time for Henry's High School and other high schools and colleges to hold their mid-year graduating exercises

00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:15.020
 and award prizes for various scholastic attainments.

00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:22.020
 And speaking of honors being presented, that reminds us of another honor being awarded every day in thousands of homes all over the country.

00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:25.020
 It's an honor that might be presented in the following words.

00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:37.020
 Ladies and gentlemen, for rich mellow flavor, for smooth, creamy goodness, and for all around satisfaction, we proudly present the award,

00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:45.020
 The award, not of cum laude, magna cum laude, but summa cum laude to jello chocolate pudding.

00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:49.020
 And we designate it most likely to succeed.

00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:55.020
 As folks, jello chocolate pudding certainly does carry off top honors when it comes to real downright goodness.

00:13:55.020 --> 00:14:01.020
 It's a swell luscious pudding, velvety smooth through and through, just the way a perfect pudding should be.

00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:05.020
 And yellow chocolate pudding is simply unaccelled for rich chocolatey flavor.

00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:10.020
 A chocolate flavor developed especially for Jell-O by the famous Walter Baker Company.

00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:13.020
 So try this mellow treat real soon, won't you?

00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:20.020
 You'll find that in your family too, they dessert most likely to succeed is Jell-O chocolate pudding.

00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:36.020
 [Music]

00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:41.620
 Now getting back to Henry Aldrich, Henry is to run for Central High in a cross-country race.

00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:46.120
 Unfortunately, when we left him, he had neither track shoes nor a track suit.

00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:49.120
 As we return we find him warming up at the starting line.

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:56.120
 Yeah! Yeah! Come on. Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

00:14:56.120 --> 00:15:03.120
 How are the shoes, Henry? Well, let's see you running them.

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:06.120
 Well, I'm glad your father let me borrow these golf shoes.

00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:08.120
 I thought you said they were too big for you.

00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:10.120
 I've got three pairs of socks on.

00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:12.120
 How about using your own head?

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:13.120
 How do you feel, boy?

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:15.120
 I guess I never felt better in my life.

00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:19.200
 Well, see that's a great idea of your wearing your swimming suit

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:31.160
 Dizzy that was for me the whole school's in fact of you it's up to you Henry don't worry about me

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:35.000
 Boy, did you hear Gwenlyn yell out like that?

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:41.340
 Did you see that Middleton team over there if I can't pass them I'm gonna give up running the main thing is do you understand?

00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:44.020
 Where the course goes sure yeah, well where does it go?

00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:47.100
 We start right here at Scott's corners and follow the main highway

00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:49.760
 Intercentible till we come to the big four huh yeah

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:54.500
 Well, do you turn to the left or to the right to the left anyone knows that that's the shortest way in the town

00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:59.780
 Okay, but remember you don't go to the right and listen Henry if you can't start right with a gun

00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:04.820
 Remember this is a three and a half mile race if you can get a quick start you're in

00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:09.080
 I thought you didn't want me to take the lead take it until you can jockey for position

00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:16.100
 After that whole back say yeah save yourself. Oh sure and don't try to pass whoever grabs a lead

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:22.180
 It's a come on they always put a spritter in their purposely to tie here. Hello Henry. She was Geraldine

00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:28.440
 I'm going up to the finish line Henry. Are we going to the dance tonight? Sure if I win this race and pass in my math

00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:36.260
 I am and Geraldine will you promise to save all your dances for me? Oh Henry of course. I was all right. Who's calling me? All right?

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:37.260
 Come here.

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:39.260
 Oh, Gee, did you want me, Coach?

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:40.260
 Oh, you do.

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:42.260
 Oh, Gee, Coach, I could race 10 miles.

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:43.260
 Fine.

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:45.260
 Now, I'll tell you what I want you to do.

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:46.260
 Yes, Coach.

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:47.260
 Central is got to win, see?

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:48.260
 Yes, Coach.

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:51.260
 But you and Erwin Cooper are the only two I can spare for this race.

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:52.260
 Yes, Coach.

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:54.260
 And there will be six running against you from middle town.

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:55.260
 Yes, Coach.

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:57.260
 The whole thing is up to you.

00:16:57.260 --> 00:16:58.260
 Yes, Coach.

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:00.260
 Now, here's the dope.

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:02.260
 Take the lead right at the start.

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:03.260
 Yes, Coach.

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:05.260
 Run those six boys from middle town right off their feet.

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:10.560
 Yes, Coach, and then when you shot everything you've got, Erwin Cooper has been holding back.

00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:12.460
 We'll come forward and win the race.

00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:13.060
 Yes, Coach.

00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:15.760
 I don't win it?

00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:18.260
 Well, after all, isn't this for the school?

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:19.860
 Yes, Coach.

00:17:19.860 --> 00:17:26.460
 This isn't the time to ask it, but could you tell me if I passed my math exam?

00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:29.260
 I'll let you know about that when the race is old.

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:29.760
 [whistle]

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:30.260
 Now?

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:32.260
 There's a two-minute signal.

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:35.820
 I'll go in there and give everything you've got.

00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:37.660
 Okay, Coach, you see, with...

00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:38.460
 Henry!

00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:39.360
 What do you have, Mother?

00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:41.260
 Don't you think you ought to be wearing a coat, dear?

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:43.060
 Mother, don't embarrass me.

00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:44.660
 Good luck, son.

00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:47.260
 Thanks, Father. Only I can't win the race.

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:49.060
 They aren't going to let me.

00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:50.860
 If you see Geraldine, will you tell her?

00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:51.960
 Oh, you'll win it.

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:53.560
 They don't want me to.

00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:55.260
 Your mother and I are going to get in the car

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:56.760
 and drive on up the road away.

00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:58.360
 Henry! Henry!

00:17:58.360 --> 00:17:59.660
 What do you think has happened?

00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:00.160
 Why?

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:02.660
 Everyone Cooper just turned his knee and he can't run.

00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:05.060
 I mean I'm the only one running for a special ride.

00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:06.660
 Well, where are you everyone?

00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:08.260
 Popeyes can line up here.

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:09.660
 Oh, stay, stay, stay!

00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:10.660
 Hey!

00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:12.860
 You still want me to take the lead?

00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:14.260
 Oh, do whatever you can.

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:15.660
 Just get him there and run.

00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:17.060
 Yes, coach, sure.

00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:18.060
 Line up, boys.

00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:19.060
 Yay!

00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:20.060
 Tickle!

00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:21.060
 Tickle!

00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:22.060
 Tickle!

00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:23.060
 Oh, hey!

00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:25.060
 Get on your mark!

00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:26.060
 Hey!

00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:27.060
 Get, cut!

00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:28.060
 Kill him, Henry!

00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:30.060
 What's happening?

00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:31.060
 Henry, get on!

00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:32.060
 Oh, my friend!

00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:35.060
 I'm going to go on, honey. I'll follow you on my bicycle.

00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:37.060
 I don't have to go fair with me, this thing.

00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:40.060
 You're doing great, boy. I am? Yeah.

00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:42.060
 Could you put on just a little steam?

00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:45.060
 The six middles and guys have already rounded the turn.

00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:48.060
 I'm holding back on purpose. Oh, that's using the old head.

00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:50.060
 I've got it all figured out, sure.

00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:53.060
 But don't you think you ought to run a little faster?

00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:55.060
 Don't talk to me so much.

00:18:55.060 --> 00:18:57.060
 Darn it all anyhow. What's the matter?

00:18:57.060 --> 00:18:59.060
 My shoe string busting.

00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:01.060
 What difference does that make?

00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:02.460
 Come on, keep going, Henry.

00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:05.060
 I can't run with my shoe half, or...

00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:06.660
 There, I kicked it off.

00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:08.060
 And now you're coming.

00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:11.060
 Look up ahead, they're less than a quarter of a mile in the lead.

00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:15.260
 I'll never be able to catch them in one shoe,

00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:18.060
 but you've got that much less to carry than they have, haven't you?

00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:22.060
 Yeah, but look, take the other one off and you won't have anything holding you back.

00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:23.060
 Okay.

00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:24.060
 Well, I...

00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:26.060
 ...take it off.

00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:28.060
 You'll keep your eye on Middletown.

00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:32.740
 I'm watching them I won't let them get out of your sight all you have to do now

00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:37.580
 are sprint alone you pass them in no time oh boy does that feel good watch me

00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:43.180
 go oh aren't you glad you took them off Henry

00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:49.160
 time at stone any hour when we got you got a run on gravel for the next two

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:54.660
 miles that's going to help there's the I'll never be able to catch up with them

00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:56.660
 Well get over and earn him the ditch.

00:19:56.660 --> 00:19:58.660
 Yeah, that's an idea.

00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:01.660
 Oh gee whiz, why didn't you tell me there was water in here?

00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:02.660
 Well get out.

00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:05.660
 I'm certainly glad I wore my bathing suit.

00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:07.660
 Look at them up ahead.

00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:08.660
 I've got an idea Henry.

00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:09.660
 You keep on running, say.

00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:10.660
 Where are you going?

00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:13.660
 I'm coming up in the back and say this baby, where are you going?

 [Music]

00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:30.660
 Sam, how many have gone by so far?

00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:31.660
 Six.

00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:33.660
 How many are there in the race?

00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:34.660
 Seven.

00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:39.660
 Are you sure Henry wasn't one of the first to pass?

00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:43.000
 I certainly haven't seen anyone go buy in a red bathing suit.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.860
 Come over the coach is having him hold back.

00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:48.760
 - Hold back. - Uh-huh.

00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:51.860
 - Well, what's the sense in that? - Strategy, Alice.

00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:55.100
 You save yourself till the finish and then you put on a burst of speed.

00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:58.260
 Well, isn't that smart of Henry to think of it?

00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:01.160
 Oh, here he comes at it. He's coming around the curve.

00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:05.560
 - On a bicycle? - Oh, no, no. That's strange. That's dizzy.

00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:08.060
 - Miss Aldrich! Miss Aldrich! - Miss Aldrich!

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:10.160
 Did he have something happened to Henry?

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:11.660
 He lost his shoes.

00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:12.660
 What was that?

00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:14.960
 He's roaming in the stocking's feet on gravel

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:16.660
 and Mr. Orbridge needs some sneakers.

00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:18.660
 Well, we couldn't possibly get any sneakers now.

00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:19.760
 Sure, we can get some.

00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:21.360
 It's only a minute up to the store.

00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:23.360
 Well, all right. Hurry up. Get in the car.

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:24.660
 Okay.

00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:27.160
 Then I thought you said it was Roy and Henry's character

00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:28.160
 if we buy shoes.

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:30.960

 Henry, don't those shoes make a difference?

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:54.960
 Hey Henry!

00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:57.960
 I can hear you.

00:21:57.960 --> 00:21:59.960
 I can't speak.

00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:01.960
 Put on the steam boy.

00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:02.800
 Yeah.

00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:06.360
 Let me get on your bicycle, would you?

00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:08.760
 You're not gonna quit, are you?

00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:12.120
 What's the use of my keeping on?

00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:18.040
 The rest of it already finished and the crowd's probably going home.

00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:22.440
 But, Henry, no matter how tired you may be, you should always finish your race.

00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:24.760
 You've only got another quarter of a mile.

00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:27.920
 I don't care whether I pass my math.

00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:31.480
 I don't even care whether I take Gerald into the dance.

00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:35.480
 But the one central high to go down in history is not finishing this race.

00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:37.480
 Oh, I'll finish.

00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:40.480
 But I hope there's nobody there to see me.

 Don't show me that way.

 Oh, come on, everybody.

00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:14.480

 You're fine!

00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:56.480
 Sam, I think this is the grandest idea you had.

00:23:56.480 --> 00:24:00.480
 I had our dropping in for a few minutes and watching the young people dance.

00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:03.480
 And there will probably be the hero of the ball.

00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:06.480
 Oh, my goodness, has he been busy today?

00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:12.480
 First he won that race and then after getting his mark in mathematics he had to exchange the sleeping bag you gave him for the typewriter

00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:16.480
 so he could get the tickets and take Geraldine. I should think he'd be exhausted.

00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:21.480
 Here we are. I'll open the door.

00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:23.480
 Oh, thank you.

00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:24.480

00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:25.480
 Well...

00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:31.900
 You don't suppose Henry's winning that cross-country race had anything to do with his getting 98 and mathematics do you?

00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:36.320
 Why no no it couldn't have

00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:44.520
 No Alice. I've decided that boy has character. Yes character as I'm really encouraged. Come on. Let's go into

 Have you any idea where Henry could be?

00:24:57.660 --> 00:24:59.160
 What do you mean there?

00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:00.160
 Why he disappeared?

00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:01.660
 Nobody can find him.

00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:03.160
 What do you mean he disappeared?

00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:05.660
 Well, he brought me to the dance and nobody seen him since.

00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:07.160
 I haven't even danced with you.

00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:08.160
 No.

00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:10.660
 I've just been sitting and waiting and waiting.

00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:12.660
 Then what are you supposed to have to happen?

00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:14.160
 Hey, Mr. and Mrs. Aldrich.

00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:15.160
 Hey, Dizzy.

00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:16.660
 Dizzy, have you seen Henry?

00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:18.660
 I've been trying to find him.

00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:19.660
 Oh, my goodness.

00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:21.660
 Maybe Middletown's kidnapper.

00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:22.160
 Why?

00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:25.360
 Boy, they were certainly very indignant when he won that race.

00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:28.260
 I know who might know where he is.

00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:28.760
 Who?

00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:29.560
 The coach.

00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:31.960
 He's down in the basement sneaking a smoke.

00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:33.860
 Come on with me, Geraldine.

00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:34.560
 Oh, I did.

00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:35.960
 Will you come back and tell her?

00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:38.560
 Look out for these stairs, Geraldine.

00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:39.160
 Oh, did he?

00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:41.660
 Do you think Middletell really has done anything to him?

00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:43.360
 Come on around the landing here.

00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:46.360
 If they've even touched them, we'll get them.

00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:48.560
 Well, she lives.

00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:49.760

00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:51.260
 Do you see what I see?

00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:51.960
 What?

00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:55.960
 Henry! He's gone to sleep right here on the stairs.

00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:57.960
 He's gone to sleep.

00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:00.960
 Oh, so that's all he cared about bringing me.

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:01.960
 Hey, Henry.

00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:03.960
 Don't wake him. I'm going upstairs.

00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:04.960
 Hey, Henry!

00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:07.960
 I'm going upstairs with any night, please.

00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:12.960
 Henry, well, move over, Blam, tired too.

00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:32.960
 [Music]

00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:38.560
 Tomorrow night for dinner ladies and gentlemen, how about serving a dessert wonderfully easy to make?

00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:41.560
 Yes and believe me mighty easy to take too.

00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:45.560
 The dessert I'm thinking about, of course, is jello vanilla pudding.

00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:50.560
 Served as is or mixed with bananas or any other fruits or nuts you may have, handy,

00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:54.560
 jello vanilla pudding is a perfectly grand treat that the whole family will love,

00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:57.560
 and they'll want to enjoy it again and again.

00:26:57.560 --> 00:26:59.560
 It takes only a few brief moments to prepare.

00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:02.560
 It's very simple and it's quite inexpensive.

00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:05.560
 Yet few desserts, no matter how costly or complicated,

00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:09.560
 can rival jello vanilla pudding for gratifying goodness.

00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:11.560
 It has a flavor that is really swell,

00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:16.560
 a rich delicate flavor that you'll find supreme for sheer satisfaction.

00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:19.560
 So enjoy some jello vanilla pudding tomorrow,
