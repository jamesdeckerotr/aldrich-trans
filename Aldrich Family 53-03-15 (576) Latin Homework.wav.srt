 In just a minute, it's the Aldrich family on NBC.

 Academy Award time is with us again, and it's the period of the year when everyone is wondering who will win the Oscar.

3
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:16,860
 Why don't you listen to the Academy Award presentation next Thursday night on NBC and find out?

4
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:20,980
 Of course, each weekday NBC brings great listening into your home, too.

11
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:48,540
 [music]

12
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:50,980
 Henry! Henry Aldridge!

13
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:51,820
 Homming mother!

14
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:57,060
 [applause]

15
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:02,060
 Yes, it's the Orange Family is transcribed written by Clifford Goldsmith.

16
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:22,060
 Whatever your teenage years were, hectic, adventuresome, or shining,

17
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:25,560
 you can never forget them. They're an important part of you.

18
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:32,360
 And whenever you go back to them in memory, you'll always find a typical boy like Henry Aldridge right in the middle of them.

19
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:36,360
 The scene opens at the Aldridge telephone. The time is evening.

20
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,360
 Hello? Hello, is this Lucy Smith?

21
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,360
 Lucy, this is Henry. Did I play any chance to leave my Latin book at your house this afternoon?

22
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,960
 - No, it's not me, Henry. - Well, you sure I didn't leave it out in your kitchen?

23
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,560
 - No, no. - Well, as your mother's been in or around your refrigerator lately,

24
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:55,160
 - Henry, ask her whether she's seen my Latin book too. - Homer, keep quiet.

25
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,520
 Hello Lucy, look if you do find one could you give me a ring?

26
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,960
 Henry, does she think she can find?

27
00:01:58,960 --> 00:01:59,960
 Goodbye.

28
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:04,160
 Homer, do you realize that whenever I talk on the phone all you do is stand there and ask questions?

29
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,160
 Well, she was. You never tell me anything.

30
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,560
 Who are you gonna call next?

31
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,560
 Never mind.

32
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,060
 Hello?

33
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,960
 Oh, Henry, can't you tell me who?

34
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:11,760
 Number three.

35
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,760
 Operator, give me Elm.

36
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,360
 Two, two, seven.

37
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,160
 Elm, two, seven.

38
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:16,760
 Henry?

39
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,560
 Mother, I think I'm on the trail. You just go on reading your paper.

40
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,560
 Henry, do you mean to say you haven't found your Latin book yet?

41
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,160
 Well, not yet exactly, Mother.

42
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,760
 Well, you better not let your father here, you haven't found it.

43
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,160
 Well, there isn't anything to worry about, Mrs. Aldridge.

44
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,560
 It'd be different if we didn't know where we went today.

45
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,060
 Just the same, Henry. Better find it in the hurry.

46
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:37,060
 Hello, Aunt Harriet, this is Henry.

47
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:40,560
 Henry, you're nephew. Don't you remember Aunt Harriet?

48
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,560
 Oh, yeah. Hello.

49
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,560
 Hello.

50
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,560
 Look, have you happened by any chance to see Cicero around your house?

51
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,560
 Oh.

52
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,560
 Cicero, yet we've been studying him this year.

53
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,560
 Oh, you mean the old cook-call must have been...

54
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,060
 That was just a minute.

55
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:57,060
 Homer, what does our Latin book look like?

56
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:59,060
 What do you mean? Like a book?

57
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:01,560
 What color? What color?

58
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,060
 Uh... is it black?

59
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:06,560
 Black? I thought it was sort of...

60
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,560
 It's sort of... Henry, it's brown, isn't it?

61
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,060
 A nice sort of brown with Cicero printed on it.

62
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:13,560
 Hello, Aunt Harriet Brown! And there were two of them.

63
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,560
 Homer's in mind.

64
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,060
 Has she stained them, Henry?

65
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:19,560
 Well, have you been in or around your refrigerator lately?

66
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,400
 - I don't know how to sound in Sanfield.

67
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,240
 - Hmm.

68
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,600
 I'll ask you whether she's had her dinner yet.

69
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,440
 Thanks, Aunt Harriet, goodbye.

70
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,360
 - Henry.

71
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,080
 - Homer, be looking up another number.

72
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:29,920
 - Henry.

73
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,760
 - Yes, father?

74
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,840
 - You and Homer still out there at that four.

75
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,280
 - Henry, I think I'll go outside

76
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,840
 and sit on the front porch for more.

77
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,680
 - Yeah, but Homer.

78
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,520
 - Henry.

79
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,000
 - Yes, father, just a minute.

80
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,840
 - Number three.

81
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,960
 - It's just a question at time,

82
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,520
 and I'll have the darn thing.

83
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,640
 - Number three.

84
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,920
 - Operator, give me M34.

85
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,320
 - M34.

86
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,160
 - Yes, please.

87
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:52,680
 trouble is Henry that you don't pay attention to anything you do. There it is

88
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:56,720
 the night before you have to get an 88 an examination to bring your average up

89
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,120
 to Paris. Father I don't like to contradict you but all I need to pull me

90
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:04,120
 through is a flat 85. I spent nearly an hour this afternoon figuring it out. Hello

91
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:07,760
 Eleanor this is Henry. Instead of figuring out a thing like that you should have

92
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,120
 been looking for your Latin. Yeah just a minute Eleanor. Sure Father I agree with

93
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:16,600
 you absolutely. Eleanor have you seen my Latin book? Has she? Yes I mean no I mean

94
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:20,940
 Eleanor, when we were in your kitchen and we put the ice tray back, did we put anything

95
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,240
 else in with it?

96
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,700
 Well, like a Cicero.

97
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:27,340
 What'd you do this afternoon?

98
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:29,500
 Visit every refrigerator in town?

99
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,900
 Oh, well, goodbye, Father.

100
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:32,900
 I mean, Eleanor.

101
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:36,540
 You see that, Henry, your mind is known as single thing you do.

102
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:39,260
 Father, this isn't a result of anything my mind did.

103
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:40,260
 I agree.

104
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:41,260
 It's what your mind doesn't do.

105
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:43,780
 You have a father, don't you see?

106
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:46,300
 There's a swell chance they may not even need my Latin book tonight.

107
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,300
 Why not?

108
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:50,300
 Because I'm not even sure we're going to have an exam tomorrow.

109
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,300
 What do you mean by that?

110
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:58,300
 Well, Homer, isn't there a possibility that we don't have an exam until day after tomorrow?

111
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,300
 And you've asked me that three times.

112
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:04,300
 Miss Wheeler said it was tomorrow's second period, and that's all there is to it.

113
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:08,300
 Are you sure, Homer? Because my father's standing right here.

114
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,720
 (jazz music)

115
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:25,800
 - Quos qua tandam avu terri cottalina potientia nostra.

116
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,880
 There Homer, what does that mean?

117
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,140
 - Go on and finish it.

118
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:32,060
 - I have finished it.

119
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:36,540
 - Quos qua tandam avu terri cottalina potientia nostra.

120
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:41,140
 That means Homer, how long will you abuse our patients o' cattle line?

121
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,140
 It does?

122
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:43,140
 Sure.

123
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:44,140
 Now can you give it to me?

124
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:45,140
 Sure.

125
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:47,140
 O' cattle line?

126
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:48,140
 O' cattle line?

127
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:52,740
 And could you read it again please?

128
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:53,740
 The whole thing?

129
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:54,740
 Well of course not the whole thing.

130
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:55,740
 Do you think I'm dumb?

131
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,940
 Just give me the first word.

132
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:00,140
 Quose Quay, Quose Quay.

133
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:02,940
 Oh yes, Quose Quay.

134
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:04,740
 Look Homer.

135
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,860
 Does this give you any hint as to what it is?

136
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:09,260
 When you measure something, what's the first thing you want to know?

137
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,540
 Where's the ruler?

138
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:12,060
 [LAUGHTER]

139
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,740
 No, Homer.

140
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,020
 You're supposing you've got the ruler.

141
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,780
 What's the next thing you want to know?

142
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:18,300
 What is it you ask yourself?

143
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,700
 Henry, are you sure that Cicero you're reading?

144
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:21,580
 Sure, Homer.

145
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:23,140
 Sure, it's your own book.

146
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:26,420
 Didn't my mother just find it down in the preserved closet?

147
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:30,140
 Now, listen carefully and see whether this brings back anything.

148
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:33,180
 Quosqué tandem avu tare.

149
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:35,180
 Give me one more clue.

150
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:38,180
 Homer, if I give you any more, I'll have given you the whole thing.

151
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,180
 No, I won't.

152
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,180
 He won't.

153
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:41,180
 I won't.

154
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,180
 The Caroline is measuring something.

155
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,180
 I know that.

156
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:44,180
 No, Homer.

157
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:46,180
 Listen, how long are you going to hold out on me?

158
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:48,180
 Homer, you got the whole thing.

159
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,180
 What whole thing?

160
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,180
 He just said it.

161
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:53,180
 How long will you abuse our patients' Caroline?

162
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,180
 Well, Henry, I knew that part all right.

163
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,180
 But is that all there is to us?

164
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,180
 Sure.

165
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:58,180
 It's as easy as rolling off the log.

166
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:59,180
 Henry!

167
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,180
 Let's not talk so loud.

168
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:02,180
 Homer, my folks have gone to bed.

169
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:03,180
 Now for the next one.

170
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:05,180
 -Henny, are you sure tomorrow's exam cup

171
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:06,180
 is the first for your raisins?

172
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:08,180
 -Well, I heard her say the first three.

173
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:12,180
 Now listen, Abbott excessive evasive eruptment.

174
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:14,180
 -Why, uh...

175
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:15,180
 Why, uh...

176
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,180
 -I remember it means he departed.

177
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:18,180
 He withdrew. He went out. He broke four.

178
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,180
 -Sure. That's just what I was going to say.

179
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:22,180
 -You're crazy.

180
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,180
 -I am not. I knew it all the time.

181
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,180
 -All right. I'll read it again.

182
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,180
 -Aboard excessive evasive eruptment.

183
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,180
 What does it mean?

184
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,180
 -What's so tough about that?

185
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:30,180
 -All right. Tell me what it means.

186
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:31,180
 -Sure.

187
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:34,180
 He came in, he fell down, he got up, he fell down again.

188
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:39,540
 Now is that someone calling?

189
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:40,700
 No, I don't think so.

190
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:43,380
 Well, okay, shoot me another, I'm getting hot.

191
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,140
 Henry, do you realize what time it is?

192
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,580
 What time, mother?

193
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,700
 Good, it's just a little after 10, isn't it?

194
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,540
 It's 20 minutes to 12.

195
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:53,340
 And you promised me that if I let home

196
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:56,060
 a stay here overnight, you'd behave yourselves.

197
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:58,260
 But mother, all we've been doing is sitting here quietly

198
00:07:58,260 --> 00:07:59,100
 with Cicero.

199
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,340
 Sure, Mrs. Aldrich.

200
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:03,140
 I'm sorry, but you were talking as loud as you could.

201
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:04,780
 And what's more, it doesn't seem to me

202
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:07,260
 that you should have to study as late as this.

203
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:09,300
 But, mother, you have no idea what a stiff exam

204
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,420
 Miss Wheeler can do.

205
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:12,740
 Well, it shouldn't be stiff if you'd paid attention.

206
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,940
 Alice, will you please come to bed?

207
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:17,300
 Sam, I'm talking to the boys.

208
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,860
 I'd like to get back to sleep.

209
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:22,020
 Mother, I have paid attention, but Miss Wheeler

210
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,020
 doubled cross this.

211
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:24,340
 I'll say she did.

212
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:26,420
 What do you mean she doubled cross to?

213
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:28,700
 Mother, she stood up in class after we're almost

214
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:31,060
 through with the last three orations of Cicero

215
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,460
 and announces that the examination

216
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:33,700
 will cover the first three.

217
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:36,500
 - Sure, and we haven't looked at those since last term.

218
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,780
 - And she didn't give you any advance warning?

219
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:41,660
 - No, Mrs. Olives, not since since February.

220
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:42,820
 - Sure.

221
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:45,700
 And here we are stuck when we oughta be in bed.

222
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:46,940
 - How did they go to bed?

223
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,740
 - Yes, ma'am, he's going.

224
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:50,580
 - But, mother, don't you realize that if we don't study

225
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:53,260
 this our whole year's work will be in vain?

226
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:55,260
 And father, you know what father's gonna do.

227
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,620
 - But Henry-- - And Mrs. Olives,

228
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:59,120
 This is one course I don't want to have to take over again.

229
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,280
 - Oh, man.

230
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,000
 - I'd like to say something to both of you.

231
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,880
 - But listen, mother--

232
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,960
 - Now wait, Henry, let me explain this to her.

233
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:26,580
 (

234
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:28,580

235
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:30,680
 Good that's well now about

236
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:36,580
 Homer Homer you asleep listen Henry stop shaking me so loud home

237
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:41,220
 Do you want to wait my folks I wasn't talking loud well you are now and it's ten minutes to two

238
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:44,060
 Okay

239
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:46,060
 Give me that sentence again

240
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:52,860
 Homer what we be sensible. Why don't you set the alarm for seven o'clock and finish in the morning?

241
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:56,000
 Homer

242
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 Homer, do you realize you've got your head right in the middle of my collection of rocks?

243
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 [laughter]

244
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 And Homer, some of those are valuable.

245
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 [laughter]

246
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 But, uh, give me that sentence again, Henry.

247
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 Didn't you hear what I said, Homer?

248
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 Rocky, oh, what?

249
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 [laughter]

250
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 I said, "Let's quit and go down and get something to eat."

251
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 Oh, boy!

252
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 Do you have any breakfast cereal? You know, the kind I like?

253
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 Sure.

254
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 I think I'll have some myself.

255
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 We'll put your milk on it.

256
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 And cream.

257
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 Er, wait till I set this alarm for seven.

258
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,500
 Listen, honey, how about setting it for five after seven?

259
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,500
 I need the sleep.

260
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,000
 Homer, we've got work to do.

261
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 [Music]

262
00:10:46,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 [Music]

263
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,640
 - Good breakfast, Alice. - What time is it, Sam?

264
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,520
 - One minute after nine. I ought to be at the office, but now...

265
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:23,160
 - My goodness, I ought to be getting ready to go out myself.

266
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:28,040
 - It's a wonder either one of us woke up this morning after being kept awake all night by the boys.

267
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,560
 What time did they finally stop wrestling?

268
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,920
 - Sam, they weren't wrestling.

269
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:36,600
 - Alice, I heard them myself. Homer kept yelling at the top of his lungs.

270
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,840
 He'd come in, he'd fall down, he'd get up.

271
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:43,400
 - Then he'd do it all over again. - Not a deer.

272
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:46,480
 - Why, didn't you hear them? - How did they look when they had breakfast?

273
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,480
 - Well, I didn't see them at breakfast. They must have come down quite early. - Yes.

274
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:53,480
 - I was just going to call them when I happened to find their cereal dishes out by the sink.

275
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:57,480
 And Sam, I have never been so upset about anything in all my life.

276
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:01,480
 - What about? - By imagining their Latin teacher giving them an exam

277
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:04,480
 they had to sit up half the night studying for.

278
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,480
 I still say that if Henry had paid attention, a thing like that wouldn't happen.

279
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,480
 Dear, under ordinary circumstances, I'd agree with you.

280
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,480
 But their teacher double-crossed them.

281
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,480
 Henry explained the whole thing to me.

282
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,480
 - Alice. - Yes, Sam?

283
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,480
 Listen.

284
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,480
 Did I hear someone moving around upstairs?

285
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,480
 Well, I certainly don't hear anything.

286
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,480
 I couldn't be married.

287
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,480
 She left the house at least ten minutes ago.

288
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,480
 And Sam, you didn't let me finish.

289
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,480
 I'm going down and seeing Miss Wheeler today.

290
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,480
 Who's Miss Wheeler?

291
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,480
 Henry's Latin teacher.

292
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,480
 I think it's time I had a hot to hot talk with her.

293
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:51,480
 Hey Homer.

294
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,480
 Homer wake up.

295
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,480
 Hey Harry.

296
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,480
 Hey what's that? Did the alarm go off?

297
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,480
 Not yet. I woke up about five minutes ago.

298
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:03,480
 She was. Is it raining out? Not so loud Homer. Do you want to wake up my whole family?

299
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,480
 It isn't raining, the shades are down.

300
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,480
 Oh.

301
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,480
 What time is it anyhow?

302
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,480
 There's a clock right there.

303
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,480
 Ten minutes to seven.

304
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,480
 Oh, yeah.

305
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,480
 Hey.

306
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,480
 What's the matter?

307
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,480
 Oh, no.

308
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:21,480
 I thought when I first looked at it, it said 25 minutes to ten.

309
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:24,480
 It's a funny thing, Homer, but so did I.

310
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,480
 Come on, let's tip toe down to the kitchen in our pajamas and get some breakfast.

311
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,480
 All right.

312
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:32,480
 How about a little more of that cereal and some bananas?

313
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,480
 We haven't got any bananas.

314
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,780
 Why it now, Homer?

315
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:40,280
 As soon as we get through, we'll come back and finish studying.

316
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,280
 Okay.

317
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:47,280
 You know, it's funny, but I feel as refreshed as though I'd slip until 9 or 10 o'clock.

318
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,280
 Yes, you...

319
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,780
 Homer, don't trip on these stairs. You'll wake everybody up.

320
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:54,880
 Henry, ask me what close-quaid tandem and all that sort of thing means.

321
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:55,880
 What does it mean?

322
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:58,980
 It's how long will you abuse our patients, Caroline?

323
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:00,480
 That's well, Homer.

324
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,880
 Just a second while I put in a telephone call at this hour the morning. Who are you gonna call?

325
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,880
 I think they'll be up by now

326
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,760

329
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:22,380
 Mean that's all right go ahead and ring them. Tell me who you're calling

330
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:25,360
 Or I think I know where I left my sister row yesterday

331
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:30,300
 Remember when we dropped in a Jimmy Bartlett's for a second. Hello. Hello. Is this Mrs.

332
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:35,740
 Bartlett? Yes. Well this is Henry Aldridge. Did you find a Latin book anywhere around your kitchen?

333
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:40,940
 Henry, could you speak up a little? Well I wouldn't Mrs. Bartlett, but I don't want to wake my folks up.

334
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:43,980
 Oh, why did they say Henry?

335
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:48,220
 No, they're just getting a good night's sleep. I'll tell you guys, meet the Jimmy, please.

336
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:51,420
 Did Jimmy? He's left for school. What's that?

337
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:56,140
 There's a chorus he left a long time ago. She whizzed, what time do you have to be there?

338
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:59,140
 - The final clock. - I know, but...

339
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:01,140
 but...

340
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:03,140
 what time is it now?

341
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:06,140
 - It's the quarter of a day. - Quarter to what?

342
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:09,140
 - Quarter. - Homeward, do you know what time it is?

343
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:10,140
 - What time is it? - Mother!

344
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:12,140
 - What time is it? - Mother!

345
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:14,140
 - Are you asking what time it is? - Mother Mary!

346
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:16,140
 - Mrs. Offer! - Mother!

 Hey, Henry, slow down and wait for me.

349
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:29,140
 What's the matter with you, Homer?

350
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:30,140
 Can't you run?

351
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:31,540
 She was I dressed in such a hurry.

352
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:32,040
 Look at me.

353
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:35,140
 I got my shoes on the wrong feet.

354
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,740
 Why worry about a little thing like that?

355
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:39,640
 Don't you realize the exam started 15 minutes ago?

356
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:40,140
 Henry, wait.

357
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,640
 Your pajamas are showing.

358
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,640
 Where?

359
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,840
 Below your pants.

360
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,840
 Stop and pull them out.

361
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,340
 I haven't got time.

362
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:47,420
 Henry, don't go in that door.

363
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:48,940
 That's the girl's entrance.

364
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,820
 Homer, what difference does it make in a time like this?

365
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,340
 Come on.

366
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:53,180
 We'll open it.

367
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:54,340
 Trying to.

368
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:55,180
 So are you.

369
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:56,020
 Now you see that?

370
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:57,140
 Now we've lost more time.

371
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:57,980
 Wait, it's open.

372
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:59,620
 I forgot doors and schools open out.

373
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:04,260
 Listen, Henry, don't you pay attention to anything?

374
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,180
 But where are the stairs?

375
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:06,180
 Where are the stairs?

376
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,020
 I don't know.

377
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,780
 How would I know where they are?

378
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:09,900
 Homer, don't go through that door.

379
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,100
 That's the girl's gym.

380
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:11,780
 I know.

381
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:14,220
 Who's this role-a-good girl on a parallel bar?

382
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:15,220
 Hey!

383
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:16,220
 [whistling]

384
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,220
 Homer, quit it.

385
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,220
 Come on.

386
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:20,220
 Well, let's try this way.

387
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:22,220
 Boy, are my feet blistered.

388
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:23,220
 Same here.

389
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:25,220
 We should have brought our socks along with us.

390
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:26,220
 [laughing]

391
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,220
 Come on up these stairs.

392
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,220
 Don't you see that sign that says down only.

393
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:32,220
 Homer, stop criticizing everything and come on.

394
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:35,220
 [laughing]

395
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:36,220
 What is that door, Goldle?

396
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:37,220
 She wished we were in the clear.

397
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:39,220
 Give me more outdoors again.

398
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:40,220
 We're in the main hall.

399
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:41,220
 There's Miss Wheeler's room right over there.

400
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:42,220
 Don't make so much noise.

401
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:44,220
 I wanted to notice this when we go in.

402
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:50,220
 Wait a second, Homer. Wait a second.

403
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:53,220
 We gotta sign our names on this bulletin board before we go in.

404
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,220
 Oh, yeah. Well, sign mine and hurry up.

405
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,220
 Wait a second.

406
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:58,220
 Hey, who brought us my hair look?

407
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:00,220
 Why worry about a thing like that?

408
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,220
 You should see yours.

409
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:04,220
 Just pull up your pajamas and come on.

410
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:06,220
 Quiet, Homer, quiet.

411
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:11,220
 She was. West Miss Wheeler.

412
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:13,220
 Miss Wheeler, I don't know.

413
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:15,220
 Hey, hey Lucy.

414
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:16,220
 Why?

415
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:18,220
 Where's Miss Wheeler?

416
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:20,220
 She got called down to the office.

417
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:21,220
 She did?

418
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,220
 But where are we in luck?

419
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:23,220
 Is the exam started?

420
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:25,220
 Yes, the papers are up there on the desk.

421
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:27,220
 Come on, honey, let's get them and get started.

422
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:29,220
 The period's almost half-throat.

423
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:31,220
 Boy, I wish I had time to eat some breakfast.

424
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:32,220
 My stomach's turning over.

425
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,220
 Hand me your pajamas and slipping off too.

426
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:55,220
 The point is this, Miss Wheeler. Yes, Mrs. Oldridge. I do appreciate you coming down here to the office when I know you're holding an examination upstairs.

427
00:17:55,220 --> 00:18:03,220
 But don't you think there's something wrong when a boy has to study half the night and then get up practically before sunrise and study some more?

428
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:07,620
 I do indeed, Mrs. Aldrich, and I hope you won't misunderstand.

429
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:12,180
 But my observation has been that Henry doesn't pay as much attention as he should.

430
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:18,020
 Miss Wheeler, if Henry were the only one who had to study practically all night, it would be different.

431
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:22,500
 But Homer Brown stayed up just as late and was up again at sunrise.

432
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:26,260
 Mrs. Aldrich, I hope you won't misinterpret what I'm about to say.

433
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:30,180
 But Homer Brown doesn't pay any better attention than your thunder.

434
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:35,980
 And incidentally, if you would care to look on that desk, you'll find Henry's copy of

435
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:37,180
 Cicero.

436
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:40,180
 It was found in de Haven's drugstore yesterday.

437
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:42,180
 Oh, really?

438
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:47,540
 Oh, well, naturally I realize Henry isn't perfect, Miss Wheeler.

439
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:51,500
 But don't you think that if a subject is made interesting, young people will take an interest

440
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,500
 in it?

441
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,420
 I appreciate your frankness, Mrs. Aldrich.

442
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:59,220
 And I certainly hope you won't think I'm in any way criticizing.

443
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:03,680
 And when Henry finished his teaser class last year, I went to Mr. Bradley and I told him

444
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:09,120
 I felt it was extremely unwise for us to permit him to take Cicero this year.

445
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:13,280
 And just how do you expect Henry to get into college without Cicero?

446
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,500
 By working, Mrs. Aldrich.

447
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:18,000
 By working very hard.

448
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 I see.

449
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,880
 Is there a public telephone here I might use?

450
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,240
 Ms. Shea, would you please show Mrs. Aldrich where the telephone is?

451
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,840
 Well, there's a booth right over here in the corner, Mrs. Ulrich.

452
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:31,280
 Thank you. Thank you very much.

453
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,880
 Good day, Miss Wheeler.

454
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,440
 Good-bye, Mrs. Ulrich.

455
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,680
 What's the matter with her?

456
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:39,880
 Is it my fault her son had to sit up all night getting ready for tomorrow's exam?

457
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,280
 Maro, I thought you were giving exams today.

458
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,640
 I am, but only in Julis Caesar.

459
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,200
 Cicero is tomorrow.

460
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:50,200
 [applause]

461
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:53,200
 [applause]

462
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,840
 (audience applauding)

463
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:00,120
 We'll return to the Aldrich family in just a moment.

464
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,680
 Tonight, theater guild on the air

465
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:04,880
 raises the curtain on another fine dramatic presentation

466
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,760
 by some of the superb actors the guild has teamed up

467
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,840
 with the outstanding plays of the past and present.

468
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:13,080
 Tonight's play is the Square Peg,

469
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:16,640
 starring Thomas Mitchell, Delmaritha and Jane Wyatt.

470
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,520
 And of course, no Sunday would be complete

471
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:21,040
 without a visit to those two happy householders,

472
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,040
 Phil Harris and Alice Fade.

473
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,040
 This curly-headed wonder of the airwaves

474
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,540
 can usually get himself involved in something

475
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:31,440
 that requires Alice's talented hand to unravel.

476
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,680
 Then your two regular NBC thrillers--

477
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:36,540
 Dragnet and Barry Craig, confidential investigator,

478
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:38,040
 come along next.

479
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:41,880
 Barry, played by William Gargon, clears up a thrilling mystery.

480
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:45,280
 While Dragnet, with Jack Webb, his sergeant Joe Friday,

481
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,560
 offers another case history from the files

482
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,600
 of the Los Angeles police.

483
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,440
 So stay tuned to NBC on Sunday nights

484
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:55,440
 for the tops in radio entertainment.

485
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,020
 (upbeat music)

486
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:12,080
 Now getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldridge.

487
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,600
 Due to the fact that Henry and Homer overslept this morning,

488
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,040
 they arrived at school 20 minutes late

489
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:21,320
 and have gone in to take the wrong Latin exam.

490
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:26,960
 This is Aldrich who assumes that they got up in time has taken their side in the trouble that follows.

491
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,960
 This scene opens in the examination room.

492
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,160
 Boy, oh boy.

493
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,820
 Oh, we're not so loud.

494
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:34,960
 Henry, did you ever see a tougher exam?

495
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,060
 I'll say.

496
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:38,500
 I don't recognize any part of it.

497
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,400
 Boy, Homer, am I hungry?

498
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,140
 I'm so hungry, everything's spinning.

499
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:45,000
 Henry, have you answered, Annie?

500
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,400
 Not yet.

501
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,680
 Maybe these were on the pages we were going to study this morning, but didn't.

502
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,980
 Henry, here's one I recognize. Here's one.

503
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:53,820
 Which one is it?

504
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:55,380
 Winnie-Witty-Witty.

505
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:56,980
 What about you?

506
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:58,260
 For sure, don't you remember?

507
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:00,820
 He came in, he fell down, he got up, he went out.

508
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,620
 Come on.

509
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:05,620
 Homer, don't tell me, don't tell me, that's cheating.

510
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:08,120
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

511
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:21,700
 Excuse me, Mr. Bradley, but did you send for me?

512
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:24,900
 Yes, Miss Wheeler, come right here.

513
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:30,800
 Tell me, have you Henry Aldrich's and Homer Brown's examination papers with you?

514
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,500
 No, I'm afraid I haven't. I sent the boys home with them.

515
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,700
 Oh, dear, that's too bad.

516
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:38,400
 I didn't know you wanted to see them, Mr. Bradley.

517
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,700
 I also gave Henry his copy of Cicero, his mother, left in the telephone booth.

518
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,900
 Yes.

519
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:48,700
 Well, I'm sorry about the papers because Henry's father and Homer's father

520
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,780
 are dropping in for a talk in a few minutes.

521
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:51,660
 You don't say so.

522
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:54,020
 I thought they might find those examination papers

523
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:55,340
 rather than lightning.

524
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:57,740
 You mean the fact that they took an exam in Caesar

525
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:59,300
 and thought it was in Cicero?

526
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:00,900
 Yeah.

527
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:01,740
 Never mind.

528
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:03,140
 I've sent for Ms. Johnson to come in.

529
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:04,420
 That will help some.

530
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:05,780
 Yes, Mr. Bradley.

531
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:08,020
 You're referring, of course, to that awful thing Henry

532
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,100
 and Homer did this morning.

533
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,700
 Yes, I am.

534
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,860
 Well, I'm certainly glad you're going to repost them.

535
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:15,500
 If Ms. Aldrich and Mr. Brown think for one minute

536
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,420
 at this school--

537
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:17,980
 Excuse me, Mr. Bradley.

538
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:20,580
 Mr. Aldrich and Mr. Brown are here to see you.

539
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:23,480
 Thank you, Ms. Shea. Please show them in.

540
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,980
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

541
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:39,980
 Mother, could I have just one more sip, please?

542
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:42,680
 Yeah, you are, dear.

543
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,680
 Now, put your head back on the pillow.

544
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,080
 Thank you.

545
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,680
 Thank you very much.

546
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:51,320
 Just when did this awful headache begin, Henry?

547
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,480
 Well, it's a funny thing, Mother.

548
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,600
 Just as I began taking that Latin exam,

549
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,280
 everything began to spin.

550
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:59,480
 With me, Mrs. Orville, did I begin to spin?

551
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,840
 I began to spin--

552
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,400
 boy, I'm still spinning.

553
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,320
 [LAUGHTER]

554
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,920
 Well, you just stay in that bed over there, Homer.

555
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:10,760
 And Henry, you stay in this bed, and you're both

556
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,360
 going to feel just fine.

557
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:15,120
 And I don't have to go home and tell my folks that--

558
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,600
 I don't have to go home and tell them?

559
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,200
 No Homer, I'll phone them.

560
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:22,200
 But when you do, Mrs. Olives, would you mind not mentioning my Latin exam?

561
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:26,700
 Because my father was sort of counting on me not having a breakdown until school was over for the year.

562
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,000
 [LAUGHTER]

563
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:28,900
 Hello!

564
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,800
 Yes, Sammy, you back?

565
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,700
 Henry comes and I want to see him.

566
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,400
 He's right here, dear.

567
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,400
 I'd like him to come down here.

568
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,900
 Who, I, father?

569
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,700
 Dear, he can't possibly come.

570
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,400
 You'll have to come up here.

571
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,400
 Up there?

572
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,200
 Where is he?

573
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,000
 What's the reason he can't come down?

574
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,680
 We're right here.

575
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,520
 I want to have a talk with him.

576
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,160
 Hello, Father.

577
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,720
 Henry, what are you doing in your mother's bed?

578
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,640
 Why, uh--

579
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:56,680
 And who's that in my bed?

580
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,760
 Hello, Mr. Augins.

581
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:01,520
 Now, Sam, let's not talk quite so loud.

582
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,480
 Both of the boys are feeling just terrible.

583
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,080
 I should think they would.

584
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:08,800
 I should think they'd want to crawl right under the bed.

585
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,640
 Who I, Father?

586
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,240
 Yes.

587
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,120
 I ought to take you out of school and put you to work.

588
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,160
 Why, Sam, older--

589
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:17,280
 Alice, do you realize what's happened to me? Do you realize?

590
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,200
 Dear, I don't even know what you're talking about.

591
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:23,160
 Didn't you phone and ask me to go over and have a talk with Mr. Bradley?

592
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,720
 - And didn't Will Brown and I go? - Oh, boy.

593
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:28,320
 Now, dear, you're Henry Father.

594
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,920
 It was your duty to go and get things straightened out.

595
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:38,040
 I got them straightened out, Alice. I have never been so humiliated, so shagrind.

596
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,080
 So what, Mr. Aldrich?

597
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:45,460
 We'll skip the fact that after studying Caesar for two years and Cicero for one year,

598
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:49,160
 you boys don't know the difference between the two.

599
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,960
 Did they tell you about that?

600
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,160
 They did.

601
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,960
 Well, Father, it isn't as though I didn't know the difference.

602
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,760
 As a matter of fact, when I walked into the examination, I noticed all the faces were different.

603
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:02,360
 Well, sure. We thought they were taking makeup exams.

604
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,560
 Sam, what happened?

605
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,060
 Alice, don't you get into this.

606
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:08,860
 I'm skipping the fact that you left Henry's Latin book in the phone booth.

607
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:10,860
 Oh, is that where I left it?

608
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,360
 [audience laughter]

609
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,360
 Mother, how did you happen to do a thing like that?

610
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,360
 We'll skip everything except two questions.

611
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:21,860
 First, what were you boys doing prowling through the girls' gymnasium, trying to flirt?

612
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:22,860
 [audience laughter]

613
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:26,360
 What, mind you, with Miss Johnson, the girls' gym teacher?

614
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:28,360
 When did we ever do that, Mr. Aldridge?

615
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,860
 When did we ever do that?

616
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:32,360
 What have you even whistled at her?

617
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:35,360
 Was that Miss Johnson on the parallel bars?

618
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:40,360
 And second, who may I ask is going to pay for your tutoring during Easter vacation?

619
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:43,360
 For tutoring, Father? What tutoring?

620
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,360
 What do you mean, "what tutoring"?

621
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,360
 The tutoring that you signed up for.

622
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,360
 Where, Mr. Arnold?

623
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:53,360
 On the bulletin board, I saw your signatures of my own eyes right outside of the room.

624
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,360
 Is that what we signed?

625
00:26:55,360 --> 00:27:01,360
 Not for a course in Caesar. Not for a course in Cicero.

626
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,360
 But put a course in advance, trigonometry.

627
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,960
 [audience laughing]

628
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,460
 Triggin' armagery.

629
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:10,460
 Now listen, Henry, did you sign my name to that?

630
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:11,760
 He did, Homer.

631
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:16,060
 And Henry, that's exactly what you get for not paying attention.

632
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:18,160
 I'll answer the phone, it's probably the police.

633
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:21,160
 The police, father, did you report me to the police?

634
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,360
 I did not, but on top of everything else,

635
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,260
 when I got home a few minutes ago,

636
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:27,260
 I found the car had been stolen.

637
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:28,860
 Mr. Olaj, I didn't even touch it.

638
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:30,860
 I've been right up here in bed all the time.

639
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:34,860
 Sam, how could anyone have taken it out of our garage?

640
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:35,860
 Hello.

641
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:38,860
 Central High School, may I ask you to Mr. Orange, please?

642
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:40,860
 This is Mr. Orange. Now what's happened?

643
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:45,860
 Mr. Orange, I'm sorry, but Mr. Bradley wants to know when he can come down here and let him out.

644
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:47,860
 Let him out? Let him out?

645
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:52,860
 Yes, you left your car right in front of the driveway and it's locked and we can't move it.

646
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:58,860
 Well, I'll be right over.

647
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:01,860
 - Sam, who was it? - Nothing, not a thing.

648
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:03,860
 [laughter]

649
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:06,860
 - They just found my car. - They did father where?

650
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:11,860
 - If you know what's good for you young man, you'll get out of bed and study your sister-old right now.

651
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:14,860
 - But father, that's the beautiful part of it. We've got the first three orations all studied.

652
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:21,860
 - Henry, it might interest you to know that your examination tomorrow is not on the first three orations, but on the last three.

653
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:25,860
 - The last three? The last three, Mr. Aldridge?

654
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:28,860
 She was what am I getting out of bed for?

655
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:29,860
 Henry, that's the doorbell.

656
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:32,860
 You have your bathrobe on. Go down and see who it is.

657
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:34,860
 Yes, mother. And here, take your sister off.

658
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:36,860
 Oh, yes, sure. Thank you very much. Come on, Homer.

659
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:39,860
 Oh, this I never wanted to think of another thing like this.

660
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:42,860
 You know, I had a feeling all the time you didn't pay any attention

661
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:44,860
 to what Miss Wheeler said about the exam.

662
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:46,860
 Why? Hi, Henry.

663
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:48,860
 Oh, boy. What's the matter?

664
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:50,860
 Here, look through the window by the front door. Look who's out there.

665
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:52,860
 Oh, boy, Homer, it's Miss Wheeler.

666
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:53,860
 It's Miss Wheeler.

667
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:55,860
 Henry, I'm going down to the basement.

668
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:56,860
 (audience laughing)

669
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:59,860
 Wait a second, Homer, you gotta stay here and face her.

670
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:01,860
 How do you do, Henry?

671
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:03,860
 How do you do, Miss Wheeler?

672
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:04,860
 I'm very sorry to have to bother you,

673
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:07,860
 but do you happen to have those examination questions

674
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:08,860
 you answered today?

675
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:10,860
 Oh, yeah, sure. They're right here in this just room.

676
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:11,860
 We've been sort of looking them over

677
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:13,860
 and realizing what a mistake we made.

678
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:15,860
 Really? I don't know what that was.

679
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:18,860
 When I gave them to you, I just wasn't paying attention.

680
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:20,860
 That is, um...

681
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:23,460
 Did you read what was written on the back of them?

682
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:26,860
 No, Miss Wheeler, we had a hard enough time reading what was on the front.

683
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:28,060
 Now I have to please...

684
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:29,060
 Oh, sure here.

685
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:30,260
 Thank you so much.

686
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:33,860
 These questions on the back of your examination tomorrow.

687
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:34,860
 Goodbye.

688
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:35,860
 What's that?

689
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:36,860
 You mean...

690
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:40,860
 Lesson Homer, why don't you ever pay attention to anything?

691
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:48,860
 [applause]

692
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:55,860
 Red Cross disaster plans have always been developed on the assumption that it can happen here.

693
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:58,860
 This means a big volunteer job for a great many people.

694
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:04,860
 At the same time it offers everyone an opportunity to be trained and ready to do a job in case of a local or national emergency.

695
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:08,860
