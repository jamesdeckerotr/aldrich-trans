 Henry Henry Olgridge!

00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 The coming mother!

00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000

00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 Here's to the Olgridge family written by

 Clifford Goldsmith.

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 A teenage boy has always scampered across the American scene.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 Tom Sawyer, a huckleberry fin, Kenrod, pecs bad boy.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 Maybe there's a good reason why.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 Maybe in a typical American boy like Henry Aldrich,

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 people can see someone they once were or once knew.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 The scene opens on the front porch of the Aldrich home.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,440
 home. The time is late afternoon.

15
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,500
 G. Homer, you're just worrying over nothing.

16
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,160
 Well, Henry, that isn't the way my father said he would have done it.

17
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,780
 My father will get it, Homer.

18
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:02,000
 Why do you think he's taking the time to drive way out to Mr. Frederick's farm if you can?

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 Well, boy, I certainly hope he can collect it.

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,440
 Homer, he's going to tell Mr. Frederick right straight to his face how much he owes us for the work we did this summer.

21
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,280
 And your father thinks he can get it all?

22
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,040
 Sure he can, Homer. He'll get our whole eight dollars.

23
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,000
 Well, my father said that if a man owed him that much for working as hard as we did,

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,140
 He wouldn't go all the way out there, he'd just sue him.

25
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:22,640
 Boy, your father doesn't know anything about a thing like that.

26
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,840
 All he does is sell lumber.

27
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,280
 Because my father's one of the best lawyers in the state.

28
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,920
 He can talk anyone into giving him money.

29
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,120
 How?

30
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,800
 I don't know, but it's an act you have if you're a lawyer.

31
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,040
 And nobody puts anything over on my father.

32
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,360
 When he goes after a thing, he gets it.

33
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:37,920
 He does?

34
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,200
 And how?

35
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,360
 You just wait until he comes back and hands us each $4.

00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,360

38
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:55,560
 But father, didn't I make it clear Mr. Frederick owed us eight dollars?

39
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,260
 Henry, for the last time I collected it.

40
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:00,160
 In money, Mr. Aldrich?

41
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,960
 No, Homer, not in money.

42
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,260
 As I said before, I collected the equivalent.

43
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:06,060
 Sam, what do you mean by the equivalent?

44
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:09,260
 I mean, Alice, that Mr. Frederick didn't have the cash.

45
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:11,360
 So he paid it in corn.

46
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,360
 In what?

47
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,860
 [Laughter]

48
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:19,260
 Corn Mrs. Alvich, G. Father, and not that we don't appreciate your trying,

49
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:23,860
 but what Homer and I had really planned and was, well, you know, money.

50
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:26,460
 Gee whiz, Mr. Alvich, my father said...

51
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:28,060
 Never mind what your father said, Homer.

52
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:30,060
 There's nothing wrong with being paid in corn.

53
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:33,260
 It's the ancient principle of barter and exchange.

54
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,360
 - It is? - Of course.

55
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,660
 It's a simple case of applied economics.

56
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:39,260
 You boys will learn a great deal from this transaction.

57
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,860
 It's taught me one thing already.

58
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,460
 - I'm glad to hear it, Homer. - The next time I do any work,

59
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:45,460
 I'm getting my money in advance.

60
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:47,260
 (audience laughing)

61
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:48,340
 - Now Homer.

62
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:50,620
 - Sam, how much corn did he give the boys?

63
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:51,700
 - Tomorrow morning Alice,

64
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:54,500
 he's driving his truck in with 12 bushels.

65
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,780
 - 12 bushels?

66
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:56,700
 A corn?

67
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,340
 - Yes Mrs. Aldrich, 12 bushels.

68
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,300
 - Where in heaven's name are you gonna keep it?

69
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,700
 - In the basement, mother.

70
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,580
 Until we can figure out what to do with it.

71
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:07,020
 - Well, that's very nice, I'm sure.

72
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:10,180
 Mr. Aldrich, how much is it worth a bushel?

73
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:13,420
 - Well, I'm afraid it isn't worth a great deal right now.

74
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:17,420
 Oh, but naturally if you hold it, you'll find the price will fluctuate.

75
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:21,420
 Sure, sure it will. What do you mean "flutuate" Henry?

76
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:25,420
 Boy, how many of you are dumb. It means that...

77
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:28,420
 Tell him, will you father?

78
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:33,420
 The fluctuation reflects the cost of living. The price may be down, but only temporarily.

79
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,420
 Sooner or later it'll go up.

80
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:38,420
 Sam, what is it you're suggesting the boys do? Trade in car?

81
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:40,980
 Now Alice, it would be a very good experience for them.

82
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:43,780
 They'll learn the principles of supply and demand.

83
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:46,100
 This will teach them the value of money.

84
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,380
 - When she was father, I know the value of money.

85
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:50,140
 It's the value of corn, I'm worrying about it.

86
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:51,540
 (audience laughing)

87
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,780
 - Well, don't worry about it, dear.

88
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,700
 You and Homer can corner the market

89
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:58,620
 with your 12 bushels and make a killing when it goes up.

90
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,060
 - Alice, for heaven's sake.

91
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,780
 - I'm sorry, Sam.

92
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:03,580
 Please hurry and get ready for dinner.

93
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:05,140
 - Were you including me, Mrs. Aldrich?

94
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:07,300
 - Why, no, Homer, I wasn't.

95
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:11,860
 However, if you feel that you want to stay, I couldn't stay unless I was specially asked.

96
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:14,560
 Oh, in that case, dear, perhaps the next time.

97
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:21,060
 Could you start that over again, Mrs. Aldrich?

98
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:24,100
 Come on, I'll go to the door with you.

99
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,140
 Well, thanks for your trouble, Mrs. Aldrich.

100
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,840
 And thank you for your trouble, Mr. Aldrich.

101
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,140
 No trouble at all.

102
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:32,140
 Understand, Henry, I'm not criticizing.

103
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:34,140
 Only you should have gotten my father to handle this.

104
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,040
 Now, listen, is that a slur on my father?

105
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,640
 Oh, gee whiz no.

106
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,040
 The only thing is, I don't know how he makes a living.

107
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,040
 Homer.

108
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,540
 Twelve bushels of corn or twelve bushels of corn?

109
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:45,340
 I can figure that much myself.

110
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:48,440
 But when I go up to the dance committee and get two tickets for the class dance,

111
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,540
 what am I going to hand them?

112
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,540
 Six bushels of corn?

113
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:54,540
 That hasn't even fluctuated yet?

114
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:57,040
 Are they already worse off than I am?

115
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,040
 I asked Eleanor Wentworth, haven't I?

116
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,540
 Boy, I don't know how I'm going to be able to face Betty Newton.

117
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:05,540
 Listen, Homer, why don't you see if your mother wouldn't be interested in buying it?

118
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:08,540
 It's a can. The whole twelve bushels?

119
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:10,540
 We could quote a reasonable price.

120
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:13,540
 Sure. You want my mother to get us out of a hole that your father got us into.

121
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:16,540
 Who are we? Who are we? We aren't in any hole.

122
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:19,540
 You just don't realize how valuable that corn is going to be.

123
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:23,540
 When? When it fluctuates. When it fluctuates.

124
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:33,540
 Henry, in which room is the class holding the meeting?

125
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:37,920
 right there in two way did you try the wayside market Homer yes Henry I've

126
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:41,940
 been everywhere did you go to the neighborhood grocery yes and they said

127
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:46,080
 the same thing everybody else did no they just laughed well didn't you tell

128
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,040
 them what your father said about the price Homer people who are laughing

129
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:54,080
 aren't in the mood to talk business boy I want to go to this meeting anyway all

130
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,040
 they're gonna talk about is the class dance did Eleanor wet worth go in sure

131
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:02,360
 and I'll bet the first thing they ask us is have we bought our tickets quiet

132
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,360
 Henry is the meeting started?

133
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,360
 No, President, I'm going to be teaching the chair!

134
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:10,360
 You've all heard the names of the last meeting. Are there any announcements?

135
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:13,360
 Mr. President, the chair recognizes Toby Wilson.

136
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:19,360
 All though most of the tickets for the dance a week from this Saturday have been sold, there are still a few guys holding back.

137
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,360
 Oh boy.

138
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:23,360
 Let's not have any slack, Miss Fosse. Let's make it a hundred percent!

139
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,360
 [cheering]

140
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,360
 I'm going out, Henry. No one will see ya.

141
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:31,360
 Are there any other announcements? Mr. President!

142
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:36,360
 Jimmy Bartlett. Mr. President, I've been a member of this class for a good many years now.

143
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:40,360
 I like to ask, why did ticket-tack the cost so much?

144
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,360
 Mr. President, that's what I say.

145
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,360
 Oh, shit!

146
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,360
 Oh, shit!

147
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,360
 Well, I think the price of the ticket should fluctuate like the cost of living.

148
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,360
 Homer, would you mind explaining that?

149
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:57,360
 Well, if you don't know, it's not going to do any good to tell you.

150
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,680
 The beneditions of money I mined is the principal.

151
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,620
 Homer, I believe the price of tickets was fully discussed at the last meeting.

152
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:04,580
 And you're out of order.

153
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,060
 What do you mean I'm out of order?

154
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:08,000
 I wasn't even at the last meeting.

155
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,700
 I think we ought to have more principal all the way around.

156
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:13,540
 [crowd murmuring]

157
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:14,500
 Homer, be quiet.

158
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,740
 Water, please.

159
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:17,000
 Water.

160
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 Are there any other announcements?

161
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,140
 Mr. President.

162
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,100
 Betty Newton.

163
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:26,140
 I make a motion that the chairman of the dish read off the list of those boys who hadn't bought their tickets here.

164
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:28,060
 The last will be right at the next meeting.

165
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:29,380
 Are there any other announcements?

166
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,780
 - Mr. President?

167
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:31,700
 - Yes, Shanery.

168
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:34,620
 - I make a motion that we postpone the dance.

169
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:37,360
 (crowd cheering)

170
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,380
 - For how long?

171
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:41,920
 - For about four weeks.

172
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,260
 - Oh, yeah.

173
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:45,980
 - All in favor signify by saying aye.

174
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:46,820
 - Aye.

175
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:47,740
 - Don't oppose.

176
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:48,900
 - No!

177
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:51,860
 - Mr. President, I make a motion that no more in this class

178
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,700
 feel allowed to bring any girl to the dance

179
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,100
 that isn't in the class.

180
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:58,940
 Mr. President, yes, darling, I object not amongst the no less than

181
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:02,640
 confiscation of personal rights.

182
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:06,040
 Mr. President, Henry Orridge,

183
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:09,940
 I've been listening with great interest to all the complaints about this dance

184
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:12,260
 and naturally it worries me.

185
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:15,580
 I'm not sure, but I think I have a suggestion.

186
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:19,540
 We had a good dance last year and we had a good dance the year before.

187
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:22,620
 And I guess if we're all here we'll have another one next year.

188
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:25,620
 I certainly hope we will because I like to dance.

189
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,620
 But, gee, I don't know.

190
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:31,620
 Sometimes I start wondering if dancing is everything in life.

191
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:34,620
 How about trying something else, just one year?

192
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,620
 The evenings are nice now.

193
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:39,620
 They're a little chilly maybe, but we're going to have a moon, I think.

194
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:42,620
 Why waste our time indoors?

195
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:43,620
 Just dancing.

196
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:46,620
 Well, what do you suggest?

197
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:49,620
 Why, uh, sort of cornrows.

198
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:57,860
 I make a motion that this class show a little originality and initiative and have a corn

199
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:58,860
 roast.

200
00:08:58,860 --> 00:08:59,860
 I second the motion.

201
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:00,860
 On our place.

202
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:01,860
 On our...

203
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:02,860
 That's the present.

204
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:03,860
 I've never heard of anything so ridiculous.

205
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:04,860
 All I can say is who wants a corn roast?

206
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:05,860
 I do, Mr. President.

207
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:06,860
 Why do you have an NREO return on through dancing yet?

208
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:07,860
 I mean corn!

209
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:14,300
 The only trouble with having a corn roast is where are you going to get a corn roast?

210
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,300
 I mean corn!

211
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,800
 The only trouble with having a corn roast is,

212
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,800
 "Where are you going to get the corn?"

213
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,800
 It's hard to find this time of year.

214
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,800
 Oh, my God.

215
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:29,300
 But if we have enough initiative and originality to want a corn roast,

216
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:33,300
 then I'm willing to personally guarantee that I will find the corn.

217
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,300
 Somehow.

218
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,800
 [cheering]

219
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,800
 I second that motion too.

220
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,800
 What motion, Homer?

221
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,800
 What?

222
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,800
 There wasn't any motion.

223
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,800
 Well, then I made one.

224
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,800
 Oh, I second that.

225
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,140
 Now wait a minute, where are your principles?

226
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,200
 - At whom are shut up? - Here has been a motion

227
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,040
 that instead of a dance, we show little originality

228
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,680
 and initiative by holding a corn roast.

229
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,640
 All those in favor signify by saying aye.

230
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,580
 - Aye! - Aye!

231
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:59,440
 - Pause! - No!

232
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,440
 - The boys have it, it'll be a corn roast.

233
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,280
 (crowd cheering)

234
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,280
 - This is the best! - Hold up.

235
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,880
 Homer, tell Henry Audrey somebody wants him outside.

236
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,000
 I'm wanted outside?

237
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,680
 Somebody wants you out in the main office.

238
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,120
 Hey, come on, Homer, I'm wanted.

239
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,360
 Mr. President, the good meat we will or will not have punch also.

240
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,660
 [CHEERING]

241
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:22,920
 Gee, Henry, did you steamroll or that?

242
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,680
 Oh, Henry, it just happens that I did it for the sake of the class.

243
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,200
 You did?

244
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,200
 Sure.

245
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,080
 I really think a corn roast is a better idea than a dance.

246
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,080
 And if it happens that we have the corn, they need,

247
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,160
 we'll let them have it.

248
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,560
 Just what they need, no more and no less.

249
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,880
 Well, how much do you think they'll need, Hen?

250
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:40,320
 About 12 bushels.

251
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,440
 Henry, I wonder who wants you in the front office.

252
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,940
 Henry Oh, Ritchie.

253
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,140
 Where did you come from, Eleanor?

254
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:47,160
 I just followed you on a class meeting,

255
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,760
 and I want to tell you that every girl in there

256
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:51,280
 is so mad at you, they're never going to speak to you again.

257
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,160
 They're all mad at me?

258
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,480
 My goodness, Henry.

259
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,160
 You even invited me to go to the class dance with you.

260
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,600
 Well, sure, Eleanor, but let me explain it.

261
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,080
 Henry, I even bought a dress for the dance,

262
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,800
 a brand new Tafforda dress.

263
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,640
 Well, look here, watch that.

264
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:04,080
 Oh, and I look nice eating corn on the cob in Tafforda.

265
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:04,920
 But she was Eleanor.

266
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,040
 Oh, we did with Substitute a corn roast for the dance.

267
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,160
 And you can just substitute another girl.

268
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,000
 Goodbye.

269
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,300
 Eleanor, wait.

270
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,360
 Eleanor, wait.

271
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,360
 Oh boy, come on Henry, here comes Betty.

272
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,360
 You wait for me, Homer Brown.

273
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,360
 Oh, did you want to speak to me?

274
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,360
 Yes, I do.

275
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:23,360
 Do you realize I can't eat sweet corn?

276
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,360
 Why not?

277
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,360
 Because I got this breeze on my teeth.

278
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,360
 And I've got to wear it for three more months.

279
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,360
 She, Whiz Betty, are too self-conscious about it.

280
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,360
 That's right.

281
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,360
 It's not the least bit noticeable.

282
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,360
 Unless you smile.

283
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,360
 No, but she whiz Betty.

284
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,360
 Henry Aldrich!

285
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,360
 Oh boy, who's that?

286
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,360
 Who's that?

287
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,360
 It's your sister, Henry.

288
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,360
 Mary?

289
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,360
 What's she doing here in school?

290
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,360
 She got a complaint too.

291
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,360
 Henry, I've been waiting for you in the main office.

292
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:51,360
 Here, you left this morning without your lunch box.

293
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,360
 Oh, well, thanks very much.

294
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,800
 And Henry, when you come home from school this afternoon, you'll stop at the store and see

295
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,360
 if you can get 12 years of fresh picked corn.

296
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,360
 Corn?

297
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,360
 Yes.

298
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,360
 We've got corn.

299
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,360
 She was 12 bushels came this morning before I left the house.

300
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,360
 But Mother says we can't eat that, Henry.

301
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,360
 My goodness, how could we eat it?

302
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,620
 Why couldn't we?

303
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:11,820
 It's horse gone.

304
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:16,560
 [laughter]

305
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,360
 It's what corn costs?

306
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,200
 Horse?

307
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,200
 Horse?

308
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,200
 Does that mean we can't have the corn roast?

309
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:26,100
 Homer, that means if anything is going to be roasted, it'll be us.

310
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:33,040
 [applause]

311
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,040
 The Aldrich family will be back in just a moment, but first,

312
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:41,320
 Tonight on most of these same NBC stations, you can enjoy more comedy with Theatre Guild on the Air.

313
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:47,720
 This week Theatre Guild on the Air stars Van Hefflin and Rutherford and Kenny Delmar in George Washington slept here.

314
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:54,760
 Already seen on Broadway and a hit in the movies, this George S. Corp and Mosshard comedy deals with a city man who discovers the country,

315
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:58,120
 where running water usually means there's a brook in the backyard.

316
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:03,240
 Here in Theatre Guild on the Air's presentation of George Washington slept here later this evening.

317
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:08,720
 And finally, no program lineup would be complete without some of the top NBC news shows.

318
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,320
 And Sunday is no exception.

319
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,040
 For tonight, NBC brings you "Moth Around Trees Meet the Press."

320
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:17,080
 Tonight's second-use feature is the American Forum of the Air,

321
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:21,200
 and the discussion topic is "Which Party is the Working Man's Friend?"

322
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,760
 Offering as guest panel members, Secretary of Labor, Maurice Tobin,

323
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:27,920
 and Fred Hartley, co-author of the Taft Hartley Labor Act.

324
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,120
 Your moderator will be Theodore Grannick.

325
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,880
 Yes, that's the NBC program scheduled for tonight.

326
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,880
 Just stay tuned for the tops in radio.

327
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:42,520
 [Music]

328
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:45,520
 And now getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldrich.

329
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:50,160
 Henry and Homer have talked to junior class into holding a corn roast instead of a dance

330
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,960
 in order to sell their 12 bushels of corn.

331
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,520
 While congratulating themselves on their success,

332
00:13:55,520 --> 00:14:00,400
 they learn that they have in their possession not sweet corn, but horse corn.

333
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,400
 The scene opens that afternoon in the Aldrich basement.

334
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:08,100
 Understand, Henry, I'm not criticizing your father, but don't you think he should have

335
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,800
 known this was horse corn?

336
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,320
 Why should he have?

337
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,800
 After all, my father's a lawyer, not a farmer.

338
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,800
 To him, corn is corn.

339
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,080
 Well, listen, Henry, I've been thinking.

340
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:22,280
 Couldn't we still sell it to the class, even if it is really just for horses?

341
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,080
 Look, Homer, you see this front tooth?

342
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,080
 Yes?

343
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,240
 I lost that tooth once, biting into an air of horse corn.

344
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,240
 Looks alright to me.

345
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,640
 Sure, I threw out again.

346
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,240
 But the one I had, I lost.

347
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,240
 You did?

348
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,240
 Sure.

349
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,440
 And do you want us to be responsible for the whole class losing their front teeth?

350
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:41,280
 Well, couldn't we soak it in butter and soften it up a little?

351
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,560
 And not serve it until after dark?

352
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,560
 No, Homer.

353
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:48,960
 Oh, well here we are Henry, stuck with those 12 bushels of horse food and the whole junior

354
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:52,800
 class is waiting for something to eat.

355
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,800
 [Music]

356
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,300
 [Music]

357
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,300
 Mother, please let me finish!

358
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:03,300
 Eleanor, I don't want to hear another word about the class dance.

359
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,800
 Mother, it isn't to be a dance, it's to be a corn roast,

360
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,300
 and Henry Aldrich expects me to go with him.

361
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:11,800
 But you're not going out and by close just for a corn roast.

362
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,800
 We bought you a lovely taffet address to dance in.

363
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,800
 I understand.

364
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,300
 Why aren't you having the dance?

365
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:21,800
 Henry thought it would be much more original for us not to have one.

366
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,960
 Well, you have plenty of clothes that are good enough to eat corn in.

367
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,800
 But nothing that Henry hasn't seen me in before.

368
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,560
 And this is going to be a very original occasion.

369
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:34,200
 There, you can't expect me to buy your address for every single occasion.

370
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,720
 It's silly Eleanor.

371
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,720
 But mother, I'll economize.

372
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:41,320
 I'll get something like a wear to corn roasts and weenie roasts.

373
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:45,160
 Oh, mother, if I don't get a new dress, I'll just die. I know which.

374
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:48,360
 Oh, I'd have a hard time explaining that to your father.

375
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,360
 Oh, I'll die.

376
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,360
 Oh, right.

377
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:55,360
 Can you meet me at the Emporium tomorrow?

378
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,360
 Oh, yes, Mother, and thank you.

379
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,360
 I saw just the thing down there I have in mind.

380
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,360
 It's good night where you are, Mother.

381
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,360
 I'll answer the phone for you.

382
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,360
 Hello?

383
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,360
 Hello, is this Eleanor?

384
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:09,360
 Yes, this is Betty. I just had a great idea.

385
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,360
 What about?

386
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,360
 Well, you know that cornrolls we're having?

387
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,360
 Yes.

388
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,360
 Well, my uncle has a cabin down by the lake,

389
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,360
 and I ask him whether the whole class could meet there.

390
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,360
 And what do you think, Eleanor?

391
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:24,240
 He said he'd be very glad to let us have it, and he's sending two men out there to get the whole thing cleaned up for us.

392
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,240
 Really? Yes. I think it's a very original idea, don't you?

393
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,240
 Yes, I was just telling my mother.

394
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,360
 And what else do you think?

395
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,000
 What?

396
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,800
 But Dennis is gonna take the brace off my teeth.

397
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,000
 He is?

398
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,080
 And the special favor, just for the weekend.

399
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,440
 That's wonderful.

400
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,560
 No, why?

401
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,160
 Am I looking forward to it?

402
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,360
 I should imagine.

403
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,960
 I think it's terribly exciting.

404
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,160
 I should think you were.

405
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,440
 And how?

406
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,440
 You know what's been here since I've eaten sweet corn?

407
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,440
 Hey!

408
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,440
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

409
00:16:53,440 --> 00:17:01,440
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

410
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:07,440
 Quiet, please. Quiet. Why can't we have an orderly clash meeting for a change?

411
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:10,440
 Gee Henry, everything's going swell. They haven't even mentioned the corn roast.

412
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,440
 Quiet, Homer. I think they've forgotten they voted on.

413
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:15,440
 Quiet, please. Quiet.

414
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:19,880
 The next item on the agenda is report on the corn roast.

415
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,380
 Where is Henry Orich?

416
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:22,380
 Oh boy, who?

417
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:23,380
 There he is, Mr. President.

418
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:25,380
 Is that Orich back in the corner?

419
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:26,380
 Yes.

420
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,380
 Yes, Mr. President.

421
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,980
 Will you make a report?

422
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:32,780
 Well, I'd like to say a few words on that subject.

423
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:37,760
 It has come to my attention that some of the people around here are a little upset by the

424
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,800
 corn situation.

425
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:43,540
 We've always been pretty proud of the harmony in the class, and I think would be a great

426
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:48,340
 mistake if we let an innocent suggestion by me about having a cornrow split us wide open.

427
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:55,140
 After all, we have our annual what you may call it's to have a good time. And for that

428
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:59,940
 reason I think it's foolish to go ahead willy-nilly with a cornrow. I second the motion. No motion

429
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:07,060
 has been made yet, Norman. Then I second it when it's me. Oh, you're out of water. You

430
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:10,020
 That's so well just as a matter of principle I like to know

431
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:16,940
 To a corn rose tan rate what are you suggesting its place?

432
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:22,860
 We girls have a right to know where we stand around here

433
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:31,580
 And don't misunderstand me Betty I think we ought to have a dance and corn

434
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:36,820
 Only only working together so that everybody will be satisfied and that won't be any hard feelings

435
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:39,740
 Well

436
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:44,100
 Why couldn't we show a little originality and initially I'm gonna have sort of a farm dance

437
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,820
 You know what I mean?

438
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:51,040
 The only not a plain ordinary barn dance. This would be different the decorating

439
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:55,060
 Nothing but ears of corn. Mr. President. I second that motion

440
00:18:57,060 --> 00:19:01,060
 I can't have corn to eat instead of just corn for decorations.

441
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:05,060
 Because along this time of the year, Toby, you take corn for instance.

442
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:10,060
 It's very colorful and nice to look at, while sweet corn is liable to be tough.

443
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:13,060
 If you don't want to lose a tooth when you're out on a social event, do you?

444
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:15,060
 I can take care of my teeth.

445
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:18,060
 But I say why take a chance?

446
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:22,060
 After all, we can eat corn any old time. Why get into a rut?

447
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:27,100
 I think we ought to be the first class in the history of Central High or any other school

448
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:31,060
 that has the originality and initiative to have a plain card dance.

449
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:35,060
 [cheering]

450
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:37,060
 Mr. President, I have the floor for...

451
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:39,060
 Yes, my name is...

452
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:43,060
 Order, please. The chair recognizes on our work worth...

453
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:46,060
 Mr. President, I'd like to protest.

454
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:49,060
 Just because the majority in this class is composed of boys,

455
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:53,060
 That doesn't give the boys any right to change their minds every ten seconds.

456
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:56,060
 We girls have a right to know what's going to happen to us!

457
00:19:56,060 --> 00:20:00,060
 I demand that a ball be taken!

458
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,060
 No, wait a minute, Eleanor!

459
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:07,060
 I demand that a ball be taken on our having a simple, informal dance in evening clothes!

460
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:08,060
 No!

461
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:09,060
 Yes!

462
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:10,060
 No!

463
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:13,060
 Mr. President, Mr. President, Mr. President!

464
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:14,060
 Mr. President!

465
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:22,800
 [Music]

466
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,760
 Mother, did you hear what happened at Henry School today?

467
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,760
 No Mary.

468
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:30,760
 My goodness, I don't know what started it, but one of the classes practically had a riot.

469
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:31,760
 Really?

470
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:35,960
 I understand they had to call in six hall monitors and the gym teacher to quiet them down.

471
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:36,960
 What was the trouble?

472
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,960
 I don't know, but they tell me the class is in a terrible condition.

473
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,960
 Nobody's speaking to anybody.

474
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:47,960
 There's even some talk of when they graduate, they're going to have two separate commencements.

475
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:48,960
 Or four!

476
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:54,960
 Well, all the girls say they won't be seen graduating from the same platform as the boys.

477
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:55,960
 What is the living home?

478
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:56,960
 Is that you, Henry?

479
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:57,960
 Yes, mother.

480
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:58,960
 Oh, Mrs. Aldrich.

481
00:20:58,960 --> 00:20:59,960
 Hi, Mary.

482
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:00,960
 Hello, Homer.

483
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,960
 Henry, how on earth did you get your shirt torn?

484
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:04,960
 My shirt?

485
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:05,960
 My shirt?

486
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:06,960
 Oh, Gee whiz.

487
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,960
 Do you know who I think tore it, Henry?

488
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:09,960
 Oh, Betty.

489
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,960
 When did she do that?

490
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,220
 Right after Natalie White slapped his face.

491
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:18,760
 Henry, why don't you slap your face for?

492
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,360
 I took the floor away from her.

493
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,360
 The floor?

494
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,360
 You blocked?

495
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,360
 I took the floor away from her.

496
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,360
 We had a class meeting.

497
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,560
 Homer, you better get some Akira Crump for your face.

498
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,760
 It's all scratched up.

499
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,260
 That was Madeline Miller.

500
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:34,460
 Yeah, I goodness, she must have long fingernails.

501
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,460
 Not anymore.

502
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:41,460
 Henry, you didn't get into a fight with any of the girls, did you?

503
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:43,900
 She was no. I was a gentleman through the whole thing.

504
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:47,060
 I don't understand what caused the whole thing.

505
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:50,340
 Well, we had what you might call a close vote.

506
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:52,700
 See, Mother? But we got it through, didn't we, Henry?

507
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,620
 What did you get through?

508
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:56,500
 Oh, just a little motion I made.

509
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,500
 Listen, Mother, where'd you put the corn?

510
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,340
 The corn?

511
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:00,780
 Sure, my 12 bushels.

512
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:02,780
 Oh, no, it isn't Mrs. Aldrich.

513
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,660
 Yes, it is, Homer.

514
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:06,260
 Mary, we were just down there.

515
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:08,060
 And there wasn't even one basket there.

516
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:09,540
 Well, I don't understand.

517
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:12,300
 Mother, did you go out at all the day?

518
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,200
 Yes, I did.

519
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,600
 Did you lock all the doors?

520
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,100
 Oh, but the back door.

521
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,200
 Oh, boy.

522
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,900
 You think our corn's been stolen him?

523
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,700
 Sure it has, Homer. Sure it has.

524
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,400
 There don't be ridiculous.

525
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,200
 No one is going to steal 12 bushels of corn you can't eat.

526
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:26,900
 Corn?

527
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:29,100
 You boys aren't worried about the corn, are you?

528
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,100
 We sure are, Father.

529
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:30,900
 Hello, Sam.

530
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:31,500
 Hello, dear.

531
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,300
 Do you know anything about the corn, Sam?

532
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,600
 I certainly do.

533
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,200
 Who took it?

534
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,300
 Who took it, I did.

535
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:37,100
 You did?

536
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:39,700
 After all, I wasn't going to let Mr. Frederick stick.

537
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:42,620
 my own son with the load of useless horse corn.

538
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:43,500
 No sir.

539
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:46,260
 So I just went out there and made him take it back.

540
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:47,860
 You haven't got the corn anymore?

541
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:49,140
 I should say not.

542
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:51,500
 Did Mr. Fredericks give you the money?

543
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,340
 No, potatoes.

544
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:55,780
 [LAUGHTER]

545
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:57,260
 Potatoes?

546
00:22:57,260 --> 00:23:00,180
 Nobody puts anything over on Sam always let me tell you,

547
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:01,860
 I'm a pretty sharp trader, you know.

548
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:03,340
 But father, you're all rich.

549
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,340
 No bother to thank me.

550
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:06,700
 It was my own fault for not being more careful in the first place.

551
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:07,900
 But father, you're all rich.

552
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:10,500
 I let him know quite plainly I would stand for no nonsense.

553
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,660
 But, Paul, Mr. Oldrich!

554
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:24,500
 Look, Daddy, see that window in the Emporium? That person, the senator?

555
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:28,500
 Yeah, that's exactly like the one I got for the corn roast. Only mine was blue.

556
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,100
 And they won't let you take it back?

557
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:32,900
 No, that's why my mother's so mad at our class.

558
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:37,300
 Well, look, Daddy, I guess you're going on and this is about as far as I go.

559
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,500
 Well, I'll see you tomorrow.

560
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,340
 Goodbye.

561
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:40,180
 - Bye.

562
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:41,020
 - Bye.

563
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:43,060
 - Oh, hello mother.

564
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:45,300
 I wondered whether you'd be here.

565
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,620
 - Now Eleanor, are you sure you have to buy

566
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:50,260
 a special outfit just for a barn, Dan?

567
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:51,820
 - Oh my goodness, yes.

568
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:53,900
 After all, I can't wear a corn roast dress

569
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:56,860
 to a corn dance, especially when the whole dance

570
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:58,520
 was Henry's idea.

571
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,100
 (upbeat music)

572
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:08,600
 Quietly! Quiet!

573
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:11,800
 Henry, what are we gonna do?

574
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,700
 Let's just wait and see if something happens.

575
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,300
 Well, we're still stuck with the potatoes.

576
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,400
 Homer, relax. Take it easy.

577
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,000
 My father says that's a trouble.

578
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,300
 We've been taking it easy when we should have been tough.

579
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,900
 I'm gonna make a motion. What motion?

580
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:23,900
 I don't know yet.

581
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:26,100
 But Mr. President, Homer Brown...

582
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,300
 I had the floor first.

583
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,300
 Nobody recognized you.

584
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,300
 Sit down.

585
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:31,300
 Sit down, Homer.

586
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:35,000
 As long as there is some doubt about who had the floor first,

587
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 I think we should recognize the young lady.

588
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 (cheering)

589
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 Thank you Mr. President.

590
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 I'm glad to see there's a little chivalry left in this school.

591
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 Mr. President, this is a matter of principle!

592
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 Betty Noten has the floor.

593
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 Thank you.

594
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 I should like to bring to your attention an article in today's school paper, which is the most sensible thing I've ever read in my life.

595
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 It's called "In These Times."

596
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 It says, "In these times it hardly seems fitting in proper for students who are planning a dance to spend their money on unnecessary decorations."

597
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,720
 decorations such as corn. If the junior class really wants to hold a dad so it

598
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,640
 will be long remembered, why don't they give a dance without the decorations and

599
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,360
 show a little originality and initiative by contributing that money in the fall of

600
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:20,080
 food like potatoes.

601
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:25,360
 They are very generous and appreciated steps and would eliminate a lot of

602
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:30,080
 worries. Time a loyal classmate.

603
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,280
 Mr. President, why must it be potatoes?

604
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:36,280
 Because in the staff of life, that's Brad.

605
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:39,280
 The professor told me the person who wrote that article

606
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,280
 knew what he was talking about.

607
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,280
 And we're going to carry out his wishes.

608
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:45,280
 Mr. President, I make a motion that this class give a dance,

609
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:49,280
 just a plain informal dance, an evening dress,

610
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,280
 without any other decoration.

611
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:55,280
 And then we use the proceeds to buy potatoes for people that are worried.

612
00:25:55,280 --> 00:26:00,280
 Mr. President, Henry Olrich, I just want to say that since I was the one who first

613
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:05,200
 suggested the court dance after hearing that article I'm ashamed of myself I

614
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:13,480
 not only would grow my suggestion but I second Betty's motion hey Henry who wrote

615
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:18,360
 that article what do you think why didn't you tell me I even put the paper on

616
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:22,360
 Betty's desk hey Homer Homer there's a fella in the hall it wants to see you he

617
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:26,280
 wants to see me who is it I don't know somebody just told me come on Homer let's

618
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:31,740
 get out we're sitting pretty I'll say we are order order all those in favor of

619
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:36,540
 our country the banks proceeds to potatoes you said that's ready for corn please

620
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:47,100
 say hi Henry do you see anyone out here no hello Homer father what are you doing

621
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:50,980
 here I just went out and had a talk with that farmer who owed you money you did

622
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:55,740
 mr. Brown yes sir and I fixed things I told him he couldn't unload first horse

623
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:58,140
 and then old potatoes that were even sprouting.

624
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:59,740
 Maybe he could do that to Sam Alrich,

625
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:01,340
 but he couldn't do it to me.

626
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:03,140
 You mean you got our money, Father?

627
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:05,540
 No, he didn't have any cash.

628
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:09,140
 But I made him come across with 25 baskets of spinach.

629
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:11,140
 Spinnish!

630
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:15,140
 Oh boy, Homer, not even the poor will take spinach!

631
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:17,140
 [applause]

632
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:26,140
 [applause]

633
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:30,140
 Within the next 20 seconds that fire will break out somewhere in the United States,

634
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:34,140
 yes, there are 4,600 fires in America each day.

635
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:38,140
 By obeying a few simple rules, we can protect ourselves from dis-devastating menace.

636
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:43,140
 Don't smoke in bed or discard lighted cigarettes carelessly, and be careful with matches.

637
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:47,640
 Remember, it doesn't pay to gamble with fire. You can't win.

638
00:27:47,640 --> 00:28:00,340
 Hello?

639
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:02,140
 And just one more thing, Henry.

640
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:03,340
 Wasn't she again, Eleanor?

641
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:06,140
 It certainly is the more I think about it.

642
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:09,140
 A spinach dance! A spinach dance!

643
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:11,640
 And I have a brand new yellow chafeta!

644
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:15,140
 Well, couldn't you go as a slice of egg?

645
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:17,140
