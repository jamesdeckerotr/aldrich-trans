 Thank you, Alice.

 What have you spoke of in the henry this morning?

22
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,880
 Got into him in what way?

00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:27,760
 Oh, my goodness.

24
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,600
 Didn't you hear him in the bathroom?

25
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,440
 He was brushing his teeth and whistling

26
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,120
 at the top of his lungs.

27
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,720
 Alice, that can't be done.

28
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,000
 Well, there he was doing it.

 Good morning, Mother. Good morning, Father.

00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,160
 Good morning, Father.

34
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,160
 Yeah. How do you feel?

35
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:51,160
 Oh, I wonder. Pass the cereal, please.

36
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,160
 You're good. Eat cereal voluntarily.

37
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:56,160
 Oh, sure, Mother. If there's one thing I feel like this morning,

38
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,160
 it's great, not.

39
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,160
 See, stick out your tongue. My tongue?

40
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,160
 No, I'll let it.

41
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,160
 Oh, I'll let it in.

42
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:06,160
 Henry, it's necessary for you to be in quite such good spirit.

43
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,160
 You're worrying, your mother.

44
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:15,160
 Well, I was gonna save it for a surprise, but what's the best news in the world I could give both of you?

45
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:18,160
 You've discovered oil and I can retire.

46
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,160
 Father!

47
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,160
 Henry, you passed your history exam.

48
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:25,160
 Ask that mother. I got the highest mark in the class.

49
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,160
 Sam, did you hear that?

50
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,160
 I think I did, but I'd like to hear it again.

51
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,160
 The highest finish?

52
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,160
 Sure. Well, that's fine, sir.

53
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:36,160
 The highest mark imagined my song.

54
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,160
 Well, that's not the good news.

55
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,160
 I'm going to be the regular shortstop on the baseball team.

56
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,160
 What?

57
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,160
 That's nice. Congratulations, Henry.

58
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,160
 Nice, mother.

59
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,160
 Only try to be careful when the other boys tackle you.

60
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,160
 Mother!

61
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,160
 Well, Henry, shortstop, eh?

62
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,160
 Yes, sir.

63
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,160
 First thing, eh?

64
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:58,160
 First thing, well, well, well, well.

65
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,160
 When did Coach Nelson tell you, Henry?

66
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,160
 Tell me what?

67
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,160
 He kept you with the first thing, shortstop.

68
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:06,520
 He didn't exactly tell me in so many words, Father.

69
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,020
 No.

70
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,760
 I'm not in so many words.

71
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,760
 What did he tell you?

72
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,560
 Well, Father, I didn't have to be told.

73
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,760
 It's obvious.

74
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,260
 Sam, let him finish his breakfast.

75
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,200
 He'll be late for school.

76
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,560
 In a moment, Alice.

77
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,960
 And they would do mind telling me how it is obvious.

78
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,360
 Father, do you remember Steve Armstrong?

79
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,560
 Wasn't he the regular shortstop last season?

80
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,840
 Sure, that's just it.

81
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,120
 He's not around this year.

82
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,160
 He had a fortunate accident.

83
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:28,720
 Accident.

84
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,960
 Sure, he graduated.

85
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,760
 When his nomination moved to Abbott City,

86
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,100
 and that's just like Willie Marshall and me.

87
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,800
 And you're that much better than Willie?

88
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,640
 No, but he flunked his history exam

89
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,140
 and so he's ineligible.

90
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:42,880
 And don't you think I'm a pushover?

91
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,440
 No, suppose some boy you don't even know about shows up

92
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,480
 at practice and take short stuff away from you.

93
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,520
 Father, you're talking just like a lawyer.

94
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,080
 I am a lawyer.

95
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,520
 Santa, hand me to your confidant, he's a pushover.

96
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,720
 Well, that's, he's just counting his chickens

97
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,560
 before their hats.

98
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,840
 But, gee, was they even gave me a uniform?

99
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,560
 That's how sad I am.

100
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,240
 You had a uniform last year?

101
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,040
 Sure, but this one fits.

102
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,880
 And he even got another on it.

103
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,780
 He was last year.

104
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:10,440
 They wouldn't let anyone know who I was.

105
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,040
 And the evidence certainly sounds very convincing.

106
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,360
 Alex, I'm not saying Henry won't be the shortstop.

107
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,240
 I just think he ought to keep quiet about it

108
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,240
 until he's certain.

109
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,040
 But, Paul--

110
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,200
 Then Henry, there'll be no chance

111
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,840
 of you making a fool of yourself.

112
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,440
 Hey, Henry.

113
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,320
 Oh, she was--

114
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,920
 Is that a homer already?

115
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,360
 I had the same reaction.

116
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,880
 I'll be right with you, Homer.

117
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,280
 Henry, your breakfast.

118
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,200
 Mother, I finished all.

119
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,200
 But a few great nuts and I'll crunch them on the way to school.

120
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,200
 Hi, Homer.

121
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,200
 Henry, hurry up. We're gonna be late.

122
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,200
 What are you eating?

123
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,200
 Not in my breakfast.

124
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,200
 Yeah?

125
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:45,200
 If I ever mention I'm crazy about great enough, Homer, I need my strength.

126
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:48,200
 Oh, do you mind if I hold my palm under and catch what falls?

127
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,200
 Okay.

128
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,200
 What are you gonna do with that glove?

129
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,200
 This glove? This baseball glove?

130
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,200
 Yeah.

131
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,200
 Nothing, Homer. Nothing.

132
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,200
 Oh, it's across the street.

133
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,200
 Henry, are you turning out to the team again?

134
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,200
 I'm trying out power if you only knew.

135
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,200
 You know what?

136
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,200
 I think I'm a...

137
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,200
 And quit trying to make me make a fool of myself.

138
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,200
 Can we tell me?

139
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,200
 No.

140
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,200
 Please.

141
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,200
 No!

142
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,200
 It'll be on my mind all day.

143
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,200
 I have enough trouble concentrating on my curriculum.

144
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,200
 Well...

145
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,200
 ...comer...

146
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,200
 ...can you keep your mouth shut?

147
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,200
 You know me, Henry.

148
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,200
 That's what I mean.

149
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,200
 Can you keep your mouth shut?

150
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,200
 Scout on!

151
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,200
 Well, look.

152
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,200
 I'll tell you this and no more.

153
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,200
 Did you know Steve Armstrong is out of school?

154
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,200
 Sure.

155
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,200
 The lucky dog graduated.

156
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,200
 Well did you also know Tommy Dixon moved to Abbott City?

157
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,200
 Yeah.

158
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,200
 And did you know Willie Marshall?

159
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,200
 Plant history and it's ineligible.

160
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,200
 Can we hear the new short stop?

161
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,200
 The Homer stop putting words into my mouth.

162
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:56,200
 I had a few of those white books.

163
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,200
 Yeah, I was just about to hear it.

164
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,200
 Come on, come on.

165
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:01,200
 - Henry! Henry, wait for me!

166
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,200
 - Kathleen, what are you doing on the bowl field

167
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,200
 in civilian clothes?

168
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:09,200
 - Henry, Toby Smith, just tell me you were all set for shortstop.

169
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,200
 - Well, she was. Toby told you that?

170
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,200
 - Yeah.

171
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,200
 - Well, gee, who is?

172
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:18,200
 - That just shows how people twist innocent little statements around.

173
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:22,200
 All I said to Toby was that when he takes the official pictures of the team,

174
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:26,200
 I'd like an enlargement of shortstop to give them to my mother on her birthday.

175
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,800
 Oh, then it is true.

176
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:34,680
 Well, all I can tell you, Kathleen, is that at the end of the season, I may have a little

177
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,680
 something for your charm bracelet.

178
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,680
 My charm bracelet?

179
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,440
 And it isn't gold, is it?

180
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,440
 Well, I had my thing.

181
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,440
 And love?

182
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,440
 Well, I...

183
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,440
 And you're giving me your gold bar sitting face for...

184
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:49,440
 And now, Kathleen, I didn't mention anything specifically.

185
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,280
 Okay, well, you wouldn't be able to go over here.

186
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,280
 Oh, boy, that's Coach Nelson.

187
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,280
 I have to go now, Kathleen.

188
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,040
 - I'm gonna get my car, can you?

189
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,540
 - I'm gonna get you, wait for me!

190
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:01,040
 - All right, were you calling on, coach?

191
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,240
 - Yes, get out there, sure.

192
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,040
 I'm gonna hit some grounders for feeling practice.

193
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,120
 - Sure thing, coach.

194
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,880
 - Now, that's where the old pepper boys come on.

195
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,720
 - I'm coming on, I'm coming on.

196
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,280
 - Let's go, guys, get me old pepper,

197
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,240
 the old pepper, old pepper, old boy, old boy, old boy!

198
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,920
 - Okay, here it comes, all right.

199
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,560
 - I got a little waterfall!

200
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,560
 - Oh, he's coming on!

201
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,200
 - He was where did it go?

202
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,400
 - He's playing your leg.

203
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,600
 - But did, how to get down there?

204
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,840
 Okay, fine again, over. Get down a little lower.

205
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,160
 Here come.

206
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,520
 I got it, Paul!

207
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,020
 No!

208
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:35,200
 He was, was that the ball that bounced over my head?

209
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,160
 Oh, which I didn't mean that low.

210
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:40,160
 Coach, are you sure those balls are perfectly round?

211
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:40,820
 No.

212
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,520
 What's the matter with you?

213
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:46,800
 Well, I don't want you to think I'm making excuses, Coach, but...

214
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,560
 You see this, Glove.

215
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,720
 What's wrong with it?

216
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,640
 I'm glad you asked.

217
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:55,640
 She was my father used it to rip barbed wire off the backyard fence.

218
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,340
 I see.

219
00:07:56,340 --> 00:08:00,140
 But I'm planning on taking it to the shoemakers right after we're through.

220
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:01,540
 And maybe you better do it now.

221
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:03,140
 You're excused with the rest of practice.

222
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:04,840
 Okay everybody, over the sliding fence.

223
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:07,740
 Thanks, coach, and you'll see a big difference tomorrow.

224
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:08,740
 Hi!

225
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:09,940
 She was Agman.

226
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,940
 Why can't I not claw out of you?

227
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,740
 I might claw out of your shed.

228
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:14,940
 Agnes, quit!

229
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,440
 That's my throwing hand.

230
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,440
 Say you won't be getting too gall-based, Bob, will you?

231
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,840
 Well, she was.

232
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,600
 Did Kathleen tell you about that?

233
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,240
 No, Margot Hammersmith.

234
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,720
 Well, how could she? I don't even know her.

235
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,440
 Sure, but she poncied our job,

236
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,360
 and Lubble poncied our Kathleen.

237
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,200
 Boy, where's Kathleen now?

238
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,160
 So we're being pumped by Nancy Adams.

239
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,720
 So we're saving you to get a good old baseball,

240
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:39,080
 you won't forget your old power, Agnes Lee.

241
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,480
 Well, listen Agnes, I'll thank you not to go counting any chickens.

242
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,520
 But when did I do that?

243
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,400
 You know, darn well, the next thing you know,

244
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,640
 it'll be all over school, and there I'll be making a fool of myself.

245
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,680
 Listen, kid, you don't have to worry about me.

246
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,980
 I can keep a secret as well as the next dog.

247
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,980
 Sweet John, wait a minute!

248
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:57,480
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

249
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:06,680
 Good morning, Mr. Bradley.

250
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,120
 Oh, yes.

251
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,040
 Come in, Mr. Nelson.

252
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,280
 You wanted the scene, Ian?

253
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,480
 Yes, I did, Mr. Bradley.

254
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,880
 If it's about new equipment for your baseball team,

255
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,640
 Mr. Nelson, I must warn you that the entire school is

256
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,680
 on a very strict budget this year.

257
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,360
 Budget?

258
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:22,080
 But Mr. Bradley, the number of broken bats we had last year

259
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,560
 when balanced against the results achieved

260
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,280
 was quite often proportion.

261
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,580
 Quite often proportion.

262
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:28,880
 Well, I'm aware of that, Mr. Bradley,

263
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,640
 and that isn't the reason I'm here.

264
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,040
 It's about Willie Marshall.

265
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:32,700
 Willie?

266
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:33,280
 Yes.

267
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,920
 We've been practicing for nearly a week now,

268
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,280
 and well, couldn't you ask Ms. Eggleston

269
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,080
 to let him take a makeup exam?

270
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,440
 Well, no, I'm not sure I could do a thing like that,

271
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,120
 Mr. Nelson.

272
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,880
 Mr. Bradley, he's our best shortstop.

273
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,960
 We're not here to play baseball, Mr. Nelson.

274
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,160
 The boy is expected to have scholastic standing.

275
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,160
 I know then that one thing really seems to have very little love.

276
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,160
 Oh, well, hey, but our first game is this coming Friday.

277
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:58,160
 And if I can't get Willie, I'll have to use Henry Orrich at shortstop.

278
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,160
 Henry? Yes. At shortstop? Yes.

279
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:05,160
 I'm, uh... He's five-starred enough, but he just isn't up to it.

280
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:08,160
 So if you could put a little pressure on Miss Eggleston,

281
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,160
 uh, Mr. Nelson, I am afraid. This is a matter for Miss Eggleston to decide for herself.

282
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,160
 Oh, well, I tried. I'd better get back to my chemistry class.

283
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:18,940
 chemistry class yes you better I hope it's still there when I left Homer Brown was

284
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:24,120
 trying to make synthetic rock over hurry mr. Nelson and would you ask

285
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:28,920
 this shade to step in here please Mr. Bradley would like to see you yes

286
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:32,740
 it's rather would you say to know to me take a step and say I'd like to see her

287
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:36,880
 when she's free yes mr. Bradley tell her it's about that series of slides on the

288
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,240
 wall of 1812 she's been asking for but mr. Bradley I thought you decided we

289
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,200
 couldn't afford though I know mr. but it certainly won't hurt to discuss the matter

290
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:57,080
 Well, good morning, Mr. Albers. Good morning, your head's a...

291
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:01,080
 Has that new golf bag I wanted to ride? Why, no, Mr. Albers.

292
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,200
 I told you it probably wouldn't be until the end of the month.

293
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,200
 That's right, you're dead. I'll call you when I arrive.

294
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,200
 Good. Good.

295
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:12,200
 Say, as long as I'm here, what have you in the way of baseball gloves?

296
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,200
 baseball glove?

297
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,000
 I'm not even a market for one yet, you understand, but it can't hurt the price what you have.

298
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,400
 So the glove you have in mind isn't stock right now.

299
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,200
 The one made especially for short stock.

300
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,200
 Short stock?

301
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,200
 Yes, isn't that position Henry plays on the team?

302
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,200
 Yes.

303
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,200
 That is, no.

304
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:29,200
 That is, how did you, well, you see when, not at all, sure, yes.

305
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,200
 No?

306
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,200
 Well, I heard from a number of people that he's all set.

307
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,200
 You had?

308
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,200
 Yes, as a matter of fact, I was discussing it just yesterday with Walter Trumbull.

309
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,200
 And he lives at Mrs. Tonkins, you know.

310
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,200
 So what is that to do?

311
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,440
 Tomkins brothers generally down at the school so it's right from the horse's mouth you might say

312
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,240
 Well, is that cool? Yes

313
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:51,640
 Well, I'll tell you as long as I'm here. I might as well get that blob after all. I'll have to order from Chicago

314
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,920
 You have it in a week a week, but the first game is Friday

315
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,520
 Call Chicago and tell them to rush it out air mail with mr. All Richard will call out

316
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:01,240
 Pay the additional charges. We can't have the first drink short stop playing in a ripped glove

317
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:05,960
 Come in

318
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,880
 I'm going to see me.

319
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:08,640
 Oh, yes, Henry.

320
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,560
 Come here.

321
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,640
 Thanks, Coach.

322
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,760
 Did I mention all your worries are over?

323
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,240
 They are.

324
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:13,800
 Sure.

325
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,920
 Boy, I'm getting a glove that's so foolproof.

326
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,520
 They practically refund your money

327
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,160
 if you make a narrow with it.

328
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:19,760
 Fine, Henry.

329
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,800
 Fine.

330
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,920
 Henry, the reason I called you in.

331
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,200
 Yes, Coach?

332
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,080
 The reason I called you in.

333
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,480
 Henry, you know what I admire about you most?

334
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,480
 What, Coach?

335
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,440
 Your spirit.

336
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,040
 Yes, sir.

337
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,000
 Coming out for the team year after year.

338
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,680
 Never getting discouraged.

339
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,760
 You know what that proves to me?

340
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,260
 Why?

341
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:39,760
 But you realize that isn't only the man in the pictures, mounters, important.

342
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,260
 Oh, gee, Lee, sure, the shortstop's pretty important, too.

343
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:46,760
 Of course, but the man behind the scenes is sometimes just as valuable.

344
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,560
 He is?

345
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:50,060
 That's why I feel I can give you a job like this.

346
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:54,560
 Because you'll realize that tutoring Willie is as important as being out there on the field yourself.

347
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,260
 Why?

348
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:58,560
 Henry, Ms. Eggleston has agreed to give Willie a make-up exam tomorrow.

349
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,260
 But Coach, I...

350
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:00,260
 So what do you say, Henry?

351
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:01,560
 I know you can help him.

352
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,960
 You've got the highest marks in the class on that exam.

353
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,960
 Why

354
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:16,160
 Could I sort of get something straighten out in my mind first sure Henry well if will he passes he'll play shortstop in the game tomorrow

355
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,680
 Won't he why yes, but you'll be the one who made it possible. Oh

356
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,800
 So Henry, would you do it?

357
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,440
 Why

358
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:32,520
 Sure Henry, I'd like to shake your hand sure coach. Hey, shake. Yes, sir

359
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,780
 You've really got the kind of spirit I admire.

360
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,620
 She was. That's okay, cuz.

361
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:40,520
 I'm always glad to do what I can for the team.

362
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:48,520
 [music]

363
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,520
 Oh!

364
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:52,520
 The Big Red Letter stands for the Yellow Family.

365
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:56,520
 Oh! The Big Red Letter stands for the Yellow Family.

366
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,520
 That's Yellow.

367
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,520
 Yum, yum, yum.

368
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,520
 Yellow.

369
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,520
 What a jump, yum, yum.

370
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:11,520
 Yes, there are desserts for everybody's family and the jello family of yum yum desserts,

371
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:17,240
 like those swell jello tapioca puddings, a miracle of goodness, a marvel of speed, and

372
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:20,040
 jello tapioca puddings are ready prepared.

373
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:23,280
 All you do is add milk and cook for about five minutes.

374
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:28,600
 There's jello vanilla tapioca, luscious light and mellow, jello chocolate tapioca rich and

375
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,000
 candy good.

376
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,880
 orange coconut tapioca tangy orange blended with tropical coconut and you

377
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:39,440
 know that name jello is a trademark it's the property of general foods and it

378
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:44,120
 tells you you're getting a genuine jello product and remember more people by

379
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:49,960
 jello puddings than any other prepared puddings in the world

380
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:59,400
 And now getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldrich.

381
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:03,400
 Henry has been so confident he was going to make short stop on the baseball team

382
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:06,400
 that he spread the rumor all over school.

383
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:09,400
 Then Coach Nelson asked him to help Willie Marshall

384
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:13,400
 ask him to make up his Sam which would enable Willie to play short stop.

385
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:17,400
 The scene opens in the Aldrich living room. It is after dinner.

386
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,400
 Mother his father very upset.

387
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:23,400
 You know there he just got a walk in the fresh air might do in good.

388
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,120
 But in the future, Henry, when you have news like that,

389
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,320
 to tell him why not wait until after dinner.

390
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,040
 Hey, hey, my dear, when it comes,

391
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,200
 I put a bowl of fruit in the living room.

392
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,840
 Hi, Harold, Henry.

393
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,640
 Here I brought something to cheer you up.

394
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,440
 What is it?

395
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,000
 Bubble gum.

396
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,360
 I made it in chemistry.

397
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,360
 [LAUGHTER]

398
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,600
 And you're not really going to go through with helping, really, are you?

399
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,040
 Oh, I promised to be cold.

400
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,560
 You'll be cutting your own throat.

401
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:51,000
 I know besides Willie's too dumb to teach anything to.

402
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,080
 Well, it's you.

403
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:55,080
 You dumb, Homer, have you ever tried to do business with him?

404
00:15:55,080 --> 00:16:00,080
 I know, Henry. I know. But when it comes to history, he comes apart at the scenes.

405
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:05,080
 She was the only thing the Sega fans ever been able to make him understand is the Louisiana purchase.

406
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:08,080
 That's true. And she's a professional.

407
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,080
 That's okay.

408
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,080
 Homer, you're right. If it would...

409
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:14,080
 Moza would do Willie any good, I'd be glad to make the sacrifice.

410
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,080
 Hey, Henry!

411
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,080
 Here he is. And tell him you're not gonna do it.

412
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,080
 Hiya, fellas.

413
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,080
 Well, here I am, Hannah. Uh, uh, look, Willie.

414
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,680
 Boy, I sure appreciate what you're doing for me, Henry.

415
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,080
 - Oh, but-- - Willie, I've been thinking

416
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,080
 the whole thing over and I've decided,

417
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,580
 well, it isn't that you're hopeless, you understand?

418
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:30,480
 - I'm sorry, please answer the phone.

419
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,080
 - When I'm just about to break the news to Willie.

420
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,380
 - What's with about what, Henry?

421
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:36,380
 - See if please answer it, I'm busy.

422
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:38,080
 - Henry, wait here, Willie.

423
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,380
 - What am I hope with about Homer?

424
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:41,380
 - You're fine, now, please.

425
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:42,380
 - Hello?

426
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:44,080
 - I am. This is Toby Smith.

427
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,080
 - Hi.

428
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,080
 - Do you have a picture of yourself with a school paper?

429
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,080
 - Of me?

430
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:51,680
 We're gonna run a story on how you're sacrificing your skill for the good of the school

431
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:57,200
 Well Toby about that boy a lot of kids in the school have changed their entire conception of your character

432
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:01,520
 They have but so bring a picture to school tomorrow, will you so long, man?

433
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,520
 But Toby oh boy

434
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:10,300
 Is it alright to let willy have an apple considering you're throwing him out in a few minutes?

435
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:14,100
 Oh, I can throw him out now. I've got to try to help him pass

436
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,360
 Are you crazy?

437
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:18,600
 Or if I don't, I won't be able to show my face around the school again.

438
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,700
 But if you do, you will play short-stop.

439
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:23,400
 I know Homer, that's the spot I'm in.

440
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,900
 Willy!

441
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,300
 You're calling me Henry?

442
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:28,000
 You're gonna tell me why I'm not hopeful?

443
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 Willy, forget about that.

444
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,300
 Where's your book? We've got to start studying.

445
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:32,900
 Here it is.

446
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:36,300
 Willy, what did you have the most trouble with her in the exam?

447
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,000
 The date.

448
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,500
 When her number's not in dollars and cents, I just can't keep it in my head.

449
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:43,000
 The better one will probably ask me all about date.

450
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 Well, let's start with the date then.

451
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 When was the Constitution put into force?

452
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 The Constitution?

453
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 Yeah.

454
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 You want the day and the month of just the year?

455
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 The year, Willie, the year.

456
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 Oh, let's see now.

457
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 Well, then 1776, I know that.

458
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 That was the fourth of July.

459
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 (Laughter)

460
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 Willie, are you good?

461
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 Is that so?

462
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 I can name a president on every piece of money we've got.

463
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 Can you?

464
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 Willie, I've got to get you to remember.

465
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:17,300
 Look, the Constitution was signed in 1789, but don't think of it as 1789.

466
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:21,800
 Just think of it as $17.89.

467
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:25,000
 Yeah? Sure. I like you while buying a jacket, see?

468
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 Oh. What kind of a jacket?

469
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,500
 We need one fine.

470
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,500
 For the war caught in the law.

471
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,000
 What difference does that mean?

472
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,500
 Listen, hold on, I'm not paying $18.99 for a jacket. I don't know anything about it.

473
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,000
 [audience laughter]

474
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 Oh, Willie.

475
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 Oh, it will work.

476
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 Willie, forget about the jacket and see if you can remember this.

477
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 The Constitution, it was signed in 1789.

478
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 Say that wrong.

479
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 Sure. Now, when was the Constitution signed?

480
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 The Constitution, it was signed in 1789.

481
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 Hey, give me another and give me another.

482
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 (music)

483
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 William, now, show you may come in now.

484
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 Well, thank you, Ms. Eglison.

485
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 I don't want to rush you, but did I mention the game starts from half an hour?

486
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 I'm aware that, William.

487
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 Now, let's get right to the exam, shall we?

488
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 Yes, Ms. Eglison.

489
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 And I want to pray.

490
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 I certainly enjoyed those slides you showed the class today.

491
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 You did?

492
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 Sure.

493
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 Boy, I saw the whole war of 1812 in a different life.

494
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 That's fine.

495
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 Now, let's start.

496
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,560
 We'll take the exam early sort of word of mouth. Yes

497
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:41,360
 First question. What were the four phases of the revolution?

498
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,520
 For patients? Yes

499
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:53,200
 I know data your weak point so I decided to make the exam more general

500
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,700
 Jefferson went to Washington in 1801.

501
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:08,200
 (audience laughing)

502
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,880
 From that being one of the places, it could not.

503
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:15,360
 One of the, who's our first tariff bill to pass the Senate?

504
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,560
 Who, not one?

505
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,600
 You don't know that either.

506
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,120
 - Ms. Eggleston, it doesn't rhyme with anything.

507
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:20,960
 - Take your pardon.

508
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,960
 Well, I mean, is that the one that $17.99 says?

509
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,960
 (audience laughing)

510
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:36,960
 (music)

511
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,960
 Well, in the at least if you're a substitute, you can see the games for nothing.

512
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:45,960
 He was, what's so special about that? I mean, boy, have you ever sat on that bench, Homer?

513
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:49,960
 Hello. The sun's beating down on you all the time, you get sunburned.

514
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,960
 It's a hundred times more comfortable in the grandstand.

515
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:59,960
 Yeah, besides your right out in public view where everybody can can listen home.

516
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:02,960
 Or if I'd rather be a spectator, why should you worry?

517
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,960
 Oh, there you are, Henry.

518
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:05,960
 Hello, Father.

519
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:09,960
 Henry, you're a new club. Just arrived there, express. You might as well have it.

520
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,960
 But, Mr. All, the kid was turning in his uniform.

521
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,960
 Oh? Oh, I see.

522
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,960
 Oh, would you mind leaving for a moment?

523
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:17,960
 Leaving?

524
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,960
 I'd like to say something to Henry.

525
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,960

 Henry, may I ask why you are turning in your uniform?

529
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:37,960
 Well, since Willie's going to play short-sidy,

530
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,960
 so if you can't beat top man, you're going to take your ball and go home.

 Everybody couldn't have failed. I told him everything I know.
