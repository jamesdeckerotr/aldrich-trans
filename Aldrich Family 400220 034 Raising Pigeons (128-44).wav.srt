 The Aldrich family,

 starring as Reston,

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 written by Clifford Goldsmith,

 delicious new desserts

00:00:47,000 --> 00:01:10,520
 putting. In the month of February you know, fall the birthdays of two great American presidents.

18
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:15,100
 We don't know, of course, whether Henry Aldrich will ever become president, but as the scene

19
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:21,100
 opens tonight in the Aldrich family living room, Henry has a birthday and other things on his mother.

20
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:27,340
 Mother, if you could choose anything in the world for your birthday, what would you take?

21
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:31,820
 A million dollars. No mother, be reasonable. I can't give you as much as that.

22
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:38,860
 What would you like? Right at the moment, Henry, your mother would like a mink coat. A mink coat,

23
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:46,500
 father a mean coat how much would a thing like that cost how much do you have

24
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:53,020
 two dollars and thirty five cents oh but that's not important father no not at

25
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:57,460
 all but it isn't I've got a scheme all worked out I'll be able to get anything

26
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:02,500
 mother wants really dear it isn't anything more than you deserve mother could

27
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:07,100
 you loan me could you loan me two dollars there which one of us are you

28
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:11,820
 speaking. Oh not to you father. I realize I've stretched you to the breaking point as it is.

29
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:18,460
 I'm glad you're aware of that. How about it mother? How about what, dear? In case you don't

30
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:23,420
 know it, Alice, you're about to be stretched to the breaking point. What is it you want the two

31
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:29,100
 dollars for? To put with the money I have. I'm making an investment. I read a pamphlets see.

32
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:36,220
 It's got the easiest way I ever heard of to make money. What is it? Rabbits. I make up on. Raising

33
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:42,220
 rabbits. They'll double your money overnight. You don't say so. But they will, father, you can't lose.

34
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:47,100
 Where would we keep rabbits? In the basement. Well, we're not keeping rabbits in our basement.

35
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:53,020
 Read the pamphlet, mother. One fella started with just four rabbits, and in two years, he had 700.

36
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:59,100
 And do you think we're going to have 700 rabbits running all over our basement? Well, I'd make

37
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:04,300
 pens for them. And how would I get into the basement? You remember Henry that stray dog that stayed

38
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:07,300
 I had to ask you to feed her every day she was with us.

39
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,300
 But that was just one mother.

40
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:11,300
 I certainly wouldn't forget to feed 700.

41
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,300
 [laughter]

42
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:15,300
 Incidentally, who's going to pay for the feed for 700?

43
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,300
 Oh, they pay for it themselves.

44
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,300
 Oh, I see. Out of their own pockets?

45
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,300
 Father.

46
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,300
 Everything I suggest you take lightly.

47
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:26,300
 Oh, if you think I'm taking this lightly, you're quite mistaken.

48
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:28,300
 You're not going to spend any money on rabbits.

49
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:30,300
 But that's not what I want it for.

50
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,300
 I thought that was what you did want it for.

51
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,140
 - What was that?

52
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:34,900
 - Feeding pans for the rabbits.

53
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,220
 - For what rabbit?

54
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:38,940
 - For my rabbits, the ones I've got down in the cellar.

55
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,780
 (audience laughing)

56
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:43,020
 - You have 700 down there?

57
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:45,020
 - No, Father, just four.

58
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,180
 I'm only beginning.

59
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:48,620
 They're beauties, too.

60
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:49,620
 - Where did you get them, dear?

61
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,060
 - Happy Taylor game to me.

62
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,380
 - How did the Taylor Boy happen to do that?

63
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:54,460
 - I don't know.

64
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:56,460
 His folks just seemed to think we'd like them better

65
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:57,300
 than they would.

66
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:00,140
 (audience laughing)

67
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:00,980
 - I don't know.

68
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:03,020
 (audience laughing)

69
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:04,060
 - Yes.

70
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,620
 - How would you like to be generous, dear,

71
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,500
 and give them back to happy Taylor?

72
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,460
 - Mother, don't you want a birthday present?

73
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:11,540
 - Not as much as I want a home.

74
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:12,780
 - Well, if I give those back,

75
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,260
 I won't have anything at all.

76
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,740
 - How about your dog?

77
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:16,740
 - He left.

78
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:18,660
 - Because of the rabbits?

79
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:19,820
 - But, Father, don't you want me

80
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:23,220
 to develop responsibility, so I'll take care of things

81
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,340
 and feed them?

82
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:26,380
 - Henry, we are not opposed to your developing

83
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:28,460
 all the responsibility you want to,

84
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:31,540
 But you'll have to find someone to take those rabbits.

85
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:32,500
 - Who is there?

86
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,020
 - Well how about Tommy Walsh?

87
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:36,820
 He has a much larger house than we have.

88
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,760
 - Well, could I give him the rabbits,

89
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,220
 but let him keep them here?

90
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:42,260
 (audience laughing)

91
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:45,820
 - And your mother and I could live with the wolves, is it?

92
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:48,940
 - My father, you have no idea how I've planned on this.

93
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,540
 It's supposing you go to the phone, dear,

94
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:53,580
 and see whether Tommy wouldn't like to have them now.

95
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:57,780
 - Henry, if you want a rabbit for a pet, that's one thing.

96
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:00,980
 But you're not going to raise rabbits in our basement for the purpose of making money.

97
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,380
 Now, please call the waltchers.

98
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:03,780
 No phone number.

99
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,780
 I hope they are an inn.

100
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:09,780
 Well, Alice, in one year we would have had rabbits in every room in the house.

101
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:12,580
 Sam, don't you think we might at least get Henry a dog?

102
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,780
 Alice, by tomorrow you'll have forgotten the whole thing.

103
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:15,780
 Perhaps.

104
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:18,780
 You never has kept it anything for more than 24 hours.

105
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,780
 Well, just the same, he might have kept it this.

106
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:23,180
 You mean you want him to raise rabbits?

107
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:25,480
 Well, as he says, it would develop character.

108
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,480
 Alice, let's have an understanding right now.

109
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:32,080
 Which do you want Henry to have character or a father a father, dear?

110
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,620
 What do you suppose that can be at the door probably mr. Hubbard I'll let him in

111
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:46,360
 Well, oh there, but evening what is it you want prepared? Oh the troubles out in the kitchen pipe under the sink

112
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:52,060
 No, Henry, will you take mr. Hubbard out and show him where that leak is sure thing

113
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,960
 Tell me what I'll say about the rabbit.

114
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:59,480
 His folks weren't in, but he'd be very glad to take the mother.

115
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,680
 This way, Mr. Hubbard.

116
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,380
 Yes, sir.

117
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:04,760
 You raised rabbits?

118
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,160
 I was going to.

119
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,560
 Here you are.

120
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,080
 There's the pipe that's dripping.

121
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,000
 Oh, on the weather of a ranch that'll fit that or not.

122
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,920
 Want me to look in your bag for you?

123
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,680
 Yeah, no, thank you.

124
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,600
 It's a good thing you're getting out of this rabbit business.

125
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,840
 Don't you recommend it?

126
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:26,080
 I'd be a rich man now, but worn for rabbits.

127
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,040
 - What happened?

128
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:30,120
 - By the time it was over, even my wife left me.

129
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,120
 (audience laughs)

130
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:31,960
 - Yeah?

131
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,400
 But do you want me to hold a screwdriver for you?

132
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,360
 - Yeah, will you just put it down, please?

133
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,360
 - Sure.

134
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:42,400
 - I raised beavers once too.

135
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,120
 - Make a lot of money on them?

136
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,880
 - That was the second time my wife left me.

137
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,080
 - Well, did she ever come back?

138
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,560
 - She did, and she got even with me.

139
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,400
 How?

140
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,200
 She went in for raising turkeys.

141
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,720
 She make a lot of money?

142
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,200
 That was when I left her.

143
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,760
 (audience laughs)

144
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:04,320
 I see, well, tell me, did you ever raise silver foxes?

145
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,480
 Just for one winter.

146
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,400
 Now there was an experience.

147
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,760
 Yeah?

148
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:12,800
 If you want to make money real quick though,

149
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,520
 the thing to do is raise pigeons.

150
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,360
 Pigeons?

151
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,760
 Yeah, that's what I'm gonna put every cent I've got into.

152
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,680
 Is that right?

153
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:25,680
 Yes, sir. Once I get it going, I'm giving up plumbin'.

154
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,680
 Want me to hold that nut?

155
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,680
 Uh, just leave your hands over.

156
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,680
 Yes.

157
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:36,680
 I figured out there's 300 cent profit in every pigeon you raise.

158
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:40,680
 As much as that? What do you sell them for? Eating purposes?

159
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:45,680
 Don't raise that kind. I tried them once. I had to eat them all myself.

160
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,680
 Well, what kind do you raise?

161
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,120
 - Carriers. - Carriers?

162
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,120
 Is that right?

163
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,480
 - Oh.

164
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:57,160
 - The kind that get back home no matter where you take them, huh?

165
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,520
 - Yeah, there's my hammer.

166
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,720
 - Oh, let's see.

167
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,160
 Oh, here it is.

168
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,200
 - Leave it there, I'll pick it up.

169
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:07,600
 (audience laughing)

170
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,560
 - I knew fella once that raised carrier pigeons

171
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,200
 and sold them to the army.

172
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,480
 - Is that what you're going to do?

173
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,240
 - Yeah, and put them in races.

174
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,560
 That's where you make the real money.

175
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,720
 Sometimes you win as much as five or ten dollars.

176
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,840
 Gee whiz, I didn't know anything like that was going on.

177
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,440
 Oh, what is it you're looking for, Mr. Hubbard?

178
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,920
 And pair of pliers, just let me look for myself.

179
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:34,840
 Do you mind if I point to them?

180
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,760
 Where are they?

181
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,640
 Oh, yeah, I am.

182
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,960
 Gee, there's a business I'd like to go in.

183
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,160
 What's stopping you?

184
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:48,000
 Well, do pigeons take up very much room in the cellar?

185
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,760
 What are you going to keep them in the cellar for?

186
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,520
 Why don't you keep them in your attic?

187
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,840
 Gee, how do they get along in an attic?

188
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,720
 All you got to do is fix up some hoops

189
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,280
 and be sure the windows are left open.

190
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,520
 I wonder why I didn't think of that myself.

191
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,600
 Want your two-world bag, Mr. Hubbard?

192
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,400
 Uh, put it right back where it was.

193
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,400
 Yes.

194
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,520
 How much would it cost to go into the pigeon business, Mr. Hubbard?

195
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,920
 - Get your head out of the way.

196
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,820
 (audience laughs)

197
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:16,660
 - Is that better?

198
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,020
 - Yeah, just keep it out.

199
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:21,260
 - I guess you don't need any expensive equipment

200
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,420
 like you do for rabbits.

201
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:25,260
 - All you need is some secondhand coops.

202
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,620
 - Where could I get those?

203
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:29,500
 - Any reason you couldn't advertise in the morning paper?

204
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,940
 - You mean advertise?

205
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:33,420
 I just say I want some secondhand pigeon coops,

206
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:34,260
 and that's all.

207
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,020
 - What else would you suggest?

208
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:37,700
 - Sure, and I'd save money.

209
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:40,540
 Unless of course nobody answered.

210
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:47,420
 But then the way I look at it, you've got to take a gamble at anything if you want to

211
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,420
 make money.

212
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,420
 Isn't that the way you look at it, Mr. Hubbard?

213
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:51,420
 Well, I...

214
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,420
 What are you doing out here?

215
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:56,820
 Well, I'm helping Mr. Hubbard find his tools, Mother.

216
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:59,780
 Could you please stand back so you don't cast a shadow on him?

217
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:00,780
 Oh, my goodness.

218
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:04,220
 The way you've been talking out here, I thought you'd have all the problems of the world settled.

219
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,220
 Have you heard us?

220
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:08,340
 Well, I haven't heard what it was about.

221
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:10,260
 What time does the center of Olgazette close?

222
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,460
 - No, I have no idea.

223
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:14,180
 - They're open till pretty late.

224
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,020
 - They are?

225
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:16,340
 - Why do you ask, dear?

226
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:17,340
 - Oh.

227
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,660
 - No reason.

228
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,900
 I was just wondering how long they stay open.

229
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:23,940
 - His father around in the living room, any place?

230
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,500
 - Your father went out.

231
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,020
 - Is everyone right?

232
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:27,860
 He went out?

233
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,500
 - Mr. Hubbard, will I be in your way here?

234
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,380
 - No, ma'am.

235
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,660
 - Well, goodbye.

236
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:33,980
 - Where are you going, Henry?

237
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:35,860
 - I'm just in the living room.

238
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:36,700
 Look around.

239
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:41,700
 [ Laughter ]

240
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:45,700
 Operator. Operator, could you get me the son or vogue as that please?

241
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:46,700
 Yes, ma'am.

242
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,700
 Hi, Ray. Are you in the living room?

243
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,700
 I think I am, mother.

244
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,700
 Mr. Hubbard wants to know whether you picked up his screwdriver.

245
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:56,700
 Tell him he'll find it in his left hip pocket.

246
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:57,700
 Thank you.

247
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,700
 Hello?

248
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:01,700
 Well, how do I put in an advertisement?

249
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,700
 Coaps.

250
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:06,700
 Just ordinary pigeon coops.

251
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,700
 Yeah.

252
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,700
 Yeah, that sounds good.

253
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:12,700
 Sign at Henry W. Aldridge.

254
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:13,700
 Yeah.

255
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:15,700
 About how much will that be?

256
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:18,700
 As much as that?

257
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:21,700
 Well, would it be cheaper if I left the W out?

258
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,700
 [laughter]

259
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:26,700
 Well, supposing I leave the Henry out?

260
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:27,700
 Okay.

261
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:31,700
 Just say reasonable prices pay for old pigeon coops.

262
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:41,300
 Sign at Aldridge. Yes sir. Yes sir. Goodbye. Henry, would you see this at the door please?

263
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:48,100
 Yes mother, I'd be very glad to help you mother. Gee whiz Tommy, you over here already?

264
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:54,500
 I came over to get my rabbits. Yeah, come on in. Did you ask your folks whether it'd be alright?

265
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:59,400
 I don't know why it wouldn't be alright. Why should I worry them about a little thing like that?

266
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,400
 Yeah, well come on down the cellar stairs.

267
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,400
 Why don't you want them Henry?

268
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:06,400
 My folks would rather I raise pigeons.

269
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,400
 Pigeons?

270
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,400
 Sure, I've become a pigeon fancier.

271
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,400
 Yeah?

272
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,400
 Sure, I may even raise pigeons for the army.

273
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,400
 Big money in it Tommy.

274
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,400
 Yeah?

275
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,400
 Mm-hmm.

276
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,400
 For the Department of Interior Communications.

277
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,400
 Yeah?

278
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:23,400
 Your rabbits are around here on the other side of the Preserve Closet.

279
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,400
 Oh, you showed them Tommy.

280
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,400
 Now listen, before I let you see them,

281
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:31,600
 them. When do I get that who's it? You promised me on the telephone.

282
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,840
 Oh, tomorrow Henry. I couldn't bring it over tonight.

283
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,640
 Okay. Oh, here they are in this box.

284
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,040
 Look at them.

285
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:43,240
 That's what I say. Can you beat that?

286
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,800
 Well, what's the matter? They're right here.

287
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,640
 Can you imagine that?

288
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,640
 What all I want is for?

289
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,800
 You got to take eight.

290
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:55,760
 I haven't got room for eight. I'm going to have trouble keeping just four in my

291
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,720
 closet. Well you should have gotten here sooner Tommy. Well they certainly isn't my

292
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:07,680
 fault. Yes mother that's Tommy. Is he taking all four of the rabbits? Yes mother.

293
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:12,920
 I'm certainly glad to hear that dear. Tommy, Tommy when we go up don't say

294
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:17,440
 anything about the four I'm keeping. Why not? Maybe I can surprise my mother

295
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:22,160
 after all. Boy am I gonna make money. Rabbits in our basement and pigeons in

296
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:29,160
 in our attic.

297
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:39,560
 Our scene shifts for the next moment, ladies and gentlemen, to a department store, where

298
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,800
 we clear up the mystery of the lady...

299
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,800
 Good evening...

300
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,080
 ...and the gong.

301
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:49,720
 Behind a counter on the fifth floor, lamps China curtains, drapes, rugs, house furnishings,

302
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:54,400
 and so forth, there stands a clerk approaching him is the lady who says,

303
00:13:54,400 --> 00:14:00,100
 "Last week I bought a piece of merchandise in this department. I have it here with me. It's a dinner gong."

304
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:00,760
 "Yes, madam?"

305
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:06,160
 "You see, I used to have a lot of trouble every night getting my husband and the children to the dinner table.

306
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:12,000
 They'd keep right on reading the paper or listening to the radio or whatever else they were doing when I called them.

307
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,120
 So I bought this gong."

308
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,420
 "An excellent idea, madam."

309
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:18,240
 "But now I want to return it if I may."

310
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,120
 Well, is anything wrong with it, Madam?

311
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,400
 Let's have a look at it.

312
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,880
 Sounds alright to me.

313
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,640
 Oh, the gums are alright.

314
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,400
 But recently I've been serving

315
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,520
 Jello Chocolates pudding for dinner.

316
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,720
 Now when I start to ring the gums,

317
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,920
 my husband and the children are sitting at the table

318
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,400
 before I get a chance to hit it.

319
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,840
 And the very delicious moral to that story

320
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,200
 is, ladies and gentlemen,

321
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,200
 folks certainly do get to the table

322
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,800
 and get there in a hurry when they know

323
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,480
 there's Jello Chocolates pudding for dessert.

324
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,120
 Because, friends, it's a grand treat

325
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,120
 that everybody loves.

326
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:53,040
 young and old alike. Nothing can compare with its rich, creamy smoothness and its

327
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,880
 thrilling chocolate flavor. And you'll be simply delighted to find how quickly

328
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,720
 and easily you can prepare jello chocolate pudding, how inexpensive it is,

329
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:05,280
 and how many different and delicious desserts you can make with it. So try it

330
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:08,800
 tomorrow, why don't you? Start right away to treat the folks at your house to

331
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:14,520
 this new family favorite. Well, luscious, easy-to-eat, jello chocolate pudding.

332
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:29,520
 [Music]

333
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:33,020
 Now getting back to the problems of Henry Aldrich.

334
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:37,520
 Without telling his parents, Henry is inserted an advertisement in the town paper

335
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:40,020
 and signed it with the name Aldrich.

336
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:44,020
 Vassine opens the following day in his father's office.

337
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:48,020
 Miss Thompson, I don't have a great deal of time. Will you take a letter in a hurry, please?

338
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:49,020
 Yes, I still have a letter.

339
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:52,020
 To the Brown Realty Company.

340
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:58,020
 There, Mr. Brown, this is to advise you that unless steps are taken at once...

341
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:01,020
 Mr. Aldrich is over.

342
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:03,020
 Yes?

343
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:05,020
 Yes?

344
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:09,020
 No, sir, you must have the wrong number, I'm afraid.

345
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:10,020
 No number?

346
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,020
 Yes, sir.

347
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:14,100
 Now then you just started a letter to the Brown Realty Company.

348
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:18,380
 Dear Mr. Brown, this is to advise you that unless debts are taken as wise.

349
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:19,380
 Yes.

350
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:24,020
 This is to advise you that unless steps are taken as wise.

351
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:27,020
 Mr. Ulrich is open.

352
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,020
 What was this?

353
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:31,020
 I don't understand you.

354
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:33,020
 Say that slowly, please.

355
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,020
 One moment.

356
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:38,020
 Mr. Ulrich, somebody wants to talk to you about something.

357
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:39,460
 Let me have it.

358
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:43,860
 Samuel Oritt speaking, what number are you calling?

359
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:47,020
 Pigeon coops.

360
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:49,860
 Did you say pigeon coops?

361
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,660
 My name is Oritt.

362
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:56,500
 I'm the only Orittian town, but I don't buy pigeon coops.

363
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,900
 Who is this talking?

364
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,300
 Charlie?

365
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,300
 Or you can't fool me, Charlie.

366
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,420
 Now listen, Charlie, I'm busy as the deuce right now.

367
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:05,700
 I'll give you a call later.

368
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:06,580
 Don't bother me.

369
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:07,980
 Goodbye.

370
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:11,320
 Charlie Goslin would try to be funny just when I'm trying to get my work done

371
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:14,720
 Try to make me think his name was Tony Vichito

372
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:19,200
 Be quite honest, Mr. Old, I never did like Mr. Goslin.

373
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,200
 Well, we get a lot of business from him

374
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,800
 Now then, where were we?

375
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:26,920
 This is to advise you that unless steps are taken at once

376
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,440
 Is that all the farther we got?

377
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,440
 It is

378
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,440
 Unless steps are taken at once

379
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,600
 What did I was going to say?

380
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,600
 I have no idea

381
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,700
 Now I remember, toward improving the property occupied by my...

382
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:44,000
 Let me answer that.

383
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 Sam already speaking.

384
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 Who?

385
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 Yes, Charlie.

386
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 They're selling pigeon coops?

387
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 I will take all 15.

388
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 Yes, deliver them right to our house.

389
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 I don't care where you put them.

390
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 Put them in the living room.

391
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 Yes, and don't bother me anymore.

392
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 Just because Charlie Goshen happens to be a client.

393
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 How far are we?

394
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 Right where we were.

395
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 Yes.

396
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 You know, it would be just like Charlie to go and find 15 pigeon coops and deliver them to our house.

397
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 I remember one other practical joke he tried to play off.

398
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 Miss Thompson, please answer that.

399
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 If it's Charlie again, tell him I've gone for the day.

400
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 Hello?

401
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 Yes, sir.

402
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 Mr. Olrit, Mr. Olrit, it's a centerville feed company.

403
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 They want to know whether they may supply you with cracked corn.

404
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 (audience laughing)

405
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 For what?

406
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 One moment.

407
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 Hello?

408
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 Mr. Olrit wants to know what he would use cracked corn for.

409
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 No, Mr. Olrit has not changed his business.

410
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 He's still practicing law. Goodbye.

411
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 Cracked corn?

412
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 Cracked?

413
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 Did that sound like Charlie Gosling?

414
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 My suspicion is that was Mr. Gosler.

415
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 No, no, he probably phoned the Centerville Feed Company and told them to call here.

416
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 Now, unless steps are taken, it was to him. Who's at the door?

417
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 You Mr. Orrids?

418
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 I am.

419
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 How many pigeon coops do you want?

420
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 I beg your pardon?

421
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 How many did you want?

422
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 Did you say pigeon coops?

423
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 Pigeon coops.

424
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 A pork and what you have all you need up to sixty.

425
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 May I ask who sent you here?

426
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,380
 sent you here. I don't know my poor just told me to come up here. Where is your

427
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:39,240
 poor? Down in front. Had a parked double. We got all 60 down there. You have 60

428
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:43,380
 pigeon coops down in front for me. Sure you want to brought up here to the

429
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:49,660
 office? No. It also fixed you up with 60 feet and pray. Now then young man may I

430
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:54,180
 ask how your father happened to come here. I don't know. Do you know a gentleman

431
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:59,220
 but the name of Charles Goslin? Never heard of. But here's what you're to do.

432
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:04,220
 You're to deliver your confounded goops to Mr. Gosland's residence at 12 Church Street.

433
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:05,220
 All 60?

434
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:08,220
 All 60 and all 60 feeding trays.

435
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,220
 Who paid for them?

436
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:11,220
 Send the bill to Mr. Gosland.

437
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,220
 Sure.

438
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:13,220
 Take them over right away.

439
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:14,220
 That's fine.

440
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:17,220
 Mrs. Aldrich. Mrs. Aldrich is on the phone.

441
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,220
 What does she want?

442
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:22,220
 There's a gentleman by the name of the Cheeto at your house and loading pigeon coops.

443
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:25,220
 You can piss the final leaving them in the living room.

444
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:27,220
 Now I know it was Charlie.

445
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:29,820
 This is all she says he had nothing to do with it.

446
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:31,420
 Well then the fella must be insane.

447
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:33,020
 That's why she says you ought to come over.

448
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:37,420
 Yes, yes, where's my hat and coat right in the middle of the busiest day I ever had.

449
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:39,820
 If anyone else calls Miss Thompson I've left.

450
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:40,820
 Hello, Father.

451
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:41,320
 Hello.

452
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,820
 Can I speak to you just a minute?

453
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:43,320
 You may not.

454
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,320
 Good bye.

455
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,320
 Well what do you know about that?

456
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,920
 Miss Thompson is he in a hurry over something?

457
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:50,920
 He is.

458
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:54,320
 And if I were you, I wouldn't follow him.

459
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,320
 Miss, Miss Thompson could...

460
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,320
 I've got access to it.

461
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,320
 Where's Sam Alridge?

462
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,320
 He just went out.

463
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:04,320
 I've got exactly what he wants outside on my truck.

464
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,320
 What is it?

465
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:09,320
 Aye, it's of the darlinest pigeon coop you ever put your two eyes on.

466
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,320
 Well, Gee whiz, could you hold him over to my house?

467
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,320
 And why not?

468
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,320
 Well, I don't think anyone's home.

469
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:18,320
 Oh, now you take the coops, and I'll give you a dozen fine birds to go with them.

470
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,320
 You will?

471
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,320
 I will not.

472
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,320
 Gee whiz, I'll be getting an even better start than I thought I would.

473
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,320
 Let's go!

474
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:46,320
 For the last time, please put the rest of your coops on your wagon and get away from the front of my house.

475
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,320
 You know, out of a tise?

476
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,320
 I did not advertise.

477
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:52,320
 The ladies, she know out of a tise?

478
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:56,320
 I did not advertise. No one in this house advertised. We couldn't have.

479
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:00,320
 That's a funny thing. My wife is she's a reader to me after love.

480
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,320
 What you probably did was to misunderstand the name.

481
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,320
 What's your name?

482
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,320
 Aldrich.

483
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:08,320
 Aldrich, that's all right. I'm a telephoner.

484
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,320
 He's a show show. So bring on me 50th in the coals.

485
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:16,320
 All right, I'll admit that I'm the one who answered the phone, but...

486
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,320
 I thought you were somebody else.

487
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,320
 I'll meet to his price.

488
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:22,760
 [audience laughing]

489
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:26,120
 No, I thought you were a friend by the name of Charlie.

490
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:29,320
 Alice, what's a Charlie got to do with it?

491
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,560
 Now listen, my friend, for the last time,

492
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:34,040
 put that final crate on your wagon and get away from here.

493
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:37,000
 All right, all right, time to go home and rid the air.

494
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 You sure you know one of these acupes of chips?

495
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:39,640
 Get out!

496
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,800
 All right, all right, give me a please.

497
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,920
 Bye, maybe I see you tomorrow.

498
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:45,880
 No!

499
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,120
 Well, thank goodness he's gone.

500
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,760
 You know Alice, I honestly believe the fellow's crazy.

501
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,600
 Did you hear it?

502
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,920
 Me practically insisted that we advertise.

503
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,760
 Father, take a look.

504
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,760
 What did it, Henry?

505
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:59,360
 And what I've got right here in this truck, pigeon coops.

506
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,960
 [LAUGHTER]

507
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,360
 Where did you get those?

508
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,360
 They're from my pigeons.

509
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,200
 How are you, sir, Maldridge?

510
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,640
 Could you give me a hand to him, everybody?

511
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,200
 Sure.

512
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,200
 One minute.

513
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,040
 Henry, are you unloading those here?

514
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:10,600
 Sure.

515
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,800
 Oh, don't with them, me son.

516
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,480
 Hey, wait before you unload that.

517
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,440
 Oh, it's not too heavy, Father.

518
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,440
 Oh, there we are.

519
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,440
 What's that I hear?

520
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:23,440
 No, for three years I've been wanted to show you me gratitude, Sam.

521
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,440
 Mulligan, I'm sorry, but we have no place here for those pigeons.

522
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:29,440
 But father, they aren't costing us a cent. We're getting them absolutely free.

523
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,440
 What do you mean?

524
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:35,440
 Mr. Mulligan has very kindly consented to credit the coops toward a Bill Heo's father.

525
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,440
 What was that?

526
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,440
 Don't you think that's fair, father?

527
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:42,440
 Henry, will you and Mr. Mulligan please put that crate back on the truck?

528
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,440
 You mean you don't want them?

529
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:48,880
 I do not. Oh, but, but, but, but it's three years I've been owning and that builds Sam.

530
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,640
 Don't you think it's about time it was paid? Sam?

531
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:55,340
 If you take those crates away I'll call the whole thing paid.

532
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:59,440
 Oh, now, now that's very decent of you, Sam. Give me a hand, me boy.

533
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,920
 But father, I need them.

534
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:04,940
 Hey, Ray. Do you want me to put that on for you? I'll help him.

535
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:08,240
 Ah, you're a gentleman, Sam Aldrich.

536
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:12,440
 And the next time I come into town I'll bring your son a present.

537
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,740
 But not pigeons or pigeon cook.

538
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:16,840
 Oh no, no, no, or not pigeons.

539
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:20,940
 I'll bring him a fine white nanny goat I have.

540
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:22,140
 You will?

541
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:24,440
 You will not?

542
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,440
 Good.

543
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,940
 Good day to you all.

544
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:29,540
 She was.

545
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:32,540
 Now I've even lost what I paid for the ad.

546
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:33,640
 For the ad?

547
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,940
 For what ad?

548
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:37,640
 For coops, didn't I tell you?

549
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:40,240
 Let's go into the house, Enry.

550
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,240
 I want to have a talk with you.

551
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,440
 I know what you're gonna say.

552
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:47,640
 I wouldn't cry right out here on the sidewalk, Henry.

553
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,840
 I'm not crying.

554
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,440
 Who's crying?

555
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:54,440
 You're a disappointed dear, but the next time you do anything like this, you must tell us.

556
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,440
 Of course.

557
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:02,140
 We may not have room for pigeons any more than we had for rabbits, but we'll find something you can have.

558
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:05,740
 The only thing is I need pigeon coops. I need them bad.

559
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:09,640
 Oh, today you need them, but by tomorrow you'll have forgotten all about them.

560
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,440
 Sam, what's that?

561
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,640
 What was what?

562
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,840
 Something just flew out of our attic window.

563
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,640
 Out of which window?

564
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,440
 That was one of my pigeons.

565
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,840
 What of what pigeons?

566
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,340
 That Mr. Hubbard gave me.

567
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:23,340
 That he gave you? How many did he give you?

568
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:26,040
 Just six. Two of them are up there setting.

569
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,440
 In our attic?

570
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,640
 It would be all right if they had a coop, Father.

571
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,240
 Henry Aldrich.

572
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,240
 Henry, could I see you all minute?

573
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,440
 What about Tommy?

574
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,940
 What have you got in the box there?

575
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:37,040
 Your rabbit.

576
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:39,340
 My mother and father won't let me keep them.

577
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:41,340
 What are you doing returning all four of them?

578
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:42,340
 All four of them.

579
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:43,340
 There are ten of them.

580
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:44,340
 Can you imagine?

581
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:46,840
 Henry, we can't possibly take those.

582
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:49,840
 But mother, the ones I have don't bother you any, do they?

583
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:50,840
 The ones you have.

584
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,340
 Yeah, the ones in the Preserve Club.

585
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:53,340
 Henry!

586
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:57,340
 Look! Look who's coming! It's Touser!

587
00:25:57,340 --> 00:26:00,340
 Oh, my old dog Touser will jee-wiz!

588
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:04,340
 And where are you going to keep him, Henry?

589
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:05,840
 Oh, he can sleep at the foot of my bed.

590
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:06,840
 Listen, Henry.

591
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:09,640
 I want my who's it back that I gave you for the rabbits.

592
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,240
 Oh no, that was a bargain, Tommy.

593
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,440
 You've got to give it back.

594
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,340
 Give what back?

595
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,140
 My snake.

596
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:15,140
 What's that?

597
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:19,240
 No, he gave me that snake.

598
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:21,440
 Henry, why should you want an old dead snake?

599
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,040
 From mother it isn't dead, it's alive.

600
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,040
 What?

601
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,640
 Where is it?

602
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,440
 Where is it?

603
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:27,940
 Yes.

604
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:29,740
 It's in my top, you're a drawer.

605
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:31,240
 Henry, open it!

606
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:41,240

607
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:44,240

00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:36,640
 Now there is a truly fine dessert one that has no rival when it comes to smooth creamy goodness

 So make tomorrow night's dinner end on a truly festive note by serving the family this luscious treat.

618
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:10,920
 You'll add a new name on your list of favorite desserts the very first time you enjoy the rare, distinctive goodness of Jell-O vanilla pudding.

620
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:23,500
 (upbeat music)

621
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:44,800
 - You know, Tommy, I just had a big idea.

622
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,720
 - What about Henry?

623
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,600
 - We can make some money on these pigeons.

624
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,800
 We can clean up.

625
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:52,360
 Wow, all we have to do is put another rat in the paper.

626
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:56,120
 The only trouble is though, we'll have to put it in in your father's name.

627
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,120
 [laughter]

628
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:02,760
 Well, now ladies and gentlemen, in the event you would like to see Henry's latest advertisement,

629
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:07,100
 you will find it only a next week's issue of Centerville's leading paper.

630
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:11,080
 The Aldrich family starring Ezra Stone is written by Clifford Goldsmith.

00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:15,840
 Original music for the program is composed and conducted by Jack Miller.
