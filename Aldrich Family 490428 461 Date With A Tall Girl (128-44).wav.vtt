00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.520
 originated by Clifford Goldsmith and starring Ezra Stone as Henry with Jackie

 Oh the big red ladder stand for the Jell-O family. Oh the big red ladder stand for the Jell-O family.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.940
 (dramatic music)

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:11.840
 There's an old saying that goes something like this.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.280
 Youth is so wonderful a thing.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.120
 It's a shame to waste it on the young.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.600
 But grown-ups can always recapture some of their teenage

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.880
 by reliving the experiences of a typical American boy

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.680
 like Henry Aldrich.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.480
 With seen openings in Henry's room, the time it is early afternoon.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.480
 But Homer, how was I to know?

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:37.440
 Henry, you're too impulsive, especially when it comes to girl.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.280
 But she was already sitting when I came over to your table.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.280
 You should have waited till she stood up.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.680
 Sure, that's easy enough to say now, Homer.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.240
 But why didn't you say something when it would have done me some good?

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.160
 Or why didn't Agnes say something?

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.440
 How can you tell someone not to ask a girl for a date because you think she's bigger

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:54.440
 than he is.

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:55.440
 Bigger.

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.960
 Boy, when she stood up to go, I thought I'd die.

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:04.560
 What if I had to dance with her and have to hold her around the knees, practically?

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.600
 Maybe you better break the date, him.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:09.600
 Yeah.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.600
 Maybe I'd bet.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.360
 But she's so pretty.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.640
 Homer, did you happen to notice her eyes?

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:16.640
 Probably.

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.960
 What did you think of them?

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:19.960
 How should I know?

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.960
 I'm not an optometrist.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.560
 I happen to think they were exceptionally attractive.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:26.060
 You do?

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:27.560
 I certainly do.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.560
 They're color, for instance.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.760
 Sort of blue.

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.360
 Navy blue.

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.060
 And her eyelashes.

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.660
 Did you ever see eyelashes that long?

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:40.160
 Sure.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.960
 Oh, my head.

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.260
 Well, you ought to see them, hen.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.860
 When she has them on, I mean.

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.260
 Now, wait a minute, Homer.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.560
 Are you insinuating that Helen's eyelashes come on and off?

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.960
 I didn't insinuate anything, him.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.760
 Okay.

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.160
 And her lips, Homer.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.360
 Did you happen to notice her lips?

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.960
 I don't think so.

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:06.560
 They're so cute.

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.200
 Well, I'll tell you how I feel about lips, him.

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.200
 Personally, I'll take them not so cute,

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.560
 but low enough down so I can reach them.

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.360
 (audience laughing)

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.760
 Homer, Homer, what do you think I ought to do?

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:19.600
 Break the day.

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:20.440
 No.

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.920
 keep the day. But she's too tall. Can't you think of something else? What else is

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:32.320
 it? I don't know. Let's see. What if? What if what Homer? My father's Derby. What

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:37.880
 about it? That'd give you at least three inches. Sure. Well what happens when I

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.880
 take it off? You don't. You mean I keep it on all evening? My father wouldn't mind.

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.040
 Listen Homer, how would you like it if you were a girl and the fella kept his

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:55.360
 Derby on all evening. Okay. How about? No. What? How about what? I was gonna suggest

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:01.040
 you go to a beauty parlor and get them to fix your hair so it stood up straight. That's

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:09.200
 silly. Yeah. Sure. We never last all evening. Suppose what? Suppose we planned the date

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:14.840
 so you never had to stand up all during. Huh? Look, you phoned Helen just before you're

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.400
 supposed to pick her up on Saturday and tell her it's going to be very crowded at the movie.

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.960
 So you're going to hurry over there and hold two seats and she can meet you inside.

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:29.560
 Then you're already sitting when she gets there. Sure! But how do we get out of the movie without

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:37.240
 her seeing me stand up I mean. Oh let's see. When you see the part coming where you came in

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:42.840
 you ask her what flavor ice cream she likes. Suppose it's caramel delight. Yeah. You say that

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.840
 The dehaven structure always runs out of caramel delight very early on Saturday night.

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:48.340
 Yeah?

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:51.240
 So you're gonna rush over there and reserve some.

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.140
 By the time Helen gets there, you're sitting again.

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:55.740
 I don't know, Homer.

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:56.940
 Why not?

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:01.340
 So far, you're two-thirds through the date and she hasn't seen it your full length once.

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:02.740
 That's true.

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:08.040
 Although, actually, I'll be spending most of the date running away from her, won't I?

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.940
 Not necessarily, him.

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:13.300
 Once you're sitting, there's no reason you can't sit as long as you want.

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.300
 Yeah, I guess so.

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:19.540
 Now all we've got to figure out is how to get her home with you sitting.

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:21.940
 I'll get it Homer. You keep thinking.

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:23.440
 Hello?

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:24.640
 Hello Henry Agnes.

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:25.640
 Oh, hello Agnes.

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:26.240
 Guess what?

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:31.540
 My father had to buy four tickets for the charity done to the club Saturday night and he gave them all to me.

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:32.440
 Oh, that's nice.

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:35.040
 Two for Homer and me and two for Helen and you.

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:36.540
 Had you had your hands?

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:37.040
 Uh-huh.

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:38.640
 No thanks Agnes.

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:42.240
 I don't think you understand, and you don't have to pay for them.

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:43.240
 [laughter]

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.440
 Even so, Agnes.

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:46.440
 No, thanks.

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.040
 Why not?

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:51.800
 Because dancing requires you to...

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:52.800
 Never mind, Agnes.

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:53.800
 I'd just rather not.

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:54.800
 What's the matter?

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.840
 You're too good to dance for charity.

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:59.240
 Well, Agnes, it isn't that.

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.800
 I'd just rather not dance with Helen.

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:02.800
 That's all.

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.040
 Well, she'll certainly be interested in hearing that.

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:06.040
 Oh, wait, Agnes.

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:07.040
 Listen.

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:08.040
 Why is she going to love you?

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:10.540
 Agnes, you don't understand.

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:13.280
 Agnes.

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:14.940
 - Yes, Henry?

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:16.700
 - Thank you very much for the tickets.

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:18.320
 I'd love to go to the Dan.

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:20.580
 - That's well, and you make the arrangements with Homer.

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:22.060
 We'll make a big night of it.

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:22.900
 Bye.

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:23.740
 - Goodbye.

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:26.140
 - Hey, Henry, I've got it all worked out.

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:28.180
 You're in the ice cream policy.

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:29.180
 - We're going dancing.

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:30.900
 - Helen sees a friend at another table,

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:35.300
 so she turns around a wave to her in the minute of dancing.

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:37.900
 That's the worst thing in the world for you to be doing.

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:38.900
 I know.

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:48.200
 [music]

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:51.200
 Well for goodness sake Helen, you don't have to snap my hat off.

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:53.600
 But Agnes, why did you have to make it dancing?

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:57.000
 That's the worst thing in the world under the circumstances.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.300
 I'm sorry, Helen, but it never occurred to me that Henry might be shorter than you.

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:03.600
 That's all I've worried about since we made the day.

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:04.800
 Then why did you make it?

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:07.440
 Well, he's sort of cute.

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:08.960
 And cute?

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:10.560
 Oh my goodness, yes.

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:12.800
 Well, I guess that's what makes horse racing.

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.680
 What should I do, Agnes?

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:18.000
 You want me to call him and cancel a dance?

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
 No, he'll guess why and hate me for him.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.400
 Then let's just go and make the best of him.

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:25.200
 Oh no, he'll hate me every minute he's dancing with me.

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:26.960
 Then what do you want me to do?

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:27.680
 I don't know.

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:29.840
 Oh, sometimes...

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:32.880
 Sometimes I wish I were a pig me.

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:42.880
 [Music]

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:44.880
 Well tell me Homer, what do you think?

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:46.880
 Let me see you walk again.

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:49.880
 Can you tell?

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:53.880
 If I weren't with you while you had it done, him, I'd never know.

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:55.880
 How did you do it, Mr. Bridges?

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:58.880
 Why, I just built his shoes up on the inside.

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:00.880
 How do they feel, Henry?

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:05.880
 Pretty good, except that I feel I'm leaning forward all the time.

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:06.880
 Am I?

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:08.880
 Just a little hen, about 10 degrees.

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:12.880
 That's because most of the build-up is in the heel. You'll get used to it.

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:13.880
 I hope so.

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:15.880
 Are you sure you can't tell Homer?

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:19.880
 Soon as you straighten yourself out, you'll look perfectly natural, hen.

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:21.880
 Lean back a little.

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:22.880
 Like this?

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:24.880
 Yeah, that-- oops, not too far.

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:25.880
 How much?

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:27.880
 Come forward again.

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:35.880
 Little more, more, more. Hold it. Okay. How does he look to you now, Mr. Bridges?

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:39.880
 Why, you look fine, Henry. Fine. In a few minutes you'll feel as though you've been wearing

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:45.880
 them all your life. Sure. Well, thanks a lot, Mr. Bridges. Goodbye. Fine, Mr. Bridges.

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:50.880
 Goodbye, boys. How does it feel, Hen? Very comfortable.

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:53.480
 No, I mean up there.

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:58.880
 Oh, I think this air is a little cleaner.

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:03.480
 Yeah, no one to tall people are healthier than short people.

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:04.440
 Gee whiz, I'll marry you.

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:06.080
 I only built them up an inch.

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:07.440
 Well, you never--

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:08.680
 Hey, there's Agnes.

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:10.680
 Hey, Agnes.

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:11.760
 Wait a minute.

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:12.520
 Come on, Henry.

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:14.880
 Homer, you won't say anything to her about--

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:16.080
 you know what, will you?

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:17.160
 Of course not.

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:19.480
 Gee whiz, what do you think I am, a cad?

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:20.320
 Listen, homie.

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:23.060
 I know I don't like to be kept waiting.

00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:25.060
 - Hi, Henry.

00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:27.120
 - Hi, Agnes.

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:30.280
 Well, I'd better get home, Homer.

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:32.160
 See you later, kids.

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:34.000
 - Sure.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.000
 Sure.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.320
 - So long, Hen.

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:39.960
 Oh, what I wanted to talk to you about, Agnes.

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:42.680
 Why are you looking at me like that?

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:44.680
 - You know something, Homer.

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:45.680
 - Why?

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:49.480
 - I never before realized you were such a shrimp.

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:58.980
 [Music]

00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:00.580
 Alice, you know where Henry is?

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:05.080
 Not exactly, Sam. He said he had a problem to work out, something about a charity.

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:09.180
 Oh, that's nice. I'm glad to see he's getting interested in civic affairs.

00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:13.780
 By the way, dear, that reminds me. Are we going to the charity dance at the club this Saturday?

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:16.680
 Oh, let's not, Alice. I'm too tired.

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:19.240
 My goodness, Sam, what's the matter with you lately?

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:23.560
 You haven't done a stitch of exercise in two months, I'd say.

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:24.440
 That's not true.

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:26.880
 I played handball at the Y just to--

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:29.320
 just to-- is it really two months?

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:30.400
 At least.

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:32.240
 And dear, you're beginning to barge.

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:32.920
 Barge?

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:33.480
 Me?

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:34.520
 Where?

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:37.160
 Oh, besides I'm not as young as I used to be.

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:40.640
 That's exactly why you should be getting some exercise, dear.

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:43.560
 You know what happens to the human body, as it grows older,

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:48.920
 isn't taken care of begins to sort of shrivel nonsense Alice in the first place

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:53.240
 I'm not that old yet and in a second what in the world would a horse be doing

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:55.880
 on our porch

00:10:55.880 --> 00:11:03.440
 as a matter of fact it does sound like a horse is that you Henry yes mother excuse

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:07.160
 me Alice I'll speak to him yes dear I'm right in the middle of my potato Henry

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:11.080
 how many times do I have to tell you to take off your roller skates before coming

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:12.080
 in this house.

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:15.080
 Skates father, I don't have in my skates, huh?

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:18.080
 Oh, well, what in the world was all that?

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:19.080
 Henry.

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:21.080
 Yes, father?

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:25.080
 Are you wearing your trouser belt a little higher, these days?

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:27.080
 She was, no.

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:30.080
 Oh, it seemed to me.

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:31.080
 Oh.

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:33.080
 May I go upstairs now?

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:35.080
 Well, yes, yes, certainly.

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:37.080
 See you later.

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:38.080
 Yes.

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:39.080
 Hello?

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:40.080
 Yes, dear.

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:45.080
 What were you just saying about a person shriveling up?

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:57.080
 But father, why can't I have it done?

00:11:57.080 --> 00:12:00.080
 Because, home, there's nothing wrong with you as you are.

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:02.080
 Nothing that build up shoes could help that is.

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:05.080
 But how would you like it if your girl called you a shrimp?

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:07.720
 Now dear, you just eat your spinach and you'll get to all that.

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:09.880
 Spinach isn't what made Henry tall.

00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:12.680
 Do as your mother told you, Homer. Eat your spinach.

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:15.240
 But why can't I have my shoes built up?

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:17.320
 Because spinach is cheaper than leather.

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:20.920
 I don't like spinach.

00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:23.400
 It's good for you. Here, have some of mine.

00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:25.160
 Well, you eat your spinach too.

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:26.680
 Why? I'm tall enough.

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:28.280
 Now, will.

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:29.960
 What do you mean by a statement like that?

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:32.040
 Father, you're not so tall either.

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:32.760
 What?

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:35.160
 All I meant in our family are shrimp.

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:36.160
 Is that so?

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:38.160
 Sure, look at Uncle Harry.

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:40.660
 He's a head and a half shorter than an Amy.

00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:43.060
 And Amy is an exceptionally tall woman.

00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:44.960
 Oh, you really think so, Will?

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:45.960
 What?

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:48.960
 Well, I'm a good four inches taller than Uncle Harry.

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:51.560
 Well, at least three inches.

00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:53.360
 To winch it?

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:05.360
 Listen Henry, how much longer are we gonna wait for?

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:08.080
 I saw her go into Agnes's house almost an hour ago.

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:09.560
 She's gotta come out soon.

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:10.920
 Okay.

00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:13.160
 What makes you think an inch isn't enough?

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:15.640
 Well, I caught a glimpse of Helen at school today,

00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:17.320
 standing next to Charlie Clark.

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:18.960
 And from where I was standing,

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:21.400
 she seemed about an inch taller than Charlie.

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:22.320
 No kidding.

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:23.160
 Sure.

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:26.400
 And a little later I saw Charlie talking to Francine Lita.

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:29.600
 He looked about two and a half inches taller than Francine.

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:31.480
 That's who you should have made the date with.

00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:32.320
 Charlie?

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:34.320
 Oh, Francine.

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:36.120
 She doesn't excite me.

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:39.200
 Anyway, just for the fun of it, I went over to talk to Francine.

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:42.240
 It seemed to me I was about three inches taller.

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:42.800
 So?

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:43.960
 So don't you see?

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:45.880
 If I'm three inches taller than Francine,

00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:48.080
 who's two and a half inches shorter than Charlie, who's

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:50.780
 an inch shorter than Helen, that still makes me about a half

00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:52.400
 inch too short.

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:54.160
 Wow.

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:55.440
 Oh, in that case--

00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:56.520
 Here she comes.

00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:58.440
 Hide in this doorway.

00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:00.520
 Remember, she passes that fence,

00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:03.160
 make a metal picture of where she comes to on it.

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:04.000
 - Okay.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:11.400
 - The coast is clear, Ann.

00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:12.520
 - Good, come on.

00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:15.120
 Where she come to Homer.

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:17.600
 - Right about here, I think.

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:19.080
 - That high?

00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:21.760
 Seemed to me it was closer to down there.

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:24.080
 - It was up here, Ann.

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:25.680
 - Well, I'll tell you what.

00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:28.880
 Let's take a point halfway between your opinion and mine.

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:31.080
 That'll bring it to about right here.

00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:32.640
 Okay, I got it, Hen.

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:34.160
 Stand with you back to the fence.

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:35.000
 Okay.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.720
 Well?

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:41.640
 Hen, what time does the shoemaker open in the morning?

00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:44.220

 Yes, there are desserts for everybody's family

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:11.320
 and the famous jello family of yum yum desserts.

00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:13.640
 For instance, pineapple lime delight

00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:16.280
 made with shimmering green lime jello

00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:18.360
 looks as fresh as spring itself,

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:20.520
 just as all the package of lime jello

00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:23.720
 in two cups of hot canned pineapple juice and water.

00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:25.040
 When slightly thickened,

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:30.200
 Fold in two slices of diced canned pineapple together with four cut-off marshmallows.

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:35.480
 Yes, tempting tangy lime jello with pineapple and luscious marshmallows.

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:38.360
 Enjoy all six delicious jello flavors.

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:41.720
 Strawberry, raspberry, cherry, orange, lemon, and lime.

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:46.860
 All six, rich with that locked-in goodness that's exclusive with jello.

00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:52.060
 Flavors so rich and satisfying, it reminds you of the real ripe fruit itself.

00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:56.060

 And now getting back to the troubles of Henry Ulrich.

00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:09.460
 Henry has been experiencing all sorts of difficulties,

00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:12.580
 trying to build himself up to the exact height of the girl he

00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:14.820
 has to date with for a dance.

00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:18.940
 So far, he's succeeded only in making Mr. Ulrich apparently

00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:20.180
 shriveled.

00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:22.100
 But singing his Agnes' house.

00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:23.700
 The time is the following day.

00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:26.700
 - But a few in Henry go to the church supper.

00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:29.060
 Helen all after dance, every dance went home.

00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:31.740
 - I'm sorry Agnes, but at a supper you sit.

00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:32.580
 - Hello?

00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:33.940
 - Hello, is this Henry Aldrin?

00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:34.780
 - Speaking.

00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:36.020
 - This is Helen Henry.

00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:39.220
 - Oh, please, I mean, hello.

00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:42.260
 - Henry, the church is having a supper this Sunday night.

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:43.100
 - Really?

00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:45.740
 - Uh huh, and I thought you might prefer going to that.

00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:46.580
 - Why?

00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:49.460
 - Well, uh, uh.

00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:51.160
 Oh, you mean...

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:52.460
 Uh...

00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:54.460
 Yes.

00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:57.460
 Well, if you think...

00:16:57.460 --> 00:16:59.460
 Helen, wait!

00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:01.460
 One minute, Henry. What is it, Agnes?

00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:03.460
 Did you see what it says in the ad for the church supper?

00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:04.460
 No, what?

00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:07.460
 It's a buffet supper you have to eat standing.

00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:09.460
 Oh, and there's square dancing afterwards!

00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:10.460
 Oh, my!

00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:14.460
 Hello, Henry. You don't really want to go to the church supper, do you?

00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:15.460
 Do you?

00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:29.460
 Up, two, three, four. Down, two, three, four.

00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:30.460
 But dear.

00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:31.460
 Up, two, three, four.

00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:34.460
 Oh, they at the gym are now these weights at home.

00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:36.460
 I thought you wanted me to exercise.

00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:38.460
 Yes, but not as a full-time job.

00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:41.460
 Two, three, four. Up, two, out.

00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:42.460
 For what happened?

00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:46.640
 I think something gay Sam old rich that's enough for today

00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:50.740
 Maybe you're right Alice

00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:55.340
 Do I look any less shriveled much dear? Well, I feel a lot better

00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:58.580
 Would you mind helping me to the couch? I think I'll lie down

00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:09.340
 In here Homer, how you mr. Oldrich great? That's nice worse Henry in his room there. Thanks. See you later mr. Oldrich

 Oh boy. I mean, I don't think I'm tall enough yet.

00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:35.420
 What? Listen, Homer Helen phoned me a little while ago. What for? I think she's worried too.

00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:38.020
 Yeah, well what'd you want me for?

00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:43.620
 Well, I figure I'll know exactly how much build up I need if I can get someone to find

00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:45.120
 out her exact height.

00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:47.420
 Oh no, not me.

00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:50.820
 Homer, let's go downtown and have a soda.

00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:51.820
 Unmea.

00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:54.620
 And I'll tell you just what I have in mind.

00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:56.020
 Well, okay.

00:18:56.020 --> 00:18:59.920
 Boy, you think you've got troubles.

00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:00.920
 Look at me.

00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:03.020
 If you can see that far down.

00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:06.380
 Listen Homer, being this high up has its disadvantages too.

00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:07.180
 Like what?

00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:09.020
 Like doorknobs for instance.

00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:10.140
 What about doorknobs?

00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:11.340
 I keep missing them.

00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:13.180
 Overshooting.

00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:14.620
 No kidding.

00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:16.060
 Sure.

00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:20.140
 It's going to be even worse with this new build up on top of the old build up.

00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:20.940
 She...

00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:23.260
 Now just relax Sam, try to rest.

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:24.860
 Hello mother, hi father.

00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:25.580
 Hello, Henry.

00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:27.020
 Oh my.

00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:28.300
 Father, what's the matter?

00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:29.100
 Sam!

00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:32.940
 Up two three four down two three four.

00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:41.940
 [MUSIC]

00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:43.760
 Agnes, are you sure you don't mind

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:45.440
 learning me your eyelashes for Saturday?

00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:47.060
 >> Of course not.

00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:48.120
 >> Hi Agnes.

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:49.060
 >> Wow.

00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:50.520
 >> Hello, Helen.

00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:51.380
 >> Hello Homer.

00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:52.680
 >> What do you want?

00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:58.420
 >> I just happened to be passing by and I didn't know you had company Agnes.

00:19:58.420 --> 00:19:59.780
 >> Well now you know.

00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:00.140
 >> Yeah.

00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:03.140
 And what we're talking about is strictly private.

00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:04.640
 I think I better go.

00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:06.860
 Whoa.

00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:08.700
 So long every.

00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:12.420
 Boy, that's a beautiful pin you have on Helen.

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:13.420
 Oh, thank you, Homer.

00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:14.260
 Can I see it?

00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:15.700
 I was thinking of buying one.

00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:16.820
 Let him see it, Helen.

00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:17.740
 For my mother.

00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:19.040
 Goodbye, Homer.

00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:20.940
 (audience laughing)

00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:21.780
 Goodbye.

00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:23.060
 So long.

00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:24.900
 So long.

00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:25.740
 Homer.

00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:26.740
 Yes, Agnes?

00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:27.660
 Beat it.

00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:30.100
 By the way, Helen, have you heard about the newest answer

00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:34.540
 doing the girl stands up and the boy stands with his back to the girl like

00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:37.100
 this and turns his head all the way around as far as...

00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:54.480
 -H

00:20:54.480 --> 00:21:00.680
 Well hello there Will. Oh hello Sam. How are you doing sitting here on a fire hydrant waiting for a bus?

00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:06.400
 No, no, I just had my shoes my feet hurt a bit. I thought I'd sit down and rest a while

00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:12.620
 Oh, well come on. I walk you home exercise. I'll do us both good sure. Let's go

00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:16.160
 As a matter of fact talking about exercise

00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:19.420
 You know you're leaning forward a bit well

00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:25.940
 I am. How's that? That's better.

00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:29.940
 Talking about exercise, I noticed that...

00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:33.180
 What's the matter, Sam? Why are you looking at me like that?

00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:38.460
 Nothing. Nothing. Oh. By the way, Sam, I think there's a

00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:44.620
 speck of dust down there on the top of your hat. There it is. I don't see it.

00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:47.620
 Well, maybe you just looked like it from up here.

00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:48.620
 Oh.

00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:52.620
 Uh, well, do you mind walking home by yourself?

00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:53.620
 Why, where are you going, Sam?

00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:54.620
 Back to the gym.

00:21:54.620 --> 00:22:08.620
 Can't you walk a little faster than the girls are waiting?

00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:13.620
 I'd like to see you walk down steps any faster on stilts practically.

00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:14.620
 Practically.

00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:18.500
 Maybe you shouldn't have put on two pair of sweat socks in.

00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:22.020
 Maybe the three cardboard in our soles would have been enough.

00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:23.020
 Maybe.

00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:26.220
 Who measured himself against Talon and said I needed another wrench.

00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:28.860
 Boy, my ankles are killing me.

00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:29.860
 There.

00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:32.500
 Is it easier on level ground, Hen?

00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:33.500
 A little.

00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:34.500
 Mother, we're going...

00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:38.500
 Dear, are you sure your father said you could have the car?

00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:39.500
 Positive.

00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:41.860
 What exactly did he say?

00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:42.860
 Nothing.

00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:56.060
 looked up at me and handed over the keys. Oh well have a nice time boys. Henry the phone is probably for you. Oh thank you. Hello? Henry. Yes Father hold it I'll get mother. I know Henry I want to speak to you. Oh you're

00:22:56.060 --> 00:23:08.180
 gonna so kill me. What is it Father? I want you to come and get me. What? Where are you? Down at the Y. All the way down there? Father how about taking a bus home? The girls are waiting for us.

00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:10.880
 Girls can wait, Henry, they don't have sprained back.

00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:11.880
 Do you, Father?

00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:12.880
 In three places.

00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:14.880
 Well, how about a taxon?

00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:15.880
 Poor an ambulance.

00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:17.880
 Henry, this is partly your fault.

00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:19.880
 My fault and what way, Father?

00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:21.880
 Never mind, just come down and pick me up.

00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:22.880
 Yes, Father.

00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:37.280
 Henry said for me to pick up you on Hell and then heat me to share it today.

00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:38.280
 Where is he?

00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:39.280
 I don't know.

00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:40.280
 She'd have been here by now.

00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:42.080
 She better come to look at poor Helen.

00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:44.080
 She's been sitting there since we got here.

00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:45.080
 Yeah.

00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:47.960
 By the way, Agnes, what happened to her?

00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:48.960
 What do you mean?

00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:52.880
 Well, she doesn't seem to be as high off as she used to.

00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:53.880
 Oh, that.

00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:55.360
 Homer, can you keep a secret?

00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:56.360
 You know me, Agnes.

00:23:56.360 --> 00:23:58.480
 Yeah, but I'll tell you anyway.

00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:02.760
 Would you see Helen thought Henry was too short for us, so she's wearing her hair as

00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:05.760
 flat as possible in the lowest heels she could find.

00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:11.680
 Oh boy, but Henry spent the whole week building up his shoe so he'd be tall enough hours.

00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:12.680
 No kidding.

00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:15.080
 Sure, he's gonna tower over and now.

00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:16.600
 Homer, hello, Mar.

00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:17.920
 Someone wants to see you outside.

00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:18.920
 Me?

00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:19.920
 That's right.

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:20.920
 Excuse me, Ag.

00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:21.920
 With pleasure, excuse me, Mar.

00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:22.920
 My dad's being tall.

00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:23.920
 Pssst.

00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:30.360
 Homer, over here, behind the bush.

00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:31.600
 Henry, what's the matter?

00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:32.600
 Listen, Homer.

00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:34.600
 A terrible thing just happened.

00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:35.600
 Why?

00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:39.200
 I was downtown helping my father into the car, see?

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:39.700
 Yeah.

00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:42.520
 And in the struggle, my foot got caught on the running board,

00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:44.300
 and one of my heels came off.

00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:45.800
 [LAUGHTER]

00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:47.560
 Just look at me.

00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:49.760
 Henry, you shrunk.

00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:51.320
 Completely.

00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:52.840
 Couldn't you put it back on?

00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:53.680
 No.

00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:55.320
 It rolled down the sewer.

00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:56.840
 [LAUGHTER]

00:24:56.840 --> 00:24:58.840
 Boy, that's great.

00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:00.800
 Homer, I thought you were a pal.

00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:02.480
 You don't understand him.

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:04.120
 Helen's much smaller now.

00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:04.560
 What?

00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:06.960
 She's wearing her head and shoes flat.

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:09.260
 Really?

00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:11.760
 Sure, you'll be just right for her now.

00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:13.460
 Oh boy!

00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:16.360
 Humber, where are you?

00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:18.760
 Coming Agnes, look who's here.

00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:21.160
 Henry, will I'm glad to see...

00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:23.960
 Homer, I thought you told me he was...

00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:25.860
 He was, but now he is.

00:25:25.860 --> 00:25:27.960
 Come on, let's go in. I'm dying to dance.

00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:28.760
 Where's Helen?

00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:30.260
 Oh boy!

00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:31.660
 Agnes, what's the matter?

00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:33.060
 Homer, you told...

00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:34.660
 So I told Helen...

00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:35.660
 And why?

00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:39.060
 She went home to get her high heel shoes again!

00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:41.060
 Well, Gee, you were...

00:25:41.060 --> 00:26:00.260
 Why, how many of you have a child dance?

00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:01.660
 Or anyone who knows something else?

00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:02.460
 What, Agnes?

00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:04.460
 Where'd I get the idea you were a shrimp?

00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:06.460
 Tonight you seem much taller.

00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:07.460
 I do.

00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:10.460
 Yes, and lots stronger too, homeroal kid.

00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:11.460
 What a man!

00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:12.460
 She is.

00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:14.460
 I am sure.

00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:17.460
 Now when you step on my feet, I can feel it.

00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:22.460
 Well, ladies, there is one time when appearances are never deceiving.

00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:26.460
 That's when you serve colorful, shimmering, jello for dessert.

00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:29.460
 Because jello, with that tempting fruit-like goodness,

00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:31.460
 always tastes as good as it looks.

00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:36.460
 In any of those six delicious flavors, strawberry, raspberry, cherry, orange,

00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:41.460
 lemon, or lime, every jello flavor is a special treat in itself,

00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:43.460
 rich with that famous locked in goodness.

00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:48.460
 Flavors seal right in by a special process, so it can't get out to your first

00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:52.460
 delectable spoonful. Look for it on your grocery's dessert shelf tomorrow.

00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:55.460
 Look for those big red letters on the box.

00:26:55.460 --> 00:27:00.460
 Those big red letters stand for the jello family of yum yum desserts.

00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:01.460
 desserts.

00:27:01.460 --> 00:27:20.460
 Hey Henry, guess what? You've won a prize. A prize? No kidding. Sure. Go ahead Henry.

00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:27.660
 The Downey Donut Award. Huh. Presented to Ezra Stone as Henry Aldridge as the boy who

00:27:27.660 --> 00:27:35.660
 typifies the nation's ideal teenage donut donut donker. Boy that's wow. The only thing is him. Why?

00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:39.660
 Don't I get anything? Sure homie you'll get to carry it.

00:27:56.660 --> 00:28:05.160
 The Aldrich family starring Ezra Stone is Henry with Jackie Kalka's Homer is written by Frank Tarlov with music by Jack Miller.

00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:09.160
 Ms. Grinn Mrs. Aldrich, our house Jamison and Catherine Rod.

00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:15.660
 And this is Dan Seymour in New York saying, "The Aldrich family is brought to you by the Jell-O family."

00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:20.660
 Oh, the big red ladder stand for the Jello family.

00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:24.660
 Oh, the big red ladder stand for the Jello family.

00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:26.660
 That's Jello, yum, yum, yum.

00:28:26.660 --> 00:28:28.660
 Jello pudding, yum, yum, yum.

00:28:28.660 --> 00:28:32.660
 Jello tap, b-y-o-ka pudding, yam, sari.

00:28:32.660 --> 00:28:40.660
 New as new as a square egg.

00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:42.660
 Amazing, the only one of its kind.

00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:44.060
 That's minute rice.

00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:46.660
 Minute rice for magically quick, quick meals.

00:28:46.660 --> 00:28:49.060
 You've never tasted such true rice flavor.

00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:51.760
 You've never seen rice so light, white, and fluffy.

00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:54.560
 And all you do is drop it in water and bring to a boil.

00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:56.960
 No washing, rinsing, draining, or steaming.

00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:59.160
 Minute rice is quicker to fix than potatoes.

00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:03.160
 You'll want to use it in all sorts of combinations for quick, quick meals.

00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:04.460
 Remember the name "minute"?

00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:06.960
 Minute rice in the red, white, and blue box.

00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:20.960

00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:23.960

00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:27.960
 Quick George, Patchessy Kase. We've got a New York on the rocket ship.

00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:28.960
 What?

00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:32.960
 The engineer in the control room says we're going from coast to coast in 40 seconds.

00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:36.200
 Gracie means our program is on next on NBC.

00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:42.200

00:29:42.200 --> 00:30:11.200
