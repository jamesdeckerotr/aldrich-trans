00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 [Music]

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 And now the Jell-O family presents the Aldrich family.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 Henry! Henry Aldrich!

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 Coming, mother.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 Yes, it's the Aldrich family based on characters

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 originated by Clifford Goldsmith

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 and starring Ezra Stoners Henry with Jackie Kelka's Homer.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 And yes, it's the Jell-O family with its three famous desserts.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 Jell-O in those sex-delicious flavors,

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 Jell-O puttings without old-fashioned homemade flavors,

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 and Jell-O tapioca puttings,

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 a miracle of goodness, a marvel of speed.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 Everyone's a Jell-O good fellow, a very good Jell-O good fellow,

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,800
 So rich, so tempting and mellow

15
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,200
 J-E-L-L-O

16
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,600
 And now for the All-Rich family

17
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:21,000
 A boy is a boy, and that's all there is to it

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,800
 He gets into difficulty somehow and he gets out of them somehow

19
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,800
 But what happens in between is usually unforgettable.

20
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:31,100
 The scene opens at the telephone in the Aldrich Front Hall.

21
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,600
 It is early evening.

22
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,000
 You did, Homer. You really got them?

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,500
 I'll say I have them right here in my hand.

24
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,100
 Gee.

25
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,600
 And Charlie Clark didn't mind loaning them to you?

26
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,400
 No, I just had a promise we take good care of them.

27
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,800
 And boy, you should...

28
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,800
 Just a minute, Homer.

29
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,800
 Yes, mother?

30
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,800
 Where are you?

31
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,100
 Why, I'm just sort of on the phone.

32
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:53,300
 I'm up to the hang up and start your studying before we leave.

33
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,740
 Sure mother in just one second. Hello Homer.

34
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,020
 You should see the notes. There's everything important we learned all last month.

35
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,020
 Oh boy.

36
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:05,940
 Once we get these ten pages under our belt, we can write that French exam tomorrow blindfold.

37
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:07,940
 Well hang on to them Homer, I'll be right over.

38
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:10,660
 Okay you better hurry though. Charlie's going to the movie.

39
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:12,900
 You mean he has all his studying done?

40
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:18,100
 Yeah but you know Charlie. He's smart. Sure. But what else has he got?

41
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,220
 You're right Homer.

42
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:21,620
 And he has to have his notes back as soon as he gets out.

43
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,380
 Just a second, Homer. Yes, Father?

44
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:26,020
 Did you hear your mother tell you to get started on your homework?

45
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,780
 Yes, sir. The only thing is...

46
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:31,380
 Well, this fella Homer and I know is going to the movie scene.

47
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,620
 Henry, hang up right now. You're not going to the movies tonight.

48
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:37,620
 No, no, Father. It's only that we have to give something back to him. Very important.

49
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:40,420
 And you're not going to run any errands. Now, please put down that receiver.

50
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,220
 But, Father...

51
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:42,620
 Hey, Ray! Hello, Homer. Goodbye.

52
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,120
 What?

53
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:47,220
 I've got to explain something to my father. I'll call you back.

54
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:48,820
 Henry, you're not calling Homer back.

55
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,320
 You have a French examination tomorrow.

56
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:53,500
 And every night this week you thought up a different excuse to get out of studying.

57
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,260
 Sure, Father, I agree with you.

58
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:56,960
 And would you like to know why?

59
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,620
 Indeed I would.

60
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:00,420
 Because I've been saving all my strength up for tonight.

61
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:03,340
 Boy, I'm gonna roll up my sleeves and tighten my belt

62
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:05,500
 and digest the whole French language.

63
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,340
 That's fine. And would you please guess the word?

64
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:10,660
 The only thing is, Father, I know you'll think it sounds unreasonable,

65
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:12,660
 but I just have to go over to Homer's.

66
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:14,760
 And me, your mother and I are rushing off to a bridge game,

67
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,060
 and I have it much time.

68
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:17,740
 But I'd like to make one thing clear.

69
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:18,380
 Yes, Father.

70
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:19,540
 Just this.

71
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:23,440
 You are not under any circumstances to go anywhere near Homer's house this evening.

72
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:23,940
 But father...

73
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:26,580
 You will stay home by yourself and concentrate on your French.

74
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:29,140
 But father, won't you please let me explain something.

75
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:30,540
 Henry, let me explain something to you.

76
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:31,140
 Yes, sir.

77
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:36,140
 Son, I don't think you realize how important a solid foundation is.

78
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:36,740
 And sure, but...

79
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:37,640
 Now you take a bridge.

80
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,440
 A bridge?

81
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,240
 When someone builds a bridge, they hire the best engineers.

82
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,640
 They spend years on it.

83
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,240
 And when it's finished, it may be the best-looking bridge in the world.

84
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:45,940
 Gee!

85
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:47,340
 But suppose, Henry...

86
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,940
 Suppose that bridge has a weak foundation.

87
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:51,740
 A truck runs over it and where is it?

88
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:52,340
 In the water?

89
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:52,940
 The truck?

90
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:53,940
 Everything.

91
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,440
 And it's the same with life.

92
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,540
 You understand?

93
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:57,840
 I think so, Father.

94
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,540
 Fine.

95
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:00,440
 Now then, please get to work on your foundation.

96
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,540
 - You wouldn't but Father-- - I know more excuses.

97
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:03,540
 Oh, excuse me, Mary.

98
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:04,540
 It's certainly Father.

99
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:08,340
 Henry, did I hear Father say someone ran over someone on a bridge in a truck?

100
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:10,640
 - No, Mary. Gee, what-- - Was it anyone we know?

101
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,140
 It wasn't anybody, Mary.

102
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:14,940
 And listen, would you be willing to speak to Father for me?

103
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:17,240
 - What about? - He just misunderstood the whole thing.

104
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:23,240
 All I want to do is go over to Homer's house because Charlie Clark has these notes saying he's going to the movies.

105
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:26,240
 - Oh, Larry? - No, Charlie, so would you please, Mary?

106
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,240
 - Certainly, Father. - Yes, Father.

107
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,240
 Henry wants to know if he can go to the movies with Charlie Clark.

108
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,240
 - What? - No, Mary, no.

109
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,240
 She was, can't you understand French? I didn't mean English.

110
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:41,240
 - Hey, man, come in here. - Now look what you've done, Mary.

111
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,240
 - Oh, my goodness, that's the last favor I'll ever do for you.

112
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,240
 - Now, if I can just stay here, let me speak to Henry.

113
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,240
 Mother, can I please explain something to you?

114
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,240
 Certainly, dear.

115
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,240
 Well, you see, it's like this.

116
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,240
 Henry, your father and I would love to let you go to the movies tonight, but...

117
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,240
 Mother, you don't understand. I don't want to go to the movies.

118
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,240
 You don't?

119
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:03,240
 No, gee whiz. Movies are the farthest thing from my mind.

120
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,240
 All I want to do tonight is study.

121
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,240
 Really?

122
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,240
 Over at Homer's house.

123
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,240
 Well, then, what's everybody so excited about?

124
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,240
 Sam, all he wants to do is go over to the Browns along with us.

125
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,640
 Alice Henry is not going over to Homer.

126
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,840
 Henry, you are not going over to Homer's.

127
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,040
 For mother!

128
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:23,440
 Dear your father and I both feel that tonight you should study at home.

129
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,240
 For mother, you don't understand!

130
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,240
 Are we going to be late?

131
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,440
 I'm coming, Sam and Henry.

132
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,240
 Yes, mother.

133
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:32,040
 If you work real hard and pass that French exam,

134
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,840
 you can go to the movies tomorrow night.

135
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:43,440
 Let me help with the table cover well.

136
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,840
 It's all set, Sam, and have I been looking forward to tonight?

137
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,640
 We haven't played bridge for a whole week.

138
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,840
 Alice, you and I can start shopping the cards.

139
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,440
 All right.

140
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,840
 And I was saying, well, it's all a matter of discipline.

141
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,040
 Shuffling cards, raising a son.

142
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:56,840
 Oh.

143
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,040
 Yeah, you're right, Sam.

144
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,240
 It's quite a job.

145
00:05:59,240 --> 00:05:59,840
 Who deals?

146
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,040
 And now, Sam, let's not talk about Henry.

147
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,440
 I feel badly enough about the whole thing already.

148
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,640
 What happened, Dallas?

149
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:09,240
 Honestly, Elizabeth, I wish you could have seen Henry's face when we lived.

150
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,040
 Henry's face?

151
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,240
 What about it?

152
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,480
 He was salting because I made him stay home and study.

153
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,200
 First he wanted to go to the movies.

154
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,880
 Then he had to give Charlie Clark something.

155
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,280
 Anything to get out of the house.

156
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,980
 Well, I'll tell you frankly, Sam,

157
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,540
 when Homer wants to get out of the house,

158
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:22,820
 I'm inclined to let him go.

159
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:25,880
 It will even go so far as to encourage him.

160
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,180
 Isn't that nice?

161
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:29,720
 You mean you encourage him to neglect his studies?

162
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,020
 Nobody has to do that.

163
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,220
 Who steals it?

164
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:34,920
 Although, will I wish you'd made him stay home tonight?

165
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,560
 Oh?

166
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,820
 Homer's gone out?

167
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:37,460
 Yes.

168
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:40,060
 Homer, hit me, phoned him before you got get out of his hand.

169
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,440
 Henry phoned him.

170
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,500
 Whose deal is it?

171
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:46,900
 Yes, and then homophoned the Beijou Theatre to find out what time the picture.

172
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:47,400
 Picture?

173
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,300
 Alice, did you hear that?

174
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,100
 Sam, I'm sure there must be some mistakes.

175
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,000
 Who deals?

176
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,100
 Will do you realize those boys are off to a movie when they should be studying?

177
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,900
 And after I expressly forbid Henry...

178
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:58,100
 Relax, Sam. What harm can they do?

179
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,500
 Who deals?

180
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,000
 Well, you don't understand unless we do something about this right now.

181
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,100
 Sam, you can't possibly do anything tonight.

182
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,300
 Oh, yes, I can.

183
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,000
 Come here, please sit down and play a break.

184
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,100
 Whose deal is it?

185
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,100
 Will, get your coat off.

186
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:10,600
 What?

187
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:14,100
 You and I are going down to the V-U Theater and catch Henry and Homer red-handed.

 Hey Henry.

 We Homer?

192
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,600
 Hey me and Apple, what are you?

193
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:37,100
 Now listen Homer, I thought we decided to speak nothing but French while we're studying.

194
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:40,100
 No, but well, don't anymore.

 No.

200
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,100
 What is French for Apple?

201
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,100
 Apple?

202
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,100
 I don't remember.

203
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,100

 Thanks.

 I'm in their seat.

210
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:05,100
 And listen, Homer, let's stop fooling around with our stomachs and get to work.

 Charlie's movie gets out at 10 o'clock.

212

 We only have an hour and a half.

213
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:12,100
 Tarn it all. Now I have to waste time answering the phone.

214
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:15,100
 Why not answering French and kill two birds with one spell?

215
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,100
 That's an idea.

216
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,100
 Bonsoir?

217
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,100

 Hey, is that... Hello?

221
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:28,100
 Hey Homer, that was my father.

222
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,100
 He was. Does he want me to go home?

223
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,100
 I don't know. He hung up.

224
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,100
 You mean he's still mad at you?

225
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:38,100
 Listen Mary, I'm not speaking to you. Besides, we've got a lot of studying to do.

226
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:44,600
 You know Henry, if we got notes like these off Charlie years ago, today you'd be in Princeton and I'd be in Spartan Tech.

227
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,100
 Henry, he's down at the Beazew Theatre with Mr. Brown.

228
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,100
 Mr. Brown, that's my father.

229
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:51,100
 Mary, you're crazy. They're playing bread.

230
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:55,100
 No, they are Henry. I just passed them at the Beazew and they said they were waiting for you and Homer.

231
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,100
 You mean that's why he phoned?

232
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,100
 Oh, I know Henry, is that they're expecting you?

233
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,100
 Gee, that's funny.

234
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:02,100
 Homer, maybe we'd better dash right down there and see what they want.

235
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,200
 We only have an hour and a half left to study.

236
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,340
 And my brain's just limbering up.

237
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:08,980
 We can take our notes along with us and study on the way.

238
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:11,420
 But Henry, it's snowing, and I promise, Charlie,

239
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,700
 we wouldn't let them get down.

240
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,740
 Well, look, we can put them back in this comic book

241
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:15,940
 so they won't get all away.

242
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:16,780
 Let him know.

243
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:17,820
 Homer, come on.

244
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:20,300
 My father wants to see me down at the Beijou Theater.

245
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:20,640
 Sure.

246
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,660
 And after all the trouble I've had this week,

247
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:24,540
 I'm playing it safe from now on.

 Any luck, Mr. Allridge?

 I've afraid not, Mr. Harris.

252
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:38,040
 We've been up and down your aisle twice, and there's no sign of the boys.

 I told you I didn't remember selling them a ticket.

 Sam, let's get back to our bridge game.

00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:45,040
 Hey, look, Mr. Harris, you wouldn't consider putting the house lights on for a minute, would you?

256
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,040
 But, Sam, how could we look at the picture?

 Well, we're looking for the boy.

 Back home and play bridge.

 We'll be going to wait outside the theater here until Henry and Homer show up.

 But, Sam, they won't show up.

 Well...

 Is what?

294
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,200
 Foundation will.

 What good is a bridge without one?

296
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,040
 You're right, Sam. Let's go home and play bridge.

297
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:56,600
 Well, here they come. What did I tell you?

298
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:00,800
 Well, I'll be done. And buried in a comic book.

299

 Henry! Hello, Father. Hi, Father.

300
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,660
 Well, Henry. Well, home up. Father, could you tell me what it is you wanted?

301
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:10,520
 We're kind in a hurry. You kids are pretty cool, aren't you?

302
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:17,000
 Well, it's snowing, Father. I don't suppose you recall that you're supposed to be at home studying.

303
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,880
 Oh, we've been studying, Father. We've been studying all the way down here.

304
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,480
 Sure, you see this Kermit book?

305
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,920
 I see it. Let me have it, please.

306
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,600
 Father, wait.

307
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,600
 Let me have it.

00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,320
 Thank you.

 But we have to give that back to Charlie.

 He's right here in the movie, see?

311
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,120
 Homer, that's a pretty poor excuse.

312
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:31,520
 Why?

313
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:34,000
 Henry, I don't want to attract attention by dealing with you now.

314
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,640
 Dealing with me, Father, in one way?

315
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,280
 I'll attend to the matter tomorrow morning.

316
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,840
 Father, what have I done now?

317
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,520
 There's a streetcar stopping over there.

318
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,720
 I want to see you get on it.

319
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:44,080
 Father, listen, we've got to have that Kermit book.

320
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,400
 Homer, get on that streetcar and go home with Henry

321
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,440
 and finish your studying.

322
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,800
 But Father, what about Charlie?

323
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,480
 Henry!

324
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,480
 Come on, huh?

325
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,480
 But she wish him what about our nose?

326
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:58,480
 Well, that wasn't the pleasant thing to do, Will, but some day those boys will thank us for it.

327
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:09,480
 Mary, speak louder, I can't hear you.

328
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,480
 You don't say.

329
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,480
 You don't say, Mary.

330
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,480
 You don't say.

331
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:23,400
 Here's your father now. You tell the boys to come over here to the Browns and not to worry about a thing.

332
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,800
 Come on, Sam. On with the bridge.

333
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,800
 Goodbye, dear.

334
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,440
 Well, Alice, I was right.

 Oh, you were, Sam?

336
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:32,360
 I sure have to hand it to Sam. He certainly understands boys.

337
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,640
 Well, I work hard at trying to understand them, Will.

338
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:37,520
 Well, Sam, you have to work a little harder in the future.

339
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,000
 What's that?

340
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,680
 It so happens that Mary just phoned me and said, "Henry and Homer have practically gone to pieces over what you did to them."

341
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,720
 But all we did...

342
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,280
 All you did was take their French notes away from them.

343
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,380
 Alice, all we took from them was a comic book.

344
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:51,180
 Sam, they were studying their notes.

345
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,180
 At the movies?

346
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:54,480
 Mary told them you wanted to see them down there.

347
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,280
 No, Alice, I've heard a lot of stories, but I hope you don't believe that one.

348
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:01,080
 Sam, the boys had their French notes inside that comic book.

349
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,480
 And now they have to return them to Charlie Clark.

350
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,880
 What's that? What did you say?

351
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:08,380
 Sam, I told you not to toss that comic book into the trash bin.

352
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:09,180
 No, wait.

353
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:11,880
 The trash bin? Sam, all right.

354
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:21,880
 [Music]

355
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,580
 Here, Homer, head to the glass of ginger ale.

356
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:25,480
 She thinks.

357
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,380
 The only thing is Homer, what time is it?

358
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:30,080
 And now, Henry, you just have another cookie and stop worrying.

359
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,880
 But Mother Charlie will be getting out of that movie any minute now.

360
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,680
 And I promised him this notes back.

361
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,380
 I'm sure your father will be right back with him.

362
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:38,380
 Oh, excuse me while I answer the phone.

363
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:41,680
 Listen, Homer, while we're waiting, why don't we go over a few verbs?

364
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:48,040
 You know verbally sure why not oh, that's a wonderful idea and mother would you please help us over a hump?

365
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:54,840
 Certainly what is it you want to know Henry the first person plural future tense of the verb to be to be what there?

366
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:58,680
 Just you know

367
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,440
 to be

368
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,440
 Etra sure oh

369
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:09,120
 That that's French isn't it there sure yes, I was pretty sure it was French

370
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:14,320
 Well, let's see now. First person plural, future thing.

371
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:19,120
 Boys, wouldn't it do you more good if you figured it out yourself?

372
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,120
 [Laughter]

373
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,320
 We don't remember!

374
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,720
 Alice, guess who that was on the phone?

375
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,720
 Sam and Will.

376
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,720
 And boys, I'm afraid they're going to be a little delayed.

377
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,520
 Delayed?

378
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,520
 Elizabeth, what happened?

379
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:33,720
 Well, they got down to the Beijou Theater and it seemed the cracks been, had been emptied.

380
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,320
 And empty?

381
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,520
 But they said you haven't any worry about boys.

382
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,320
 They're going to keep right on looking.

383
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,320
 Oh boy!

384
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,320
 (music)

385
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:52,320
 (applause)

386
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:58,320
 And now while Henry's waiting, it's a good time to listen to Meredith Wilson and his talking people.

387
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,320
 Hey! It's intermission!

388
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,320
 Intermission!

389
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,320
 Okay, everybody knows it's intermission.

390
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,320
 How do they know?

391
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,320
 Because you're not Homer and I'm not Henry.

392
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,320
 Henry.

393
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,320
 Well you certainly have Mrs. Aldrin.

394
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,320
 Oh my God.

395
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,320
 Mead Diamere's your chance to shimmer.

396
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,320
 Mike Dello, America's favorite gelatin dessert?

397
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,320
 Yes sir.

398
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,320
 In all six delicious flavors?

399
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:20,320
 In all six delicious locked in flavors.

400
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,320
 It would be a pleasure.

401
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,320
 Starting with strawberry, we we we we.

402
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,320
 Transparent, cherry, we we we.

403
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:31,320
 Orange, lemon, lemon, lemon, lemon.

404
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,320
 Jake, eat, oh, oh.

405
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:36,320
 Oh, there's a big red letter that's spelled jello.

406
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:41,480
 and jello smells a treat. It sure does because that rich fruit-like flavor is

407
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:45,260
 locked right in there by a special process so it can't get up to your first

408
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:51,000
 electable spoonful. Delectable. And the whole jello family is delectable. For ease

409
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,960
 and speed and variety, get the jello family. Don't say dessert say jello.

410
00:15:55,960 --> 00:16:02,300
 Jello puddings. Don't say dessert say jello. Jello tappy oka puddings. Yup, the

411
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:05,740
 a jello family of desserts if you don't want to say it sing it

412
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,500
 j-e-t-o-kout

413
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,860
 oooooooh

414
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:15,860
 and now back to the Aldrich family

415
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:21,260
 yes getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldrich

416
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:25,020
 in his effort to discipline his son mister Aldrich has inadvertently lost the

417
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:27,340
 french notes he ordered Henry to study

418
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:30,460
 notes which the boys promised to return to charlie clark

419
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:32,700
 The scene opens in the brown's front hall.

420
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,220
 It is later that evening.

421
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:35,220
 Hello?

422
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:36,220
 Hello?

423
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:37,220
 Is that Mr. Prescott?

424
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:39,820
 Who teaches French at Central High?

425
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:40,820
 That's right.

426
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:41,820
 Who's this?

427
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,500
 Well, Mr. Prescott, this is Mrs. Oldridge.

428
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,500
 Henry's mother?

429
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,500
 Henry.

430
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,500
 Henry Oldridge.

431
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,340
 The nice-looking boy with the colleague.

432
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,740
 He's in my French class?

433
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:52,900
 Yes, and frankly, he's having quite a bit of trouble.

434
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:53,900
 Trouble?

435
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,660
 Oh, yes, I know the boy.

436
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:59,580
 You see, he started in studying his French this evening, and he was buckling right down

437
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:04,860
 and taking a real interest in it. You don't say. Yes. And this gives me did you say Henry

438
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:11,660
 Aldrich? Yes, that's right. He's taken an interest in French. Yes, of course. How did

439
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:16,020
 that happen? What's that? Is this Mr. James Prescott?

440
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:29,820
 Ouch! Well, what you mind looking where you're going?

441
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:32,740
 But the snow's blinding me! I can't see a thing!

442
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:34,740
 Where are we anyway?

443
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,440
 Somewhere behind the visual theater.

444
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:39,440
 Sam, are you sure this is where Mr. Harris dumps his waste paper?

445
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,940
 Frankly, I'm not sure of anything.

446
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:42,540
 Sam, the whole thing is hopeless.

447
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:46,140
 How are we going to find a comic book out here in the dark with all this snow?

448
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,640
 We'll just have to keep looking.

449
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,140
 But we'll be here all night!

450
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:53,140
 You know, Sam, if we stayed home and played bridge in the first place, none of this would have happened.

451
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,140
 Now, we'll...

452
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,140
 Whoop!

453
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:58,140
 I'm sorry, Sam. I guess I stepped on you again.

454
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:00,140
 No, you didn't. I stepped on something.

455
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:02,140
 Hey, let me have that flashlight.

456
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:05,140
 Here. Sam, look.

457
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:07,140
 We'll get your foot out of that bucket.

458
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:10,140
 The only thing is, I can't get it out.

459
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:12,140
 All right, Will, let's not lose our heads.

460
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:16,140
 Out in. Lift your foot. Lift it so I can get hold of the bucket.

461
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:19,140
 All right, Tom. Race yourself. Take it easy, Sam.

462
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:22,140
 He will stop dancing around.

463
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:26,140
 Now then, now pull! Pull yourself!

464
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:28,140
 Is it starting to give?

465
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:30,140
 No! Not yet!

466
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:34,140
 Sam, where are you?

467
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:36,140
 Sam, where'd you disappear to?

468
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:37,140
 Sam!

469
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:50,140
 Homer, isn't that the fastest you can walk in?

470
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:50,980
 - You can warm up.

471
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,780
 - But look, and hold your head back

472
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:55,300
 so you let the snow blow right into your face.

473
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,140
 - Homer.

474
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:58,300
 - Better still open your mouth.

475
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:00,540
 - Homer, can't you keep your mind on your foundation

476
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:01,740
 for five seconds?

477
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:02,900
 - It's on my wife.

478
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:05,180
 - Look, suppose you're building a bridge, son.

479
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:07,020
 - And I'm not going in for building bridges

480
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,340
 on a night like this.

481
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:09,540
 - Just suppose you were a Homer,

482
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:11,140
 and you had a weak foundation,

483
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:13,780
 and then a truck runs over you, and where are you?

484
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:14,600
 - Where?

485
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,620
 - Flowing around the water with a whole bridge

486
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:18,100
 on top of you.

487
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,700
 - And do you feel all right?

488
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,420
 Hey, this is Mr. Prescott's house, isn't it?

489
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:23,420
 Let's see.

490
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:25,640
 97, yeah, this is it.

491
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:28,340
 Henry, you're sure your mother knows what she's talking about?

492
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:29,340
 Sure, Homer.

493
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,400
 Mr. Prescott said all we had to do was come over here,

494
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,300
 and he'd loan us a whole set of French notes.

495
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,300
 Boy.

496
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:36,140
 They'll be much better than Charlie's notes, Homer.

497
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:38,620
 I think they're Mr. Prescott's own personal ones.

498
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:40,220
 Boy, imagine.

499
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:43,380
 Straight from the horses now.

500
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:46,340
 And all we had to do is make one copy for us

501
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:47,340
 and one for Charlie.

502
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,340
 And ring the doorbell.

503
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:49,460
 Sure.

504
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:52,260
 and Homer don't forget to take your hat off when we get in the hall.

505
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:54,060
 I'm not wearing a hat.

506
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:56,960
 Then brushless snow off your hair.

507
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,960
 Well, good evening Henry, Homer.

508
00:19:58,960 --> 00:19:59,960
 Good evening Mr. Prescott.

509
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,460
 Good evening Mr. Prescott.

510
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:02,460
 I've been expecting you.

511
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:02,960
 Come in.

512
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,260
 Thank you Mr. Prescott.

513
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:05,960
 Thank you Mr. Prescott.

514
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,560
 Henry, if I got it all off my hair.

515
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,860
 I mean the snow.

516
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:11,760
 Sure Homer, come on.

517
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:16,660
 Well boys, I want to tell you that I got one of the most pleasant surprises of my life this evening.

518
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:17,660
 Uh-huh.

519
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:18,860
 Let me have your coat Henry.

520
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:19,860
 I know, but...

521
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,060
 Thanks, I'll hang it up here.

522
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:25,100
 Yes, sir, Henry, when your mother told me how seriously you were taking your French lessons,

523
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:29,060
 I said to myself, "Presscott, you were all wrong about those boys."

524
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:30,060
 Gee!

525
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:31,060
 And Gee!

526
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:32,060
 Now your coat, Aunt Homer.

527
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:35,260
 Well, the only thing is, we're sort of in a hurry.

528
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:37,660
 Homer, Mr. Prescott wants your coat.

529
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:39,860
 Oh, oh, my coat.

530
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:41,060
 There, right.

531
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:43,160
 Now, come on into the living room, boys.

532
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,460
 I'll have the French notes for you any minute now.

533
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:46,460
 Any minute?

534
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:47,460
 Here, sit down.

535
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:48,460
 Well, thank you.

536
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:51,860
 You see, I loan my notes to another student, Charlie Clark.

537
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:53,660
 Charlie Clark!

538
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,660
 Yes, and he promised faithfully.

539
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:57,660
 Have them back to me by ten o'clock.

540
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:59,660
 Oh boy.

541
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:00,660
 Oh boy.

542
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:03,660
 What he phoned only a few minutes ago to say he'd been slightly delayed.

543
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:04,660
 Oh, Henry.

544
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:05,660
 Oh, is anything wrong?

545
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:06,660
 Wrong.

546
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:09,660
 Oh no, did he yes and no!

547
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:11,660
 I want you boys to take good care of those notes.

548
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:13,260
 They're a rather valuable set.

549
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:14,260
 Mr. Prescott.

550
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:15,260
 Yes, Homer?

551
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:16,260
 That is...

552
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:18,860
 See this is a nice place you've got here.

553
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:23,260
 Thanks. See, while we're waiting, could I offer you boys a glass of ginger ale?

554
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:26,060
 Ginger ale? No thanks.

555
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:28,660
 We couldn't drink a drop of anything.

556
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:40,060
 Mr. Harris, are you sure Henry and Homer didn't show up?

557
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:40,860
 Positive, Charlie.

558
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:43,060
 Oh, but she is after ten o'clock and boy.

559
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:45,760
 Boy, what am I gonna do? I promise Mr. Prescott...

560
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,360
 Well, if you want to wait around another five minutes, Charlie, here's something you might like to read.

561
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:49,860
 What?

562
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:50,860
 This comic book.

563
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:52,460
 Adam, smash your comics.

564
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:55,060
 I fished it out of the trash bin there earlier this evening.

565
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:55,560
 Here.

566
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,360
 No thanks, Mr. Harris. I've read it.

567
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,260
 Oh, Mr. Harris.

568
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:59,760
 Oh, no, not again.

569
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,960
 Look, Mr. Harris, let's be reasonable, huh?

570
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,760
 You aren't busy this time of night.

571
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,760
 Look, what is it you're trying to sell me?

572
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,760
 It's one of our new machines, sir.

573
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,260
 And if I could just give you a quick demonstration.

574
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:12,060
 All right. All right.

575
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:14,560
 Where is all in my car? I'll be right back.

576
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,760
 Say Mr. Harris.

577
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,520
 Yes, Charlie.

578
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,960
 If you see, Henry or Homer, will you tell him to phone me?

579
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:19,900
 OK, Charlie.

580
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:21,560
 It's a matter of life and death.

581
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,240
 Excuse me, Sonny.

582
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,240
 I'm sorry, Mr. Harris.

583
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,440
 Now then, Mr. Harris, you see this?

584
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,880
 Well, it looks just like an ordinary vacuum cleaner to me.

585
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,360
 That's where you're wrong.

586
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:32,320
 This is a special vacuum cleaner special for theaters.

587
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:32,960
 You don't say?

588
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,320
 Yes, sir.

589
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,000
 Now, if we can just find some old scrap paper

590
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,040
 or anything I can demonstrate with,

591
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:41,920
 oh, how about that Adam Smasher comic book?

592
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,920
 Yeah, thank you.

593
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,280
 Well, what are you going to do with it?

594
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:47,580
 I'm going to tear it into bits into tiny bits.

595
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:51,260
 And then we'll scatter the pieces all around like this.

596
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:52,420
 Quite a mess, isn't it?

597
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:53,260
 It sure is.

598
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:56,460
 And then we'll tear up a few of those chocolate bar apples.

599
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:59,220
 Mm, chocolate drip into tiny little pieces.

600
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:00,500
 Now take it easy.

601
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,660
 If anybody comes out of the theater and sees this mess--

602
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:03,620
 Oh, Mr. Harris!

603
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:05,740
 Mr. Eldridge, what happened to you?

604
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:07,060
 You were all wet.

605
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:08,260
 Frankly, I'm ashamed to tell you.

606
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:09,580
 He fell into a snow drift.

607
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:11,540
 Now, if you gentlemen would like to watch it--

608
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:13,700
 Mr. Harris, did you have any sort of a floodlight

609
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:17,740
 We can borrow a flood line. We can't see a thing out here and back here.

610
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:20,100
 Alrighty, Mr. Harris, here we go.

611
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:27,700
 Something very important that we have to find a certain fine spot, Mr. Hat, on we tell you, turn that thing off.

612
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:31,700
 What did Mr. Harris watch any of these sprouts of paper?

613
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:36,700
 Did you ever see a vacuum cleaner eat a paper like that?

614
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:40,700
 Mr. Harris, have you seen anything of a comic book I threw in your trash bin?

615
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:43,200
 A comic book? It's a matter of life and death.

616
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,600
 Mr. Orridge, I know exactly why you'll find it.

617
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:56,800
 [Music]

618
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,200
 Henry, are you sure you're copying it down right?

619
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,500
 Sure, keep going Homer.

620
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,500
 Lay Duke's doorlings.

621
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:05,000
 Lay Duke's the UCKS.

622
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 Henry, not Doc's Duke's.

623
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,300
 Oh, sure, Duke's, okay, what about him?

624
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:12,600
 Sonton Famil, they plume no bill.

625
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:17,440
 Or is it mobile is it what mobile you know is in Memphis?

626
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:22,280
 How would I know what comes after that that's the end of the page well stay here

627
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,800
 I'll see if they pasted the next one together father

628
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:30,160
 Father's the next page ready yet

629
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:39,240
 I'm using it just have to go on this small piece okay, but oh yeah, had me the magnifying glad he was father

630
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,500
 It's almost midnight and we promise trial.

631
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,900
 All right, Henry, relax.

632
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:45,480
 Your French exam doesn't start to land in the morning.

633
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,340
 Mr. Prescott, we'll have his notes by then.

634
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:48,000
 I know, but--

635
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,540
 Here, here's your next page.

636
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:50,940
 It's pretty messy, but--

637
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:51,820
 Thanks, Father.

638
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:53,100
 I've got it, Homer.

639
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:55,020
 Sam, there's one thing I still don't understand.

640
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:55,780
 Now, let's be careful.

641
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:57,620
 You're blowing the pieces all over the living room.

642
00:24:57,620 --> 00:25:00,620
 Sam, do you have a scrap that would fit this space?

643
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:03,020
 Well, I've got enough trouble putting together my own pieces.

644
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:05,180
 There, was it absolutely necessary for you

645
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:07,420
 to buy that vacuum cleaner?

646
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:12,420
 Now, Alice, an extra vacuum cleaner is very handy thing to have around.

647
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:17,420
 Sure. And besides, this one's different. It's especially for theaters.

648
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:19,420
 Will.

649
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:22,420
 Henry, Henry, you can't be finished with that page already.

650
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:25,420
 No, but we just copied out the first sentence and Gee whiz.

651
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:28,420
 What's wrong with you? Mother, does this make sense to you?

652
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:30,420
 Le premier d'you chocolate drip?

653
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:31,420
 What's that?

654
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:35,420
 The a la Adam Smasher Walla.

655
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:42,420
 No, wait a minute.

656
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:51,420
 Now listen, Homer.

657
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:53,420
 Listen, I mean, uh, kabool-a-book.

658
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:55,420
 Well, anyway, who you kidding?

659
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:56,420
 Kidding, kidding, me kidding.

660
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:58,420
 I mean, more.

661
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:59,420
 Sure, huh.

662
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:03,420
 How can you bet me 30 cents will pass this French exam when I happen to know you haven't

663
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:04,420
 got 30 cents?

664
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:06,420
 What's the beautiful part of him?

665
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:07,420
 What is?

666
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:09,420
 When I win the bet, I'll have 30 cents.

667
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:10,420
 Miss Pa?

668
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:12,420
 Well, here's a sure bet for you ladies.

669
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:14,420
 And that's the hit you make with the family

670
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:16,420
 when you serve jello puddings for dessert.

671
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:18,420
 Yes, jello puddings.

672
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:20,420
 Chocolate, butter, scotch, and vanilla.

673
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:22,420
 Creamy, rich, and luscious smooth.

674
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:24,420
 Chuck full of old-fashioned homemade goodness.

675
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:27,420
 Now, sure, jello puddings are nourishing made with milk.

676
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:29,420
 And sure, they're quick and easy.

677
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:31,420
 Cook in about five minutes.

678
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:35,100
 The great thing about jello puddings is they taste sasuel.

679
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:39,500
 And you know that name jello is a trademark, the property of general foods, and it tells

680
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:42,460
 you you're getting a genuine jello product.

681
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:46,860
 Remember that when you look on your grocery shelf tomorrow for jello puddings, and remember

682
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:53,940
 more people buy jello puddings than any other prepared puddings in the world.

683
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:59,180
 The Olrich family starring as Rustona's Henry with Jackie Calcas Homer is written by Patricia

684
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:03,560
 Jaudrey and Del Dinsdale with music by Jack Miller. Mr. and Mrs. Aldrich are

685
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:08,400
 house Jameson and Katherine Roth and this is Dan Seymour in New York saying

686
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:13,880
 the Aldrich family is brought to you by the Jell-O family.

687
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:26,880
 Everyone's a jello good fellow, a very good jello good fellow, so rich, so tempting and now, oh, J-E-L-L-O!

688
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:39,880
 Listen again next Thursday, same time, same station, to another sparkling half hour with the old-rich family.

689
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,720
 This is NBC, the National Broadcasting Company.

690
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:46,300
 (bells ringing)

691
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:49,040
 (bells ringing)

692
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,040
 (chime)
