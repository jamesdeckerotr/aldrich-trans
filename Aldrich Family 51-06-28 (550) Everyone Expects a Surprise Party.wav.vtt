00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
 [Music]

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
 If you weren't too far from the days when you were in high school,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 you probably remember that a teenage boy is about as unpredictable as the wind.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
 And so because Henry Aldrich is an average boy,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
 the kind you'll find anywhere in your town,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 well, there's just no telling.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
 It's morning and the scene opens in the Aldrich Mythi room.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
 Now, don't worry, Ed, I've taken care of everything.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.840
 I know the country courts wouldn't have a better chairman of the arrangement committee.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:32.840
 Thank you, Anne.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.840
 But I can't help worrying.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.400
 Last year, only 11 people turned up for our Fourth of July celebration.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.760
 And six of them were waiters.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:40.760
 That's right.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.760
 Well, this Fourth of July will be different.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.440
 I have a rose surprise.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:45.440
 A surprise?

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:46.680
 A special fireworks display.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.080
 George Washington crossing the Delaware on Hothback.

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.080
 It's famous.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.080
 Didn't Washington cross in a rowboat?

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.280
 That's the surprise.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.280
 And that is no.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.280
 I have a...

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.280
 You see, if we want a big crowd, we have...

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.280
 - We have to call the killer to hear him, sir.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.280
 - No, but he isn't.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.280
 Now, my idea is...

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:07.280
 - He isn't home.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.280
 - I mean, he isn't here.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.280
 The thing here is not to scribble about pennies.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.280
 - Oh, I agree with you, sir.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.280
 We send a little money on publicity.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.280
 We'll be able to...

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.280
 How many do you find this conversation particularly interesting?

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.280
 - Oh, no, no, no.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.280
 I mean...

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.280
 - Oh, but if you want, Henry, he's in the kitchen.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.280
 - Thank you.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.280
 - The kitchen is the room with the refrigerator.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:35.800
 Good to you. All the time. Now if you don't mind. Oh sure. I'm going I would say it. And all of the

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:43.880
 things. I'm going to. What are you doing here. What does it look like. Like a clean. That's what I'm

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:52.120
 going to. For a home or guy can help his mother out without the force to do it. Can you're doing this

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.380
 of your own free-roading humor.

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.160
 And Homer, since I'm going to be busy.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.000
 Oh, don't mind me, madam.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.720
 I'll just sit here and watch.

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.720
 Don't be just a wise guy, Homer.

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.920
 Personally, there's nothing I like to see there

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.520
 in a well-kept kitchen.

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.640
 Listen, if you came over to scarf at me--

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.720
 I don't see how you keep your kitchen so wide and clean.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.400
 Homer and your woodwork.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.240
 It's just spotless.

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.720
 Homer, it may interest you to know

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.480
 that the reason I'm helping my mother is on account of the park.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.480
 I find the scouring powder that's wonderful.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.480
 What powder?

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.480
 The one we're having here tonight.

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:26.480
 Tonight?

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.480
 Here?

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.480
 Don't want me to help you clean the stove here in old pal?

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.480
 I don't know, my mother's pretty fussy about her stove.

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.480
 Come on, here, I'm going to help. I'm a 12 stove cleaner.

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:41.480
 Well, please hand me.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:42.480
 You've talked me into her.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.480
 Here, take the rag.

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:45.480
 Just rest a little.

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:46.480
 He pays him.

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:47.480
 You're a pal.

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.480
 All the way in back, Homer.

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.480
 You'll have to get a little dirty.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.480
 Oh, that's all right.

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:53.480
 I don't mind.

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.480
 Oh, what kind of party are you having, Jim?

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.480
 They're well parties, of course we're going to the country for the summer.

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.480
 Have you invited many people?

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.480
 Well, it's just going to be a small affair.

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.480
 Well, exclusive time.

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.480
 Now, get all the burners, Homer.

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.480
 Oh, sure, he's sure.

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.480
 Are all invitations out?

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.480
 Oh, most of all.

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.240
 Oh, but there are still some people you haven't asked.

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:18.440
 Just one.

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.440
 Here's some clean calls, Henry.

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.440
 There I ask you to clean the soul.

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.720
 It's been done, mother, by what you might call remote control.

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.200
 - Well, I'm doing it, Mr. Holders.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.000
 - Why, goodness, Holders, I didn't see you under the stoke.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.440
 - I'm getting all the corn in.

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:33.560
 - Thank you, dear.

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.600
 - Tell me, I don't think it's very nice making Homer do your work.

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.440
 - The mother was his own idea.

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:39.960
 - That's no excuse.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:42.440
 - It really did go up Mary back in the hall, Rob.

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.040
 He was mother do you want to have to this girl's work?

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.040
 Well you could clean up the garage. That's man's work.

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.340
 Well what I'm adding mine was more boys work.

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.640
 Then there's the base of the guest mother. I'll help Mary.

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:56.940
 I'm going right now.

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.440
 Uh is there anything you want me to do Mrs. Hauler?

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:00.940
 No thank you Hauler.

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.140
 My goodness you got yourself all dirty from the stove.

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:05.740
 How am I getting dirty?

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:09.240
 After all it's not as though I was doing anything tonight.

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.340
 You know, that's no.

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.540
 Or if I was at another suit I could wear.

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:15.820
 Oh, that's nice.

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:18.420
 It's the suit I always wear to parties.

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:19.860
 [LAUGHTER]

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:21.620
 I'd like you to see it sometime.

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:23.300
 Oh, I'd like to do it.

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:24.300
 When?

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:25.780
 [LAUGHTER]

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:26.460
 Sorry.

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:27.900
 It's fine, not tonight.

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.700
 It's free having little parties here.

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:30.200
 Mm-hmm.

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:31.420
 I'm trying to love you.

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:32.060
 Good.

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:33.260
 Really expect you then.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:34.980
 Of course, I don't want to be in the way.

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:36.380
 Not at all, my--

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:39.380
 Maybe I'll be one to many for an exclusive party.

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:41.100
 I'm trying to feel your tight welcome.

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.700
 The last thing in the world I want to do is force myself.

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.700
 Oh, but don't you want to come?

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:47.700
 Am I giving you a question I didn't?

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.600
 I don't see what mother says, Henry.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.800
 You are asked or you'll see, you'll see.

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.300
 Children, not so nice.

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.100
 Mother, when we say that, I have to say one to the party tonight.

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:57.100
 Do I, mother?

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.600
 Now, do I--

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:58.700
 You're darn right, you do, Mary.

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:00.100
 Mother's making me say it.

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.100
 And tell me you stay out of this.

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:04.100
 Mother, I'm supposed to go to the movies tonight.

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.800
 It's coming.

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.600
 If Mary goes so to why.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:07.200
 It's in.

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.100
 What kind of a party is this?

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.380
 Now Mary, you and Henry will both stay home.

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:15.220
 After all, it's the last time you'll see Aunt Harriet all summer.

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:17.100
 Is that the party?

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:18.620
 This Aunt Harriet?

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:19.620
 Yes, dear.

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:21.620
 Oh, boy.

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:24.900
 But Mother, I've been here at home and everything goes down.

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:26.460
 And I see all of them as in that.

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:27.820
 That's enough.

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:29.900
 This time they thought it was your father's idea,

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:32.300
 and I don't think he'd like the way you're both behaving.

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:33.220
 Yes, Mother.

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:34.540
 But Mother, it's a doubt.

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:35.580
 Don't call him moving.

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.580
 I don't care where I practice those.

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:38.580
 You're saying no.

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:39.580
 Mother!

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:40.580
 Now come along, Mary.

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:41.580
 Help me with the bedroom, please.

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:42.580
 Mother, where are those?

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:43.580
 I'm so tired.

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:46.580
 Boy, if I'm known as a family party, I wouldn't have let your mother invite.

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:47.580
 You mean your invite?

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.580
 Yeah, and you can get some invite.

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:51.580
 That's all I'm inviting.

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:52.580
 See, you were a farmer.

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:54.580
 What kind of attitude is that?

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:58.580
 Listen, if I were an ovation, even in that way, I happened to have relatives of my own.

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:01.580
 Mother, I'm not an opportunity to finish vacuuming the hall.

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:03.580
 Boy, Mary, it's girls.

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:05.820
 Oh, Mary, it's Gerald's work.

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:08.080
 Mother said if you said that, you tell me the garage,

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:08.580
 you should be--

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:10.180
 I know, Mary, I know.

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:12.920
 I suppose you know how to operate a vacuum cleaner.

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:13.980
 Don't worry, Mary.

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:17.100
 If there's one thing I know, it's had a maneuver of Hoover.

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:21.100
 You take my work for it, eh?

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:23.100
 This will be the biggest port of July celebration

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:24.460
 the country club has ever had.

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:26.580
 Father, no, I just heard you.

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:27.660
 You already have, Mary.

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:28.500
 What is it?

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:30.020
 Mother would like you to move the living room

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:32.740
 furniture when you have time so we can get out the rug.

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:34.060
 I tell you mother I'm busy.

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:34.940
 That's all I say.

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:35.940
 I'm going anyway.

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:36.780
 Well, goodness, Father.

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:38.340
 I just gave you mother's message.

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:39.220
 That's all.

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:41.660
 Well, family, the ticket committee does a good job.

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:42.580
 Everything will be fine.

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:45.060
 And we'll just have to make it our individual business

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:47.060
 to get as many people to come as we can.

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:48.260
 Are you right, Sam?

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.140
 Now, I won't keep you from the furniture.

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:50.740
 I'll see you later.

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:51.580
 And I'll ask you, bye.

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:52.580
 Bye.

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:55.940
 Mr. and I can show, Karen, you can do it by yourself.

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:56.540
 Oh, hold on.

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:57.380
 Yes, sir.

00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:59.260
 Do answer the question for me.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.780
 If this is the one about how you get down from an elephant's

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:08.500
 back I've heard it no I'm a this is I do you get down from another side you know

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:09.540
 you get it from the dark

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:21.180
 think of it I've heard it home would you say that a six piece orchestra is large

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:27.200
 enough for dancing I'm sure you're gonna have an orchestra of course we are

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:30.520
 nothing but the best. I thought that is mr.

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:32.600
 Polders said it was going to be a small thing.

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:33.880
 I was just being modest.

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:36.760
 Matter of fact, it's going to be one of the biggest affairs

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:38.040
 center there has ever seen.

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:43.080
 Even any sort of was going to be a small quiet gathering.

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:45.640
 I think Henry is due for a surprise.

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:49.280
 Oh, I get it.

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:51.200
 And by the way, over, I want to see as many people

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:52.160
 show up as possible.

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:55.000
 I'd appreciate it if you would spread the word to anyone who doesn't know.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.440
 I sure will.

00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:59.180
 You can depend on me, Mr. Orley.

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:00.360
 Good, oh my good.

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:02.160
 Oh boy.

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.360
 We're not even wanting to bring the ladder up there.

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:05.800
 All right, don't forget all this.

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:06.640
 Spread the water.

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:07.960
 You bad, Mr. Orley.

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:09.160
 Spread the word about what?

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:11.400
 I can tell you, he needs to see good.

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:13.880
 You and my father have a secret, sure.

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:15.280
 And don't ask me what it is.

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:17.120
 I'm on a bound not to tell.

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:19.440
 Wild horse, you couldn't drag it from me.

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:20.120
 OK, almost.

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:21.080
 That's the way you feel.

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:23.200
 I'm trying to explore all the whole things you knew.

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:23.720
 Knew what?

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:25.720
 If your father was going to...

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:28.720
 I almost told you.

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:32.720
 Okay, Homer, don't tell me. I don't want to know.

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:34.720
 All right, here, look here and sit.

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:36.720
 But remember, you forced it out of me.

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:37.720
 What?

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:38.720
 This party tonight.

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:39.720
 You're in, Harry?

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:40.720
 Yeah.

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:41.720
 It's just a blind.

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:42.720
 It is?

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:43.720
 Sure.

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:45.720
 It's really a surprise party for you.

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:46.720
 For me?

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:47.720
 Are you sure?

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:48.720
 Sure.

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:49.720
 Sure.

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:51.720
 Your father just told me, face to face.

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:53.120
 And she will.

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:54.760
 And it's gonna be a real big affair.

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:56.220
 An orchestra and everything.

00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:57.720
 An orchestra?

00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:00.560
 Sure, and I'm supposed to invite anyone I can think of.

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:02.400
 Boy, how's that?

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:05.160
 I wonder why my father's getting a party for me.

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:06.960
 It must be some reason.

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:09.160
 Is it some special occasion?

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:11.160
 None that I can think of.

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:13.880
 I don't graduate till next year.

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:14.720
 Maybe.

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:16.520
 [audience laughter]

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:18.280
 It isn't my birthday.

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:19.920
 - Since I say... - What's it?

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:22.920
 I bet it's because I passed in chemistry.

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:24.420
 You think that might be it?

00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:25.920
 Sure, I got a fixie too.

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:30.920
 That's the only thing that's happened lately that's worth celebrating.

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:31.920
 Hey, me!

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:34.420
 Oh, my gong, but my mother's suspect, I suspect anything.

00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:36.920
 Henry, will you help your father with a ladder?

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:38.420
 I sure will, mother.

00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:40.420
 I don't know why the curtains have to be changed today.

00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:42.420
 Well, the house will look nice, thanks.

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:43.420
 All right.

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:44.420
 All right.

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:45.420
 Come on, Henry, give me a hand with a ladder.

00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:49.420
 Do you mind if I get a glass of 8-2-0 first?

00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:51.420
 I beg your pardon.

00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:53.420
 That's chemistry for water.

00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:56.420
 It's also an excuse for not working. Come along, you know.

00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:57.420
 Yes.

00:09:57.420 --> 00:09:58.420
 Yes.

00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:01.420
 Sometimes I think it'd be easy just to do everything myself.

00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:03.420
 Oh, Mrs. Alden. Yes?

00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:05.420
 I know all about it.

00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:07.420
 Oh, about what's here?

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:08.420
 About the party tonight.

00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:10.420
 Oh, you're not the prize party.

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:11.420
 What's the prize party?

00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:13.420
 Sure, you know.

00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:14.420
 No, I don't.

00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:16.420
 And I don't think you should have told me.

00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:17.920
 Oh, Mrs. Long, if you study,

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:20.120
 you tell me I don't want to hear about it.

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:21.720
 But you learn to find out.

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:23.520
 When I do, it'll be time enough.

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:24.520
 But wouldn't you like to know?

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:25.420
 I mean, tell me.

00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:27.120
 Not another word.

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:28.320
 Yes, ma'am.

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:31.320
 Would you mind having Henry and Mr. Albright, tell me?

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:32.320
 He is, my little.

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:33.320
 I'll be glad.

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:35.720
 Thank you, dear.

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:39.820
 I'll ask my good friend to give me L2O2O.

00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:42.120
 Hello, is this the beauty stop?

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:43.320
 This is Mrs. Albright.

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:46.320
 Can I come in at two o'clock?

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:48.120
 I couldn't wait that late.

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:49.820
 There's a special reason.

00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:53.820
 My husband was giving a surprise party for me tonight.

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:57.020
 Yes, I found out by accident.

00:10:57.020 --> 00:10:58.420
 You're a pager?

00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:03.620
 Oh, it's the anniversary of the day he proposed.

00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:06.420
 I knew it was the '20' age.

00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:08.820
 Oh, it was the '27.

00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:09.820
 Was it you?

00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:11.820
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:18.820
 (music)

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:20.820
 Mother, is anything wrong?

00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:22.820
 Well, Mary, I have a cotton heart.

00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:25.820
 I don't know, you've been walking around with a funny look.

00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:27.820
 Come Mary, that's silly.

00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:29.820
 So most of those you know something?

00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:30.820
 I don't know something.

00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:31.820
 Another thing.

00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:32.820
 Hi, Mother.

00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:36.820
 Really, Mary, I don't know something like that.

00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:38.820
 Did you know anything? I didn't know.

00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:41.820
 I told you I don't know a thing.

00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:42.820
 I'll get it, Mother.

00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:43.820
 Thank you, dear.

00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:46.820
 Hello?

00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:47.820
 Hello, Mary.

00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:48.820
 This is Elaine.

00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:49.820
 Oh, hello, Elaine.

00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:50.820
 I just saw Homer Brown.

00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:51.820
 You do you?

00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:53.820
 Yes, you invited me to the party tonight.

00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:55.820
 Homer invited you?

00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:58.820
 That was by the authority of your father.

00:11:58.820 --> 00:11:59.820
 It's all right, isn't it?

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:00.820
 Oh.

00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:02.820
 Oh, of course Elaine.

00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:04.820
 It's just that I didn't know about it.

00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:05.820
 Well, I wanted to know what to wear.

00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:07.820
 I thought that since your father was hiring, you know,

00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:10.420
 It was highly an orchestra and everything it might be formal.

00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:13.540
 Oh no, Elena. It's just a small family party.

00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:15.420
 But Norman said it was a surprise party.

00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:17.980
 It's nothing like that, Elena. It's just a...

00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:20.220
 a surprise party.

00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:22.620
 Mary, don't tell me you didn't know.

00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:23.940
 Why, I didn't.

00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:25.700
 Oh, you wouldn't get it yet, I am.

00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:29.340
 But, I mean, it never occurred to me that the party might be for you.

00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:30.620
 It is.

00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:31.660
 Isn't it?

00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:35.980
 Oh, I'm good. There's no wonder my mother was actually so mysterious.

00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:38.380
 Please, please don't let on a told you.

00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:39.980
 Oh, don't worry, I won't.

00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:41.780
 Mary, what's the reason for the party?

00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:45.780
 Oh, I can't see them, huh?

00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:47.980
 Yes, that's what it is.

00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:49.480
 My birthday.

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:50.480
 Yes?

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:51.480
 Happy birthday.

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:52.480
 No.

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:54.480
 No, it's your time.

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:55.980
 But we'll be in the cut-scene then,

00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:57.980
 so they'll have to have it now.

00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:00.560
 (upbeat music)

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:07.600
 - Hey, now you came to it?

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:09.300
 - Well, no, it's my party, isn't it?

00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:11.400
 - But when it's a surprise party, I knew it.

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:13.740
 It is an ethical invite people yourself.

00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:16.500
 - Homer, what have ethics got to do with gliders?

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:19.300
 - Boy, and you should don't know girls.

00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:20.800
 Ethics is everything to them.

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:21.640
 - It is?

00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:23.680
 - Okay, Homer, you call gliders.

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:26.260
 (upbeat music)

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:31.840
 Hello, Willy. Can you come to a surprise party for Henry tonight?

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:34.840
 You're going to do a club practice?

00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:36.840
 We'll bring them along.

 Yes, tonight, a wrong night.

 You have to be a babysitter.

00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:53.840

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:05.840
 Yes, you may not remember me, but I used to sit behind you in third grade.

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:06.840
 Yes!

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:17.840
 Mary, I didn't expect to see you here, and I was happy to surprise you.

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:20.840
 Oh, I don't know why we should be surprised.

00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:24.840
 I suppose it's the most normal thing in the world for a woman to go to a beauty college.

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:29.840
 I don't know why I came to do to just as relevant tomorrow.

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:31.840
 That's the way I see your mother.

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:33.840
 Well, especially since I'm not going to have much done.

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:37.840
 I think I've got a manicure and lazy a hair set.

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:39.840
 Goodness, they say, "Yeah, do this today."

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:41.840
 And I don't even have an appointment.

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:43.840
 Neither do I.

00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:46.840
 I wonder if you lady could come back tomorrow with terribly rough.

00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:47.840
 Tomorrow?

00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:50.840
 But unless... I mean, I'd like to have it done today.

00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:53.840
 You told me over the phone you'd be able to squeeze me in.

00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:58.840
 I'm sorry, I don't know what happened, but everyone seems to be going to a party tonight.

00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:09.840
 - How am I sure, oldie? - Yes, Omar, what is it?

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:14.840
 - Well, I've been spreading the word, like you said. - Good, Omar. I knew I could defend on you.

00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:19.840
 - George Bigel, a way to question. - What question, Omar?

00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:22.840
 He wants to know what flavor ice cream you're having.

00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:25.840
 All flavors and sandwiches and cold drinks.

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:29.840
 Boy, I did not let it get around there. Everybody will want to come.

00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:31.840
 Well, that's just what I want, Homer.

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:32.840
 You do?

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:34.840
 Get as many people as you can.

00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:36.840
 All right, Mr. Olga, if you say so.

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:37.840
 Goodbye.

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:38.840
 Bye.

00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:39.840
 What do you say, Homer? What do you say?

00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:41.840
 Homer, don't you hear me?

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:44.840
 Boy, you hear me? You're a father. I'm so excited to invite more people.

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:45.840
 He does?

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:49.840
 God, who would drink the chemistry was so important to my father.

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:56.840
 (music)

00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:58.340
 That's right Ed, 38.

00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:01.140
 I just got a report from one of my agents.

00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:02.540
 And it's just the beginning.

00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:06.640
 We'll have more people at the country club this fourth of July than ever before.

00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:07.940
 All right, this is why I called Ed.

00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:09.740
 We'd better order more food.

00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:11.540
 You better double the order to the caterer.

00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:12.540
 Oh, no wait a minute.

00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:14.540
 The way things are going, you better triple it.

00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:17.540
 (music)

00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:21.340
 (music)

00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:24.340
 My goodness, my grandma, how much longer are you going to have to go?

00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:26.940
 I'll just about restain to my patients, Mary.

00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:28.340
 Are you going to leave, Mother?

00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:30.140
 I'll wait just one more hour.

00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:31.140
 Oh.

00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:32.140
 Oh, yes.

00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:34.140
 How much longer will it be?

00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:35.740
 Oh, I'm very sorry you had to wait.

00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:36.940
 Can you take a glance?

00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:38.940
 Which one of you want to be sample and set,

00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:40.940
 facial, manicure, fingerweight, and feather cut?

00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:41.940
 Yay!

00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:43.340
 Oh, well, I can only take one of you.

00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:44.340
 Which one will it be?

00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:45.340
 Namir.

00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:46.340
 Namir!

00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:48.920
 (upbeat music)

00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:55.500
 - Can I add him to you?

00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:56.580
 What you're worrying about,

00:16:56.580 --> 00:16:59.100
 your father said to invite as many people as I could.

00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:02.380
 - I know Homer, but 54 people.

00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:03.780
 How do you wanna cook them?

00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:04.860
 - How about the basement?

00:17:04.860 --> 00:17:05.860
 - I'm allowed for that.

00:17:05.860 --> 00:17:07.620
 They're just as in room and up in this house

00:17:07.620 --> 00:17:08.620
 for that many people.

00:17:08.620 --> 00:17:10.420
 - Well, I only did what your father told me.

00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:11.820
 - I know Homer, I know.

00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:12.980
 Look, here comes my mother.

00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:14.020
 - Why don't you ask?

00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:15.340
 - Okay, but you better be.

00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:16.840
 You're not supposed to know when it comes out.

00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:18.640
 All right, Homer, I'll be in my room.

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:20.540
 Oh, my, wasn't Henry just here?

00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:21.540
 Yes, ma'am.

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:23.740
 Oh, Mrs. Org, this is sure when I--

00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:24.940
 Oh, thank you, dear.

00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:26.640
 --just come from the beauty palace.

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:28.640
 Mrs. Org, can I ask you something?

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:29.940
 Who, Homer?

00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:33.040
 It's, um, about the surprise party tonight.

00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:35.340
 You think, Homer, I'd rather not hear about it.

00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:37.440
 And Mrs. Org, if you don't know what I'm gonna say.

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:39.340
 And I don't want to know, dear.

00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:41.540
 But Homer, please.

00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:42.840
 Yes, Mrs. Org.

00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:44.760
 Mother, look at my hair.

00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:45.960
 It's just awful.

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:48.080
 It looks very nice, Mary.

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:50.360
 And besides, dear I did, you're yours.

00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:51.520
 I know, Mother.

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:53.880
 Now I wish I had taken a sample one thing to wait

00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:55.120
 instead of the face.

00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:56.320
 Now I'll have to with your hair.

00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:57.240
 Dear, come upstairs.

00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:58.000
 All right, Mother.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.600
 I hope you can do something with it.

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:00.600
 Mary.

00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:01.280
 Yeah, Mother.

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:01.920
 What is it?

00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:02.960
 Can I ask you something?

00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:04.520
 That isn't Homer.

00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:07.560
 Well, you know the surprise party, Tenerys.

00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:08.560
 I do not.

00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:09.460
 What?

00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:11.400
 I don't know what's it happy about.

00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:13.400
 Listen, Mary, there's a party to me.

00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:15.400
 Oh, I'd rather not discuss it.

00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:17.400
 And I must say I'm surprised at you.

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:18.400
 Oh, Mary.

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:19.400
 Oh, Mary, I'm sorry.

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:22.400
 Excuse me. Mother's waiting for me.

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:24.400
 Mother, do you think I had a wash, my mamper?

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:26.400
 Well, Omar, what's the latest figure?

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:29.400
 It's, uh... 54.

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:32.400
 But don't forget, you told me it's plenty.

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:33.400
 Plenty.

00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:34.400
 Why?

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:38.400
 Omar, I never realized before how talented you were when it seemed to spread it.

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:40.400
 [laughter]

00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:42.400
 Or even a football.

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:44.400
 Oh, there's plenty of room at the country club.

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:45.400
 The country club.

00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:47.400
 The country club?

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:48.400
 What's the matter?

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:51.400
 Nothing, I had no idea you were going that way.

00:18:51.400 --> 00:19:06.400
 Well, isn't this cozy? Our own little family at our own table.

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:08.400
 Yes, Sam. Yes, Father.

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:11.000
 Well, what are we waiting for? Let's eat.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.200
 Since you think we better wait, dear?

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:14.800
 It's still our own father.

00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:18.600
 And we might have, well, you know, company.

00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:20.800
 Oh, that's right. That's about all about it.

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:21.800
 Oh, who?

00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:23.200
 There is that, Harriet.

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:24.800
 And didn't you call her?

00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:26.000
 I thought you were.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.600
 My goodness.

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:29.000
 It's too late now.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:30.200
 Alex, have you served dinner?

00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:32.000
 Oh, no, Father, not you.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.600
 Can we wait, Father?

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:34.400
 Wait, what's all?

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:36.400
 Sam, please. What's going on?

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:38.740
 What's everybody all dressed up for?

00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:40.640
 Is this special there or something?

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:42.540
 Now, Sam, please don't be kidding me.

00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:46.340
 Father, I hate this boy, I suppose, but I know.

00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:47.340
 You do.

00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:49.340
 And I suppose you know too, Henry.

00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:52.780
 Tell you the truth, Father, and I do.

00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:55.920
 I just want to say I consider myself well rewarded

00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:58.320
 for all the work I did in chemistry.

00:19:58.320 --> 00:19:59.220
 Fine.

00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:02.260
 Now, everybody knows but me.

00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:05.220
 What if it is just an ordinary day that's when he hates his deal

00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:08.180
 and I don't think I'll go right.

00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:11.660
 You do father and that's not playing game.

00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:13.380
 Just on you too.

00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:14.700
 It is.

00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:16.860
 This is a surprise party.

00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:18.820
 Father we know that.

00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:23.340
 You're also clever about it but my birthday isn't until next week.

00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:26.740
 But father.

00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:30.260
 And you're always saying how good you are today.

00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:32.020
 A surprise party for me.

00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:34.020
 Oh we before my birthday.

00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:37.460
 Well, better early than never, Sam.

00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:39.860
 I got to say, I'm really touched.

00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:41.460
 Thanks, you all.

00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:42.860
 Happy birthday, Father.

00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:45.860
 [LAUGHTER]

00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:47.660
 Happy birthday, Father.

00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:49.060
 Thank you, Mary.

00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:51.660
 Dear Father, I hope you don't mind a present

00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:53.260
 with slightly second hand.

00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:53.760
 What?

00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:56.500
 I thought I'd give you the present I got to Uncle George

00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:59.660
 for Christmas, the BB gun.

00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:01.860
 So I can fire three times.

00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:02.860
 Thank you, Henry.

00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:04.740
 Feel free to use it anytime.

00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:09.820
 Father, you remember that book of Robert Brown in the past?

00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:11.140
 I got lost, please. Yes.

00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:13.100
 You said he was your favorite part.

00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:14.300
 He said he is.

00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:17.900
 When you take it as a birthday gift, I'll have a credit.

00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:18.500
 Yeah.

00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:19.660
 Thank you, Mary.

00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:21.740
 Borrow it whenever you like.

00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:24.460
 Sam, you know that package it came today

00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:27.340
 from the guest of Brothers Department store in Arlington?

00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:28.140
 Yes.

00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:29.980
 Please take it as a birthday present.

00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:32.660
 All right, what will I do with the ladies umbrella?

00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:34.860
 Stand where you take it and don't ask any questions.

00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:35.940
 All right.

00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:37.260
 Now, what about the birthday cake?

00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:39.060
 All I have is an apple pie.

00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:39.360
 Good.

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:40.380
 I don't like cake anyway.

00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:41.700
 And why should I have to eat something?

00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:43.460
 I don't like a week before my birthday.

00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:44.580
 I'll get the pie.

00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:45.660
 Don't bother about it.

00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:47.700
 I'll get the vote.

00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:48.540
 Hello.

00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:50.980
 Mr. Allrich, where is everybody?

00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:51.980
 What's that, Omar?

00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:55.580
 I'm here at the country club with 96 people.

00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:56.580
 What?

00:21:56.580 --> 00:21:57.080
 What?

00:21:57.080 --> 00:21:58.980
 Not including the police club.

00:21:58.980 --> 00:21:59.820
 What?

00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:00.980
 In a baby.

00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:02.380
 A what?

00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:14.380
 [applause]

00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:17.380
 Boy, Homer, it's my whole family mad at you.

00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:19.380
 Oh, now wait a minute, Henry.

00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:21.380
 You and your surprise party, boy.

00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:23.380
 Listen, Henry, you heard your own father tell me.

00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:24.380
 Right on this whole home.

00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:26.380
 Well, my father was talking about

00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:29.380
 was the big Fourth of July party at the country club,

00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:30.380
 next week.

00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:33.460
 - This is Ezra Stone.

00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:35.540
 Now that I've stepped out of character,

00:22:35.540 --> 00:22:38.500
 I'd just like to say a word to all you folks in our audience

00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:41.020
 who've been friends and neighbors of the Aldridge family,

00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:42.580
 all these years.

00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:46.340
 Folks, we want you to know how much we'll really miss

00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:49.580
 our wonderful sponsor, the General Foods Corporation,

00:22:49.580 --> 00:22:52.460
 and our foster fathers, Howard Chapin and Ray Smith,

00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:57.020
 who have kept us in the world so well fed all these years.

00:22:57.020 --> 00:23:00.540
 But I guess most of all, we'll miss you.

00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:03.780
 We hope you'll miss us too, just a little bit.

00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:05.500
 Usually at the close of each show,

00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:07.980
 I've always bid you goodnight to the entire Aldridge family,

00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:11.580
 but tonight I think we should eat, speak for ourselves.

00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:13.580
 In the booth, NBC's finest.

00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:16.740
 Alice Young, Paul Knight, Bill Brinkmeyer,

00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:20.020
 and of course, our own Jack Miller and his fine orchestra.

00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:22.500
 Goodnight to Rita Bauer, Mary Aldridge.

00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:23.500
 - Goodnight everybody.

00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:25.180
 - And Catherine Ross, Alice Aldridge.

00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:26.180
 - Goodnight everybody.

00:23:26.180 --> 00:23:28.580
 - House Jameson, Samuel Longbend.

00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:29.420
 - Good night, everybody.

00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:31.780
 - Of course, Jackie Kelk, Homer.

00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:32.740
 - Good night, everybody.

00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:34.940
 - And for me, as with Stone,

00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:37.580
 may you always be healthy, prosperous,

00:23:37.580 --> 00:23:40.860
 and appreciative of the folks who live next to you.

00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:43.100
 Good night, and good bye.

00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:46.260
 (audience applauding)

00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:49.000
 (dramatic music)

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.740
 (dramatic music)

00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:53.980
 (buzzing)
