 [Music]

2
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:14,560
 The special service to this and presents the redraw cast of...

3
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:19,320
 Henry Henry Moseley! Come on, Lenny!

4
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,280
 [Applause]

5
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:27,800
 While you men and women in the armed forces of the United Nations, here's the Aldrich family!

00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:45,300
 [Music]

7
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:50,900
 One of the attractive things about teenage youngsters is that they manage to get a lot of fun out of things

8
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:55,760
 Which to their elders are absolutely pretty much a laboratory offered to their elders

9
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,300
 Build it that far instance

10
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:58,700
 This is living room

11
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:02,700
 See how Henry Alfred candles the problem of moving day for instance

12
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:06,100
 The scene opens in Kathleen Anderson's living room

13
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,800
 Now wait a second Homer

14
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,800
 Kathleen asked me to lift that box for

15
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,800
 Can we leave you take your hands off at your only making it heavier?

16
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,000
 I know Homer, but everything I've picked up you've tried to grab too

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,500
 Anybody think the Anderson's weren't able to move without your budding in?

18
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,500
 Alright, then, alright, then take it.

19
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,500
 I hope you break your back.

20
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,000
 Well, gee, Whiz, Homer, that's a nice thing to do.

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 Right on Kathleen's motor's hardwood floor.

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 They're moving out of here, aren't they?

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,500
 And someone's moving in, aren't they?

24
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,000
 I didn't hurt yourself.

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 No, I didn't hurt myself.

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 Homer, could you...

27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 Could you give me a hand with this?

28
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 I thought you wanted to lift it yourself.

29
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 We have taken the on-up.

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,500
 Put this other pile of book in.

31
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,000
 Oh, you're going to put more in it.

32
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 Henry, we have to get everything we own out of here by tonight.

33
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 You do?

34
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 Well, see, where you going to have dinner?

35
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,800
 I don't know.

36
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,500
 Listen, Kathleen, why don't you come over to our house, Virginia?

37
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,500
 Over to your house?

38
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,500
 Really, Homer?

39
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,500
 Homer, over to your house?

40
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,500
 And now, wait a second.

41
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,000
 Why should she want to come over to your house?

42
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 Why shouldn't she?

43
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 I'd be caused, Homer.

44
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,500
 In the first place, your mother and father are both on a diet.

45
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,000
 And you know what that means?

46
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 What does it mean?

47
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 Yes, Mrs. Anderson?

48
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,500
 Are you calling I?

49
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,000
 Could you come here and help me with this stiff leather?

50
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 Yes, you are.

51
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 Homer, move that box of books out on the port for Kathleen.

52
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 Oh, I'll tell you. Listen, Kathleen.

53
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 Why don't you all come over for dinner?

54
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 As long as your mother's gonna have all your dishes packed.

55
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 I don't think we should impose on your mother and father like our homeless.

56
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 Well, that's the beautiful part of it.

57
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 If you come over, my mother will have to cook something good for a change.

58
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 You know, Homer, I don't think we'd better.

59
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 Now, would you move that box, please?

60
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 Okay, Kathleen.

61
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 On the home, and ask my mother.

62
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 Then I can explain the whole thing.

63
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 On a cheap day, she'd rather we wouldn't come.

64
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 Will you be frank and tell us how?

65
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,500
 You'll be fine.

66
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,260
 Can tell us now?

67
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:48,580
 Oh, she was, Kathleen.

68
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:50,680
 You don't have to worry about a thing like that.

69
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,940
 Hey, Homer, how about coming down the basement?

70
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,840
 Give me a hand with a barrel of stuff.

71
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,040
 I've got a beaded, Henry.

72
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:59,580
 As soon as you get the barrel up, move that box of books there.

73
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:00,340
 Listen, Kathleen.

74
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,240
 Where's he going?

75
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,620
 Oh, let me see whether his mother would

76
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,600
 mind having anyone extra for dinner.

77
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,780
 Give me your going.

78
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:06,780
 You're going?

79
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,260
 And so they're coming over to my house.

80
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:10,660
 Oh, Henry, I haven't even mentioned your house, Kathleen.

81
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:12,100
 Don't you remember my saying--

82
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:15,220
 my saying, don't you want to eat with my family?

83
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:20,520
 I didn't say I didn't want to. I'm much rather only how about your mother my mother

84
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:24,160
 What would my mother have to do with your coming old for dinner? I mean

85
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:27,420
 All I have to do is phone and say you're coming

86
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:35,400
 Hello, I guess you might have better nature than my mother. Oh gee as soon as I said, please listen mother number P

87
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,180
 Oh, oh, L3 O3

88
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:39,440
 Down 303.

89
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,280
 Kathleen?

90
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,240
 Yes, Mother.

91
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,240
 Could you help me please?

92
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:42,980
 Mom.

93
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:45,220
 And I have something I could tell you.

94
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:48,880
 And Kathleen asked her dinner, maybe we can go to the movie.

95
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,780
 Hello?

96
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:50,280
 Hello?

97
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,080
 Listen, Mother.

98
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,480
 Henry, where are you?

99
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,380
 Wait, I'm just over helping.

100
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:55,480
 Ah, I'm sort of--

101
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,880
 So you won't be late getting home for dinner tonight with you, dear.

102
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,980
 We're good to eat early.

103
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,380
 Oh, y'all.

104
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:02,880
 Mother, I-- I want to tell you something.

105
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,680
 What is it?

106
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,880
 You know the Anderson.

107
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,480
 Have something happen to them?

108
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,720
 No, they're an awful predicament.

109
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,000
 They help you get out of their house by tonight, see?

110
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,620
 Really? Where are they going?

111
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:13,920
 Over on Center Street.

112
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,820
 That'll be nice.

113
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,320
 Well, don't be late, will you, dear?

114
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,360
 Wait a second, Mother.

115
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,020
 I'll have to finish with their predicament.

116
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:20,400
 Dear, I can't stand here and tell,

117
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,960
 but you aren't putting up Apple Sauce.

118
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,960
 You are? Well, that's good.

119
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,540
 But, uh-huh. How would you...

120
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,840
 Well, what would you think of sort of helping out

121
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,440
 and asking Kathleen to come and eat with us?

122
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,740
 Henry, this is no time to ask anyone for dinner.

123
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:35,180
 I've got Jaws and Apple Sauce all over the kitchen.

124
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:37,440
 Put mother, she's very fond of apple sauce.

125
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,520
 - Right, Grandma, I don't like it bringing home a guest

126
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,080
 when I'm working as hard as I am.

127
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:41,920
 But tonight.

128
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,760
 - Mummy.

129
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,280
 - Look, let me explain something.

130
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,080
 - Grandma, there's nothing to explain.

131
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,000
 - Mother, miss him.

132
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,840
 - My dear.

133
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:48,680
 - Mother.

134
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,680
 - Can we just get your mother?

135
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,280
 - Yes, and for now.

136
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,400
 - It's wonderful because Mother's gonna

137
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,080
 be glad to let me go.

138
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,280
 What's that?

139
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,200
 - Well, that's fine.

140
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,940
 (dramatic music)

141
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:06,940
 (music)

142
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:09,940
 In the first place Alice, Henry shouldn't have asked you.

143
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:12,940
 But Sam, I told him he could not have Kathleen tonight.

144
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:17,940
 Oh, well, I'm glad to hear that. Not that Kathleen isn't welcome here, but there's a chance that Ed Wilson will be in town.

145
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,940
 You mean you've asked him to have dinner here?

146
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:24,940
 No, Alice, but if he does arrive in town tonight, I'd like to feel free to ask him for dinner so we can talk business.

147
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:26,940
 Then I'm all the more glad Kathleen isn't coming.

148
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,940
 - Mother! - Henry, is that you?

149
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,940
 - Yes, where are you? - We're in the living room.

150
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,940
 We'd like very much to speak to you.

151
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,940
 - You mean, father's in there with you?

152
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,940
 - I am. - Oh, hello, father.

153
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:40,940
 - Hello. - Henry, I certainly hope Kathleen understood why I couldn't have it tonight.

154
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:43,940
 - Well, Mother, if you aren't awfully busy,

155
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:46,940
 could I speak you out in the dining room where we can be alone?

156
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,940
 I mean, there is no use here bringing the subject up.

157
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:51,940
 Your father agrees with me. We cannot have Kathleen tonight.

158
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:55,940
 - Oh, we can? - Henry, remember this for as long as you live.

159
00:05:55,940 --> 00:06:01,520
 live don't ever ask anyone to this house for dinner as a as a surprise to us yes

160
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:06,380
 father is that clear dear yes mother that doesn't go just for Kathleen it goes

161
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:10,460
 for home of Brown for Jimmy Bartlett yes father for everyone and anyone you

162
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:14,060
 happen to have an impulse to ask yes mother only only first there's just one

163
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:17,300
 thing I want to explain don't try to explain anything Kathleen is out of the

164
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:20,940
 picture as far as tonight is concerned where you going out of the garden mother

165
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:24,620
 would you be interested in listening to me and I have not hear anymore about it

166
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:26,620
 What mother, look out Mrs. Anderson gave me.

167
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:27,620
 What is it?

168
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,120
 Are those racing fans?

169
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,120
 Yes, sure, she felt bad about it.

170
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,620
 Well, my goodness, look, pretty stamp.

171
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:35,620
 That gives you some idea, mother of health.

172
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:39,120
 Oh, well, Henry, you certainly couldn't have been very cordial in your invitation.

173
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,120
 What's that?

174
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,520
 Henry, what did you say to Mrs. Anderson that made our theatre

175
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,520
 she had to give you those?

176
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,620
 That's the funny part of it.

177
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,620
 It came right out of a clear blue sky.

178
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:49,620
 Did you realize how embarrassed this made me feel?

179
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:54,120
 Apparently she felt the reason we couldn't have Kathleen was because we didn't have an operation stand.

180
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:58,200
 My mother dear when you're inviting anyone for dinner there are two ways to do it

181
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:03,440
 Either don't ask them at all or you ask them wholeheartedly and really make them feel as though they're wanted

182
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,440
 You do?

183
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,440
 Yes dear of course you do

184
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,440
 What's the Anderson's number?

185
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,440
 You're going to call them?

186
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,440
 Of course I am

187
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,440
 Why?

188
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,440
 It's it's album 344

189
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,440
 M344

190
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:15,680
 For gee mother is that a load off my mind?

191
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,680
 Number please

192
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,680
 Operator I want M344

193
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,680
 M344

194
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,640
 Henry do you see that list of groceries on the table?

195
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,640
 Yes mother

196
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,040
 If you take it and go right over to the store?

197
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,040
 Yes sure and thanks very much

198
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,720
 And don't even mention this to your father

199
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,480
 You let me explain things to him

200
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,480
 Yes mother

201
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,480
 Hello

202
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,480
 Hello is this Betty Anderson?

203
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,480
 Yeah

204
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,760
 This is Alice O'Rijt here

205
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:40,440
 I've just been talking with Henry and frankly Betty I've never been quite so embarrassed

206
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,200
 What about Alice?

207
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:46,280
 Anyone that has to move at a time like this and is in the position you're in for better

208
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,280
 we just love to help you all

209
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,280
 Oh really?

210
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,280
 Of course

211
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,280
 What's that?

212
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,280
 Of what's that?

213
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,280
 Oh

214
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,880
 You mean you can help?

215
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,880
 Will have fine, Betty.

216
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:00,280
 I was afraid for a minute, and Henry had asked just Kathleen.

217
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:04,280
 No, Alice, are you sure you can have us all on this short notice?

218
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:10,280
 Why, why Betty, I give you my word. Nothing would give us more pleasure than making you feel that our home is your home.

219
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,780
 Really, Alice? Oh, that's awfully sweet of you.

220
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,280
 Not at all. Goodbye.

221
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,280
 Goodbye.

222
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,280
 So am.

223
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,280
 Sam, I've got to tell you something.

224
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:32,280
 [Music]

225
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,280
 Hello?

226
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,280
 Hello?

227
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,280
 Bob, this is Betty.

228
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:38,280
 What do you think the older kids have come to the rescue?

229
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,280
 They've asked us over to their house.

230
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,280
 Yes?

231
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,280
 For the next three days?

232
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,280
 Why no, Bob?

233
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,280
 No, of course not.

234
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,280
 Just for dinner.

235
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:48,280
 Well, that takes care of one meal, but, well, we're going to stay tonight and tomorrow night until the other place is ready.

236
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:52,660
 the other places ready well couldn't you get room for the man to know no no they're

237
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:56,380
 all filled up you don't suppose the auditors would put us up for a few days

238
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:59,740
 to you now Bob I'm even a little embarrassed about going over there for

239
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:03,460
 dinner do they know we can't move into the other house yes well then I don't see

240
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:07,660
 why they don't ask us we do the same for them well Alice Otter it's this day she

241
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:11,300
 wanted us to feel that their home was our home but I don't think she expects

242
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:15,500
 it to stay three days why don't you call it back and make sure now Bell I can't

243
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:19,880
 do that. Let's just wait and see what happens. And Bob, somebody let the door

244
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:22,500
 I just got to hang up and see who it is. Good bye.

245
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:28,760
 You can't hear me. Where are you? I'm not here in the first hall. It's Kathleen

246
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:33,540
 here. Hello, honey. What is it? Nothing Kathleen. Nothing. I was just on my way to

247
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:38,500
 get some groceries for a first something and I just thought I'd drop in. Oh, all I

248
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:42,860
 want to know is I want to make sure. Yes, honey? Well, I want to be positive. See,

249
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:46,860
 I just had a talk with my mother and she called you, didn't she?

250
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,860
 Yes, and that was very sweet of us.

251
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:50,860
 Boy, where she upset over the way I asked Kathleen.

252
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:53,860
 Your mother was sitting nice to car an afterthought.

253
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,860
 Oh, all of you?

254
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:56,860
 Yeah.

255
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,860
 Oh, gee, that's the way my mother is.

256
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:02,860
 Once she decides to do something, she'll even turn over her whole house to you.

257
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:03,860
 Really?

258
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:07,860
 As a matter of fact, Henry, she did say we were to feel your home without home.

259
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:08,860
 Sure.

260
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:10,860
 All she's got to know is you're in a jam and I'm fine.

261
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:14,980
 I am fine. Only Henry. Are you positive we won't be crowding you?

262
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:17,820
 Crowning us. She was. How could you do a thing like that?

263
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:18,860
 Are you sure, Henry?

264
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:21,460
 Kathleen, you talked as though we'd never had caught me before.

265
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:25,100
 She was there's plenty of room. And your mother told you to stay there?

266
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,860
 Sure. She certainly said I was to be cargill.

267
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:28,940
 Well, goodbye.

268
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:31,460
 Goodbye. Thank you very much for turning over.

269
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:34,180
 Kathleen, go to the phone and call your father.

270
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:37,660
 Yes, mother. Tell him it's all settled. We won't have to go to the hotel.

271
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:39,980
 Hey Kathleen. Yes, holler, where are you?

272
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,580
 I'm out here at the back door. Where are you?

273
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:43,080
 I'm just going to put in a phone call.

274
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:46,180
 Well, look, I've got a sort of embarrassing message for you.

275
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:49,680
 See, my mother said she likes to have you folks come for dinner.

276
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,380
 In fact, there's nothing she'd rather have you do.

277
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:56,380
 Only, don't you think as long as you folks are going to be so tired

278
00:10:56,380 --> 00:11:00,480
 from moving and everything, it would be better to wait and come some time afterwards

279
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,480
 when you feel fresher and then keep your mind on what you're eating.

280
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,080
 And as long as the matter of fact, we're all going over the hand-me.

281
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:07,980
 For dinner?

282
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:08,580
 Yeah.

283
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:11,580
 Everybody? Oh, Gee whiz, that's a fine thing.

284
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,580
 Could I use your telephone before you do?

285
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:14,580
 I guess so.

286
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:15,580
 Hello?

287
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:17,580
 That is not Gee whiz.

288
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:18,580
 Number three.

289
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:19,580
 Elm two three two.

290
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:20,580
 Elm two three two.

291
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:24,580
 In horror, as soon as you get through, could you come in the living room and talk and move that box of books and books?

292
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:26,580
 Didn't Henry take care of us?

293
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:27,580
 Of all of them?

294
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:28,580
 At all?

295
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:30,580
 Home, Mother, I won't be home for dinner.

296
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:33,580
 Find us! The old riches are throwing a party.

297
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:42,580
 (music)

298
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:45,580
 But, Mother, I didn't ask them all for dinner. You did.

299
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:49,580
 Well, incidentally, since you knew how many would be here, why didn't you get enough thing being?

300
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:51,580
 I did. That's a beautiful part of it.

301
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:54,580
 Then why didn't you tell me before I sent your father to the store?

302
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,580
 You did? Well, I'll go right down and get him.

303
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:59,580
 Now, don't do anything more. You've done enough as it is.

304
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:00,580
 Where are you going?

305
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:04,840
 over to Mrs. Kilmer's and try to borrow a large tablecloth and yeah I hope you'll

306
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:08,820
 let this be a lesson don't ever ever start inviting people in a wholesale way

307
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:13,180
 like this again yes mother only I just asked Kat wait and please go answer

308
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:18,060
 that phone yes mother maybe this is Mrs. Anderson saying they thought it over

309
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:23,320
 and none of them can come except Kat Lee hello hello man I speak with Mr.

310
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:27,340
 Orange please right mr. Orange is near right now if you tell me how am I

311
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:31,340
 I don't think you can't. He's not trying to scrape up some string beans.

312
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:34,340
 What's that? May I ask who that's there speaking?

313
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:35,340
 This is your son.

314
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:39,340
 Oh, yes. This is Mr. Wilson. I believe I met you when I was in town last week.

315
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:41,340
 Oh, yes. Up on the road.

316
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:47,340
 Henry, I'm in sort of a camp down here at the hotel. I've been trying to get a room and they tell me there isn't a chance.

317
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:48,340
 There isn't?

318
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:50,340
 No matter a fact, even the dining room is packed.

319
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:52,340
 You mean you can't get in and get anything?

320
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:56,340
 That's why I called. I was wondering whether you might have any suggestion to make.

321
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,340
 Well, I tell you.

322
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:58,340
 No.

323
00:12:58,340 --> 00:12:59,040
 What's that?

324
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,140
 I'm pretty sure I better not make that one.

325
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:03,640
 Do you know any place to get a room or a meal?

326
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,340
 Right.

327
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:05,040
 No.

328
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,740
 No, my mother was just saying a little while ago.

329
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,040
 No.

330
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,640
 Everything's all tied up.

331
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,240
 I see.

332
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,440
 How about...

333
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,840
 How about my father fooling you when he comes in?

334
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,640
 I don't want to go any good. I can't wait here.

335
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,340
 I have to find a place to eat and sleep.

336
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:18,940
 Oh.

337
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,140
 Just forget the whole thing.

338
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:20,740
 Goodbye.

 We'll be back with the Alberts family in just a moment.

 Now, it's intermission time, and here's our intermission guest,

394
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:59,140
 Now getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldrich.

395
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:04,140
 The Aldrichs are upset to think that Kathleen Anderson and her family are coming for dinner this evening.

396
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:09,140
 Never dreaming that the Anderson's are really preparing to stay for three days.

397
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:12,140
 The scene opens and the Aldrich's living room.

398
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:14,140
 Miss Duong, will you speak?

399
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,140
 Alice, where are you?

400
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:21,140
 I've been out trying to find enough groceries.

401
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:24,140
 But he had realized it was hardly an hour left before the Anderson's were being here.

402
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:28,340
 - He's a beanier. - I guess I couldn't help it if somebody had bought all the string beans in town.

403
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:30,140
 The Anderson-Cocaffery-Deg plan.

404
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:32,140
 I do hope they won't stay long after dinner.

405
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:33,640
 Father, is that you?

406
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,640
 It is.

407
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,640
 Well, if you were my friend, wait for you.

408
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,140
 There was a phone call for you.

409
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:38,640
 Yes?

410
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,640
 - Mr. Wilson? - Yes, sir.

411
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:43,140
 Oh, but he's in town. That's fine. I tried to phone him from the drug store.

412
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:44,140
 Yes, Father.

413
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:46,140
 Why are they jammed down at the hotel?

414
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,140
 You mean he can't get a room?

415
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:48,140
 No, sir.

416
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:49,640
 Well, you told him to come up here, didn't you?

417
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,140
 Up here?

418
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:51,140
 What phone?

419
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,140
 Why's a dinner there?

420
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,140
 And stay overnight.

421
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:56,920
 Why no mr. Wilson he came to town to do business with me

422
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:01,180
 I know father, but you gave me a lecture about asking people right out of a clear sky like that

423
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:04,800
 There's nothing about it that's out of a clear sky. Where did he say I could reach you?

424
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:09,700
 He said you couldn't he said he was going out to look for someplace to sleep Henry old rates

425
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:16,840
 Mother you don't you see the position I was in Henry if we have antagonized Mr. Wilson and he goes back to Chicago without seeing me out

426
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:19,540
 Now Sam, I'm sorry, Father.

427
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:21,540
 But Alice, of all the people we know, Ed Wilson.

428
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:23,540
 Ed Wilson, after all we do have a guest.

429
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:25,540
 Now Sam, don't be upset.

430
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:27,540
 That's proper goodness to go to this minute.

431
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:28,540
 Yes?

432
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:29,540
 Go, Sheila, let me go to the door.

433
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:31,540
 I'd like to be the one who invites you.

434
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:33,540
 Now wait a minute, Henry. Wait a minute.

435
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:34,540
 What's the matter?

436
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:35,540
 Alice, look out the window.

437
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:36,540
 Sorry, Sam.

438
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:37,540
 Look who's on the front porch.

439
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:39,540
 Aren't you with this cappling and a mother?

440
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:40,540
 Sam.

441
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:42,540
 How did you tell him to come?

442
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:44,540
 Well, I certainly didn't tell him to come this early.

443
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,540
 I'm not even doing it.

444
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:49,740

 - Hello, don't tell me you can't come in.

451
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:16,620
 - I thought perhaps it would be too early for you,

452
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:18,320
 but that horse is driving me crazy.

453
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,620
 I just had to get out of it.

454
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:21,500
 - Well, it's quite all right.

455
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,060
 Tell me, where's Bob?

456
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:24,300
 He's coming with the car, Alice.

457
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,300
 - Oh, yes, mother and I walk over.

458
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,140
 Really?

459
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:27,980
 Well, that's just fine.

460
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:29,980
 - Yes, that's fine.

461
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:31,660
 Let's, let's all sit down.

462
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:33,420
 Kathleen, hello.

463
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:35,060
 - Henry.

464
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:36,220
 - I guess he doesn't hear.

465
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:37,300
 He'll be back in a minute though.

466
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,820
 - Just suppose I go and get him.

467
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,820
 I had that one or two little things to attend to.

468
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:41,820
 And the kitchen, anyhow,

469
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:42,820
 would you just excuse me?

470
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:43,820
 Can you help me?

471
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:44,820
 I have to go with you,

472
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,820
 and you're the original thing to do.

473
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:47,820
 So there's a go-dell.

474
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:48,820
 I guess that's father.

475
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:49,820
 Yes? Well, that's father.

476
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:50,820
 Who's your average?

477
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:51,820
 Who's your average?

478
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:52,820
 Who's your average?

479
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:53,820
 You could go out and help him bring in grandmothers.

480
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:54,820
 What?

481
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:55,820
 My dad?

482
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:56,820
 Yes, Sam, Bob's mother.

483
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:57,820
 You remember her, don't you?

484
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:58,820
 Oh, yes.

485
00:19:58,820 --> 00:19:59,820
 Yes, that's fine.

486
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:00,820
 Oh, Bob.

487
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:01,820
 Hello, Bob.

488
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:02,820
 And Mrs. Anderson.

489
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:03,820
 How are you?

490
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:05,820
 Just play for Roblomb's, man.

491
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:06,820
 Yeah?

492
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:07,820
 All right, sir.

493
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:08,820
 Here we come.

494
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:12,320
 You want to go out the car and get grandmother's cushion.

495
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,320
 All right.

496
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,320
 Have you any idea what we're doing?

497
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,320
 Henry!

498
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,320
 Henry!

499
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,820
 I hope we're not going to be clowning you Sam.

500
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:20,320
 No, no not at all.

501
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,320
 Everything's going to be fine.

502
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,320
 Here we go grandmother.

503
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,320
 Right down into the big chair.

504
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,320
 Ah, but you want me to do.

505
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,320
 Just for sure, Miss.

506
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,320
 And she does better if you let it drop in.

507
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,320
 Yeah?

508
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,320
 Ah, that's fine.

509
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,320
 Here we are.

510
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:36,320
 Sam, I can't begin to tell you how grateful we are for you pulling us out of this chair.

511
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,320
 That's all right.

512
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:40,320
 Now Sam, I want to tell you one thing.

513
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:44,320
 Better you and I decided before we came over we're going to make as little trouble for you as possible.

514
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,320
 Bob, what are you talking about trouble for?

515
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,320
 Well, let's work out a schedule for the bathroom.

516
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,320
 You know what I mean? So we won't get in your way.

517
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,320
 What's that?

518
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:56,320
 And tell me frankly Sam, would you rather we eat with you or a little head of you?

519
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,320
 What's that?

520
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,320
 Why don't you let us do it again?

521
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:03,320
 I was just thinking, really, sir, just clean up the kitchen and get out your way.

522
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,320
 Get your stuff!

523
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,320
 Yes, Alice, what is it?

524
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,320
 Alice, what is this?

525
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,320
 Would you please come here right away?

526
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,320
 Yes, Alice.

527
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,320
 If you folks will excuse me, I'd go see what you are.

528
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:15,320
 The same as the person who'd be on the objections to grandmother eating upstairs.

529
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,320
 Upstairs?

530
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,320
 But no, that would be fine.

531
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,320
 Sam, I want you to tell me something.

532
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,320
 Alice, there's something I want you to tell me.

533
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,320
 Yes, can you cut these string beans while I go out and change my clothes?

534
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,320
 Alice, what's going on here?

535
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,320
 What do you mean?

536
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,320
 The Anderson's don't want to eat with us.

537
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,320
 Do you mean they're leaving?

538
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:32,320
 No, they want to eat in the kitchen before we do.

539
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,320
 And grandmother's going to eat upstairs.

540
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,320
 What's that? That grandmother.

541
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,320
 Alice, what do they mean by wanting a schedule for the bathroom?

542
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:41,320
 Well, do you show them where it is?

543
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:44,320
 No, they want a schedule for it, a schedule.

544
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,320
 What are you talking about? For my goodest duty for that is?

545
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,320
 I don't know who it is, how would I know?

546
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:52,320
 Well, don't just stand there, Dave. Go on to the front door.

547
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,320
 Where's Henry? Why can't Henry take care of some of this?

548
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,320
 I have no idea where Henry is.

549
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,320
 Sorry, this is not all this. I answered the door.

550
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,320
 Yes, it was. Now, Mr. Wilson was it?

551
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,320
 No, it's just the expert man without bogies.

552
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,320
 But I thought he didn't want to like it because he was so tall.

553
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,320
 Oh, oh.

554
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,820
 Now don't you let the fingers hang.

555
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:09,820
 You let that fellow out there bring everything in.

556
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:10,820
 Oh, yes.

557
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:11,820
 Or all those...

558
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:12,820
 All those...

559
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:13,820
 Is that your baggage?

560
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:18,320
 Yes, I told him to take them around and bring them in the backway so he won't scratch up the front hole.

561
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:18,820
 Hey, I'm...

562
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:19,820
 Yes, Betty?

563
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:23,820
 I forgot to tell Alice we brought our own sheets and tell our cases in our own towels.

564
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:24,320
 But, I...

565
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,820
 Enough to laugh for three days.

566
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:26,820
 Well, that's fine.

567
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:27,820
 Sam, who was it?

568
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:28,820
 Nothing Alice.

569
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:31,820
 Just the man with the Anderson sheets and towels.

570
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:35,340
 To the Anderson plot, but they say they can only be with us for three days

571
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:38,340
 I mean, oh

572
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:42,140
 Why we certainly thought you could be with us at least

573
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:51,580
 I would have been here soon. I only my father couldn't come at the last minute. What's that?

574
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:56,620
 Just my mother couldn't make it. Hello Sam. Oh, I do understand we're about being able to come along

575
00:22:56,620 --> 00:23:00,680
 Well, that's quite all right Elizabeth. We'll try to understand what we are this

576
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:04,680
 Yes, well anyway Sam, happy birthday!

577
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,680
 Happy birthday!

578
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:08,180
 Yes, yes, isn't that what you're celebrating?

579
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:10,680
 No Elizabeth, I wouldn't go so far as to say that!

580
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:14,180
 Well anyway, I know you're celebrating something!

581
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:16,680
 Oh isn't that Bambourter Endistice in there?

582
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,680
 Why grandmother Endistice!

583
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,680
 Boy am I looking forward to dinner!

584
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,680
 Is it dinner dear?

585
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,680
 Sure!

586
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:25,180
 Just for dinner? You can't stay overnight?

587
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:27,180
 Well, I guess I could.

588
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:28,180
 Where's Henry?

589
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,180
 I wish I knew!

590
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:31,180
 I'm going to get out of here.

591
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:34,180
 - What a cat, please. - Don't you can't make it out like a pixie.

592
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:36,180
 Anyway, where have you been?

593
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:38,180
 - Look, Father, look who I found. - Do you believe it?

594
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:41,180
 Can't you see? It's Mr. Wilson and his wife and children.

595
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:43,180
 I told them you wanted them to stay overnight.

596
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:44,180
 What's that?

597
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:57,180
 Alice, let me look at this list once more.

598
00:23:57,180 --> 00:24:00,180
 Quiet, Sam. You want to wake everyone in the house up?

599
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:02,180
 No one can hear us here in the kitchen, Alice.

600
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:05,180
 I just want to look at the list and see where everyone is sleeping.

601
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:07,180
 Just a moment while I turn this other light on.

602
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:11,180
 Now, let's see. Bob and Betty Anderson are in...

603
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:13,180
 There in our room, dear.

604
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:15,180
 Oh, yeah. Kathleen is in with Mary.

605
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:16,180
 Where's grandmother?

606
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:17,180
 She's in Henry's room.

607
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:18,180
 Oh, yeah.

608
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:20,180
 And Mr. and Mrs. Wilts are in the guest room.

609
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:22,180
 And their daughter is on the sofa in the living room.

610
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:24,180
 And their friends on that cart in the dining room.

611
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:25,180
 Oh, yeah.

612
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:29,180
 I'm going to sleep on that card I put up the side Mary and Kathleen.

613
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:31,180
 And where is it grandmother sleeping?

614
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:34,180
 I told you in Henry's room. I sent Henry over to stay with Homer.

615
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:37,180
 I realized that, Alice. Well, it worked out very well.

616
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:39,180
 I thought so too.

617
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:43,180
 Now wait a minute. Wait a minute. Where am I?

618
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:46,180
 You do, yes. Don't I have you on this list?

619
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:48,180
 Let's go through it once more.

620
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:50,180
 Then I guess I don't have you.

621
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:51,180
 That's a fine thing.

622
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:54,180
 Well, do you've got to lie down someplace you've had a hard day.

623
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:56,180
 Why, uh, why...

624
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:58,180
 What are you going to suggest?

625
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:02,180
 No, I guess the Wilson boy couldn't possibly sleep with grandmother.

626
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:06,180
 No dear, no. We all agreed that grandmother better sleep alone.

627
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:09,180
 How about...how about...no?

628
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:10,180
 Of course, yes.

629
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:13,180
 There's that old blanket that Henry's goat used to sleep on.

630
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:16,180
 But I frankly don't think you'd be comfortable on that.

631
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:19,180
 No. But I might take a couple of leaves from the dining room table

632
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:21,180
 and put them across the bathtub.

633
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:22,180
 What?

634
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:27,580
 And just lie there holding the bathroom schedule now Sam I'm doing the best I can I know Alice

635
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:31,300
 But I've got to do some work tomorrow. I can't just stand up against the wall all night

636
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:34,620
 Alice who said then it's Henry yes dear

637
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:40,040
 Not so loud Henry did you forget something forget something?

638
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:46,220
 What was it she doesn't know your mother's asking you why are you back? I can't sleep over Homer why not?

639
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:50,940
 Homer's Uncle Joe showed up on a furlough and he brought two soldiers along with him

640
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:51,780
 What's that?

641
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:53,020
 So I had to come home.

642
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:54,220
 Sam, what are we going to do?

643
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:56,280
 I don't know what they're going to do.

644
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,220
 It's grandmother that's messing up the whole work.

645
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:00,140
 What are you walking out of the room like that, Paul?

646
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:01,580
 I'm going to answer the telephone.

647
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:03,500
 Would you like me, grandfather?

648
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,020
 Hello.

 Hello.

650
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:06,420
 Do you have a Mr. Wilson there?

651
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:07,120
 Yes.

652
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,420
 Could I speak to him, please?

653
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:09,220
 Why?

654
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:11,580
 He can't come to the phone right this minute.

655
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:12,500
 Did I take a message?

656
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:13,860
 This is the mansion house.

657
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:16,340
 Mr. Wilson had his name on our reservation list

658
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:18,580
 and asked us to give him a call if anything turned out.

659
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:19,220
 Yes.

660
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:20,740
 We just found one bed.

661
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:23,360
 If he doesn't mind, it's being in the room with another gentleman.

662
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,120
 I missed the Wiggins from Battle Creek.

663

 Yes? Good. Hold it.

 - Come with me! - Where to?

666
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:32,800
 We're gonna sleep with a man with a name of Wiggins from Battle Creek.

 No, Henry.
