00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 Henry Obrig! Come in, mother!

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 Grown-ups, when looking back upon the days of their youth,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 always translate even their greatest catastrophes into pleasant memories.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
 But when you're right there in your teens like Henry Algridge,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
 The catastrophe is really a catastrophe.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 The scene opens at the August breakfast table.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 It is Saturday morning.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 More coffee, Sam?

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 Yes, please.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 And did I tell you, Mother, that she's going to wear a new, short,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 true stress? Isn't that nice?

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 That's enough, Alice. Thank you.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
 And shoes to match?

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 Really? Well, that's fine.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 Who, dear? Who, what?

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 Is wearing all these things?

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 Nancy Adams.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 Into the dance tonight.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 Henry, is it necessary for you to bolt your breakfast like that?

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.560
 The father haven't you been listening? I'm going to a dance right after breakfast

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.440
 Now sure deny

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.080
 But gee it's the most important dance of the year in chartreuse is my favorite color

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.280
 How do you follow that dear you're the lawyer don't look at me. She was don't you get a father?

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.480
 That's why she's wearing it wearing what good dress

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.320
 I'm glad to hear it. Did I hear it though?

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.320
 Oh, is that you Homer?

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:48.980
 Gee come on in we've been waiting for you. Good morning Homer

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:53.440
 That isn't much breakfast left Homer, but you're welcome to watch you can find

00:01:53.440 --> 00:02:01.480
 Homer didn't you hear me I invited you to have something to eat

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:12.000
 But a home

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.000
 If I don't have his mother, Alice, it may be serious.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
 But he looks alright for Homer.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.400
 Hey, go into the living room and try to find out what's wrong.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.400
 Okay.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.400
 Hey Homer!

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.400
 Sam, you're so just contagious.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.400
 Homer!

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.400
 Oh, here you are.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.400
 Hey, Homer, why are you just standing in the middle of the room?

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.400
 Oh, I am.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.400
 What's wrong?

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.400
 Well, that's okay, Henry.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.400
 Don't let me get you down.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.200
 Do you've got your whole life before you?

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.400
 You learned so of you!

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.600
 Maybe.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:46.700
 Who are you?

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.300
 Depressed about something?

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.300
 Depressed?

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.600
 She would you get a my idea like that?

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.200
 But something's happened.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.800
 Well, Gloria broke her date to go to the dance with me tonight.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.300
 But what's so unusual about that?

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:01.600
 Homer, she didn't.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:02.700
 That's nothing.

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.900
 And she's the third girl at Sonant this week.

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.900
 Gee.

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.900
 Do you expect to do it?

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.900
 Why would she do a thing like that?

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.900
 I don't blame her.

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.900
 I'll pull yourself together.

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.900
 Turn together, I'm together.

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.900
 Only look at Charlie Carr.

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.900
 He's got a swelled car and lots of clothes.

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.900
 Toby Smith has looks.

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.900
 You've got personality.

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.900
 Even William Marshall, he has a bankroll.

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.900
 What have I got?

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.900
 You've got...

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.900
 Yeah?

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.900
 Homer, you've got lots of things!

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.900
 You've got...

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.900
 Mainly one.

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.900
 Well, you've got...

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.900
 You're awfully good to your mother.

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.900
 That's the least I can do. She has to live with me.

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.900
 Listen, Homer, you're taking this whole thing too seriously.

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.040
 No I'm not and I can see the humor aside of it.

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.040
 Geez.

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.040
 Heh.

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.840
 See I think the whole thing's pretty firming.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.840
 Well, so long.

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.840
 Oh well you're not going.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:14.840
 Sure.

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.600
 You'll want to be making your plans for the dance.

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.600
 I'll just run along and get out of your ways.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:21.600
 Wait a second, Homer.

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.640
 Why don't I phone Cori and tell her what a mistake she's making.

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:25.640
 No sir.

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.360
 Well how about if my mother phones there?

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:32.600
 mother where she's real good at oh no maybe you think I'm gonna live on

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.960

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:43.600

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:51.380
 Gee Gee when hello hello operator number please

 Oh, I'm eight one one. Yes, mother

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:03.740
 In the second mother as soon as I get home we're off my mark. Hello. Hello. Is that you Nancy?

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:09.360
 Yes, is that you Chester the who oh my goodness. What day is this? Why Saturday? Oh?

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.020
 Hello Henry. Oh

 How are you? I'm fine. How are you? I'm fine. How's Chester? Oh my goodness

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:23.220
 Never mind look and Nancy could you do me a big favor?

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:24.220
 I love you.

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:29.660
 Well, I've got this very good friend see and I'd like to fix him up with a date for the dance tonight.

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:31.660
 Really? What's he like?

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:33.660
 What's he like?

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:37.660
 Well, he's uh, he's kind to his mother.

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:39.660
 What I mean is he not?

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:45.660
 Well, I'll say is Nancy. She's a swell guy. The soul of the earth. He's got everything.

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:46.660
 Really?

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:48.660
 Sure, he's got...

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:50.660
 He's got...

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:53.660
 And not only that, he's modest.

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:54.660
 Henry?

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:56.660
 I know exactly who I can guess for.

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:57.660
 You do?

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:01.660
 I was just talking to a girlfriend of mine who hasn't got a single date tonight.

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:02.660
 These...

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:03.660
 Well...

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:06.660
 To tell you the truth she just broke a date with a boy that she says is simply impossible.

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:08.660
 Well, Nancy feels certainly like Whispeller.

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:10.660
 I also because she's pretty particular.

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:11.660
 So is he?

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:16.660
 Oh, is he? As a matter of fact, he's more or less of a confirmed bachelor.

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:18.660
 Oh, my goodness, really?

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:22.660
 Sure. And now I have to hang up, Mampy. So, goodbye.

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:26.660
 Goodbye. Henry. How about your breakfast?

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:28.660
 The mother of her, I have to phone Charlie and Willie.

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:29.660
 What's wrong?

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:33.660
 To get Homer in Shakespeare tonight, it's a matter of life and death.

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:47.100
 Oh, yes, he sounds wonderful.

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:49.700
 And not only that, Gloria, he's a confirmed bachelor.

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:51.700
 Oh, my goodness, an older man.

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:53.700
 And he sounds to me like a womanator.

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:54.700
 Isn't that thrilling?

00:06:54.700 --> 00:07:00.140
 Only, if he's as wonderful as all that, he must be terribly conceited.

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:01.140
 Oh, no, Gloria.

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:06.540
 And he said even though he's got absolutely everything he does modest, it can be.

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:09.940
 Did you happen to ask whether he was tall?

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:10.940
 No.

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:14.940
 But I remember distinctly Henry didn't say he was short and mad at him.

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:18.940
 And to think I almost tied myself up with that awful Homer Brown.

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:19.940
 Yeah.

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:25.940
 Imagine my goodness, a thing like that could blithe my whole existence.

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:35.940
 (music)

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:38.940
 (music)

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:40.940
 Hello there!

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:45.940
 Hello there! I'm speaking with you.

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:49.940
 Sure, Mother. And I appreciate it.

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:50.940
 (laughter)

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:51.940
 I beg your pardon?

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:53.940
 Oh, you don't have to put yourself out.

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:57.940
 I've been thinking of what you said about giving up dancing.

00:07:57.940 --> 00:07:59.940
 I think you're very wise.

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:00.940
 You do.

00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:02.940
 After all, homo, what is that dancing anyhow?

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:07.940
 You just walk around the room pushing a girl and trying to keep time to attune.

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:08.940
 Sure.

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:10.940
 Most of the time when girls push me.

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:11.940
 A book.

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:14.940
 There are other things much more fun than that.

00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:15.940
 You can't.

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:17.940
 What give me wings or something?

00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:18.940
 I don't know.

00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:19.940
 Here's Henry now.

00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:21.940
 Shall I get the chessboard, dear?

00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:24.940
 Don't bother mother, then I'll cut you both some cake

00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:29.300
 I got your date for tonight. Yeah

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:33.320
 Will you stop that plane didn't you hear me?

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:39.860
 Sure him, but she'll just take one look at me and remember she has to sit with a sick friend

00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:46.180
 But home I wash her hair for a minder brother. Oh, that's okay him

00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:50.260
 Besides I have any money for flowers. I'm having any car

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.260
 I don't even really

00:08:52.260 --> 00:09:00.620
 Hi, how's the kid? Hi, Willie. Why Henry? Imagine seeing you here sure in a man can see you here

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:03.180
 Imagine seeing anybody here

00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:10.180
 Listen, I just brought them to pay about two dollars. What two dollars? You know that you like me here

00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:14.400
 Well, I never lent you any money. Sure. You did I didn't I?

00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:20.260
 Don't you remember when did I last summer when the last

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:24.660
 She was you fellas feel alright

00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:31.420

 Imagine seeing you here. Oh, we imagine seeing you here and willy imagine seeing you here. Hey take it easy fellas. Hi home

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:42.400
 Hi Charlie imagine seeing you

 I mean, home on my car's outside.

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:47.400
 It is?

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:48.400
 Sure.

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:53.400
 Homer, I think what Charlie means is he's landing it to you.

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:54.400
 Sure.

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:55.400
 Sure.

00:09:55.400 --> 00:10:00.400
 Landing it to me, but Charlie, you never let anyone even breathe in that car.

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:02.400
 What do you mean by a remark like that?

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:04.400
 Well, it's not that you need to be stingy.

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:05.400
 Who's stingy?

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:06.400
 Who's stingy?

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:08.400
 Nobody said you were stingy.

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:09.400
 That's what I say.

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:10.400
 Homer did.

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:11.400
 He did not.

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:13.900
 - And we are heard of Willy. - And listen, Homer.

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:16.400
 - Hey, how are you? - Oh, I'm forgetting.

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:20.900
 He whizzed what we come over here for anyway.

00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:22.400
 That's what I like to know.

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:26.900
 Homer, all we want to do is give you a helping hand, don't we, fellas?

00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:29.100
 Sure, so you won't make a mess of your date tonight.

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:33.400
 And if you ask me, Homer, the least you could do if you're going out dancing is get a haircut.

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:36.900
 But surely, he always looks like a porcupine when he gets a haircut.

00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:38.900
 - Totally. - But Willy, look at it.

00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:40.900
 It's practically down to his shoulders.

00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:42.900
 Charlie it is not

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:47.160
 Besides I hate getting my hair cut you know what the whole trouble is Homer

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:52.240
 You don't go to the right barber the whole trouble is you should have it parted on the side instead of the middle

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:56.040
 Probably you're crazy. You shouldn't have any part of all which would be cold straight back

00:10:56.040 --> 00:11:02.680
 Listen Lily. Oh, we'll keep out of it. Oh, what will he that be terrible? He'd be all face

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:12.280
 Father, please step into the dining room a minute.

00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:13.480
 Sure, Father.

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:15.080
 I'll be right back, fellas.

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:17.680
 Can't we do anything about the way he walked?

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:19.480
 Oh, Bob, I've been listening to you.

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:21.480
 Father, you mean you've been eavesdropping?

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:22.380
 Never mind.

00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:25.880
 How many times have I elected you about borrowing money and automobile?

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:28.280
 But Father, I never asked to borrow them.

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:29.180
 No.

00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:31.980
 I suppose the boys volunteered them out of a clear sky.

00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:32.580
 Sure.

00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:34.580
 I give you my word.

00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:37.180
 See, I think everybody in town's gone crazy.

00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:38.780
 That's hardly likely.

00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:39.940
 You mean it to me?

00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:44.080
 Oh my, I want you to march straight up to your room and ride out 500 times.

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:46.420
 Neither Barrowar nor Lender Bee.

00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:48.120
 But father, what a high turn.

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:49.120
 Now march!

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:58.960
 [MUSIC]

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:00.580
 Hello, Mrs. Aldrich.

00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:01.420
 Yes?

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:03.500
 This is Mrs. Brown.

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:05.460
 Why, Elizabeth, how are you?

00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:07.580
 Quite well, thank you, Mrs. Aldrich.

00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:10.380
 Your son Henry is just left here with some of his friends.

00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:11.980
 And listen to this something wrong?

00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:14.380
 Well apparently there's plenty wrong with Homer.

00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:17.980
 Now that you've mentioned it, he did seem a little odd this morning.

00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:22.380
 Well, although he may be, we become somewhat attached to him just as he is.

00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:26.480
 And if anyone's going to remodel him, it seems to me to be

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:28.780
 some a little more perfect than your Henry.

00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:30.180
 And listen, but I know that's a good thing.

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:32.380
 And in the future, Mrs. Orbridge,

00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:35.580
 suppose Henry runs his life and I run Homer's.

00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:36.580
 Goodbye.

00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:37.580
 But Elizabeth!

00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:38.580
 Where are you?

00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:40.580
 In the living room reading the paper.

00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:42.580
 Well put it down.

00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:44.580
 You've got to do something about Homer.

00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:45.580
 I just did.

00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:47.580
 I sent him up to his room.

00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:48.580
 You did?

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:50.580
 You mean about his appearance?

00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:52.580
 Elizabeth, I'm not responsible for his appearance.

00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:55.580
 But don't look at me, Will Brown.

00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:58.580
 Elizabeth, what are you talking about?

00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:00.580
 I sent him upstairs to punish him.

00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:01.580
 Punish him?

00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:02.580
 Punish him?

00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:03.580
 Yes.

00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:05.580
 After all he's been through this week, what's that?

00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:08.940
 Didn't you know that in one week three different girls have packed him aside?

00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:14.000
 Like like an old shoe and I help it if girls nowadays are getting choosy

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.820
 Really there's no one to blame for this, but you me think if all home has gone to

00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:23.960
 Well, if if only the girls would take the trouble to look under me underneath what?

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:28.340
 It only skin deep

00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:34.340
 And they'd only get under your skin. They'd see what a fine person you really know

00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:38.340
 What kind of a knife is he going to have?

00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:41.340
 The poor little guy.

00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:44.340
 I'll answer the phone.

00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:47.340
 Hello.

00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:49.340
 Hello, well, this is Sam O'Ree.

00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:50.340
 Oh, hello, Sam.

00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:53.340
 I just called to apologize to Elizabeth.

00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:55.340
 Elizabeth can't come to the phone right now, Sam.

00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:56.340
 She saw him...

00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:58.340
 Well, taking a bath.

00:13:58.340 --> 00:14:01.340
 Oh.

00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:03.340
 What did you want to apologize for?

00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:10.340
 Now I'm not quite sure, but Alice is very upset. She seems to feel she offended Elizabeth in some way.

00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:14.340
 Well, I wouldn't worry about it, Sam. Probably some foolish little spat.

00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:15.340
 You think so?

00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:17.340
 You know how unreasonable women are.

00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:20.340
 Yeah, that's true. By the way, we're the house Homer feeling.

00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:21.340
 Oh, Mark?

00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:23.340
 Yes, we were a little worried about him this morning.

00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:25.340
 Why should you be worried about him?

00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:29.340
 Well, frankly, I understood from Henry that Homer was having girl trouble.

00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:33.280
 trouble now look here Sam out rich I don't know where a rumor like that could

00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:37.200
 have started but I'll have you know that Homer is as popular with the girls as

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:40.860
 Henry is any day in the week but I never had any trouble getting a date neither

00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:44.760
 did my father before me and you can be pretty sure that Homer is following in

00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:51.760
 our footsteps good day come on down here

00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:57.660
 I had trouble getting my pencil sharpened teeth.

00:14:57.660 --> 00:15:00.660
 Oh my, why aren't you willing to let the boys help you if they want to?

00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:01.660
 Why?

00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:05.660
 Charlie wants to lend you his car and Willie wants to give you two dollars?

00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:06.660
 You take them.

00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:08.660
 Father, do you feel alright?

00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:09.660
 Me?

00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:11.660
 I never felt better in my life.

00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:13.660
 Well, do I look alright?

00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:15.660
 You look fine, Homer.

00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:17.660
 Beauty's only skin deep.

00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:18.660
 Here.

00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:20.660
 Here's the $10 bill.

00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:23.960
 Father, are you handing that in my direction?

00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:27.160
 I am, and I want you to go out tonight and win your girl.

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:27.660
 What?

00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:29.660
 In the good old bound tradition.

00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:45.260
 Come on, Homer, let's step on it.

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:45.760
 Sure.

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:47.660
 And we've got a lot to do this afternoon.

00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:51.660
 Gee Henry, I sure appreciate what you and the fellas are doing for us.

00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:55.660
 Don't mention that homeward, it's the least we can do for an underprivileged friend.

00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:57.660
 Gee thanks.

00:15:57.660 --> 00:16:00.660
 By the way, where are weally in charge?

00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:02.660
 Over Willy's pressing your suit.

00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:03.660
 They are.

00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:09.660
 And look Homer, I don't mean to be critical, but you have to trot beside a person like that.

00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:11.660
 Can't you sort of strive?

00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:12.660
 Well.

00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:14.660
 And hold your shoulders back like this.

00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:15.660
 Yeah.

00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:16.660
 Stick your chest down.

00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:17.660
 My chest?

00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:20.660
 A home where at least you can try.

00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:21.660
 Hey, Ray.

00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:23.660
 Hey, is that your mother?

00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:24.660
 Every way.

00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:26.660
 Mother, what are you doing downtown?

00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:30.660
 Henry, I was talking to Mrs. Brown a while ago and she's very much upset.

00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:31.660
 What about?

00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:34.660
 She seems to think you're doing something terrible to Homer.

00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:35.660
 Hello, Homer.

00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:37.660
 Well, where'd she get an idea like that?

00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:39.660
 Well, I'm doing this remodeling him.

00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:42.660
 There, you're just about it immediately.

00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:45.660
 Just when I've got him where he looks almost human.

00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:46.660
 You are.

00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:48.660
 Henry, what are things to say?

00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:55.500
 But, mother, have you actually honestly ever looked at Homer as one human being to another?

00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:57.500
 I am looking at it.

00:16:57.500 --> 00:16:59.500
 Yeah, but look, mother, would you do this?

00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:03.500
 Would you sort of pretend it's the olden days when you were a girl?

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:04.500
 What's that?

00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:07.420
 And you're all dialed up for a party, see?

00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:10.660
 And you're expecting a swell guy to show up.

00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:11.660
 Sure.

00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:17.300
 rings and you open the door and they're staring in the face is Homer.

00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:23.540
 My goodness Henry I know the very thing Homer needs.

00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:24.540
 You do?

00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:25.540

00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:27.900
 I'll tell you later in surprise you goodbye.

00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:28.900
 He would.

00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:30.900
 Come on Homer here's the flower shop.

00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:31.900
 Sure.

00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:33.900
 Henry what do you suppose your mother means?

00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:34.900
 See how would I know?

00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:35.900
 Hello there Henry.

00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:36.900
 Over.

 Come Mr. Prentice.

00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:38.900
 What should I do for you boys?

00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:42.500
 I like to get a coarse eyes to send a girl for a dance to me.

00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:43.460
 It's your thing, Homer.

00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:44.940
 A one-bunch of daisies, right?

00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:45.700
 What?

00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:46.260
 Sure.

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:48.200
 Wait a minute, Mr. Prentice.

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:50.300
 Homer, you're not sending her daisies.

00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:52.620
 Why, not that's what I always say.

00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:55.340
 Sure, and there's your whole trouble.

00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:58.460
 Gee, whiz, if you were a girl, how do you feel if some fella

00:17:58.460 --> 00:18:00.900
 sent you the cheapest flower on the market?

00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:02.340
 Look, suppose--

00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:05.300
 Look, suppose you boys make up your minds, let me know.

00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:07.260
 It's all made up, Mr. Prentice.

00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:09.260
 We'd like to look at some markets.

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:10.260
 For kids?

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:12.260
 Can you think I'm a millionaire?

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:14.260
 Sure, didn't your father give you ten dollars?

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:16.260
 The cheapest orchid I have is four dollars.

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:18.260
 Four dollars? Four dollars?

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:20.260
 They pretty one nine.

00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:23.260
 And then what have you got? A book more.

00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:25.260
 Mr. Prentice couldn't homework just C1.

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:28.260
 I'm provided it doesn't cost anything for law.

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:32.260
 Oh, Miss Jones, would you please bring A orchid out of the refrigerator?

00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:34.260
 Well, geez, bring the Mr. Prentice.

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:36.260
 I'd like to pick out some flowers for my girl.

00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:37.260
 for my girl.

00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:39.260
 Alright Henry, how about the nice car deez?

00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:41.260
 Garvenius, how much are they?

00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:44.260
 No, I could make up a nice courseage for 350.

00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:46.260
 As high as that.

00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:49.260
 How much would carnations be?

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:50.260
 275.

00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:52.260
 See, where?

00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:55.260
 Well, look, how much are daisies?

00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:07.260
 We're going to this dance in order to have a good time, aren't we?

00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:08.260
 Hi, Besso.

00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:10.260
 Well, if you're gonna suck all evening,

00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:15.260
 it's going in your day, sent you an orchid, and all Henry sent me was Daisy.

00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:16.260
 He did.

00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:20.260
 And the more I think about it, the more I think of all the nerve.

00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:21.260
 I tell playing you, Nancy.

00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:24.260
 How am I going to look with a bunch of babies and Henry and Olga,

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:27.260
 when you're dancing with a man in an orchid?

00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:42.260
 Okay Homer, you're all ready to go to the dance. Stand over there and let's have a last look at you.

00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:43.260
 How's it?

00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:48.260
 Willie straighten his tie a little. Sure. Boy he doesn't look like the same guy, does he?

00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:50.260
 I don't see that swell.

00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:54.260
 Those extra heels my mother has put on a choos make all the difference.

00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:59.300
 Come on fellas it's time to go is your car outside Charlie sure but boy is it raining

00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:03.140
 That's okay. Will he open the door sure and I'll be putting up the umbrella

00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:09.680
 I'm going to hold over you Homer while while you get down the wall you take his right arm willy and I'll take his left

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:13.360
 Sure now listen fellas. I can at least walk by myself

00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:19.180
 Oh, no Homer. We're not taking any chances on you falling on your face. Okay fellas. Let's go

00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:21.940
 The umbrella over him.

00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:25.940
 Yeah, but you fellas are all out in the ring and you're all just up to...

00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:27.940
 Don't worry about our homework.

00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:29.940
 Okay, here's my car, get in Homer.

00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:30.940
 Hey, look out for that car!

00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:31.940
 Homer, get by!

00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:33.940
 He's gonna splash you!

00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:37.940
 Get bacon in with, why don't you look where you're going?

00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:38.940
 [Laughing]

00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:40.940

00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:41.940
 Born.

00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:43.940
 Boy, just look at him.

00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:44.940
 Sheeee.

00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:47.940
 What's this all over my face?

00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:49.940
 Mud homie.

00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:51.940
 Well, let's get out your handkerchief.

00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:52.940
 Sure.

00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:53.940
 Ow.

00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:54.940
 Oh, my whole still.

00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:57.940
 Listen, college, you're getting the mud right in my eye.

00:20:57.940 --> 00:20:59.940
 Okay, okay, who said that?

00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:00.940
 Who said what?

00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:02.940
 Who's the white guy who called me a knitted?

00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:03.940
 Why aren't you?

00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:05.940
 Where is your knuckus block off?

00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:06.940
 Who me?

00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:07.940

00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:24.940
 Homer. Homer, how do you feel?

00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:26.940
 I feel swell, Henry.

00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:28.940
 Did you have a good night?

00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:30.940
 Sure. Thanks, Willie.

00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:32.940
 Are they treating you all right, fella?

00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:34.940
 Boy, I'll say.

00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:38.940
 That's one thing about this hospital. The service is swell.

00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:44.940
 Gee, you sure are taking it well, kid.

00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:50.940
 And we just want you to know, Homer, that we admire the way you stood up to that truck driver last night.

00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:52.940
 You bet, we sure have to hand it to you.

00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:54.940
 No, I'll say.

00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:58.940
 Boy, if you hadn't fainted, there's no telling what would have happened.

00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:00.940
 Sure.

00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:05.940
 Only what I can't understand, Homer! How did you get so banged up?

00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:10.940
 When you guys brought me down here to the hospital to have them look at my head.

00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:11.940
 Yeah?

00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:14.940
 Gee, I was walking down the stairs, see?

00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:18.940
 I forgot to allow for those extra rubber heels on my shoes.

00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:20.940
 Homer, let's talk about it.

00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:24.440
 Gee, how can you ever forgive us for what we did to you?

00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:26.440
 Gee, you didn't do anything.

00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:27.940
 I feel great.

00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:30.940
 Boy, I never felt better in my life.

00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:32.440
 Look, can we tell him now?

00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:34.440
 How many of you have you seen before?

00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:35.440
 I'm sure.

00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:37.440
 Homer, have we got a surprise for you?

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:38.440
 Sure.

00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:40.440
 Guess who's out in the hole and wants to see?

00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:41.440
 Gloria.

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:42.440
 Gloria?

00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:44.440
 She brought you a swell bunch of daisies.

00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:45.440
 She did.

00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:46.440
 Oh, look.

00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:47.440
 Could you tell it?

00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:50.440
 Just leave them and tell her I said thanks.

00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:52.440
 Homer, don't you want to see, Gloria?

00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:53.440
 Why?

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:54.440
 I don't want to take up her time, Hinn.

00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:57.440
 And look, why don't you fellas just run along too?

00:22:57.440 --> 00:22:59.440
 And leave you all alone?

00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:01.440
 Well, I won't be lonely, Ernest.

00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:03.440
 Maybe you'll be wanting to see Nancy.

00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:07.440
 No, I won't, Homer. She broke our damn state last night.

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:09.440
 She is. Why?

00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:12.440
 I don't know. Came right out of a clear sky.

00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:14.440
 Homer, don't you really want us to stay?

00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:15.440
 Oh, well.

00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:18.440
 Come on, guys. Maybe we are tiring him out.

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:19.440
 Sure.

00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:21.440
 Well, okay. And thank you.

00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:24.440
 Gee, did you ever see anybody so brave?

00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:25.440
 Oh, excuse me.

00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:28.440
 Excuse us, nurse. Sure. Come on, father.

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:31.440
 Well, Homer, how are we feeling now?

00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:34.440
 She nurse, I feel terrible.

00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:36.440
 Where have you been now, Homer?

00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:38.440
 Don't you worry about a thing.

00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:41.440
 We're going to pick you up and get you out of here in no time.

00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:44.440
 She was nurse. What's the hurry?

00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:47.440
 The way I feel, I'm going to be here for at least a week.

00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:48.440
 Really?

00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:51.440
 Or two, if I can marry you.

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:54.440
 Perhaps I'd better take your pulse again.

00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:55.440
 Sure.

00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:57.440
 Here, nurse.

00:23:57.440 --> 00:24:00.520
 Here's my hand now just lie still

00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:04.520
