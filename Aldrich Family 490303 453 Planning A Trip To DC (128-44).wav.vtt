WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 And now the Jell-O family presents...

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
 Henry... Henry Olgrich!

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 Coming, mother!

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 Yes, it's the Oldridge family based on characters originated by Clifford Goldsmith

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.500
 and starring Ezra Stone as Henry with Jackie Kelka's home.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.000
 And yes, it's the Jell-O family with its three famous desserts.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 Jell-O in those six delicious flavors, regular Jell-O puddings,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 with that old-fashioned homemade flavor, and Jell-O tapioca puddings,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
 a miracle of goodness, a marvel of speed.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 Oh, the big red letters stand for the jello family

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
 Oh, the big red letters stand for the jello family

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 That's jello, yum yum yum

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
 Jello puddings, yum yum yum

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 Jello tat the ode of puddings, yes sir

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 And now for the Aldridge family

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:26.000
 [Music]

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.000
 A typical teenage boy like Henry Aldrich lives in a world all his own.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 A very special world which adults can only understand and enter when they remember their own youth.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 The scene opens in the Aldrich bedroom. It is early morning.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.520
 morning. Alice! What now Sam? I can't find my socks. Now they are calmed down. But I can't go to

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.640
 Washington DC without my socks. It wouldn't be dignified. You've already packed them. I have? Oh,

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.760
 how about my ties? I know I didn't pack them. They're right there on the bed beside your suitcase.

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:02.880
 Oh, yeah. Say why do we have to pack now? Our train doesn't leave until six o'clock. Alice,

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.200
 this is one trip we're going to start in an orderly fashion. That's the trouble with women.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.720
 They never do things systematically. Where are my handkerchiefs? In your top drawer.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.220
 Mother!

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:13.220
 Father!

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.320
 Oh dear, Henry, what's wrong?

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.320
 Nothing!

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.320
 I just don't weigh enough!

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:19.320
 [laughter]

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.320
 Did he say "way"?

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:21.820
 I'd better go see what's wrong.

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.820
 No, Alice, you haven't started to do your own packing.

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:24.820
 I'll go.

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:25.820
 Very well said.

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.820
 And while you're packing, will you look onto the bureau for my other slipper?

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:30.820
 Now, Henry, what's the trouble?

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.320
 I can't get this darn thing closed.

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.820
 Henry, what are you doing with that steamer trunk?

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.320
 Gee whiz, packing it.

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.820
 So would you be willing to give me a hand and help me sit on my lid?

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:46.200
 Hepney may I remind you we're only going to Washington for a week. We're not moving there permanently

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.120
 I know it may look like I'm taking an awful lot father

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:54.920
 But I give you my word all I've packed is the everyday necessities of life. You don't say sure

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.120
 Would you mind lifting the lid?

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.120
 Lifting it so I can examine the necessities of life

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.040
 But father if I lift it things will start popping out all over the place

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.220
 I'm gonna have to carry my pajama bottoms in my overcoat pocket as is

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.120
 Good father. Yes, sir

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:18.340
 Well father before you say I would hardly call a baseball glove one of the necessities of life

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.180
 But gee whiz no one's ever been able to do it do what?

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.000
 Catch a ball thrown from the top of the Washington Monument

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:31.880
 Don't you think I owe it to my country to at least try and re get rid of it, but father also get rid of this hunting knife

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.140
 But I'll need that for.

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:37.800
 I hardly think so from what I've heard the hauntings pretty lean in Washington these days.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.040
 But suppose I want a sharp and a pencil.

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.520
 Henry, please pack all your things in one suitcase.

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.040
 But father, I won't fit.

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.640
 You will if you forget the necessities of life and take just the luxuries,

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.720
 like socks and shirts and underwear.

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.960
 Sam, will you please answer the phone?

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:53.720
 Yes, Alice. Now hurry, Henry.

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.800
 But I don't know how I'll ever manage.

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.720
 You don't organize things properly.

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.600
 Alice, did you find my other slipper?

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.040
 Yes, and I packed both your razors.

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:03.760
 Why, too?

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.760
 A deal you always need one on the train.

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.560
 You need one to leave in the hotel.

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.360
 [LAUGHTER]

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.040
 Hello.

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.320
 Sam, this is Will Brown and Sam.

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.440
 Homo won't need his longies, Willy.

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:16.000
 That's what?

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.080
 Longies, Sam.

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:18.040
 Longies.

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.120
 Elizabeth says he'll need them in Washington,

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.480
 and I know he won't.

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:22.680
 Washington?

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:23.560
 Homer's going to--

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:24.840
 So what do you say, Sam?

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.120
 Pack them or don't pack them?

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.240
 Sam.

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:30.880
 Are you there?

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:31.760
 Yes, Will.

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:32.360
 I'm here.

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:33.960
 What do you say, Sam?

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:34.560
 Say?

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:35.880
 About longies.

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:36.280
 Why?

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.920
 Suppose you ask Alice and call me back.

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.000
 Yes, Will.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.080
 I'll call you back.

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.080
 Goodbye.

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.120
 And Sam, I certainly want to thank you,

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:45.440
 but taking home her along.

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.560
 You don't know what this means to our family.

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:48.080
 Yes.

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.080
 Goodbye, Will.

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.320
 Enryme.

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.200
 He went up to the attic for Mary suitcase.

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.520
 When he comes down, tell him I want to speak to him.

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.360
 Sam, you sound upset.

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:59.200
 - What's that, Alice?

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:00.520
 That was Will Brown on the phone.

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:01.880
 - Oh, yes.

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.160
 How is he?

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:04.360
 - Jubilently happy.

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:05.480
 - He is?

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:07.360
 - I would be too if Homer were my son

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.240
 and I thought I was packing him off to Washington for a week.

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.240
 (audience laughing)

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.520
 - Sam, may I explain one thing about that?

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.120
 - Then you knew, Alice?

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.680
 - Sam, please sit down.

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.880
 - Yes, Alice.

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.160
 I'm seated.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.560
 - Well, you see, dear?

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:25.840
 - Yes, Alice?

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:27.640
 - Well, you see Henry in Homer

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:31.480
 talked a whole thing over, but it wasn't entirely Henry's fault.

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:32.320
 You don't say it.

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:37.080
 Now, Sam, it was only natural for them to say how nice it would be if Homer could go.

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:38.880
 And I agreed with them and...

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:42.000
 Do you know how the Browns jump at conclusions?

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000
 I see.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.320
 But that's the whole story, Sam.

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:46.800
 I see.

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.800
 May I stand up now?

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:49.800
 Yes, dear.

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.160
 Not suppose you sit down.

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:53.160
 But dear...

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:54.160
 Alice?

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:56.160
 Yes, Sam, I'm seated.

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.960
 Alice, before I begin, I'd like to make one thing clear.

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.720
 I have nothing against Homer.

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:05.680
 I'm really very fond of him, under it all, way down deep.

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.120
 But this is more than a business trip.

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.600
 I've been looking forward to it as a welcome change.

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:10.240
 Yes, sir.

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.680
 And one of the most welcome changes

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:13.840
 was going to be an entire week without Homer.

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.720
 Now that doesn't sound unreasonable, does it?

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:17.520
 No, sir.

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:20.160
 Besides, Alice, you don't realize all the trouble I went to

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:23.280
 to get the train tickets and make hotel reservations.

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.200
 I simply can't go through all that again.

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:32.200
 Dear, I admit it was probably a mistake, but the thing is Henry's God's heart set on Homer going with us.

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:34.200
 And you just have to once set it.

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:38.200
 Letting Homer come along would be like taking your mother-in-law on your honeymoon.

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:42.200
 Sam Aldrich, there's absolutely no comparison.

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:54.200
 Homer, let's not argue. Pack those longies.

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:55.960
 What father, they tickled me.

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:57.460
 They tickled me too.

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:01.320
 But your mother showed me a map and it's just as far north as it is south.

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:02.680
 My longies are?

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:04.200
 No, Washington.

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:06.120
 I can't get them in my suitcase.

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:08.040
 Sure you can if you pack intelligently.

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:08.840
 What father?

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:10.440
 Let me at that suitcase.

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:15.240
 Now we'll take some of this stuff on the bottom and put it on the back.

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:16.600
 Oh my, what's this?

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:17.720
 My rattlesnake.

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:18.680
 What?

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:20.360
 He stuffed father.

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:25.960
 Homer, what makes you think Mr. Orleans will take both you and a stuffed rattlesnake?

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:30.040
 But I'm gonna donate it to the Smithsonian Institute. He's an antique.

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:31.080
 Now, Homer.

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:34.760
 Sure he is. She was, I've had him nearly five years myself.

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:37.000
 Homer, are you in your room?

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.040
 Sure, Hen.

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:41.320
 Now, Homer, remember what I said. Don't forget your longies.

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:42.840
 Hi, Homer. Oh, time.

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:47.080
 Hi, Hen. Boy, you came just at the right time. Could you help me close this bag?

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:52.080
 Well Homer... Every time I try to sit on the lid it proctopy fills me over the end of the bed.

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:56.780
 Hm-hmm. Something I have to tell you. Yeah, why?

00:07:56.780 --> 00:08:03.480
 Well, first I have a little something for you. For me? Sure. My honey knife.

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:07.480
 Gee, you're giving me that? Sure old pal.

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:12.480
 And Gee, when you think of my father, just remember he's been working pretty hard lately.

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:15.780
 He has. And Gee was. Homer, I give you my word.

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:21.940
 Underneath it all he really likes you. He does. Underneath it all.

00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:33.460
 Henry old timer. Yes, Homer old pal. Look me in the eye. There. Now tell me the truth. Is something wrong?

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:45.700
 I'll say there is. Homer, you're not going with us. Oh, oh, oh. Homer, don't take it that.

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:47.460
 - That way. - One way.

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:49.500
 She was on her taking it anyway.

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:50.900
 - You're not? - She was just because

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:52.180
 I've been looking forward.

00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:55.620
 I mean, it isn't so tragic.

00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:56.940
 Look at me.

00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:58.020
 I'm smiling.

00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:00.960
 - You are? - I'm not.

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:03.980
 - Sure you are, Homer.

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:05.460
 And why don't you sit down

00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:08.540
 while I unpack your rattlesnake for you?

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:11.120
 (upbeat music)

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:13.700
 (upbeat music)

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:20.600
 - Henry, is that you?

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:23.160
 - Yes, mother, it's I, all right.

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:24.280
 - Here you look terrible.

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:26.400
 Go in the kitchen and have a banana.

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:28.160
 (audience laughs)

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:29.000
 - A banana?

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.640
 - It'll cheer you up.

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:31.960
 - Mother, I give you my word.

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:34.360
 I couldn't force a thing down my throat.

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:35.280
 And mother.

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:36.480
 - Yes, dear.

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:38.320
 - I know you've been looking forward

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:40.360
 to all of us seeing Washington together,

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:45.040
 But would you mind very much if I didn't go?

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:46.160
 - Now Henry.

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:49.280
 - She was, what's the capital of our country without Homer?

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:50.120
 (audience laughs)

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:52.880
 - You don't want to make your father feel badly, do you?

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:55.440
 - Father, it's Homer that can't go.

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:58.040
 - But that's why your father feels badly.

00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:00.160
 Just because he doesn't come out and say so

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:03.360
 doesn't mean he isn't terribly upset by the whole thing.

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:06.520
 - Mother, are you still talking about my father?

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:07.600
 - Yes, Henry.

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:09.640
 He simply happens to be the kind of man

00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:13.800
 who has more character than we have and can hide his feelings.

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:15.280
 She was, is that right?

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:16.640
 Of course.

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:19.480
 Then why doesn't he just say, "Sure Homer can go with us

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:20.840
 and stop suffering?"

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:22.320
 [LAUGHTER]

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:24.320
 Oh, I can't keep a fine mark.

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:24.820
 Oh.

00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:26.640
 Sam, I'm having a talk with Henry,

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:29.120
 and he understands, don't you, Henry?

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:32.840
 Yes, mother and father, I'm certainly sorry you feel so awful.

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:33.420
 I?

00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:36.440
 And from now on, I won't mention the subject again.

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:38.120
 Oh, this whole on earth was all that about.

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:42.680
 Dear, I was just explaining to Henry that it's your place to make the decision

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:46.480
 and that whatever you decide will be what you think is for the best.

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:49.200
 Well, thank you, Alice, for seeing my side.

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:50.520
 Was that the song?

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:51.160
 Yes.

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:53.000
 Well, dear, why don't you answer it?

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.120
 I'd like to finish packing.

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:56.360
 Sam, I'll be only too glad to finish for you.

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:57.360
 Alice, I'd much rather...

00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:58.680
 I'm sure it's for you.

00:10:58.680 --> 00:10:59.400
 You are?

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:02.120
 That is, I have a feeling at my feet.

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:02.840
 Hello?

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:04.320
 Hello, Sam. This is Harriet.

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:05.000
 Who?

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.840
 Harriet, your wife's sister.

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:08.380
 Oh, yes, Harriet?

00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:09.640
 Bon voyage.

00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:10.500
 A mega pardon?

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:11.780
 Bon voyage, Sam.

00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:13.000
 Bon voyage!

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.700
 On your trip to Washington.

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:15.640
 Thank you, Harriet.

00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:17.140
 And Sam, let me tell you.

00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:18.780
 When you first started courting Alice,

00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:20.540
 I was the only one in our entire family

00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:22.320
 who stood up for you and said you weren't.

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:23.020
 Word what?

00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:24.020
 Stubborn.

00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:26.520
 And I don't think you're really being stubborn now.

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:27.780
 You just happened not to have it

00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:30.060
 from the standpoint of your patriotic duty.

00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:31.160
 Harriet, I don't see--

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:33.460
 Sam, every red-blooded American boy

00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:35.020
 should be given the opportunity to see

00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:38.260
 the capital of his country at least once in his lifetime.

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:42.380
 Harriet, just what red-buttered American boy are you referring to?

00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:45.060
 Why, er, anyone?

00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:46.660
 I see.

00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:48.700
 Harriet, let me tell you something.

00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:49.740
 You were wrong.

00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:50.240
 Wrong.

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:51.140
 I am stubborn.

00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:52.620
 I'm as stubborn as they come.

00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:55.700
 And Homer is not going with us, and that's that.

00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:57.020
 I see.

00:11:57.020 --> 00:11:59.940
 Well, that's still no excuse for insulting my mother, Sam Aldrich.

00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:00.540
 Your mother?

00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:02.860
 She never went on anyone's honeymoon, and you know it.

00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:12.860
 [Music]

00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:13.660
 Hello?

00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:16.060
 Hello, am I speaking to Harold Green?

00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:16.980
 Yeah, who's this?

00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:19.180
 Will Brown over in Centerville, Harold?

00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:21.980
 Oh, hello, Will. We were delighted to get your notes

00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:23.580
 so you could come out for the weekend.

00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:26.540
 Yes. Well, Harold, that's why I called.

00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:28.460
 And don't forget to bring your golf clubs, Will.

00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:31.580
 Golf clubs? No, no, I won't forget.

00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:35.580
 And look, do you mind if I bring Homer too?

00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:36.580
 Homer?

00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:37.580
 Yes.

00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:38.580
 Your son?

00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:39.580
 Yes.

00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:42.580
 He caddies for me all the time you see and I just thought...

00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:45.580
 But well, I thought Homer was going to Washington with the Aldrages.

00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:48.580
 I thought so too, but now it seems they can't take him.

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:52.580
 So we're stuck with him, we can't very well leave him alone all weekend.

00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:56.580
 Well, in that case, naturally bring him along.

00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:57.580
 You don't mind?

00:12:57.580 --> 00:12:58.580
 Not at all.

00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:02.140
 There won't be any other youngsters around, though.

00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:03.140
 - Not at all.

00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:04.940
 - That's the way we planned this weekend.

00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:07.280
 No youngsters, just adults.

00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:08.120
 - Oh.

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:09.220
 - But bring 'em along, Will.

00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:10.940
 We'll find something he can do.

00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:13.220
 - Sure, that's one thing about Homer.

00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:15.860
 You can hand him a magazine and then forget about him.

00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:17.220
 - Sure.

00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:20.020
 What made Sam change his mind about taking him to Washington?

00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:23.220
 - Well, you know how much trouble an extra boy can be.

00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:25.580
 - Homer, trouble?

00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:27.380
 - Well, Homer.

00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:29.780
 Isn't only that, naturally, it's...

00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:32.540
 Well, I just checked the ticket office myself,

00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:35.140
 and there isn't a birth to be had on the train Sam's taking.

00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:35.780
 But will I?

00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:38.260
 And Homer's so disappointed about the whole thing

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:40.500
 that I'm sure if we brought him up to your place,

00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:41.980
 it might help to cheer him up.

00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:43.580
 But will, wait, wait, wait.

00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:45.180
 Why should Homer be disappointed?

00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:46.380
 Let's sit down and think.

00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:48.980
 (upbeat music)

00:13:56.540 --> 00:13:57.540
 Hello.

00:13:57.540 --> 00:13:58.540
 Hello, Homer, goodbye.

00:13:58.540 --> 00:13:59.540
 What's that?

00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:00.540
 This is Agnes.

00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:03.340
 Goodbye, kid, and have a nice trip.

00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:04.340
 But Agnes.

00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:10.260
 Boy, when I think of you being awake for a whole week, boy, I don't know how I'll stand

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:11.260
 it.

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:12.260
 But that's just it, Agnes.

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.660
 I'll be miserable at the dance Saturday night.

00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:16.220
 Look, about the dance.

00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:17.220
 Forget it, kids.

00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:22.660
 What's being miserable compared to you and Washington expanding your mind?

00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:23.660
 But that's it, Agnes.

00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:26.220
 I've suddenly decided not to go.

00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:30.780
 I've been thinking about it and gee what's Washington?

00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:35.960
 I mean it's a place everybody's dying to go to sure, but what is it?

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:38.380
 Homer tell me the truth why aren't you going?

00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:42.540
 Well Agnes have you tried getting on a train lately?

00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:46.420
 Boy and hotels, hotels Agnes.

00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:47.340
 What about them?

00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:49.440
 Gee they're worse than trains.

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:51.640
 Besides there's my schoolwork.

00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:55.300
 You don't think I could leave my education for a week with a free mind.

00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:56.820
 Isn't Henry leaving here?

00:14:56.820 --> 00:15:00.700
 Sure, but he has official permission from Mr. Bradley.

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:03.300
 So I guess I'll be taking you to the dance

00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:05.300
 Saturday night after all.

00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:06.500
 The dance?

00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:07.160
 How can you?

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:09.700
 I've got a heavy date with Charlie Clark.

00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:10.900
 What?

00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:12.900
 You are standing me up to--

00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:13.700
 Hey, you're home.

00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:15.220
 Mama, we'll figure out something.

00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:16.060
 Goodbye.

00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:17.060
 Goodbye.

00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:17.940
 Boy, I'm your old pal.

00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:19.740
 Have I got good news for you?

00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:21.620
 I'm going to Washington.

00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:22.980
 Not exactly.

00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:25.580
 But I've arranged a swell weekend for you.

00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:28.540
 You're staying with my Aunt Harriene.

00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:29.380
 - Why?

00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:31.300
 - Gee, you'll have a swell time.

00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:33.220
 You can play cribbage with her

00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:34.940
 and watch her do needle point.

00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:38.700
 - Now listen, and you'll be a big help to her too.

00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:40.620
 - See, what with her rheumatism acting up

00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:42.740
 against she can hardly lift a thing.

00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:43.580
 - Yeah.

00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:44.420
 - How does that sound?

00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:45.260
 - Terrible.

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:47.060
 (audience laughing)

00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:49.180
 - But Homer, when I suggested it to your father,

00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:51.260
 he thought it was a great idea.

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:52.100
 - He did.

00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:57.020
 If your folks can unload you on my Aunt Harry if they can go up to the Greens for the weekend

00:15:57.020 --> 00:16:00.820
 Homer

00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:07.520
 You don't want me my parents don't want me Agnes doesn't want me okay, okay?

00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:14.980
 Okay, but if you think I'm gonna stay home with your Aunt Harry it's rheumatism while you're having the time of your life in Washington

00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:22.060
 You're crazy. Oh, I'm just never mind feeling sorry for me. Goodbye Henry Aldrich. Homer. You're shoving me up

00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:23.460
 - Oh, here. - What's this?

00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:25.580
 - You're a hunting knife. You can't bribe me.

00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:27.580
 - Listen, Homer. - And here's that key chain

00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:29.140
 you gave me for Christmas.

00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:31.060
 It only cost a quarter anyway.

00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:33.660
 - But Homer-- - Besides that fall-leaf clover

00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:35.300
 on it never brought me luck anyway.

00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:36.300
 Goodbye.

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:39.740
 - Homer, Homer, you're not listening to reason.

00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:42.320
 (upbeat music)

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:48.580
 (audience applauding)

00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:56.340
 And now it's time to listen to a little reason from Meredith Wilson and his talking people.

00:16:56.340 --> 00:17:03.340
 "Inermission, inermission shall we dance?"

00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:04.340
 Now wait a minute here.

00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:14.340
 "Jello, bono, tapioca, jello, tapioca, jello orange, that means orange, coco, but..."

00:17:14.340 --> 00:17:19.340
 Well, I guess you could take over any intermission singing about jello tapioca puddings.

00:17:19.340 --> 00:17:22.340
 Well, we accept the compliment.

00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:23.700
 And now back to the audience.

00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:24.980
 Hey, hey, wait a minute here.

00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:27.820
 If we didn't tell everybody that Jellotapioca puddings

00:17:27.820 --> 00:17:30.820
 are a marvel of goodness and a miracle of speed,

00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:34.060
 we would be derelict in our duties to the public.

00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:34.900
 Wow.

00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:35.500
 Yes.

00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:38.700
 Whatever we do, let's don't be whatever that was you said.

00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:39.700
 OK.

00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:43.540
 And why are Jellotapioca puddings a marvel of goodness?

00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:45.900
 Because of three wonderful flavors--

00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:49.380
 chocolate, vanilla, and orange.

00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:51.100
 That means orange coconut.

00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:52.460
 I know what it means.

00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:56.460
 And why are jello tapioca puddings a miracle of speed?

00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:59.740
 Because they cooked a perfection in just about five minutes.

00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:02.100
 And what is your favorite polka?

00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:08.580
 The tap, leooca polka, jello, vanilla tapioca, jello

00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:12.700
 chocolate tapioca, jello orange.

00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:15.020
 That means orange coconut.

00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:17.020
 And now back to the Aldrich family.

00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:27.220
 Yes, getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldrich.

00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:29.020
 Mr. Aldrich has made it clear

00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:32.060
 that taking Homer on the family's trip to Washington

00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:34.060
 is an impossibility.

00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:36.380
 Unfortunately for Mr. Aldrich,

00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:39.580
 neither Henry nor Mrs. Aldrich nor Mr. Brown,

00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:42.260
 nor a good many other people in San Diego

00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:45.060
 seem to understand his point of view.

00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:47.580
 The scene opens in Mr. Aldrich's office.

00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:49.140
 It is later the same afternoon.

00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:50.220
 Take a letter, Miss Thompson.

00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:51.380
 Yes, Mr. Aldrich.

00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:54.100
 Frankly, I'm a little surprised to see you in the office today.

00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:57.220
 Well, I thought it might be a good idea to get out of the house.

00:18:57.220 --> 00:18:59.900
 And well, if I go to Washington with unfinished business

00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:00.740
 hanging over you.

00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:01.740
 Yes, Mr. Aldrich.

00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:05.060
 Take a letter to Mr. J.B. Fletcher, home industries

00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:07.060
 development corporation, dear Homer.

00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:07.900
 Dear who?

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:10.660
 A Fletcher, dear Mr. Fletcher.

00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:16.960
 The years of the 18th received and I can readily understand the difficulties involved in changing your entire suitcase.

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:17.760
 Entire what?

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:19.560
 Filing system.

00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:24.660
 However, I feel that once the facts have been weighed and is stand taken,

00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:29.360
 it is unwise to listen to those who may not be as familiar with the many sides of the problem as you are.

00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:31.960
 Yours truly Samuel Orridge. That makes sense, does it, Ms. Thompson?

00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:35.760
 Yes, Mr. Orridge. Although, have you ever thought of it this way?

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:38.160
 Two boys are a lot easier to entertain than one.

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:39.960
 Now, just a moment, Ms. Thompson.

00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:41.320
 But with just a suggestion, Mr. O'Brien.

00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:42.920
 - I've had all the suggestions I can use.

00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:43.760
 Thank you.

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:45.120
 Come in.

00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:46.840
 - Am I interrupting, Mr. O'Brien?

00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:48.360
 - Oh, no, Mr. Bradley.

00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:49.200
 Come in.

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:50.080
 - Thank you.

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:51.600
 - Mr. Thompson, suppose you get that letter off.

00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:52.600
 - Oh, yes, Mr. O'Brien.

00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:53.920
 Good one.

00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:55.280
 - I can only stay a minute.

00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:58.520
 I was on my way home and just dropped in to say

00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:00.280
 that as far as the school is concerned,

00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:02.040
 we have no objection.

00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:02.880
 - I beg your pardon.

00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:04.600
 - I'm sure a trip to Washington will do

00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:05.960
 Homer a great deal of good,

00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:08.600
 and it certainly can't do the school any harm.

00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:12.040
 [laughter]

00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:17.200
 Now, just a moment, Mr. Bradley, I have nothing against Homer Brown.

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:22.200
 But this is one trip I'm going on alone with just my family.

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:23.600
 You mean Homer's not going?

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:24.800
 Definitely not.

00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:26.600
 Well, I didn't mean to fear that he's...

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:30.800
 I got the idea from Agnes that all that was necessary was my official permission.

00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:34.200
 Agnes was wrong, Mr. Bradley, and I'm sure you can appreciate my position.

00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:36.000
 Of course.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.000
 Well, run along.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:43.000
 Next week was going to be such a pleasant change with Homer and Henry in Washington.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000
 Goodbye Mr. Bradley.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:46.000
 Bye.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.000
 I've got him at Thompson.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.000
 Hello.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.000
 Sam, this is Harold Green.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.000
 Oh yes Harold. I'll say those contracts of yours will have to wait until I get back from Washington.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000
 Oh that's okay but that isn't why I call.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.000
 Sam, I've got you all fixed up.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:59.000
 Fixed up, huh?

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:03.000
 A very good friend of mine is the passenger agent for the railroad and is a favorite of me.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000
 He really buckled down and got him.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.000
 Got him.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.000
 Got what?

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.000
 Four birthes for Washington.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.000
 What?

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:12.000
 Only you'll have to take another train that gets in 12 hours later.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.000
 What?

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.000
 But at least 15 minutes earlier.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.000
 No, wait a minute.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:16.000
 And make a note of this sale.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.000
 You change trains at four in the morning in Pittsburgh.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.000
 No, wait a minute!

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.880
 Excuse me, I'd like to pick up some tickets for Allrich.

00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:37.400
 Hi there, Mr. Allrich.

00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:38.400
 God!

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:40.200
 What are you doing behind the ticket window?

00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:41.400
 Selling tickets?

00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:43.200
 It's my new job, Mr. Allrich.

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:44.600
 Nice indoor work.

00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:45.800
 Well, would you?

00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:48.000
 Meet a nice class of people here.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.800
 You never see the same face twice.

00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:52.200
 You come to pick up your ticket, sir.

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:55.400
 Oh, yes. Three birds on the six o'clock train.

00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:58.800
 You're cancelling the four on the five forty-five?

00:21:58.800 --> 00:21:59.800
 I am.

00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:01.800
 All right, if you say so.

00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:06.240
 So you go into Washington, DC, yeah?

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:07.960
 Nice town, Washington.

00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:08.960
 I'm sure.

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:11.200
 Real credit to the country.

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:13.680
 I was there for the inauguration, you know.

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:14.680
 That's so.

00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:15.680
 It's a rebub.

00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:17.440
 I had quite a time.

00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:21.440
 McKinley turned out to be quite a president, too.

00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:23.240
 But McKinley.

00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:27.320
 William-- or was it Taft?

00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:28.880
 Let's see.

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:32.160
 There's back in Art 8. No question, there's Art 1.

00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:34.560
 - Gus. - Or was it Teddy Roosevelt?

00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:37.620
 - Gus, I'm sure I-- - Well,

00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:40.100
 there's back when we had a Republican. I remember that.

00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:44.140
 Artly a man is now alive.

00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:45.140
 [laughter]

00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:46.640
 - It's Sir E. Bob.

00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:48.640
 [laughter]

00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:51.040
 You ought to have a real nice time.

00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:55.240
 - Well, frankly, Gus, I'm not too sure. - Not sure, boy.

00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:58.520
 All I've heard all day is Homer Brown. Homer Brown.

00:22:58.520 --> 00:22:59.720
 gets pretty discouraging.

00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:01.720
 Yes, I can see where it would.

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:04.220
 Gosh, you have no idea the pressure that's been put on me,

00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:06.620
 but Gus, I'm not going to but.

00:23:06.620 --> 00:23:08.220
 That's right, Mr. Orange.

00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:10.820
 A man, if he is a man, that is,

00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:13.220
 has got to be free to make up his own mind.

00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:15.520
 Well, I'm glad to hear someone say that.

00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:16.420
 Here's your ticket.

00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:17.520
 Oh, thank you.

00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:20.720
 Only, if you don't mind my mention in it,

00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:23.120
 there's no overlook in the fact that travel,

00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:25.320
 it broadens a young man.

00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:26.420
 Now, just a minute.

00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:28.420
 I got to agree with your missus there.

00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:31.220
 - Yes, I'd have to get back to my family in the waiting room.

00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:32.860
 - Okay, have a good time.

00:23:32.860 --> 00:23:33.940
 - Thank you.

00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:35.660
 - Oh, it was Coolidge.

00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:38.420
 Grace Coolidge's husband, Kelvin Coolidge, that's all.

00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:41.500
 (audience laughing)

00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:42.340
 - What?

00:23:42.340 --> 00:23:44.300
 - I've been looking all over the station for you.

00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:45.340
 - Now just a moment, Homer.

00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:47.340
 - Mr. Orter, I've been thinking it over,

00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:50.700
 and she was why be a sore head?

00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:51.540
 - What?

00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:54.340
 - I mean, she was, we've been friends for a long time,

00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:58.100
 and well, now that you're really on your way,

00:23:58.100 --> 00:24:00.540
 Have a good time, Mr. Aldrich.

00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:01.540
 Here.

00:24:01.540 --> 00:24:02.900
 What?

00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:04.700
 A basket of fruit.

00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:05.500
 Yes, sir.

00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:07.420
 To eat on the train.

00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:09.300
 If there seemed to be a few pieces missing,

00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:11.580
 I just wanted to be sure everything was fresh.

00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:13.460
 [LAUGHTER]

00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:15.820
 Homer, I hardly--

00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:16.320
 Hard--

00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:18.420
 And here's something else I'd like you to have, Mr.

00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:21.020
 Aldrich, a map of the city of Washington.

00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:22.660
 I rode away for it last week.

00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:23.580
 Thank you, Homer.

00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:24.980
 I've got it all marked, see?

00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:26.900
 You start at the White House the first day,

00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:29.540
 and follow the red line. Then the second day you started to...

00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:32.100
 Well, you really got this all planned out, haven't you?

00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:36.340
 I've sort of been fooling around with it all week. Here.

00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:38.340
 Oh, well.

00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:40.980
 Find voyage, Mr. Aldrich.

00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:42.340
 And...

00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:43.380
 Shane.

00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:44.220
 A Homer...

00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:45.540
 Shane, Mr. Aldrich.

00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:46.620
 Yes, Homer, Shane.

00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:47.620
 Shane.

00:24:47.620 --> 00:24:48.620
 Shane.

00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:49.620
 And Homer...

00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:50.420
 Yes, Mr. Aldrich.

00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:52.820
 Homer, all of us make mistakes sometimes in our lives,

00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:56.020
 and I'd like to say that this is one time I've made one.

00:24:56.020 --> 00:24:57.080
 You, Mr. Olmuth?

00:24:57.080 --> 00:25:01.860
 Yes, me, Homer. I know it's too late now, but I sincerely wish you were going with it.

00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:03.400
 You really want to take me?

00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:05.160
 Yes, if it weren't too late.

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:06.660
 Gee, why is it too late?

00:25:06.660 --> 00:25:09.800
 But why, you would have to go all the way home and pack it.

00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:13.200
 No, I wouldn't. I've got my suitcase checked right here in the station.

00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:15.100
 [laughter]

00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:15.600
 What?

00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:18.400
 Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:19.780
 Homer, what's the matter?

00:25:19.780 --> 00:25:20.300
 Homer.

00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:22.640
 Wait a year, wait a year, Henry.

00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:23.040
 Why?

00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:25.040
 Guess who's going to Washington?

00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:40.640
 [Music]

00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:43.200
 Sam, Sam are you up?

00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:44.300
 Mmm...

00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:47.000
 Sam wake up, we're coming into Pittsburgh.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.100
 Pittsburgh? How else we're going to Washington?

00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:53.340
 Yes dear, but this is where we change trains.

00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:55.340
 Oh, oh yes.

00:25:55.340 --> 00:25:57.340
 Is it four in the morning already?

00:25:57.340 --> 00:26:00.340
 Yes, the boys are getting our bags out to the platform.

00:26:00.340 --> 00:26:01.340
 Are you dressed?

00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:04.340
 I did none dress. Four in the morning.

00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:06.340
 Sam, I'm very proud of you.

00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:07.340
 Yes.

00:26:07.340 --> 00:26:12.340
 After all the pressure we put on you, you're really taking the whole thing very nicely.

00:26:12.340 --> 00:26:17.340
 Forget it, Alice. I had a feeling all along I was fighting a losing battle.

00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:22.340
 Now you don't worry. I'm sure Homer won't be any trouble at all.

00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:24.820
 Why so far you could hardly tell he's along.

00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:28.340
 You could hardly tell he's along, but he's been sleeping right above me.

00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:32.340
 Three times he went to the washroom.

00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:34.060
 For a glass of water.

00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:37.460
 Three times he managed to step on my face, getting down.

00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:41.220
 You're come quick!

00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:43.540
 Hand-ready, quiet! You wake up the whole car.

00:26:43.540 --> 00:26:45.780
 But it's Homer, mother. There's something wrong with him.

00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:46.660
 Oh, dear.

00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:50.660
 He's just sitting on his bags down there at the end of the car and he won't say a word.

00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:52.460
 Sam, do you suppose he's train sick?

00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:55.060
 With all the water he's been drinking, it's more like with sea sick.

00:26:55.060 --> 00:26:57.660
 We've got to go see what's wrong.

00:26:57.660 --> 00:27:01.460
 Homer?

00:27:01.460 --> 00:27:03.260
 Homer, dear, what's happened?

00:27:03.260 --> 00:27:05.860
 Jean, Mrs. Allrich, I feel terrible.

00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:07.460
 What is it, Homer, old-timer?

00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:09.060
 Your sinus again?

00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:10.060
 No.

00:27:10.060 --> 00:27:12.660
 You didn't try to finish that whole basket of fruit, did you?

00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:13.660
 It isn't that.

00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:14.660
 It's the wheels.

00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:15.660
 What wheels?

00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:16.660
 Of the train.

00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:17.660
 Listen to them.

00:27:17.660 --> 00:27:20.760
 Clickety-clack, clickety-clack, clickety-clack.

00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:21.860
 They make it dizzy?

00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:22.460
 No.

00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:27.660
 They just made me realize we're getting further and further away from Sanneville all the time.

00:27:27.660 --> 00:27:28.060
 What?

00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:30.060
 Further away from all my friends.

00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:30.860
 It's not home.

00:27:30.860 --> 00:27:33.260
 Further away from my mother and father.

00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:34.160
 Home.

00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:39.660
 Mr. Alberch, when we get off at Pittsburgh, can I get a train going back the other way?

00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:41.660
 Now, wait a minute!

00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:43.660
 (applause)

00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:58.620
 - Hi, Henry, hi, Homer.

00:27:58.620 --> 00:28:01.100
 - Well, Gee, it's Willie Marshall.

00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:02.980
 - Willie, what are you doing on this train?

00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:03.940
 - Going to Washington?

00:28:03.940 --> 00:28:05.380
 Are you fellas going to?

00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:07.100
 - Oh, boy.

00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:11.140
 - Boy, Henry, going to Washington with Willie tagging along

00:28:11.140 --> 00:28:15.020
 like having your mother-in-law and your honeymoon.

00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:20.820
 Well, here I come along with some good news about the wonderful new Jello Rice pudding.

00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:25.300
 Yes, Jello Rice pudding, newest member of the famous Jello pudding family.

00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:27.900
 The quickest, easiest rice pudding you ever made.

00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:31.540
 The richest, creamiest rice pudding you've ever dipped a spoon in.

00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:34.540
 All you do is add milk and boil gently for 10 minutes.

00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:39.020
 No fussy mixing, no bothersome custard, no cooking for hours on end.

00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:43.780
 You can have it baked or boiled, thick or thin, easy directions on every package.

00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:45.460
 So buy it, try it.

00:28:45.460 --> 00:28:47.120
 The 10-minute marvel.

00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:49.820
 Look for it on your grocer's dessert shelf.

00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:56.340
 Jello Rice Pudding, America's newest dessert miracle.

00:28:56.340 --> 00:29:01.060
 The Aldrich family starring as Ruston as Henry with Jackie Kalkas Homer is written by Norman

00:29:01.060 --> 00:29:04.020
 Tokar and Ed Juris with music by Jack Miller.

00:29:04.020 --> 00:29:07.460
 Mr. and Mrs. Aldrich are House Jamison and Katherine Roth.

00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:12.020
 And this is Dan Seymour in New York saying, "The Olridge Family is brought to you by the

00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:13.020
 Jell-O Family."

00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:18.020
 Oh, the Big Red Ladders stand for the Jell-O Family.

00:29:18.020 --> 00:29:22.180
 Oh, the Big Red Ladders stand for the Jell-O Family.

00:29:22.180 --> 00:29:23.180
 That's Jell-O.

00:29:23.180 --> 00:29:24.180
 Yum yum yum.

00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:26.180
 Jell-O Pudding's yum yum yum.

00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:29.180
 Jell-O Tuck the yoke up Pudding's Jess-O-R-E-E.

00:29:29.180 --> 00:29:39.180
 [Applause]

00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:43.180
 This is NBC, the National Broadcasting Company.

00:29:43.180 --> 00:29:45.760
 (bells ringing)

00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:48.340
 (gentle music)

00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:50.920
 (bell dings)
