2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,240
 The month of April may bring its showers, but a little rain has never yet

3
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:28,240
 dampened the spirits of a teenage boy.

4
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,240
 And that's the reason it's fun to know a youngster like Henry

5
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:37,240
 Aldrich, or you can't stay down when a real American boy is bouncing around.

6
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:41,240
 Now the scene opens at the Aldrich breakfast table.

7
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:45,240
 Oh boy, mother, oh boy, wouldn't you say unlucky mother?

8
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,240
 Yes, dear, but will you please eat your cereal?

9
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:50,240
 Sure, but a G and a war with girls in this town.

10
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,240
 I'm the one she's chosen.

11
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,240
 Henry, may I have the cream, please?

12
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,520
 - McReeem. - Mother, wouldn't you say I'm sitting pretty?

13
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,880
 - What's that? - What, I just got more read.

14
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,520
 It's an invitation for dinner at her house tonight.

15
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:06,480
 - That's fine. Pass the cream. - Henry, you haven't even started your cereal.

16
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,960
 Mother, I don't want to get this letter, must stop.

17
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,760
 She would take a look at the stationery she used.

18
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,200
 - Yes, dear. - Mother, would you like to take a look at it?

19
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,440
 - I would like to have you pass me the cream. - She was having a...

20
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:22,640
 - Oh, boy. - Oh, boy.

21
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,480
 What's the matter?

22
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,480
 I haven't smelled it before.

23
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,980
 (audience laughing)

24
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:29,020
 Oh, Sam, where are you going?

25
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:31,720
 I'm going to take a walk down here and get the cream.

26
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,620
 Father, why don't you let me pass it to you?

27
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:36,200
 You just sit there and keep on smelling that letter.

28
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,860
 Now, Sam, don't tell him to smell when I've asked him to eat.

29
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:41,800
 Hey, Henry, where are you?

30
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,860
 (audience laughing)

31
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:44,400
 Oh, where did you come from?

32
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,460
 My house, where do you think?

33
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:49,740
 She whizzing me how to get that smudge on your face.

34
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:50,580
 What smudge?

35
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:51,740
 April Fool.

36
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:53,140
 (laughing)

37
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:55,040
 - First, if this April's for all stay,

38
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,940
 how many of the things would have happened?

39
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:57,940
 - Why so it is?

40
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:59,140
 - Hey, Mr. Oldrich.

41
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:01,940
 - Did you know you had a flat tire out in front?

42
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:03,420
 - That's fine.

43
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,220
 - Don't you believe me?

44
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:06,220
 - Homer, come here a second.

45
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:07,460
 Do you want to smell something?

46
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,300
 - No.

47
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,140
 - Go ahead, smell it.

48
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:11,260
 - Henry, it can't fool me with a thing like that.

49
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:13,340
 I know it's got pepper on it.

50
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:14,260
 - On this?

51
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:16,380
 Look, it's a letter from Loretta Darlington.

52
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:17,860
 - Yeah, April Fool.

53
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:18,860
 - You're crazy.

54
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:21,620
 - Henry, I'm sorry, but you will have to use one hand

55
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:26,000
 eat with regardless of how wonderful that letter is yes mother

56
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,540
 what surprised me more than anything why well

57
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:33,740
 for three weeks now I've been trying to get up enough cards to ask her to go to

58
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:35,180
 the dance Saturday night

59
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:39,080

60
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,660

61
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:47,380

63
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,560
 Please pass the redder. I never mind just skipping.

64
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,760
 Oh, here Homer, pass my father to the shelter.

65
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,960
 I don't want the sugar.

66
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,360
 You want the cream, Mr. Olver?

67
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,760
 I've had the cream.

68
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,560
 Could it be the butter father?

69
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,160
 It could not. I've forgotten what it is.

70
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,360
 Henry, could I have that piece of toast there?

71
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,760
 Sure. Homer, give that to me.

72
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,760
 Oh, sure, Mr. Olver, it's here.

73
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,760
 Oh, Murph, you and Henry are both wanted on the telephone.

74
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,360
 Yes, somebody wants us.

75
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,760
 Oh, for this? Who was it?

76
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,360
 Oh, I know is. It's the main office at the school.

77
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,000
 Miss Shea wants to speak with one of you.

78
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,600
 - Miss Shea.

79
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,840
 - Oh boy, Homer.

80
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,840
 - Oh boy.

81
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,720
 - Henry, hurry, right back.

82
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,240
 - What could a meteor suppose?

83
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,960
 - Well frankly, it could be one of two things.

84
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,720
 Here, Henry, you take the receiver.

85
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,120
 - Oh, here, I can't, I've got my mouth full.

86
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,880
 - Yeah, I've not, you haven't got a thing in there.

87
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,360
 - I have two.

88
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,200
 Hello.

89
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,000
 - Hello, is this Henry Aldrich?

90
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,600
 - Well, no, not exactly.

91
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,120
 This is, this is Homer Brown.

92
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,540
 - Oh, well you do just as well.

93
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:50,140
 I will.

94
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:57,140
 Oh.

95
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,940
 You mean we're expelled.

96
00:03:58,940 --> 00:03:59,740
 What's that?

97
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:03,540
 You want you to help decorate the auditorium for the spring play.

98
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:05,340
 Oh boy, he does.

99
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:06,340
 Does want to.

100
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:09,140
 He also wanted me to ask you whether you have all your homework.

101
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:11,740
 Oh, yes, I've got it right here in my pocket.

102
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:14,640
 In fact, I've got it right here in my hand now.

103
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,340
 Well, you might just as well tear it up.

104
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,340
 tear it up okay

105
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:20,820

106
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:24,820

00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,860

00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:30,340

113
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,420
 tearing too

114
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:46,420
 I wonder where Rudd is invitation at dinner tonight.

115
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,420
 She wish you can still go, can't you?

116
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,420
 Sure, naturally, but...

117
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:52,420
 Homer, we've got to get even with her.

118
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:53,420
 That's what I say.

119
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:56,420
 I'm going to call her up and tell her Mr. Bradley.

120
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:58,420
 Homer, that won't be any good.

121
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:01,420
 I've got a better idea. I can see the whole thing just as clear as that.

122
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:03,420
 Well, what is it? What is it?

123
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:05,420
 You know all those contest Agnes is always entering.

124
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:06,420
 Yeah.

125
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:09,420
 When we get to school, we'll tell one of the fellas that tells her she won $100.

126
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:12,420
 Sure, Henry. Sure. Only let's make it $500.

127
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:14,420
 Sure, and where we started the rush?

128
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:16,420
 We'll tell everybody.

129
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:18,420
 We'll tell everybody in this school.

130
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:29,420
 Have you heard? Have you heard about Admuth's love?

131
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:31,420
 Really? You mean to say she won all that money?

132
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:33,420
 Sure, let's go ask her about it.

133
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:36,420
 - Have you heard about Admuth's love? - Yeah, and can you beat it? I sit next to her in English.

134
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:37,420
 Hey, what's this? I hear about Admuth's.

135
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,420
 - Did she really want to contest? - Sure, she sure did.

136
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:41,420
 A little bit more than that crowd. Let's go tell her.

137
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:43,820
 I could throw someone all that money or crazy.

138
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:44,520
 I am not.

139
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,620
 I know somebody that says she knows somebody that heard it on the radio last night.

140
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:48,520
 Did you hear it?

141
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,220
 No, but it's all over the school, though.

142
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,820
 I know where there she is over there.

143
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,520
 Agnes, oh Agnes.

144
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,520
 There you are.

145
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,320
 We want to tell you something.

146
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:59,520
 Agnes, did you know you won $1,000 in a contest?

147
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,420
 You're crazy.

148
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:03,020
 You did too ask anybody in school, Agnes.

149
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:03,620
 You're crazy.

150
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:05,620
 I won 2,500.

151
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:06,920
 You did.

152
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,820
 You did?

153
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:08,720
 Sure I did.

154
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,920
 Imagine.

155
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,600
 Who are you? What do you know about that?

156
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,160
 I can hardly believe it.

157
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:16,640
 Well, I did, Homer Brown, and don't try to make out it couldn't be possible.

158
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:20,600
 I know, Agnes, but $2,500?

159
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,240
 That much never occurred to me.

160
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,400
 Well, I did.

161
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,240
 And if you don't believe me, you can ask anybody here on the campus.

162
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,400
 Oh, Agnes, we're not trying to make you out of a liar only.

163
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,800
 What kind test was it?

164
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,040
 How should I know?

165
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,720
 I enter one every time I pick up a new magazine.

166
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,440
 Hello, Agnes. I came over to tell you how proud I am to know you.

167
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,440
 Yes, Agnes, you're really smart.

168
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,440
 You know what I think I'll do, fellas?

169
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:45,440
 I think I'll take the whole gang over to the soda fountain

170
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,440
 and treat them after school.

171
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,440
 You're really well?

172
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,440
 Sure.

173
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,440
 Homer, could you let me borrow a dollar

174
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,440
 until I get my prize?

175
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,440
 What's that?

176
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,440
 I'll tell you, Agnes, I've got to go,

177
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,440
 or I'll be late to class.

178
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,440
 Yes.

179
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,440
 Same here as the buy-edge.

180
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:01,440
 Agnes, are you sure the whole thing isn't an April fool joke?

181
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,440
 Listen, I don't think I know one of those when I see one.

182
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,440
 Didn't I tell you what I did to Henry?

183
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,440
 No.

184
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,040
 I wrote him a note masking to come to Loretta Darlingsons for dinner tonight.

185
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,840
 Really? Sure, I even signed Loretta's name to it.

186
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,440
 Boy, do I love April fool jokes!

187
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:29,240
 [MUSIC]

188
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,920
 You have some more potatoes, Sam?

189
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,160
 No, thank you, Alice.

190
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,840
 Henry, can I give you anything?

191
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,120
 Mmm, oh, thank you. I'll just sit here and watch you week.

192
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,840
 I'm sorry dear that we're having such a good dinner on the evening you're invited over to Loretta.

193
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,360
 Well that's alright mother, we'll probably have a swelled dinner over there too.

194
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,760
 Oh we did, I did horror and I played the darndest April Fool joke today.

195
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,600
 Oh yes, may I have the biscuits please?

196
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,400
 Here you are.

197
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,800
 It's the best April Fool joke ever for her.

198
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,240
 Henry are you quite sure you shouldn't be starting for Loretta?

199
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,840
 Mother I've got loads of time.

200
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,880
 Look here's part of her invitation right here she says,

201
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,360
 we won't be eating tonight until 830.

202
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,960
 Be sure to come good and hungry.

203
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,200
 Well.

204
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,960
 Henry, will you please answer that?

205
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,560
 They will you are Henry, all answered.

206
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,720
 I'm expecting a call.

207
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,480
 Mother, what are you and father having for the dirt?

208
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,320
 Hello, this is Sam Otter speaking.

209
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,240
 Mr. Otter, just Mr. Lawson.

210
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:19,800
 Who?

211
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,520
 I think it's Lawson's father.

212
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,240
 Oh, yes, yes.

213
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:22,920
 Hello.

214
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,480
 Say, yes, Sam, I don't know if you heard about her or not,

215
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:28,480
 but the Lawson family seems to have struck oil.

216
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,120
 What's that?

217
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,320
 You mean you haven't heard about it?

218
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,600
 No, not a word.

219
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,800
 Well, don't you listen to the radio?

220
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,200
 No, not if I can help it.

221
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,800
 Well, Sam, I don't know why we weren't listening last night or so.

222
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,700
 The wind is dead, Agnes won the grand prize.

223
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:45,700
 - You don't say so. - Now, Sam won't ask your advice about something.

224
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:51,700
 Agnes says she's been reading the rules and she's under the impression that the winner must appear in New York for the check.

225
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,700
 Yes, that sounds reasonable.

226
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,500
 - That's exactly what I was thinking.

227
00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:01,500
 Only Agnes can't possibly make a trip to New York by herself, and Mrs. Wilson, I can't get away.

228
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,300
 And what I was wondering was,

229
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:06,800
 uh, can you glupland represent us with a power of attorney?

230
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,900
 Why, when would I have to leave?

231
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:09,900
 Tomorrow.

232
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,900
 We've set a telegram for instructions,

233
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:15,100
 and I imagine they'll say they want us to come right onto the door.

234
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,100
 Tomorrow, the only thing is...

235
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,900
 You're glad to pay your expenses, Sam,

236
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:21,200
 and make it right with you and the burgundy?

237
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,100
 Why, you pay my expenses, and that's all I ask for.

238
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,700
 Any young lady that's smart enough to go out and win a contest

239
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,300
 deserves everything she can get out of it.

240
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,000
 Can you move?

241
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,400
 I think I gotta arrange things.

242
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,600
 As a matter of fact, I'd like a trip to New York.

243
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,680
 That's fine. Fine. Now I won't have to worry.

244
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,520
 No, don't you worry about a thing.

245
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,720
 No, just one more thing before you hang up.

246
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:45,600
 If you don't mind keeping this confidential because we heard it was 2,500.

247
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,320
 And practice feels it's 35.

248
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,080
 And then we've heard from another source that it might be even more.

249
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,480
 Oh, you don't say so.

250
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:59,520
 And naturally, until we know just how we really do stand, we don't want to go around talking too much.

251
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,520
 I see your poise.

252
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,920
 You're getting cold.

253
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,120
 I've got something to tell her you won't believe.

254
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,120
 - What's the matter? - It's the loss that just fo' me.

255
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,520
 - Yeah. - And it looks as though I'll have to leave for New York tomorrow.

256
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:12,120
 - On this short notice, Sam. - I'm gonna arrange it, I think.

257
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,320
 - How do you want me to tell you what I was going to?

258
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,720
 - No, Henry, not now.

259
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,320
 But Mother was the best April Fool joke you ever heard of.

260
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,920
 - Henry, will you please go back into the dining room while I finish telling your mother something?

261
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,720
 - But Father, I'm not eating any dinner.

262
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,720
 - All right, go in there and look at mine.

263
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:28,320
 - And any rate, get out of here. - Yes, Father, I'll go.

264
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,320
 Only I thought you'd like to know about the joke over an eye.

265
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,020
 As though an ape of food joke were important at a time like this.

266
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:36,320
 Alice, you won't believe it, but here's what happened.

267
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:54,020
 Well, sir, I may have seen bigger stakes than juicier stakes, but I don't remember where.

268
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:56,020
 And we can all thank Agnes for having you.

269
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,020
 Thank you, Mother.

270
00:10:57,020 --> 00:11:00,220
 Did you really use up all the operations coupons to get this dinner?

271
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,260
 Yes, dear.

272
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,740
 Ed, you aren't cutting those slices a little bit thick, are you?

273
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:07,580
 Gertrude, are you forgetting what has happened to the Lawson family?

274
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:10,060
 Why don't we have any bigger plates in these?

275
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:11,740
 Oh, Ed, I'm glad you brought that up.

276
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:14,620
 I'm going downtown to my own by a whole new dinner set.

277
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:17,260
 Oh, Gertrude, we don't need to spend any money on dishes.

278
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,820
 Besides, I've got that money all planned out for Agnes.

279
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:20,780
 You have, Father?

280
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:24,540
 First thing I'm going to do is see whether I can get a priority to get a new car.

281
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:25,180
 For me?

282
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:28,180
 I guess you aren't old enough to drive a car, you know, you're not.

283
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,880
 Here, pass the stake to your mother.

284
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,280
 Yeah, but I don't care for any. I can't eat a thing.

285
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,380
 - What's the matter with you? - Not a thing.

286
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:37,180
 Only if I can't get a new dinner set out of this, why?

287
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:39,980
 All right, go ahead and get a dinner set.

288
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:41,980
 And Father, do you know what I want to get?

289
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:44,580
 First of all, a new evening dress.

290
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:48,080
 - I know what? - Without any shoulders, boy.

291
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:51,180
 Agnes, do you realize that I haven't finished telling your father

292
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:52,480
 but I'm going to do more?

293
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,680
 Well, folks, I've got that all attended too.

294
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,880
 You're interrupting your mother.

295
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:59,240
 Oh, excuse me, but I just wanted to tell you I resigned my job.

296
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,360
 You resigned, Ralph?

297
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,440
 Sure, I gave up my job Saturday night at the Havens drugstore.

298
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,640
 And my money?

299
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,520
 Well, you're my sister, aren't you?

300
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,560
 I'm gonna ask somebody to go to the dance Saturday night.

301
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,360
 How are you gonna pay for the tickets?

302
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,920
 Listen, Agnes, don't be so selfish.

303
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:21,880
 - Hey, Ren. - Yes, Bob?

304
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,000
 I thought you were coming down here

305
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,200
 so I could have a talk with you.

306
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,840
 Just one more minute, Father.

307
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,280
 What's the matter with the boy?

308
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,280
 Sammy's upstairs changing his tie.

309
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,880
 Again? That's the third time he's changed it this evening.

310
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:35,200
 Dear, he's going over to Loretta Dallington in just a few minutes.

311
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,360
 Yes, Father, is there something you want us?

312
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:37,960
 There is.

313
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:41,920
 Henry, your father's just been talking with me and he has a grand idea.

314
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,520
 He has? Yes, dear, and I'm going to let him tell you about it.

315
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,440
 Yes, Father.

316
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:50,440
 Henry, it's been a long time since you and I have done anything together, hasn't it?

317
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:53,440
 Well, we had a milkshake together last week.

318
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:58,440
 Yes, but Henry, how would you like to make a trip to New York with me?

319
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,440
 To New York, Father?

320
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:04,440
 Yes, you and I get on the train tomorrow and we'll go on a real binge for the weekend.

321
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,440
 To New York?

322
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,440
 But how about my school tomorrow afternoon?

323
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,440
 I can get you out of it, I think.

324
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,440
 Oh boy, oh boy, and you're asking me whether I want to go?

325
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,440
 I thought you'd like it.

326
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,440
 Oh, wait, how about the rent? I asked her to go to the desk.

327
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,440
 How do you know?

328
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,440
 I don't think she'd want to stand in the way of your going to New York, would she?

329
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:25,440
 She was after all. She's having me for dinner tonight. So that will make it as though I weren't going to see her at all.

330
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,440
 Yes, Mother.

331
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,440
 Home is on the phone.

332
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,440
 He is?

333
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:33,440
 Father, will you excuse me while I speak to him, please? And thank you very much for telling me.

334
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,440
 Hello?

335
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,440
 Hey, Henry, when do you hear what happened to me?

336
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,440
 Do you or when do you hear about me?

337
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:41,440
 Henry, I got a job at the Havens Drugstore for Saturday night.

338
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,440
 You did?

339
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,440
 Sure, the guy that was working there just quit on the moon.

340
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,440
 What?

341
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,440
 Or where do you hear what happened to me?

342
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,440
 Why?

343
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,440
 I tell you my father and I are going in the yard.

344
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,440
 You are?

345
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,440
 Yeah, we're going on a blowout.

346
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,440
 Do you know how high the Empire State Building is?

347
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,440
 Sure, 75 stories.

348
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,440
 You're crazy, more 75 stories.

349
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,440
 It's around 250.

350
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,440
 And I'm going all the way to the top.

351
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:09,440
 Sure, you may not couple of guys at the bank of the top.

352
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,440
 But, but, are you ever eating an automatic restaurant?

353
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:16,440
 All you do is put in a nickel and boy things come right out at you.

354
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:21,500
 Your father wants to speak to you. He does mother poor goodbye and I send you post call

355
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:27,940
 Yes, father

356
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:30,340
 Henry I've got to make the Pullman reservations right away

357
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:34,280
 Are you quite sure it'll be all right for you to break your date with this Loretta of what's her name?

358
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:39,600
 Sure father. She won't mind standing staying home. She's a very good sport. You're quite sure sure

359
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,280
 Hello

360
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,400
 Elle 991

361
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,780
 Yes, please gee father did Homer turn green when I told him about New York City

362
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:53,220
 Boy poor kid back here in center real whether

363
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:58,520
 Didn't you recognize my voice this is angry?

364
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:06,500
 Yes, I'm sorry to bother you right this minute Loretta, but my father just asked me to go up in the Empire State Building with them

365
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,060
 We're going in the York

366
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:15,380
 Yes tomorrow and and I was just wondering whether it would be alright if I couldn't take it in a dance out of me now

367
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:21,420
 Well Henry is a matter of fact it works out fine because somebody just told me a few minutes ago and asked me to go with him

368
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,420
 Oh somebody did

369
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:29,140
 A friend of mine is just coming into a lot of money. Oh, I hope you have a nice time in New York Henry

370
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:32,080
 Thanks Loretta, and I'll be over in just a couple of minutes

371
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:32,900
 What's that?

372
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,900
 Boy in a my star. Goodbye

373
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:59,900
 [Music]

374
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:04,400
 Agnes Lawson, the son of April Fool, led her to Henry, inviting him to dinner tonight

375
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,320
 at Loretta Darlington's.

376
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,320
 Henry and Homer, in order to keep April Fool's Day

377
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,800
 from being a total loss, have led Agnes

378
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:15,400
 to believe that she's the winner of a radio contest.

379
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,360
 The scene opens in Loretta Darlington's home.

380
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:21,360
 The time is around 9.15.

381
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,200
 - Mark.

382
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:26,200
 - Oh, Mrs. Darlington, yes, Henry.

383
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,040
 Nothing.

384
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,600
 I'm sorry Loretta isn't here right this minute, Henry.

385
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,080
 She said she was going to step out,

386
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,960
 and she told me where she was going,

387
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,360
 but I didn't pay any attention.

388
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,460
 Well, that's alright, Mr. Tarleton, that's alright.

389
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:38,060
 I've just just so set here.

390
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:42,400
 If you have any work to do in the kitchen,

391
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,000
 you go right ahead with it.

392
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,780
 You're not keeping me from one thing, Henry.

393
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:47,680
 I'm not.

394
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,140
 Won't you have another piece of candy?

395
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:50,600
 I don't mind if I do.

396
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,240
 Just a moment while I take this next layer of paper out,

397
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,480
 I didn't realize we'd eaten practically half a buck.

398
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,880
 It's very good candy.

399
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,120
 Is it your favorite kind?

400
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:02,080
 I like any kind and you don't have to worry it.

401
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,000
 Never spoil my appetite.

402
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,800
 Good. Tell me, did you have any April Fool jokes played on you today?

403
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:12,740
 No, I got by this year of what you might call a clean slate.

404
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:16,180
 My goodness. Did I tell you what Agnes did to Loretta?

405
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:21,240
 No ma'am. Mrs. Darlington, Loretta went out that she say about how long she'd be gone.

406
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,920
 No, I don't think she did.

407
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:26,560
 Well, where's Mr. Darlington? I haven't seen him since I got here.

408
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,980
 He went to a lodge meeting.

409
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:30,720
 Oh, he did? Is he having dinner there?

410
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,160
 Oh, my. No, he grabbed a bite before he left.

411
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,160
 Oh.

412
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,160
 Too bad he couldn't wait.

413
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:42,160
 Well, as I started to tell you, Henry, Agnes Lawson has played more jokes today.

414
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,160
 Do you know what she did this morning?

415
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,160
 What?

416
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:51,160
 She didn't say one word to Loretta about it, but she wrote a note to Loretta's father and asked him whether she could have a dollar and sign Loretta's name.

417
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:54,160
 And Mr. Darlington never knew the difference and gave Loretta a dollar.

418
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,160
 He did.

419
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,160
 Yes.

420
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,160
 And Agnes not only made her handwriting look exactly like Loretta's,

421
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:03,500
 But where she ever got Loretta's scented stationary, I never will know.

422
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,500
 Oh.

423
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,500
 Oh.

424
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,500
 Agnes did that?

425
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,500
 Yes.

426
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:11,100
 Wasn't that a good one?

427
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,100
 Oh.

428
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:15,100
 Mrs. Darlington, would you tell me something frankly?

429
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,100
 Yes.

430
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:19,180
 About how many meals have you had here so far today?

431
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:20,180
 Why three?

432
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:22,180
 Why do you ask?

433
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:23,180
 Oh.

434
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:24,180
 Oh.

435
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,180
 Well, oh.

436
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:29,180
 Oh, so Agnes did a thing like that to Loretta.

437
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:30,180
 My there.

438
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:31,180
 Loretta, come in here.

439
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:34,180
 Mother, who's had it out there in the hall?

440
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:36,180
 Oh, hello, Henry.

441
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:40,180
 Oh, my goodness, I've been over to the Lawson's and more things have happened to them.

442
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:41,180
 What, for instance?

443
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:44,180
 They're so rich, Mother, they're practically rolling in money.

444
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:50,180
 Mrs. Lawson put in a long distance call all the way to San Francisco just to tell all Mrs. Lawson about it.

445
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:52,180
 About what? The $3,500 they want.

446
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:53,180
 Haven't you heard, Henry?

447
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:54,020
 - You heard Henry?

448
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:54,900
 - I read her, Agniston,

449
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:55,780
 - She didn't want any money.

450
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:57,340
 - Why Henry, she did too.

451
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:58,740
 - She was, she couldn't have the whole thing

452
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,140
 with an April 4th show.

453
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,660
 - Why Henry, it couldn't have been.

454
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:03,380
 - What I'm telling you, home of mine,

455
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,740
 we made the whole thing up.

456
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:06,020
 - If you ask me, Henry,

457
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:08,020
 all of which I don't like your attitude.

458
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:09,900
 - Well, I know right, I'll show you.

459
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:10,940
 - As a matter of fact,

460
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:12,860
 Henry, if you're going to contradict me like that,

461
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,900
 I'm glad I'm not going to the dance with you.

462
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,060
 - And as a matter of fact,

463
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:18,380
 I'm glad I'm going to San Francisco.

464
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:19,220
 - In New York.

465
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:20,060
 - Good bye.

466
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:22,260
 - Henry, all of which I think you're insane.

467
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:24,260
 What do you mean by a statement like that?

468
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:29,260
 When Mr. Lawson told me himself that your own father is going to New York to collect the money for Agnes.

469
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:32,260
 My father? Yes, your father.

470
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:34,260
 That's why he's going there.

471
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:38,260
 And I...that was some more, Rhett. She whiz.

472
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:53,160
 But Agnes, you didn't, you couldn't possibly have.

473
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:56,620
 Henry, I suppose you think I don't know an April Fool's joke when I see one.

474
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:58,820
 But I'm not kidding you, you didn't want it.

475
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:01,260
 Wait a second, Henry. Let me explain it to her.

476
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:04,600
 Agnes, Henry and I just made the whole thing up.

477
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:08,800
 By Homer Brown, and I suppose you made up the fact that I entered that contest.

478
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,700
 You may have entered it, but you didn't want it.

479
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:13,900
 Now, Henry, for the last time, I'm not going to be April Fool.

480
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:17,040
 You're just trying to get back at me for writing that letter to you from Loretta.

481
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:17,940
 What letter, Henry?

482
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:20,940
 Never mind Homer, let's just take one thing at a time.

483
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:21,940
 (audience laughs)

484
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:22,940
 Now listen Agnes.

485
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:25,940
 I'm not gonna listen to one thing you say of all of Just Peep.

486
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:26,940
 What Agnes?

487
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:28,940
 What's all this known as in here?

488
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:30,940
 Oh, she was who almost did what was in here?

489
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:31,940
 That's the trouble.

490
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:34,940
 Mr. Lawson, there's something we feel we ought to tell you.

491
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:35,940
 Well...

492
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,940
 Agnes thinks she won a lot of money, see?

493
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:38,940
 Yes.

494
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,940
 And she won't believe she didn't.

495
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,940
 Oh, why shouldn't she believe it?

496
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:44,940
 Mr. Lawson, I guess you didn't understand.

497
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:46,940
 Mrs. April, follow us, eh, see?

498
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:50,940
 I know, but I don't think you boys ought to try to pull a joke like this one.

499
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:51,940
 What's that?

500
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:59,940
 Pretty serious thing boys, when you deliberately tell somebody they didn't win a prize like $3,500 when it's common knowledge that they did.

501
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:01,940
 But she couldn't have an empty microphone.

502
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:04,940
 I won't tell your father about this, Henry, but you better be running along.

503
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:09,940
 Agnes has had a pretty big day, and for that matter, this whole family has. We're in no mood for jokes.

504
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:11,940
 You mean you don't believe us either?

505
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:15,940
 You boys, just forget it's April Fool's Day, and go home and get your schoolwork done.

506
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:16,940
 Mr. Lawson!

507
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:18,140
 I'll run along.

508
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:19,540
 Good night.

509
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:21,740
 She was at the fine thing.

510
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:24,840
 Henry, did we make this whole thing up?

511
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,940
 What did Agnes really win that prize?

512
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:29,640
 Listen, Horr, we've got to do something about this.

513
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,640

 [MUSIC PLAYING]

515
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:44,340
 Hello?

516
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:45,940
 Mr. Lawson speaking.

517
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:48,100
 Oh, this is a telegram office.

518
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:48,900
 Yes?

519
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,580
 I got a telegram here for you.

520
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:53,260
 Oh, yes, yes. Is it from New York?

521
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:55,980
 Well, it has New York written at the top.

522
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:58,060
 There's something about it I want to explain to you,

523
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,980
 but I think I better read it to you first.

524
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:00,940
 All right.

525
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:07,460
 It says this is to inform you that Agnes Lawson did not win $3,500

526
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:08,940
 because she couldn't have.

527
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:11,660
 You want the victim of an April Fool joke.

528
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:13,300
 Oh.

529
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,500
 Oh, uh, they say anything else?

530
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,500
 Nope, that's all.

531
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,700
 Oh.

532
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:23,100
 And I think out of Tilly, Mr. Lawson, that telegram didn't really come over the wires.

533
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:28,700
 Henry Aldrich and Homer Brown dropped in here a few minutes ago and told me to phone it to you.

534
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:31,300
 Oh, you don't say so!

535
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:34,800
 Henry Aldrich and Homer Brown, eh?

536
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:46,600
 Henry, do you realize what a serious thing this is that you and Homer have done?

537
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,600
 Sending a telegram that wasn't even real.

538
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:52,600
 But Father, don't you boys like Agnes? I always suppose she was a pretty nice girl.

539
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,600
 She is, Mr. Aldrich, but she has in any sense of humor.

540
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,600
 That's the point. You think a thing like this is funny?

541
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,600
 No, Father, not me more. We don't.

542
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:05,600
 Do you think any family and their right mind would go ahead and make all the plans they have if they hadn't won the money?

543
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,600
 I'd have a good mind not to take you to New York.

544
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,600
 But Father, that's the point, don't you understand?

545
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,600
 Henry, for the last time, that's not full about this anymore.

546
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,600
 I've changed our plans and we're going tonight.

547
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,600
 My bag is right here and it's all packed.

548
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,600
 - What's wrong? - If you want to go with me,

549
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,600
 you have 10 minutes and wish to pack your thing.

550
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,600
 - You mean you're going now? - I ought to be on the way to the station right this minute.

551
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,600
 What's funny, you can't take that train.

552
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:28,600
 Even if you cut off my allowance for the next six months, you've got to listen to me.

553
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,040
 Well, you have another hamburger, Homer.

554
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,040
 Thanks.

555
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,040
 I don't mind if I do.

556
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,640
 Boy, am I hungry.

557
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,480
 Could I have the cats, please?

558
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,480
 Here.

559
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:54,120
 These hamburgers are best at rating my life, Henry.

560
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,920
 I'm glad you like the magnet.

561
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:59,320
 Would you like to have me put another nickel on the jukebox?

562
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,320
 Yes, I'd be swamped.

563
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:06,160
 Agnes, is your brother Ralph going back to work in the Havens drug store this Saturday

564
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,160
 night?

565
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,160
 Or is he gonna wait a week?

566
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,160
 No, he's going right back.

567
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:11,160
 Boy, is he mad at me?

568
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,160
 Why is he mad at you?

569
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:16,160
 I don't know. Nobody in my family speaking to me.

570
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,160
 It's the way it is in my family.

571
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:21,160
 Well, it doesn't matter if I...

572
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:24,160
 And you know, maybe it's just as well I didn't get it.

573
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,160
 Didn't get what?

574
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,160
 My evening dress without shoulders.

575
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,160
 I guess I'm just not the type.

576
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:33,160
 Boy, has this been a day?

577
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,160
 I'll say it has.

578
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,160
 Same here.

579
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,160
 Henry, you spilled some ketchup on your tie.

580
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,160
 - He was weird. - April Fool.

581
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:43,160
 Now it's an magnet. It's 12 o'clock, Henry, and you can't get back at me.

582
00:24:43,160 --> 00:25:02,160
 Listen again next week, same time, same station,

583
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:05,160
 for another sparkling half hour with your favorite youngster,

584
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:10,720
 his family and his pals. The old rich family starring Ezra Stone is written by

585
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,780
