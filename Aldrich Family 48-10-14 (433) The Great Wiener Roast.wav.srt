 - Charlie, have the kids got everything straight?

00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,200
 - Sure I guess so.

00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,880
 - You're all to go to Mac oracle's Rocks on your bike.

27
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,720

00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,120
 - And nobody's to light the fire until I get there.

 - Okay.

30
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:49,800
 - Okay.

31
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,640
 - Why?

32
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,460
 - Why, why?

33
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:52,840
 - Why do we have to wait till you get there?

34
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,440
 Because Charlie, because I'm organizing the whole thing.

35
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:56,940
 Oh.

36
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:57,840
 Sure.

37
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,640
 Why?

38
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,540
 Why?

39
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:00,340
 Why?

40
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:02,540
 She was so nothing will go wrong.

41
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:05,540
 Henry, did you say $2 worth or $3 worth?

42
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:07,340
 $3, Mr. Prichard?

43
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:07,840
 OK.

44
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,740
 Extra fresh.

45
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:11,040
 Now listen, Charlie.

46
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:14,040
 Charlie, Charlie, where'd you go to?

47
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:14,640
 She was.

48
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:22,100
 Mr. Prichard, are you taking those weiners out

49
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,100
 of the showcase?

50
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,100
 Sure.

51
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:26,860
 But didn't you order special ones just for me?

52
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:27,860
 Why?

53
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:28,860
 Sure, Henry.

54
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:34,860
 I've just been saving them just for you right here in the corner of the showcase.

55
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,100
 Oh, oh well that's good.

56
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,620
 Boy have I got a headache.

57
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:40,620
 Oh that's too bad.

58
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:44,820
 I don't know why I let myself get talked into managing these things.

59
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:45,820
 Excuse me.

60
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:48,660
 Do you mind if I just watch you weigh those weiners?

61
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:49,660
 Hey, I'll look Henry.

62
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:50,660
 Just keep away from these scales.

63
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:55,280
 I'd be glad to only I have to look after all the little details such as

64
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,680
 Well such as such is what well mr.. Pritchard

65
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,500
 I don't suppose your thumbs actually resting on the scales

66
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:09,940
 Just looks like it. Look I'll throw into extra winners if you'll get down off my counter sure

67
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:13,220
 See, thanks very much. You want me to leave the winners in this here box?

68
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:18,320
 Yes, please and would you put some heavy brown paper on it and lots of string all right?

69
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,320
 I don't want anything to go wrong

70
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:23,480
 You got everything straight Homer

71
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:29,400
 If that's what you mean did they check it from top to bottom they put air in the tires

72
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:35,020
 What else can you do with a bike? It's gonna be in perfect running order Homer. I told you that I've got a big

73
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:39,740
 Responsibility listen Henry who asked you to be responsible anyway

74
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:44,520
 What do you mean by that just because the kids gave you the money for the winners?

75
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:48,520
 That doesn't mean you had to talk everybody into pedaling way out into the country.

76
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,520
 What's wrong with that?

77
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,520
 She whiz its work.

78
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,520
 But think of the appetite it'll give you.

79
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,520
 Henry, I don't need anything to give me an appetite.

80
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:01,520
 Why can't we have the leaner roast in your backyard the way you said in the first place?

81
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:07,520
 Homer, when I invited the kids to my backyard, how was I to know my father had just planted grass seed

82
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,520
 and was going to be unreasonable about it?

83
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,520
 What's the matter with your friend, Lord?

84
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,520
 Homer, listen.

85
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:19,520
 Why sit on an uncomfortable lawn when you can sit in solid comfort on McCorkle's rocks?

86
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:22,520
 Here Henry, here's your weeners, that'll be $3.

87
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,520
 Sure, I've got it right here.

88
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,520
 Right?

89
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,520
 Henry, what's the matter?

90
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,520
 Oh boy.

91
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,520
 Why are you turning all your pockets inside out?

92
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,520
 Oh boy, Homer, Homer, have you got any money?

93
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:37,520
 What do you mean if I got any money? Where's our $3?

94
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,520
 I had it, I had it, I had it in this pocket here.

95
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,520
 That one with the hole in it?

96
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:46,160
 all folded up. Oh boy. Mr. Prichard, what are you doing?

97
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,600
 Why are you blind Henry? He's unwrapping the wieners.

98
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,560
 No, wait a minute, Mr. Prichard. Wait a minute. Homer, I want you to go all the way back to

99
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:59,040
 my house on your hands and knees. Now listen Henry. Hey, hey, wait a minute.

100
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:05,520
 Why are you taking your shoe off? Look. Here's the three dollars in my sock.

101
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,680
 Why? And it's still all folded up. Well, I'll be done.

102
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,960
 Mr. Prichard, would you mind wrapping those weiners up again?

103
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,320
 Alright.

104
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,240
 Boy, Homer isn't this my lucky day.

105
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,160
 I'll say.

106
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,880
 Let's get going. Where'd you put my bike?

107
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,480
 Uh, right out there at the curb. Behind that truck.

108
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,240
 You mean the one that's...

109
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,080
 Whom are the trucks backing up?

110
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:25,920
 Hey!

111
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,040
 Well, Gee, where's my bike?

112
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,920
 Hey, Mr. Look out!

113
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:33,280
 Hey, cut it out!

114
00:05:33,280 --> 00:06:02,680
 *Singing* Hello? Hello? Is that you, Charlie? Sure, who's this? It's Henry! Hi, you Charlie, old kid, how's a kid? One kid. Look, Charlie, you know what I've been doing? I've been thinking. You have, Henry again? What do you mean by a statement like that?

115
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:06,280
 Why you did some thinking yesterday, Henry and all I did was get confused.

116
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,920
 What's confusing about it, Charlie?

117
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:13,080
 Instead of sitting around and being bored in my backyard, we're having a

118
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:16,600
 swell wiener roast in the open air at Macorkle's Rocks.

119
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,180
 What's so confusing about that?

120
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,360
 Nothing, I guess.

121
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,600
 Except you keep changing your mind all the time.

122
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,680
 No, I don't.

123
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,800
 Okay. We're all going out to Macorkle's Rocks on our bikes. That's fine.

124
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:31,680
 Well, look, Charlie, and that's what I've been thinking about.

125
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,240
 We're just letting ourselves in for a lot of trouble going on bikes.

126
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,680
 We are, why?

127
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,000
 Well, for one thing, they're tearing up a piece of the road out there.

128
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,520
 And boy, there are ruts all over the place.

129
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,520
 Yeah.

130
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,280
 Sure, and detours.

131
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:52,040
 And, um, and, uh, it's a regular booby trap, Charlie.

132
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,040
 She wish.

133
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:57,960
 So look, why don't we get all the kids to get their father's cars and drive out there

134
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:58,960
 in solid comfort.

135
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,960
 You all those ruts?

136
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,720
 Charlie look you go through a run on a bike and you're up a tree

137
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,300
 But you go through a rut in the car and where are you?

138
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,300
 Where she was in a rut?

139
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:17,000
 That's a beautiful part Charlie you stay there. That's true. So do you think you can swing it from bikes to cars?

140
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:25,440
 Okay, you do that

141
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,920
 It's practically in the bag so long

142
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,920
 Father

143
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,920
 Father, are you upstairs?

144
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,420
 I'm in my room, Henry.

145
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,420
 You are?

146
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:37,420
 Can I help you with anything?

147
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:39,920
 As a matter of fact, I'm fighting for something.

148
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,520
 Oh, I'll help you hunt, Father.

149
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,920
 I'll start on this door here.

150
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,420
 What are we looking for?

151
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:45,420
 Never mind, Henry.

152
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:46,420
 What is it you want?

153
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:53,220
 Well, now that you mention it, Father, we've always been pretty good pals, haven't we?

154
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,220
 I think so, son.

155
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:55,220
 Sure.

156
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:57,020
 That's what I'm always telling the kids.

157
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:00,920
 Boy, I say, is my father a reasonable sort of guy.

158
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,220
 He has his full chore, but don't we all?

159
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:05,920
 The main thing is, he's generous.

160
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,420
 Who is?

161
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:07,620
 You are, Father.

162
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,520
 And boy, I think of a person as generous

163
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,320
 than the rest can just go out the window.

164
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,820
 Would you like a wiener, Father?

165
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,220
 You throwing them out the window?

166
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:19,320
 No, no, Gee, was I'm just not letting them out of my sight.

167
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,920
 Father, I'll get right to the point.

168
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,920
 I'm glad to hear it.

169
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:26,920
 I'll ask you straight from the shoulder.

170
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,540
 You know your car?

171
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:31,720
 Pretty well. I've been on intimate terms with it for 10 years.

172
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,040
 Well sure, that's my point.

173
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:34,940
 What is?

174
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:41,520
 Father, you remember the other night you said you didn't feel you should get a new car until this one was worn out?

175
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,320
 Yes, I believe I said that.

176
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:47,480
 Well, don't you agree that the only way to wear it out is to use it?

177
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,640
 I do use it.

178
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,920
 Sure, Father, but I don't.

179
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,920
 Henry, I don't want it worn out that quickly.

180
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:58,800
 Father father if you just lend it to me tonight, I give you my word. You'll never know it had been in a rush

181
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:04,320
 What's that I mean? Well, it's a matter of life and death father and all the other kids are getting cars

182
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:09,680
 I think and if you want to borrow my car this evening, why don't you come right out and ask for it?

183
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,240
 You mean I can have it?

184
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:18,380
 If you can show me a good reason why you need it. Oh, I can father. I can dig up as many reasons as you want

185
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:21,160
 Yes, mother

186
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:25,500
 Oh boy, that'll be Charlie. I'll be right back father with my reasons.

187
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,960
 Head rest slow down.

188
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,380
 My goodness Sam, what's the matter with head mate?

189
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:35,540
 Well that's pretty involved subject Alice. Right now I'm trying to find my maroon tie.

190
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:40,780
 What maroon tie Sam? My favorite Alice, the one I wear all the time. I've been hunting high and low for it all week.

191
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:44,260
 Now there you don't want that tie. It was one practic but a shred.

192
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,480
 Alice, why do you say that?

193
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,520
 And dear let's talk about it some other time. I have to go down and start dinner.

194
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:51,520
 Alice, what happened to my maroon tire?

195
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,520
 Very well, Sam.

196
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,520
 To be perfectly frank, Henry borrowed it.

197
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,520
 What?

198
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:00,520
 Now, there before you lose your temper, try to think of all the nice things he does.

199
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,520
 Henry!

200
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:04,520
 Sam, there's no use asking him for it.

201
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,520
 Why not?

202
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:09,520
 Well, as I said, it was pretty well worn, and...

203
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:12,520
 Well, you see, Henry was patting this horse.

204
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,520
 What?

205
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,520
 And you know those little white squares on the tire?

206
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:18,320
 you have to admit they do look like lumps of sugar.

207
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:24,020
 Alice, do you mean some strange horse ate my tie?

208
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:25,920
 Oh no, Sam.

209
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,920
 No.

210
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,120
 It was Gus's horse, Sheila.

211
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,120
 You know Sheila.

212
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:34,120
 Alice, that's the third thing Henry has borrowed and not returned this week.

213
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,120
 Henry isn't the only one there.

214
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:40,320
 There's that book you borrowed over a year ago called History of the Roman Empire.

215
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,320
 Alice, that's different.

216
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,720
 I don't remember who I borrowed it from.

217
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,720
 Have you made much of an effort to find out?

218
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,720
 Alice, I never heard of anyone called Aunt Tilly.

219
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,720
 And that's the only name in the book.

220
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,720
 Henry, where are you?

221
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,720
 And how do you try not to get angry?

222
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,720
 I'm just going to teach Henry a lesson.

223
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,720
 You have Charlie, you have your father old soda, well so am I.

224
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,720
 Henry, please put down that receiver.

225
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,720
 Sure, Father. So long, Charlie.

226
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,720
 And keep working on the rest of the kids.

227
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,720
 Henry, about my car.

228
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,720
 Sure, Father. Here are my reasons.

229
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,720
 You can forget the whole thing.

230
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,720
 Forget it.

231
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,880
 Father, you mean? You mean I can't have?

232
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,720
 I do.

233
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,360
 But you haven't heard my reason.

234
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,420
 Just sit down, son. I'll tell you a few of my reasons.

235
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:32,600
 [Music]

236
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,340
 Hello.

237
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:35,480
 Hi, all-time-er. Our trip.

238
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,440
 Is that you, him?

239
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:36,940
 Sure.

240
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:38,240
 I was just gonna phone you.

241
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,940
 My father finally fought over his car.

242
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:41,940
 We're all set.

243
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:42,940
 We are?

244
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:47,940
 Well, look, I've been thinking, and did I come up with a swell idea?

245
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:48,940
 Yeah.

246
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:50,940
 Sure, it's so good I don't know why I didn't think of it before.

247
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:55,940
 Look, why don't we all chip in and take a couple of taxis out to McCorkle's rocks?

248
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:56,940
 A taxi?

249
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:59,940
 You are in right out in solid comfort.

250
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:03,940
 Well, Henry, you take a taxi and I'll go in my father's car.

251
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:08,940
 But wouldn't it be more fun if we all went together and, and besides, if we all chip in, it'll be cheaper?

252
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:12,940
 What do you mean cheaper? It wouldn't cost me a cent to go in my car.

253
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:13,940
 I think of the repairs.

254
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:14,940
 What repair?

255
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:18,940
 Over there, road is full of ruts. By some of them are this deep.

256
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,940
 They are? As deep as that?

257
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:21,940
 Sure.

258
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:28,940
 You'd stand a very good chance of wrecking your car out there, but a taxi's different. They're made to be wrecked.

259
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:30,940
 How much would a taxi call?

260
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:33,940
 I got it all figured out, only two dollars each.

261
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:36,940
 Henry, that's two dollars more than I've got.

262
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:41,200
 All you gotta do is work on your father. You've got a golden tongue Homer.

263
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,200
 A what? A golden tongue, a golden tongue.

264
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,640
 I have. And I'll phone the other kids and get the wheels rolling.

265
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:59,880
 But father Henry Alders can get two dollars.

266
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,940
 Now wait Charlie.

267
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:03,780
 Mother says it's alright with her and it's alright with Mr. Alders.

268
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:05,380
 So why isn't it alright with you?

269
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:09,480
 What do you want the two dollars for? I told you you could have my car, didn't I?

270
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:13,240
 Yeah, but suddenly we've all decided to go out to Macquarkle's Rocks by Taxi.

271
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,280
 By Taxi? Why?

272
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:19,720
 Because of the ruts and it's bad enough with a bicycle and with a car, gee!

273
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:23,360
 Only a taxi doesn't cost as much the fix like a car is when it's wrecked.

274
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,460
 What's that?

275
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:26,460
 I think that's my reason. I'm all confused.

276
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:29,460
 Now just a minute, who's running this weeder rose?

277
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:30,220
 Henry Aldrich.

278
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:32,400
 Very well, before my headache gets any worse.

279
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,140
 I'm going to phone the Aldrich's and find out what's going on.

280
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:37,660
 I still don't think you'll understand it any more than I do.

281
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:38,660
 Hammer, please.

282
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,220
 Airm, 303.

283
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,460
 No, 303.

284
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:42,340
 Charlie, run along.

285
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:44,660
 Can I listen, Father? I'd like to find out what's happening.

286
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:46,740
 I'll tell you what's happening. Now, run along.

287
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:47,380
 Yes, Father.

288
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:48,020
 Hello.

289
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:50,340
 Uh, hello, Mr. Aldrich. This is Mr. Carr.

290
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,540
 Oh, hi, your water.

291
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:55,220
 Sam, I'd just like to know if you're loaning Henry your car this evening,

292
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:57,140
 or if you're giving him money or what?

293
00:13:57,140 --> 00:14:00,900
 Well, I'm certainly not lending you my car. I'm being very firm about that.

294
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,860
 Boy, his age isn't capable of taking care of other people's belongings.

295
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:04,740
 I see.

296
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:10,140
 Recently, Henry developed a bad habit of borrowing things and not returning them, so I decided to clamp down.

297
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,620
 Good for you, Sam.

298
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:14,460
 Borrowing things as one of the worst thoughts a boy can have.

299
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:14,980
 Exactly.

300
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:17,540
 Some people never get over it, even when they grow up.

301
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:19,260
 I agree with you 100%.

302
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:24,900
 For example, Sam, somebody, I can't remember who it was, borrowed a favorite book of mine over a year ago.

303
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,860
 History of the Roman Empire, it was.

304
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,100
 Oh.

305
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,100
 Oh.

306
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:29,900
 Yes, sir.

307
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,460
 And I've never seen the book again.

308
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:34,460
 Mr. Clark, that's, that's rather a coincidence.

309
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:37,260
 If you ask me, Sam, it's a perfect example of bad upbringing.

310
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:39,860
 I'm sure you'll book what you are one of these days with the car,

311
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:42,760
 and now excuse me, I think I hear my wife calling you goodbye.

312
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,760
 Goodbye, Sam.

313
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,960
 Hello, sir.

314
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:48,060
 Did I hear you talking about that history of the Roman Empire?

315
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:48,860
 You did?

316
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:51,260
 Well, I certainly wish you'd hurry and find it.

317
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:54,160
 And till he keeps saying you borrowed it from her and never attended...

318
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,360
 Now, Marion, it will show up one of these days.

319
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,560
 Where is Charlie?

320
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,460
 Here I am, Father. Can I have the two dollars?

321
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,460
 You may not.

322
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:01,860
 You mean I have to go in your car?

323
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,160
 And you can't have the car either.

324
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:06,280
 Boy your age isn't capable of taking care of other people's belongings.

325
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,320
 But I don't want any argument, Charlie.

326
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,320
 From now on I'm clamping down around here.

327
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,520
 But how am I gonna get to the winner, Rose tonight?

328
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,920
 That's for Henry Aldrich to figure out.

329
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:35,920
 [Music]

330
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,920
 And now getting back to the troubles of Henry Albers.

331
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:43,920
 Henry has undertaken the management of a wiener roast at McCorkle's Rocks.

332
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:48,920
 And when a truck ran over his bicycle, he swung the boys around to going in cars.

333
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:51,920
 Now Henry can't get a car.

334
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,920
 And his attempts to raise money for taxis seem to have backfired.

335
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,920
 The scene opens in the Aldrich living room.

336
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,920
 It is six o'clock the same night.

337
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,920
 Homer, what do you mean by that?

338
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,920
 Lock the doors, Henry, lock the doors.

339
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:06,920
 Why, Gee, what?

340
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:10,920
 The kids are all on their way over here to your house, and boy, are they men.

341
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:11,920
 What are they coming over here for?

342
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:16,920
 They're all going to punch you in the nose and take their wingers over to Willie's backyard

343
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:17,920
 and eat them.

344
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,480
 I thought everybody was getting money for taxis.

345
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,880
 Well they were.

346
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:26,440
 Only everybody got confused and our father started phoning each other and now they've

347
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,160
 all decided to clamp down.

348
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,160
 But why?

349
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:34,800
 Well as near as I can figure out, it's because your father says boys our age shouldn't borrow

350
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,800
 anything.

351
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:36,800
 Oh boy.

352
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,040
 Well, frankly, Homer, I'm kind of tired.

353
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,840
 I don't mind a bit having a whole thing over at Willy's.

354
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,200
 Trouble is him.

355
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,040
 What?

356
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,320
 You're not invited.

357
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,240
 What?

358
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,240
 I'm not invited!

359
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,040
 After all I've done?

360
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,640
 That's why you're not invited.

361
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,120
 [LAUGHTER]

362
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,080
 Look for me.

363
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,200
 See, that's the thanks you get.

364
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,720
 Well, wait a minute.

365
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,600
 Homer, listen, I just got an idea.

366
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,760
 Can we take my advice and forget it?

367
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:06,800
 Look, when the kids get here, you stall them, see.

368
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,720
 Don't let them get near the weiners.

369
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:13,420
 And in exactly half an hour they're going to get the biggest surprise of their life!

370
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:23,720
 [Music]

371
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:26,220
 Gus, is there any way we could hurry with this?

372
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:29,720
 No, you can't hurry, a sensitive horse like Sheila Henry.

373
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,720
 Not when it comes to hitching her to a hay wagon.

374
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:36,220
 I know Gus, but at 6'15" go on Sheila back out!

375
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:38,900
 Henry, it won't get you anyplace pushing her.

376
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,180
 You have to talk to her.

377
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:41,180
 Yeah?

378
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:43,340
 Sheila, listen, I'm talking to you.

379
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:47,140
 It's 6'15, and the kids won't wait much longer.

380
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:50,060
 Beck, we go, Sheila, baby.

381
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:51,700
 Beck, up to the nice wagon.

382
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:54,220
 I sure appreciate you're doing this for me, Gus.

383
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:57,340
 Boy, wait till the kids here that are having a hayride out

384
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:59,020
 to McCorkle's rocks.

385
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:01,700
 But I'm not the one doing your favor, Henry.

386
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:02,540
 Sheila.

387
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:03,540
 It is?

388
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:04,380
 Yeah.

389
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:05,940
 You don't know what this is costing her.

390
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:07,940
 She's allergic to hay, you know.

391
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:08,940
 Is that right?

392
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:09,940
 Yeah.

393
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,940
 Well, baby, she's got hay fever.

394
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:12,940
 [LAUGHTER]

395
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:13,940
 There it is, Sheila.

396
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:15,940
 Now let's put your honeycomb.

397
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:17,940
 Well, could I be taking care of this?

398
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:18,940
 Yeah.

399
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:19,940
 That's the bit, Henry.

400
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:21,940
 It goes in her mouth.

401
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:23,940
 Oh, yeah, sure.

402
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:24,940
 Here, Sheila.

403
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,940
 Open your mouth.

404
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,940
 You'll have to drive a real carpool in me.

405
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:31,940
 She's a regular bundling her overnight.

406
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:32,940
 She is?

407
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,940
 Well, if she seems unhappy,

408
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:38,700
 She brought something along to give her something she loves.

409
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,700
 What is it?

410
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,940
 The other half of my father's maroon tie.

411
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:49,940
 [Music]

412
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:55,740
 Sam, I wish you wouldn't bolt your supper like that.

413
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,700
 I'm not bolting, I'm just in a hurry.

414
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:58,700
 Did you wrap up the book?

415
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:01,100
 Yes, dear, and I patted it with brown paper.

416
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,940
 It's on the hall table.

417
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:07,260
 I still wish you'd face Mr. Clark like a man instead of sneaking over there.

418
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:10,260
 Not as long as he gets his book back. He doesn't care how it gets there.

419
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:14,700
 I still don't approve of you just tossing the Roman Empire up on his front porch.

420
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,380
 What's that?

421
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:18,700
 Don't worry folks, it's only me.

422
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,940
 Homer, what are you doing at that window?

423
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:24,100
 I'm not coming in, Mr. All. Which I'm just scouting.

424
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:26,700
 Where's Henley? Have you heard from him?

425
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:29,940
 No, Homer, but he said he'd be back here by 630.

426
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:32,100
 Homer, all the boys still on the front porch?

427
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:36,740
 Yes sir. Why don't you have them wait inside? In a hole with Henry spots of

428
00:19:36,740 --> 00:20:01,940
 lieners right there on the table. Hey, Homer, where are you? No. What do you mean? Sam isn't it grand? What is? The way Henry has managed this entire affair with all the boys leaning on him. Why with his capabilities he might, he might even. Yeah. Sam, I wouldn't say this.

429
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,740
 for anybody else but

430
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,500
 just think

431
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,340
 president all

432
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,620
 that's going just a little far

433
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:14,220
 i don't know if you got the proper guidance and help

434
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:17,500
 for instance and i do think you should have let him have your car tonight

435
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:20,820
 nonsense at least if i'd let Henry my car he wouldn't have had the satisfaction

436
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:23,780
 of working this thing out for himself i know when you have to hear he said he

437
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:26,820
 had a solution to the whole transportation problem that's true when he

438
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:29,660
 works it out the boys will respect him for it and so will i

439
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:30,700
 Why suppose so?

440
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:33,380
 That's just that I understand boys better than you do.

441
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:35,500
 Now where's that history of the Roman Empire?

442
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,700
 I'd better get over to the Clark's.

443
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:39,500
 What's all that racket?

444
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,500
 Let's open the door and see.

445
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:45,380
 We want to know.

446
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:48,540
 Now listen, you can at least take your hats off.

447
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,820
 Who cares about Henry?

448
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:51,820
 Where's Henry?

449
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:53,700
 Wait, am I good to speak to him?

450
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,220
 You speak to him, Alice.

451
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:55,980
 Where's my book?

452
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:56,580
 Oh, there.

453
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:57,740
 Send us not your book.

454
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:59,340
 That's Henry's box of weiners.

455
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:01,340
 Oh, then this is the book.

456
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:03,340
 This woman goes like a wiener.

457
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:05,340
 Hey, now look boys, let's pour this.

458
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:07,340
 Let's pour this back.

459
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:09,340
 Don't tell them they'll link to them.

460
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:11,340
 Then come back here, you understand boys?

461
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:13,340
 Hey, here.

462
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:16,340
 Boys, boys, listen to me.

463
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:28,840
 Hello?

464
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,140
 Is that you mother?

465
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:32,040
 Henry, what all of this happened to you?

466
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,040
 Oh, the boy, everything.

467
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:37,140
 Oh, the boys are right here in the living room waiting for you.

468
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:37,940
 They are?

469
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:38,940
 Oh, gee whiz.

470
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:43,540
 I explained to them that you were working out a way to get them all out to Macaulco's rocks.

471
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:46,740
 And dear, they were so excited they forgave you for everything.

472
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,340
 Mother, that's the whole trouble.

473
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:50,340
 They were going to have a hayride.

474
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:52,340
 Only now they're not.

475
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:53,140
 Why not?

476
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:55,540
 Well, I was driving Sheila down Walnut Street

477
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:58,020
 And she was as peaceful as can be when...

478
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,020
 Bang!

479
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:00,020
 Well, what happened?

480
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:04,880
 All of a sudden a fellow with his coat collar turned up and is hacked down over his eyes

481
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,580
 dashed right in front of Sheila and threw something.

482
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:08,580
 Yeah?

483
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:11,700
 And the first thing I knew there was hay all over the place.

484
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:14,660
 I was in the gutter and Sheila was headed for home.

485
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:15,660
 Oh my goodness.

486
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:21,660
 And look, mother, would you mind packing a suitcase and sending it over to Anne Harriet's?

487
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:22,660
 Goodnight!

488
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:23,660
 Why all those issues?

489
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:27,900
 I'm just going to stay here a couple of weeks till the air clears.

490
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,800
 No, there you can't do that.

491
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,760
 Ah!

492
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:33,360
 Henry, your father just came in. I'll talk to him and call you back.

493
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,860
 Okay.

494
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:38,160
 Sam, what on earth is that all over your coat?

495
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,460
 Hey.

496
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:40,560
 Hey.

497
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,460
 Hey, Alice.

498
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:47,460
 I just thrown the book up on the Clark's front porch when out of a clear sky I was nearly killed by a horse.

499
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:49,460
 You mean it was you?

500
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:50,560
 What?

501
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:53,560
 Sam, old rich, do you realize what you've done?

502
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:58,740
 What I've done when you ran in front of that hay wagon you upset Henry's whole apple card

503
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:01,380
 Alice would you please explain what you were talking about?

504
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:08,320
 Just this time if you don't do something to help Henry. We'll never be able to face his friends again

505
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,060
 Alice, I'm exhausted.

506
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:26,960
 Here you are, dear. I brought your slippers down for you.

507
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,240
 Thank you.

508
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,000
 But I'm too tired to lean over and put some on.

509
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,840
 Now, Sam, it wasn't really as bad as that.

510
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,440
 Alice, that's a long drive out the Macworkel's rocks.

511
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:42,140
 Well, I do think you could have taken the boys out there without making two trips.

512
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:47,420
 There is a law, Alice, that says you can't take 14 boys in one car.

513
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:49,480
 They aren't very big boys.

514
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,580
 Now, Alice.

515
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:56,580
 Well, the main thing is that Henry and his weiners and his friends are all out at Macaukel's rocks.

516
00:23:56,580 --> 00:24:00,080
 I'm sorry you're tired there, but I'm glad that Henry's happy.

517
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:05,580
 Seems to me that it should have been a simple thing for Henry to arrange a wiener roast without running into all that trouble.

518
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:09,580
 He did his best, Sam. He may have made a few little mistakes.

519
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:11,580
 That's just it. He should learn not to make mistakes.

520
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:15,580
 By one little mistake, and all to the whole course of the world.

521
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:19,080
 Yes, dear. Oh, did I tell you, Mrs. Clark, phone while you were out?

522
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:22,080
 Mrs. Clark, she didn't see me today.

523
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25,080
 Oh no, they wanted us to come over and play bridge this evening.

524
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,580
 What's that? After all I've been through?

525
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:30,580
 I knew you'd be tired, dear, so I said no.

526
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:31,580
 Good.

527
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:33,580
 I invited him over here instead.

528
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:37,580
 Over here? Alice, why did you do that?

529
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:41,580
 The last thing in the world I feel like doing is playing bridge with the Clark.

530
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:44,580
 Oh, you'd better answer the phone, Sam. I'll have to start on the refrain.

531
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:48,580
 But Alice, that's a fine thing.

532
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:50,580
 Hello?

533
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:52,580
 Hello there, Miss Dornridge. This is one o'clock.

534
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:53,580
 Well...

535
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:56,580
 Hello Walter, I hear we're playing bridge tonight.

536
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:57,580
 Yes!

537
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:58,580
 Well, I'm delighted.

538
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:01,580
 Well, look Sam, would you mind if we brought along the refresh?

539
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:03,580
 Oh, now that won't be necessary.

540
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:05,580
 We'd really like to. You see earlier this evening, some stranger

541
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:07,580
 tossed a package up on our front verandex.

542
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:08,580
 What's that?

543
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:11,580
 And when we opened it, it turned out to be a box of winners.

544
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:14,580
 Winners? You mean...

545
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:16,580
 Oh no!

546
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:35,580

547
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:43,580
