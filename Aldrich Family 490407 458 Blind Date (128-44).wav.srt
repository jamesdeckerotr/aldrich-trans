00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
 [Music]

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 And now the Jell-O family presents...

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 Henry! Henry Olgrich!

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 Coming, Mother!

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 [Applause]

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 Yes, it's the Olgrich family based on characters

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,800
 originated by Clifford Goldsmith and starring Ezra Stonner's Henry with Jackie Kelk as Homer.

8
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,800
 And yes, it's the Jell-O family.

9
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,800
 Oh, the Big Red Letter stand for the Jell-O family.

10
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:45,800
 Oh, the Big Red Letter stand for the Jell-O family.

11
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:46,800
 That's Jell-O.

12
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,800
 The Union, the Jell-O pudding.

13
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:49,800
 The Union, the Union, the Jell-O pudding.

14
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,800
 The Union, the Union, the Union, the Union, the Union, the Union, the Union.

15
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:52,800
 The Jell-O tack, the Oka pudding.

16
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,800
 Yes, Harry!

17
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,400
 And now for the Aldrich family.

18
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,140
 (dramatic music)

19
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:13,360
 One of the most enjoyable things a man can do

20
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,360
 is think back to the time when he was a teenage boy

21
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:20,200
 like Henry Aldrich, with no cares, no worries,

22
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,200
 no responsibilities.

23
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,480
 But when you actually are the boy,

24
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,080
 Things aren't always that pleasant.

25
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,720
 The scene opens in the Aldrich living room.

26
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,360
 It's early evening.

27
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,400
 (sighs)

28
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,240
 Father.

29
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,840
 Father.

30
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,160
 Pardon me, Father.

31
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,880
 - What is it, Henry?

32
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,640
 - Would you like to read something very interesting?

33
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,680
 - I was.

34
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,280
 - Well, I mean this book, Father.

35
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,920
 Gee, it's wonderful.

36
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,040
 It's all about two fellows, sing.

37
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,120
 - That's very interesting.

38
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,840
 - I knew you'd like it, Father.

39
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,320
 You see, Bruce and Rodney are very close friends.

40
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,800
 You might almost say they're practically inseparable.

41
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,800
 One would do anything for the other.

42
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,880
 - Very interesting.

43
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,280
 - For instance, once Rodney's in trouble, see,

44
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,760
 he's in a fight with five other fellows.

45
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:11,040
 Only I won't tell you how he gets into it

46
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,160
 'cause I don't wanna spoil the book for you.

47
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,000
 - Thank you.

48
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,120
 - Meanwhile, Bruce doesn't know anything

49
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,800
 about Rodney's predicament.

50
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:21,560
 He's home in bed, getting ready to go to sleep, see?

51
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,200
 But all of a sudden he feels uneasy.

52
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,800
 He tries to shake it off,

53
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,720
 but he can't get rid of the feeling

54
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,600
 that all is not well with Rod.

55
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,960
 So he gets stressed.

56
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,920
 - The phone, Henry.

57
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,240
 - Oh, he thought about that father,

58
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,360
 but he didn't know where to reach Rodney.

59
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,760
 - Our phone, Henry.

60
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,960
 - Oh, oh, I'll get it, father.

61
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,800
 Hello?

62
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,720
 - Hi, him.

63
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,080
 - Look, Homer, could I call you back in a few minutes?

64
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,400
 I'm right in the middle of a story.

65
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,560
 I'm telling my father.

66
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,560
 - All right, Henry, I can go.

67
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,400
 - It's very important, Henry.

68
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,640
 Couldn't it just went, are you in trouble, pal?

69
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,880
 - Sort of.

70
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,760
 - Good, I'll be right over.

71
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,520
 - You don't have to come over and I just want to ask you

72
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,360
 something.

73
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,320
 - Oh, go right ahead, pal.

74
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,520
 Anything at all.

75
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,280
 - Thanks, him.

76
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,760
 - I could come over, Homer.

77
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,840
 - It isn't necessary.

78
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,280
 I can ask you over the phone.

79
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,480
 All you have to do is answer yes or no.

80
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,120
 - The answer is yes.

81
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,120
 - How do you know?

82
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,120
 - Listen, pal.

83
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,920
 When one pal calls another pal,

84
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:22,960
 On the first palace in trouble, what else can the second palace say but yes?

85
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,960
 No.

86
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,960
 Not if they're real pals, Homer.

87
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,560
 Henry, maybe you better wait till you hear what it is.

88
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,800
 Well it doesn't matter, Homer, but go ahead if you want to.

89
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,360
 Well, you know the school dance in a couple of weeks.

90
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,360
 Sure, you want me to get you a date, is that it?

91
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,600
 No, I already have a date, Agnes.

92
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:44,760
 As a matter of fact, it's just the uh... Henry, did you invite anyone yet?

93
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,160
 No, Kathleen's out of town.

94
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,840
 I'm just sort of making up my mind.

95
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,840
 That's good.

96
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,640
 I mean, the fact of the matter is, Hen, that Agnes...

97
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,540
 You see, Agnes has a...

98
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:56,140
 Well, when I asked Agnes, she...

99
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:58,640
 Oh, boy...

100
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,840
 Look, Homer, we're friends, aren't we?

101
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,640
 Sure, Hen.

102
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,640
 Good friends.

103
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,140
 Sure.

104
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:06,340
 Practically inseparable, you might say.

105
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:06,840
 Sure.

106
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,340
 Well, then just ask me, Homer, just ask me.

107
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:10,140
 That's all.

108
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,840
 Come right out and say it.

109
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,340
 Okay, Hen.

110
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:15,640
 The fact of the matter is that a cousin of Agnes

111
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,740
 is just coming to visit her the weekend of the dance

112
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:19,940
 An Agnes asked me to get someone to take her.

113
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:20,940
 Okay.

114
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,540
 You mean you will?

115
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:23,540
 Sure.

116
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:24,540
 Just like that?

117
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:25,540
 Of course.

118
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,460
 You need me, pal.

119
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:28,460
 I'm there.

120
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:31,220
 Gee, thanks, ham.

121
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:33,180
 You'd do the same for me, wouldn't you?

122
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:35,180
 Sure, certainly.

123
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,980
 So there you are.

124
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,980
 Is this L-431?

125
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:39,980
 What?

126
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:40,980
 Sure.

127
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:45,420
 Is this Henry Aldrich?

128
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:46,420
 Naturally.

129
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:47,420
 Naturally.

130
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:51,020
 The Henry older, she was a friend named Homer Brown.

131
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,020
 Of course.

132
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,020
 Well, I'll be done.

133
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:57,980
 By him, I've got a co-agnition teller.

134
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:59,580
 So long, old pal.

135
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:02,740
 Remember, any time at all.

136
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:03,740
 Where was I, pal?

137
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:04,740
 I mean, Father.

138
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,740
 My next spice was getting dressed.

139
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,100
 What homo on?

140
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,100
 Not spice, Father.

141
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,100
 Bruce.

142
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:13,100
 He wanted me to take Agnes' cousin to the dance.

143
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,100
 Now, let's see.

144
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,100
 Bruce was worried.

145
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,100
 What'd you like?

146
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:21,380
 father. He, Homa, wanted you to take Agnes' he cousin to the den? She was no,

147
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:26,700
 she's a she. Bruce is a he. Well, thank heaven. I met Agnes' cousin,

148
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:30,100
 Henry. What's she like? I don't know. Anyway, there was Bruce. You don't know.

149
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:33,980
 And now she's from out of town. Oh, I thought you were through with blind date.

150
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:38,940
 Well, generally speaking, I am father, but this is different. My pal needs me. I

151
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:39,940
 I see.

152
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:42,240
 Mine not to question why.

153
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,660
 Mine but to do and die.

154
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:45,660
 Very likely.

155
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:46,660
 What?

156
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:47,660
 Nothing, Henry.

157
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:50,460
 Then why are you shaking your head like that?

158
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:54,900
 Son, it's been my experience that a man takes quite a chance on a blind date.

159
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,180
 More often than not, he gets stuck.

160
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:01,460
 But Father Homer's a very close friend of mine, practically inseparable, you might

161
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:02,460
 say.

162
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:05,060
 Do you really think I'll get stuck?

163
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:08,140
 Well, that shouldn't matter, Henry.

164
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:12,580
 a pal need you sure but what if she's fat

165
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:18,220
 what if who's fat and bangus's cousin mother do you think she might be fat or

166
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:23,380
 skinny I suppose there's always that possibility she was why should that have

167
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:27,460
 said you so much and read just accepted a blind date with a young lady in question

168
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:33,140
 oh well I'm sure she's very nice you really think so mother do you really

169
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:37,860
 father says more often than not a man gets stuck on a blind date is that what

170
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:43,860
 your father says? How interesting considering the fact that he met me on a blind date.

171
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:44,860
 Now Alice.

172
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:46,860
 What else did your father say?

173
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:47,860
 Well, he just...

174
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:48,860
 Henry.

175
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:49,860
 Yes, father?

176
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:53,860
 Alice, when I said what I said to Henry, I had no particular personal situation in mind.

177
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,860
 And besides, all I said was...

178
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,860
 That a man gets stuck on a blind date.

179
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:59,860
 I didn't say that, Alice. All I said was...

180
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:00,700
 - That was fun.

181
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:03,280
 (upbeat music)

182
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:11,500
 - Gee whiz Henry, why didn't you think of that

183
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,460
 before I told Agnes should go?

184
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:14,300
 - Look home.

185
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,160
 - A half hour ago you were such a pal,

186
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,220
 you didn't even wanna know what I wanted.

187
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,380
 And now look at you.

188
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,740
 - Homer, I didn't come all the way over to your house

189
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,300
 to say I won't go.

190
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,920
 It's still very possible.

191
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,980
 I may take Agnes's cousin to the day.

192
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:27,820
 - When will you know?

193
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,940
 as soon as I find out a little more about it.

194
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:32,260
 - Okay, what do you wanna know?

195
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:33,360
 - Is she pretty?

196
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,280
 - I don't know.

197
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,620
 - Is she fat?

198
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:37,980
 - I don't know.

199
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:38,980
 - Is she skinny?

200
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:40,740
 - I don't know.

201
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,540
 Is there anything else you wanna ask, can we?

202
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:44,060
 (audience laughing)

203
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,700
 - Well, what do you know about it?

204
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,300
 - Her name is Martha Adams.

205
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,620
 She lives in Hollendale and she's Agnes' cousin.

206
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,660
 - Well, don't you know anything else about her?

207
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:53,820
 - Physically, I mean.

208
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,260
 - No.

209
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:57,260
 Except that she is Agnes's cousin.

210
00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:01,860
 Well, she was cousins don't always look alike, you know.

211
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:03,900
 - That's the big trouble with your Homer.

212
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,300
 All you know are the unimportant things.

213
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,700
 Nothing about how she looked.

214
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,820
 - Henry, after all, you're just gonna dance

215
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:11,540
 with the girl for a few hours.

216
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:13,340
 It isn't as though you were marrying her.

217
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,540
 - You never can tell, Homer.

218
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:15,540
 You never can tell.

219
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:17,060
 Look at what happened to my father.

220
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:17,900
 - What happened?

221
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:20,180
 - He met my mother on a blind date.

222
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:23,620
 - Oh, well, they're happy, aren't they?

223
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:24,980
 - Not right at the moment.

224
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,340
 (audience laughing)

225
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,280
 And besides, let's not change the subject.

226
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,420
 I've got my reputation to think about.

227
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:31,260
 - Why?

228
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,860
 - If word gets around that Henry oldridge

229
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:35,900
 goes out with unattractive girls, from that moment on,

230
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,940
 I'm finished with the attractive ones.

231
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:40,500
 - Why didn't you think of that when I first asked you?

232
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,060
 - Because I was trying to be a pal.

233
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:45,420
 Didn't Agnes say anything about her cousin?

234
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:46,500
 - Nope.

235
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,180
 I wonder why.

236
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:49,900
 - Because I never asked her.

237
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:50,940
 - Well, why didn't you?

238
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,300
 - Because, you know, you brought it up,

239
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,460
 it wasn't important.

240
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,380
 (phone ringing)

241
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:55,380
 Hello?

242
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:56,380
 Hi, Homer.

243
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:57,380
 Oh, pal.

244
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:58,380
 Hi, Agnes.

245
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:59,380
 I just got into my mother told me you called.

246
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:00,380
 What do you want?

247
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:02,380
 Homer, one minute Agnes.

248
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:03,380
 What ever you...

249
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:04,380
 Ask her now.

250
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:05,380
 Ask her what?

251
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,380
 About her cousin Martha.

252
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,380
 Is she pretty or fat or what?

253
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,380
 You know, vital statistics.

254
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:10,380
 Okay.

255
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:11,380
 Hello, Agnes.

256
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:13,380
 What did you want to tell me, Homer?

257
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:17,380
 Well, well, how are you, Agnes?

258
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:18,380
 I'm fine.

259
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:19,380
 How are you?

260
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:20,380
 Fine.

261
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:21,380
 That's fine.

262
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:22,380
 How's your mother?

263
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:23,380
 She's fine.

264
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:24,380
 That's Mary's.

265
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:25,380
 Uh, how's your...

266
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:27,380
 He's fine too.

267
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:28,380
 That's good.

268
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:29,380
 What's good?

269
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:31,380
 Gee whiz, Homer, why don't you ask her?

270
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:36,380
 Hold on, Agnes, because you've got to lead up to something like that gradually.

271
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:37,380
 Um, Agnes.

272
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:38,380
 Yeah?

273
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:39,380
 How's...

274
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:41,380
 How's your cousin Martha?

275
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,380
 Who knows?

276
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:44,380
 Oh, what's she saying?

277
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:45,380
 She said, "Who knows?"

278
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:47,380
 You'll have to talk louder, Homer.

279
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:48,380
 I can't hear you.

280
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:49,380
 I was talking to Henry.

281
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,380
 Oh, is he there with you?

282
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:54,580
 - Yeah, as a matter of fact, we were sort of talking

283
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:56,720
 about our plans for the dance.

284
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,480
 And Henry was just wondering,

285
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,060
 what color hair Martha has?

286
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,060
 - Why?

287
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:07,260
 - So, well, so we know what color tie it aware.

288
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:08,100
 - Oh.

289
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:11,060
 - He doesn't want to wear a tie that would clash with her head.

290
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:11,900
 - Oh!

291
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:12,900
 (audience laughing)

292
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,460
 - What color is her head?

293
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:15,940
 - Gee, I don't know.

294
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,660
 - Oh, what'd she say?

295
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:18,900
 - She said she doesn't know.

296
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:19,740
 - How come?

297
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:20,900
 - How come Agnes?

298
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:23,900
 'Cause I haven't seen her since she was nine years old.

299
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,700
 Oh, what'd she say?

300
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,900
 Oh, no, that's what you said.

301
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,500
 Oh, thank you.

302
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:32,600
 She said she hasn't seen her since she was nine years old.

303
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,600
 What?

304
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,900
 Well, ask her what she was like when she was nine.

305
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:39,700
 Agnes, what was she like when she was nine?

306
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,400
 Boy, she was a whiz.

307
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,100
 She was a whiz, Ham.

308
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,100
 She was?

309
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,300
 Ask her in what way?

310
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,600
 In what way, Agnes?

311
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,600
 In school.

312
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,600
 Oh.

313
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,600
 What'd she say?

314
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,600
 She was a whole year ahead of the other kids her age.

315
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,600
 She was?

316
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,600
 What did she say?

317
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,600
 She's... she's intelligent.

318
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,600
 That's what I was afraid of.

319
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,600
 It's really fine, right?

320
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,600
 Listen, Homer. When you ask somebody about a girl,

321
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,600
 and the first thing they tell you is that she's intelligent,

322
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,600
 you're in trouble.

323
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,600
 Hello? Hello?

324
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,600
 Just a minute, Agnes.

325
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,600
 Just help me out, Homer. Just count me out.

326
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,600
 Hello?

327
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,600
 You can't do that. Hit me. You promised you'd take that.

328
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,600
 That was before I knew she was intelligent.

329
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,060
 intelligent

330
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:24,680
 i thought you said you were a pal and i thought when i thought i was in trouble

331
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,200
 and asked another pal to help me

332
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:30,280
 what else could that pal do listen homie did you ever try dancing with a girl

333
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:37,280
 with brains

334
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:43,840
 what you're actually saying sam is that the girl doesn't count no allies with

335
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,120
 you please i see

336
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,720
 only you men are important

337
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,440
 I suppose it doesn't matter at all if the poor girl gets done.

338
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,480
 Alice, all I say was...

339
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,760
 No wonder boys think they're kings of the earth.

340
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,160
 They take after their fathers.

341
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:54,720
 Alice!

342
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,120
 Sam, look at it this way.

343
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,000
 How would you like it if you were a girl?

344
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,600
 Henry, is that you?

345
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,600
 Yes, Father.

346
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,760
 Please come in here.

347
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,680
 Alice, let's not discuss this in front of Henry.

348
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,240
 Sam, you were the one who mixed him up in the first place.

349
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,160
 Now I want you to straighten him out.

350
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,240
 Did you want to speak to our mother?

351
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,720
 No, dear, your father wants to talk to you.

352
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,280
 Alice!

353
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,880
 Sam, I'm counting on you.

354
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,000
 What is it, Father?

355
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:22,560
 Henry, you know I never interfere in your affairs, nor do I intend to start now.

356
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,040
 Thank you, Father.

357
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,540
 But...

358
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:27,540
 But why?

359
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:32,240
 Henry, someday you too will be married and have a family of your own.

360
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,240
 Well, thank you, Father.

361
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,040
 Yes.

362
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,760
 Henry, your mother is a wonderful woman.

363
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,420
 Thank you, Father.

364
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:42,720
 But sometimes...

365
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,720
 You're welcome, Henry.

366
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,280
 [LAUGHTER]

367
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:49,000
 Son, you remember that book you were telling me about,

368
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,720
 the one about Rollo and Spice?

369
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,920
 Rodney and Bruce, Father.

370
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:53,320
 [LAUGHTER]

371
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,760
 Yes.

372
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:58,160
 Well, sometimes it's that way between Father and Son, too.

373
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,440
 Oh?

374
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:04,280
 When one's in trouble, he knows he can count on the other.

375
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:07,080
 You know how.

376
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,280
 Father, are you trying to tell me that now you want

377
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,080
 me to go on this blind day?

378
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,680
 It's not that I want you to go, Son.

379
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,360
 You just prefer it, is that it?

380
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,200
 Well, it's not exactly that I prefer it.

381
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,040
 But you think I ought to go, huh?

382
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,520
 Well, not exactly think you ought to go, but...

383
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:23,800
 After all, Henry, she may not be as fat as you think.

384
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,160
 No, that's not what I meant.

385
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,160
 I mean...

386
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:35,640
 Agnes, where is it?

387
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,600
 I'm looking for it. I'm looking for it.

388
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,040
 It's someone's here in the album.

389
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,680
 Why didn't you say you had a picture of Martha in the first place?

390
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,980
 Because who knew you were gonna be so particular?

391
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:45,260
 - Would have made a lot of difference

392
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:46,740
 to my mother and father.

393
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,500
 - Don't forget him very often

394
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,940
 a picture doesn't do a person justice.

395
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:53,220
 You should see some of the pictures we have of me.

396
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:54,980
 They'd scare the pants off you.

397
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:55,800
 (audience laughs)

398
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,640
 - Here, here it is.

399
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,480
 - Where?

400
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,420
 - There, there in the lower left hand corner of the page.

401
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,820
 - Not bad, not bad at all.

402
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,940
 - See, hen, you were worried for nothing.

403
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:07,820
 - Oh boy, not bad at all.

404
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:10,820
 A little mature maybe, but I like 'em that way.

405
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,980
 Mature, let's see.

406
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:14,420
 That's her mother.

407
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,780
 What?

408
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:18,660
 Very often, him girls take after their mother.

409
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,700
 The other one, the girl wither, that's my thing.

410
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:21,540
 Let's see.

411
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,300
 Let me see too.

412
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,140
 What's the matter?

413
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:28,020
 Listen, Agnes, I don't mind doing a person a favor.

414
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:31,020
 But if your aunt allows your cousin to go out with boys,

415
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:32,940
 she ought to be ashamed of herself.

416
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:33,780
 What?

417
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:36,580
 Very often, Henry, girls are a lot older than they look.

418
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:38,820
 Sure, Homer, but even if this girl is a lot older

419
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:41,540
 and she looked, she couldn't be a day over 11.

420
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:43,460
 - Well, is that what's worrying you?

421
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:44,460
 - Isn't it enough?

422
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:47,980
 - This picture was taken five years ago.

423
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:48,820
 - Oh!

424
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,460
 - You see Henry?

425
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:51,940
 - Let me see it again, Agnes.

426
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:55,820
 'Cause she's still wear braces on her teeth.

427
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:56,820
 - I don't know.

428
00:14:56,820 --> 00:15:00,660
 - Do you think she's still knock me?

429
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,180
 - Gee, I don't know.

430
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:04,460
 - Look at the beautiful hair she has, Henry.

431
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:05,300
 - Where?

432
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,140
 - Right.

433
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:07,140
 (audience laughing)

434
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:09,140
 - What's her mother again?

435
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:10,060
 - Well, Henry.

436
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:13,060
 - Well, you see, Agnes, it's very hard to tell anything

437
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,700
 about Martha from this picture.

438
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,460
 Is this the latest one you have?

439
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:17,420
 - Yes.

440
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:20,420
 - Do you have a magnifying glass in the house?

441
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:23,500
 - Yeah, I think, just a minute, Henry.

442
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:26,020
 Oliver, who do you think you are, cousin of you?

443
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:26,860
 - Uh-huh.

444
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:27,780
 - Well, you're not, see?

445
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:29,780
 And that goes for you too, Homer Brown.

446
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:31,260
 - Agnes, I didn't say anything.

447
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:32,500
 - Never mind the excuses.

448
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,540
 And I'll tell you one thing, Homer Brown,

449
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:37,260
 If any cousin of mine isn't good enough for Henry Aldrich

450
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:39,060
 than any friend of any Henry Aldrich

451
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:40,340
 isn't good enough for me.

452
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:42,420
 - Are you referring to me, Agnes?

453
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:44,340
 - You don't see any other friends of Henry Aldrich

454
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:45,420
 around, do you?

455
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:46,700
 Now you can both get out.

456
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:47,700
 - What Agnes?

457
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,540
 - Agnes, what about my father?

458
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:50,380
 - Ow!

459
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:51,740
 (door slams)

460
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:54,500
 - Now look what you did to me, pal.

461
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,080
 (upbeat music)

462
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:06,160
 The Big Red Letter Stand for the Jell-O Family

463
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,660
 Oh, the Big Red Letter Stand for the Jell-O Family

464
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:10,660
 That's Jell-O!

465
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:11,660
 Yum-yum-yum!

466
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:12,660
 Jell-O Putting!

467
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:13,660
 Yum-yum-yum!

468
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:14,660
 Jell-O Tap!

469
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:15,660
 The Oka Putting!

470
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:18,660
 Yes, sorry!

471
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:21,660
 Yes, that's the Jell-O Family

472
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:25,660
 And right now Jell-O is making you the biggest bargain offer you've heard about in years

473
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:29,660
 The offer of a full set of six beautiful individual aluminum Jell-O moles

474
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:33,700
 Yes, real aluminum, sturdy, good-looking long-lasting.

475
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:38,460
 They're handsome fluted moles, the type that have been so hard to get for such a long time.

476
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:43,220
 These moles are a guaranteed 60 cent value, but you get the whole set of sakes for just

477
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:49,420
 25 cents plus a coupon you'll find on a special banded combination of three packages of jello

478
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:50,500
 puddings.

479
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:54,500
 So hurry, hurry to the grocers, because this offer is limited.

480
00:16:54,500 --> 00:17:00,140
 With these six beautiful aluminum molds, a 60 sand value for just a quarter, plus the

481
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:02,380
 jello pudding's coupon.

482
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:09,540
 Don't miss this big bargain offer.

483
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:12,880
 And now getting back to the troubles of Henry Ulrich.

484
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:17,100
 In order to help Homer, Henry has accepted a blind date.

485
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:21,980
 But in trying to discover what she looks like, he has been less than a pal to his father

486
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:23,500
 and a homer.

487
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,780
 The scene opens in the Alrich Front Hall.

488
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:27,060
 It is the next day.

489
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:28,060
 Is this long distance?

490
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:29,060
 Long distance speaking.

491
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:33,380
 Well, look, can you please tell me how much it would cost to call Hollendale person to

492
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:34,380
 person?

493
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:36,380
 The charges are $1.25.

494
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:38,820
 She was a whole dollar and $0.25.

495
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:39,820
 That is correct.

496
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:42,500
 Even if the person doesn't know the other person?

497
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,940
 I'm sorry, sir, but the telephone company is not responsible for that.

498
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:46,940
 Oh.

499
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:50,620
 Well, look, I'd like to place a call to Hollendale person to-

500
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:51,620
 Hey, Ray!

501
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:54,620
 One minute, mother, the call is to Miss Martha Adams.

502
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:55,620
 Henry, hang up that phone.

503
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:56,620
 But mother--

504
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:57,620
 Henry.

505
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:58,620
 Never mind, operator.

506
00:17:58,620 --> 00:17:59,620
 No.

507
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:02,620
 Would you mind telling me why you're calling Hollendale?

508
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:06,620
 She was a hen able to find out a single solitary thing about my blind day,

509
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:10,620
 just that she wore braces and was not need when she was eleven.

510
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:11,620
 So--

511
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:14,620
 So I decided to take the bull by the horns, so to speak, and phone her.

512
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:15,620
 What for?

513
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:17,620
 To ask her for a description of herself.

514
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:19,620
 Henry, don't you dare.

515
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:22,220
 My goodness, the very idea.

516
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:24,460
 Is that what your father told you to do?

517
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:25,700
 - Well, not exactly.

518
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,780
 - Sam!

519
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:27,860
 Sam Aldrich!

520
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:29,420
 - What's just going on into the garden?

521
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:32,740
 - Dear, what did you say to Henry about his blind aid?

522
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,060
 - Henry, suppose you run along.

523
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:35,660
 - Sure, Father, I'd be glad to.

524
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:37,620
 - Sam, whatever you said to Henry was enough

525
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:38,980
 to make him try to phone the girl

526
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,700
 and get her to describe herself.

527
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:41,540
 - What?

528
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:42,740
 - And if I hadn't caught him in time,

529
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:44,860
 our whole family would have been disgraced.

530
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:46,300
 - Henry was going to phone her.

531
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:47,300
 - Yes, Sam.

532
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:50,900
 I hope you're satisfied with what you and your blind dates have accomplished.

533
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:51,900
 But Alice, all I said was...

534
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,500
 I don't want to hear another word!

535
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,500
 Alice, Henry...

536
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,900
 Henry, we're going to...

537
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,900
 Number, please.

538
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,700
 Give me long distance.

539
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:04,300
 I want to speak to Hollendale, person to person.

540
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:13,100
 Hi, Jack.

541
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,700
 Oh, hello, Harry. Come on in.

542
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,460
 -Gee, I'm glad you dropped over, Harry.

543
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:17,540
 I was just gonna call you.

544
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:19,380
 There's something I've gotta ask you about.

545
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:22,100
 -Yeah? That's funny, because I wanted to ask you about something, too.

546
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,340
 -Oh, yeah? -Yeah.

547
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:24,340
 -What did you want to know, Jack?

548
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:27,540
 -Well, do you know a girl here in Hollendale named Martha Adams?

549
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:29,620
 -What? -You see, my father got a phone call

550
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:32,740
 from a man he knows in Centerville, and Mr. Aldrich,

551
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:34,700
 he wants to know something about this girl.

552
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,820
 -No kidding. -Yeah, he wants the information

553
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:38,020
 for his son, Henry.

554
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:39,540
 -I got a letter from his son, Henry.

555
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:40,580
 -Yup.

556
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:42,220
 Do you know him? -Nope.

557
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:43,540
 -Well, then how come he wrote to you?

558
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:44,860
 -Henry knows my cousin, Charlie.

559
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:45,860
 He lives in Centerville.

560
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:46,360
 Oh.

561
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,460
 He wants the same information.

562
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,620
 Oh, well, do you know her, Martha Adams, I mean?

563
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:50,500
 No, do you?

564
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:50,980
 No.

565
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:51,820
 Maybe a red nozer.

00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:52,980
 Yeah, why don't we phone him?

567
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,380
 That's a good idea.

00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:59,020
 Hey, this Martha Adams must be something

572
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:01,060
 if they've heard about her all the way over in Centerville.

573
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:02,420
 Yeah, I wonder if the father really

574
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:04,260
 wants the information for the son.

575
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:05,460

 Oh, hiya, Jack.

579
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,740
 Say I was just about to call you.

580
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:11,980
 Yeah, what about?

581
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:14,820
 Do you know a girl in town named Martha Adams?

 What?

583
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:18,820
 I got a letter from a kid in the center of asking about her.

584
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:19,820
 Signed Homer Brown.

585
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:20,820
 No, kidding.

 Yeah.

587
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:22,820
 Well, who's Homer Brown?

588
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:23,820
 I don't know.

589
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:25,820
 Then how come he wrote to you?

590
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:26,820
 Well, he didn't.

591
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:28,820
 Well, not exactly anyway.

592
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:31,820
 It seems his father once had some business with my father.

593
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:36,820
 So he addressed his letter to Sid Benson's son around 17 if he has one.

594

 What?

595

 Dear Henry Aldridge, your communication received and

603
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:07,740
 I wish to state the following.

604
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:11,400
 Physically speaking, I find her very satisfactory,

 - Oh, wait, a P.S.

608
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,880
 As regards your request for exact dimensions,

609
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,580
 I could think of no way to get them

610
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:25,640
 without arousing the suspicions of the party in question.

611
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,560
 - What's the difference?

612
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,800
 He finds it very satisfactory, doesn't he?

613
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,980
 - He seems to.

614
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:31,580
 Now, what does your letter say?

615
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:34,900

 - Hello, Mr. Aldrich, what do you say, him?

622
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:46,400
 - Henry, about that blind date of yours.

623
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,240
 - Yes, Father?

624
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:51,300
 - I happened to be speaking to a business associate of mine

625
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:53,380
 who happens to live in Hollendale,

626
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:56,760
 and just in passing, I happened to ask him

627
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,580
 if he knew a girl named Martha Adams.

628
00:21:58,580 --> 00:21:59,700
 - Did he, Father?

629
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:00,620
 - His son did.

630
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:02,580
 - Well, what does son have to say?

631
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:09,380
 Well, according to his son, Martha Adams is beautiful, talented, charming, delightful, and breathtaking.

632
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:10,940
 No kidding.

633
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:11,460

 I didn't.

 Of course not, Father.

 - Wait a minute.

 - What's the matter, Agnes?

666

 It's just two o'clock too early.

667
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:07,700
 - It certainly is.

668
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:10,580
 Especially since Martha may not be coming.

669
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:11,580

 - Because right out of a clear sky,

675
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:21,940
 she became very popular with a boy in Hollendale.

00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:22,780

 Why?

 - She doesn't know, but she is.

 She can have three separate dates for that weekend with Red Harry and Jack.

00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,200
 Disappointed.

725
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,920
 No, Henry.

726
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,760
 Gee.

727
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,600
 Henry?

728
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,600
 Yes, Martha?

729
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,840
 Well, how did you feel about the blind date?

730
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:23,080
 Before you met me, I mean, were you worried or anything?

731
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,000
 What?

732
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:24,840
 What for?

733
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:28,320
 Well, I might have been not very attractive to skinny

734
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,240
 or too fat or something like that.

735
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:34,000
 Gee, what is-- no, not you.

736
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,760
 You're sweet, Henry.

737
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,000
 Sorry.

738
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,600
 Thank you, Martha.

739
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,920
 But I mean, before you met me, well,

740
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:43,960
 didn't you even think about what I might look like?

741
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,960
 Well, to be perfectly frank about it, Martha,

742
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,080
 It did cross my mind for a moment.

743
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,720
 But I'll tell you how I feel about it.

744
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:57,240
 When a pal is in trouble, see, and asks a pal to help him out,

745
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,800
 well, what else can a pal--

746
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,300
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

747
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:16,600
 Listen, Agnes, boy, you sure were a real pal

748
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,680
 to write to Martha and fix things up.

749
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,520
 Would you mind telling me what you said?

750
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:23,680
 - Well, I told her you were passively good-looking.

751
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,520
 - Not handsome.

752
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,120
 - Are you kidding him?

753
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:26,960
 Then I told her--

754
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,560
 - Just passable?

755
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,120
 - Yeah, I figured after she got here,

756
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:33,480
 she wouldn't hold it against you that I exaggerated.

757
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:37,040
 - Now listen, Agnes, I thought you were a pal.

758
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,880
 - Well, here's a pal you can count on anyway.

759
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:43,760
 Jello Puddings, yup, your best friend at dessert time.

760
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,400
 Jello Chocolate Butterscotch and Vanilla Puddings,

761
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,360
 Chock full of old fashioned homemade goodness.

762
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,280
 Tomorrow, try chocolate peppermint pudding.

763
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:54,480
 Just prepare one package of smooth,

764
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,400
 velvety rich, yellow chocolate pudding as usual.

765
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:00,840
 While still warm, add crushed peppermint stick candy

766
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:03,040
 or peppermint extract to taste.

767
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:06,240
 Top it with fluffy whipped cream and sprigs of mint.

768
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,520
 You never taste it anything better.

769
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:11,600
 All three yellow puddings are made with milk and nourishing

770
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,240
 and they cook to luscious perfection

771
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,080
 in just about five minutes.

772
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:18,040
 No wonder more people buy jello puddings

773
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:21,040
 than any other prepared puddings in the world.

774
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,800
 (dramatic music)

775
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:31,080
 Here's hoping you'll be in your living room

776
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,280
 in hours next week at the same time.

777
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,280
 Good night, folks.

778
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:37,040

779
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:48,840
 The Old Rich Family starring Ezra Stone is Henry with Jackie Kelka's Homer is written

780
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:52,040
 by Frank Tarloff with music by Jack Miller.

781
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:56,560
 Mr. and Mrs. Old Rich are House Jamison and Catherine Rod.

782
00:27:56,560 --> 00:28:01,080
 And this is Dan Seymour in New York saying, "The Old Rich Family is brought to you by

783
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,600
 the Jell-O family."

784
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:07,600
 Oh, the Big Red Letter stand for the Jello Family.

785
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:11,600
 Oh, the Big Red Letter stand for the Jello Family.

786
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,600
 That's Jello, yum yum.

787
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,600
 Jello, yum yum yum.

788
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,600
 Jello, tat.

789
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:19,600
 The Oka Pudding, Jessary.

790
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:27,600
 New as new as an ice storm in the tropics.

791
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,600
 Amazing, the only one of its kind.

792
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,000
 That's minute rice.

793
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,600
 Minute rice for magically quick, quick meals.

794
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,900
 You fix minute rice quicker than potatoes.

795
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:38,100
 Just drop it in water and bring to a boil.

796
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:40,600
 No washing, rinsing, draining, steaming.

797
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,900
 Nothing else to do.

798
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:45,500
 And minute rice is light, white, and fluffy every time.

799
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:47,100
 The best rice you ever ate.

800
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,600
 Serve it for delicious, quick, quick meals.

801
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,100
 Remember the word minute.

802
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:53,600
 Minute rice in the red, white, and blue box.

00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:13,600
 Oh, Robert Montgomery.
