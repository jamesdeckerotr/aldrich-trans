00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
 [Music]

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.500
 And now, Jell-O Puddings present...

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.000
 Henry Henry O'Rourke!

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 Coming, mother!

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 [Applause]

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
 The Aldrich family, based on characters written into my triple gold medal,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
 and starring Ed Sreston as Henry with Jackie Countess Homer.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.000
 And here they are!

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:39.680
 Just a taste of jello puddings and believe me you will know they are made by famous J E L L

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:46.760
 Oh yes that was Henry and Homer in their own particular cheer song for jello puddings

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:52.240
 because you never tasted anything better jello chocolate butter scotch and vanilla puddings

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:57.120
 chock full of old fashioned homemade goodness try them compare them see if you don't say

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.400
 that jello puddings are richer, creamier, more all-round delicious, and they cook to perfection

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:07.560
 in just about five minutes. Above all, when it comes to jello puddings, you never taste

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:21.320
 in anything better.

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.520
 Now for the Aldrich family.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.120
 Happy times are sometimes pretty difficult to recall,

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.520
 but to many of us the happiest days of our life were those of our youth.

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:37.520
 An assured far way to relive them is to make the acquaintance of a typical teenage boy like Henry Aldrich.

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.120
 It's evening, and the scene opens at the Aldrich dinner table.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.320
 Sam, will you have some more potatoes?

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.920
 Yes, please, Alice.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:45.920
 Thank you.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:46.920
 Will you have some Mary?

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.120
 No, thank you, Mother.

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:49.120
 How about you, Henry?

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.120
 More potatoes?

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.960
 Henry?

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:52.800
 Henry?

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:53.620
 Henry.

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:55.040
 Henry.

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:55.960
 Mother?

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.040
 Yes?

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.520
 Well, please have some more potatoes.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.600
 What?

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.000
 Henry, do you feel well?

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.920
 Sure, I never felt better in my life.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:04.720
 Oh, my goodness.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.400
 You look as if you're half dead.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.240
 Is that the phone?

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.240
 That's the phone.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.560
 Henry, pick up that chair.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:10.560
 But the phone's ringing.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.720
 Henry, don't run.

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:12.720
 Turn that running.

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.040
 You'll stick on the whole rug.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.040
 No, I won't.

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.800
 Oh, oh.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:17.800
 What happened?

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.200
 I just slipped on the rug.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:31.200
 Hello Henry. Hello Cynthia. What are you doing?

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:40.200
 Having my supper. Really and truly.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.200
 What are you having?

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.200
 Lancha.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.200
 Aww.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.200
 What are you?

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:52.200
 Well, to tell you the truth, I can't remember.

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.200
 Well.

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.200
 Well.

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.200
 Well.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.200
 Goodbye, Henry.

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.200
 Goodbye, Cynthia.

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.200
 Henry, where are you?

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.200
 Here in the living room, Father.

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.200
 What are you doing?

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.200
 I thought I'd listen to the radio a while.

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.500
 But Henry, what about your supper?

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.200
 Supper? Oh, oh gee, I forgot.

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.700
 You forgot. You forgot you were right in the middle of supper?

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.500
 Okay, Mary. If you're so interested in eating, why don't you go on and eat?

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.500
 Henry, there's no need to snap at your system.

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.900
 But father, she snapped at me first.

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.900
 I did not. My goodness, a person can't even ask you a civil question these days.

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.900
 All right, Mary, that's enough.

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.100
 Well, I wonder how Kathleen is enjoying her little vacation.

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:36.100
 Oh, is Kathleen away?

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.340
 My goodness Father, don't you remember how Henry soaked around here for days after she left?

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:41.820
 All right Mary.

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:45.020
 Have you written to Kathleen recently Henry?

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:46.020
 Henry?

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:47.020
 No one?

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:49.660
 Oh, no thanks Mother, I don't care for any.

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.660
 You don't care for any of what?

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:53.660
 Whatever Mother was offering me.

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.220
 Fear I wasn't offering you anything.

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.580
 I merely asked if you've written to Kathleen.

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:59.580
 Kathleen?

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:00.580
 Yes dear.

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:01.580
 Kathleen Anderson.

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:02.580
 Oh her?

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.180
 No, she hasn't.

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:05.180
 She hasn't what?

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:06.180
 He hasn't what?

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:07.180
 Written to me.

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.740
 Dear, that isn't what I asked you.

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:11.220
 I mean, she hasn't phoned.

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.020
 Oh, that reminds me.

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:14.020
 Where are you going?

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:15.980
 Now it's my turn to phoned Cynthia.

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:17.380
 Henry, you're dinner.

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:18.380
 Henry!

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:19.380
 Henry!

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:20.380
 Henry!

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:21.380
 Well, my goodness.

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.820
 Sam, what are we going to do?

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.500
 There's anything to worry about, Alice.

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:26.820
 They all go through it.

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.300
 Not like this.

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:32.140
 Ever since he met that Cynthia, he seems to have completely lost his mind.

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:33.140
 That's what I say, Mother.

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.340
 How far is he's just lost his part?

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.280
 It's a perfectly normal reaction.

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:38.280
 Reaction to what?

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.500
 Spring, Alice, spring.

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.100
 It's just a little late catching up with Henry, that's all.

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:43.780
 Well, if Summer doesn't get here soon,

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:44.980
 he's going to starve to death.

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:46.580
 Just look at his plate.

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:48.860
 And Sam, I'm sure he's not studying.

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:50.360
 That's not abnormal.

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.220
 And now Sam.

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:52.500
 All right, if it's going to worry,

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.780
 you just forbid him to see the girl for a few weeks.

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:56.620
 Oh, no, Sam, I couldn't do that.

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:57.460
 Why not?

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.780
 Well, Henry's extremely sensitive.

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.020
 We might give him a complex he'd never get over.

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:08.420
 nonsense Alice. The thing to do is diverting. If I could just keep him from going over to Cynthia's for one evening.

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:11.020
 My goodness, look at the time. I'll have to hurry.

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:16.020
 Where are you going there? No, down to the church. I promised Helen Forbes I'd vendor something blue.

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:18.020
 Something blue? What is it?

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:21.020
 But just something, Father. Oh. Oh.

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:23.020
 When is she getting married there?

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:26.020
 On Saturday. They're having the rehearsal down at the church tonight.

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:30.020
 Helen Forbes. Is she that pretty girl who's been over here a few times?

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:31.820
 Yes, Father, she's a friend of mine.

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:35.620
 Well, a friend of yours, and she's getting married.

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:37.020
 Wow.

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.020
 Sam, how are you looking at Mary like that?

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:41.620
 Father, she's three years older than I am.

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:46.420
 My won't hella make a beautiful bride with that lovely blonde hair.

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:47.220
 Mother?

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:48.620
 Well, hello there, Henry.

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:50.020
 Nice to have you with us.

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:51.220
 Yes, sir. Well, goodbye.

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:52.420
 Yeah, where are you going?

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:54.420
 No place, Mother. Just over to Cynthia.

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:55.020
 Again?

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.420
 She was, Mary. I haven't been there since last night.

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:59.420
 Hey, Henry.

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:02.300
 Well, here's Homer. Isn't that nice?

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:03.660
 Huh? What does he want?

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:04.620
 Hi everybody.

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:05.020
 Hi, Henry.

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:28.220
 Hey, Henry, I'm afraid you won't be able to see Cynthia tonight after all.

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:28.700
 I won't.

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:30.700
 I want you to run an errand for me.

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:32.700
 Mother, Mary, please run and get that puzzle.

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:33.700
 Let's go to the chair.

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:37.700
 Oh, but Mother, now Mary, I think Henry is definitely the one to deliver it.

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:39.700
 Oh, oh, I understand.

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:41.700
 You understand what, Mary?

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:43.700
 Mary, are you doing anything to learn?

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:46.700
 Mother, look, I've already promised Cynthia.

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:51.700
 Now, dear, I'm sure you think more of your own mother than you do with Cynthia.

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:54.700
 Even though she's a very nice girl in her own way.

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:55.700
 Oh, sure, but...

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:56.700
 Well, sure.

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:57.700
 Now, please go and get your coat on.

00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:58.700
 Well, sure, but...

00:06:58.700 --> 00:06:59.900
 Henry, do what your mother said.

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:00.700
 Good fun!

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:01.700
 Yes, Father, I'm doing it.

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:03.700
 Oh, dear.

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:04.700
 What's the matter?

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:07.700
 Just occurred to me, Sam, a wedding rehearsal.

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:08.700
 What about it?

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:13.700
 I wonder if I should expose Henry to an atmosphere like that in his present frame of mind.

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:15.700
 On the contrary, Alice, I think it should do him good.

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:16.700
 You do?

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:17.700
 Yes.

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:20.700
 Might make him realize the finality of it all.

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:22.700
 Sam, what do you mean by that?

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:33.700
 [Music]

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:40.700
 Now then we'll begin the rehearsal at beginning. The room stands here. Here Mr. Carson, that's right Tom, and the best man here.

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:45.700
 That's right. Now the ushers leave the procession. The bridesmaid is next door.

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:46.700
 Yes Mr. Carson.

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:48.460
 And of course, the bride.

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:50.140
 And may I take this opportunity, Helen,

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:52.980
 to say that a prettier bride has never graced this church.

00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:54.300
 Thank you, Mr. Carson.

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:56.140
 Now then, we'll start with the procession.

00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:58.660
 You don't want me to walk down the aisle now, do you, Mr. Carson?

00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:00.300
 Oh, no, Helen, it's bad love.

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:01.180
 Of course.

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:02.140
 Doreen will take your place.

00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:02.800
 All right.

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:04.700
 Would you mind if I stepped out to the vestibule

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:06.340
 for a little air until you're ready for me?

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:07.620
 Go right ahead, Helen.

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:09.340
 We'll let you know when we're ready to rehearse this,

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:10.020
 everybody.

00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:10.860
 Thank you.

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:12.980
 Now, are we all ready?

00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:15.460
 You ready at the organ, Mrs. McLean?

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:16.960
 - Yes, we can talk.

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:19.160
 - Let's go, let's go round the head and start.

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:20.160
 - Oh, hello.

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:21.200
 Are you looking for somebody?

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:22.040
 - Yes, I am.

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:24.300
 I'm looking for some girl, co-op.

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:25.140
 Co-op.

00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:28.140
 Jean, what is?

00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:29.140
 - What's the matter?

00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:29.980
 - What's the matter?

00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:30.820
 - What's the matter?

00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:31.660
 - Hello.

00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:32.500
 - Hello.

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:35.420
 - See, I didn't expect to see anybody as pretty as you.

00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:38.860
 I mean, you know what a wedding everybody

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:40.700
 is usually pretty old.

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:42.260
 - Oh, yes, I guess they are.

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.060
 Who did you say you were looking for?

00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:45.340
 - I...

00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:46.840
 I can't remember.

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:47.840
 You can't.

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:49.100
 Well, what's your name?

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:50.100
 Why?

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:51.100
 Henry?

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:52.100
 Henry!

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:53.100
 My name's Helen.

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:54.100
 Helen Ford.

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:55.100
 Well, you're the one.

00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:56.740
 You're the one I have to give this to.

00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:57.740
 Well, very much.

00:08:57.740 --> 00:08:58.740
 What is it?

00:08:58.740 --> 00:08:59.740
 My sister, Mary, wouldn't tell me.

00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:00.740
 Oh, I understand.

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:02.220
 This is from Mary Oldridge.

00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:03.380
 You're her brother.

00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:04.380
 Yeah.

00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:05.380
 She's my sister.

00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:06.380
 [LAUGHTER]

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:09.020
 She's getting married anyway.

00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:11.020
 Oh, there she is.

00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:13.020
 Walking down the aisle.

00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:25.020
 The Eleanor who the poor guy is. Oh, you don't believe in marriage? Well, I don't know. See you get married and all the romance goes right out of life, except in certain cases that is.

00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:38.020
 Well, how do you mean it? Well, you take... you take... are you married? Not yet. Me either. I mean... well, she was, I guess I'd better be running along. Goodbye, Miss.

00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:39.020
 Miss...

00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:40.020
 Goodbye, Anna.

00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:41.020
 Goodbye.

00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:42.020
 Ellen.

00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:44.020
 Hi, Hannah, old timer.

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:47.020
 Homer, what are you doing here?

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:48.020
 I just...

00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:50.020
 I just happen to be passing.

00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:52.020
 See, what a coincidence.

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:54.020
 Say, "Hend me."

00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:55.020
 And...

00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:57.020
 Say, "Listen, do you know what's on at the B-Shoe tonight?"

00:09:57.020 --> 00:09:58.020
 What?

00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:00.020
 The best cowboy movie you ever saw.

00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:03.020
 I've seen it three times and it gets better every time.

00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:04.020
 Excuse me, Homer.

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:06.020
 Will you stop jumping in front of me?

00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:07.020
 Oh, boy.

00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:13.020
 When you're still going over to see Cynthia? Cynthia? Yeah. Cynthia who?

00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:28.020
 Good morning, mother. Good morning, father. Good morning. Sit right down, Harry. Your breakfast is all ready.

00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:31.020
 My goodness, I'm starved. She isn't there for a lovely morning.

00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:34.020
 My, I can't remember when I've seen her nice, so day.

00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:36.420
 Yes, looks just like an ordinary day to me.

00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:39.020
 Well, perhaps it's because I feel so happy.

00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:41.520
 Sam, did you know my little plan worked?

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:42.320
 What did it land?

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:45.220
 D'youverting Henry last night by sending him over to the church.

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:47.820
 He's completely lost interest in Cynthia.

00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:50.820
 Now Alice, a reversal like that could hardly take place in a few hours.

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:52.020
 Well, it has.

00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:56.420
 Cynthia phoned here this morning and Henry asked me to tell her he was out of town.

00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:57.220
 Really, Mother?

00:10:57.220 --> 00:10:58.420
 Is that so?

00:10:58.420 --> 00:10:59.820
 You mean he's back to normal?

00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:01.320
 Absolutely, dear.

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:01.820
 Well...

00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:03.620
 Good evening, everybody.

00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:08.820
 What? I mean good afternoon. I mean what time is it? It's morning.

00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:19.060
 Oh. May 1948. Friday. Friday? Oh then I have to go to school. Well goodbye everybody.

00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:25.620
 Henry you haven't eaten your breakfast. Oh I haven't. Okay. He's out of town all right.

00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:31.540
 He's out of the world. He's saying you're mistaken about the whole thing. Yeah. Henry.

00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:32.540
 Yes, Father?

00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:34.540
 Done your Christmas shopping, Dad?

00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:37.540
 And not yet, I'll get around to it sometime this week.

00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:39.540
 Mom, my goodness!

00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:42.540
 Hey Henry, are you going to school?

00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:43.540
 I'm coming, Homer.

00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:45.540
 Henry, haven't you forgotten something?

00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:48.540
 Oh, sure. Merry Christmas.

00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:49.540
 Hey, Mommy, how are you?

00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:51.540
 My head old pal.

00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:52.540
 Hi.

00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:53.540
 We are so dreaming.

00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:55.540
 I know, hold my books a second, Mommy.

00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:57.540
 Sure, old Tyler.

00:11:57.540 --> 00:11:58.540
 Hello?

00:11:58.540 --> 00:11:59.540
 Hello, is that Henry?

00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:00.540
 Yeah, who's this?

00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:04.540
 Oh boy, oh boy, Homer beat it.

00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:06.540
 Well, she was.

00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:07.540
 Hello, Helen.

00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:08.540
 Hello.

00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:09.540
 How are you?

00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:11.540
 Imagine you phoning.

00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:13.540
 I mean, how are you?

00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:14.540
 I'm just fine, thank you.

00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:16.540
 Could I speak to Mary, please?

00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:17.540
 Mary?

00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:18.540
 Wouldn't I do?

00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:19.540
 But you could give her the message.

00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:23.540
 I just wanted to thank her for that package she sent over last night.

00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:24.540
 Well, gee, I'll tell her.

00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:25.540
 All right, thank you, Henry.

00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:26.540
 Goodbye.

00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:27.540
 Wait a minute.

00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:28.540
 Yes.

00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:33.540
 I mean, while you're on the phone, boy, isn't this a nice day?

00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:37.540
 Yes, it's lovely. I only hope it's a nice tomorrow.

00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:40.540
 Tomorrow? Is anything special happening tomorrow?

00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:42.540
 Right. In a way, yes.

00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:45.540
 Oh, I guess you have to go to that darn wedding, huh?

00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:47.540
 Yes, I think I should.

00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:50.540
 Well, Gee, do you really have to? Couldn't they get along without you?

00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:54.540
 Henry, do you happen to know who's getting married tomorrow?

00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:57.540
 Who cares? And listen, Helen, you can take it from me.

00:12:57.540 --> 00:13:02.940
 whole things pretty boring. Sure, she was all the same. You've been to one, you've

00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:03.940
 been to them all.

00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:07.940
 Henry, why don't you come along tomorrow? I don't think you'll find it boring.

00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:08.940
 You're inviting me?

00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:09.940
 Yes, will you come?

00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:14.740
 Well, I come, well, I come. I'll say. And look, what are you doing afterwards?

00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:17.540
 Well, I'll see you afterwards, Henry.

00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:19.540
 You will? You will?

00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:20.540
 Goodbye now.

00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:24.540
 Oh boy, goodbye. Oh boy, Homer.

00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:27.040
 Hey, Henry, we're going to be late.

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:29.700
 Homer, guess who that was that just phoned me?

00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:30.880
 Helen Forbes.

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:32.200
 Helen Forbes?

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:34.160
 The Helen Forbes, it's a friend of Mary's?

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:35.320
 Yeah.

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:37.040
 Henry, why are you looking like that?

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:39.760
 She's old enough to be your grandmother.

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:40.600
 Oh yeah?

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:42.440
 Well, I'll tell you how old she is, Homer.

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:44.600
 She just made a date with me for tomorrow.

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:45.440
 Tomorrow.

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:46.280
 Yeah, for a wedding.

00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:48.360
 And then we're going out someplace afterwards.

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:51.000
 Well, Henry, tomorrow is a perfectly good Saturday.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.560
 I plan on us going someplace swelled them on.

00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:54.920
 Let's see, where could I take her?

00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:56.640
 I thought we might go on a swelled picnic.

00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:57.640
 Say, a picnic.

00:13:57.640 --> 00:13:58.640
 What do we have to do?

00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:00.320
 Oh, that's a wonderful idea.

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:01.440
 We'll go to a ball game.

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:01.940
 We will.

00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:05.560
 I got a hell of love ball games.

00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:07.320
 We only have to take Helen.

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:10.440
 Homer, I'm sorry, but there won't be room for you.

00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:11.640
 The room?

00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:13.560
 Could Henry want to be come of me?

00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:16.560
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:31.780
 For something very special in grand desserts, try those exciting new members of the famous

00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:33.700
 Jello pudding family.

00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:38.140
 Jello tapioca puddings, a miracle of goodness, a marvel of speed.

00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:44.220
 Get that luscious-like jello vanilla tapioca, or that rich candy-good jello chocolate tapioca.

00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:48.180
 And now newest of all comes Jello Orange Coconut Tapioca.

00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:53.260
 Man, that tempting orange flavor with coconut added is the most glamorous dessert yet.

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:55.700
 It's cramp full of fresh, tangy goodness.

00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:57.780
 It's wonderfully rich and creamy.

00:14:57.780 --> 00:15:02.260
 All three Jello Tapioca Puddings are ready prepared, quick as a flash to fix, and nothing

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:03.340
 to go wrong.

00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:07.940
 All you do is add the milk, then cook in an ordinary saucepan, and Jello Tapioca Puddings

00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:11.300
 cook to rich perfection in just about five minutes.

00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:17.940
 Vanilla tapioca, jello chocolate tapioca, and newest of all, jello orange coconut tapioca.

00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:29.380
 Ask for jello tapioca puddings, a miracle of goodness, a marvel of speed.

00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:38.180
 And now getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldrich.

00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:41.940
 In the spring a young man's fancy, well you know the rest of it.

00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:46.340
 This particular spring, Henry's fancy, has turned to a young lady who happens to be getting

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:47.340
 married.

00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:50.260
 But Henry thinks she's planning on spending the day with him.

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:54.140
 The scene opens in a center of ill, florist's job.

00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:56.500
 Now set that basket of lilies over here where it's cool.

00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:57.500
 Careful of the roses.

00:15:57.500 --> 00:16:00.140
 Oh Mr. and the bride's bouquet, I'll do that myself.

00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:02.060
 Yes, sir, may I help you?

00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:03.060
 Yes, sir.

00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:06.780
 Please, I'd like to order a corsage and I'm in a hurry.

00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:07.780
 A corsage?

00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:09.380
 Please, a flower?

00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:10.580
 What kind of flowers?

00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:13.780
 Well, I'll tell you, it's for a girl to wear to a wedding scene.

00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:16.980
 I've spent most of my money for tickets to the baseball game.

00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:19.180
 How about a nice spring corsage of daisies?

00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:21.380
 Well, gee, I don't know.

00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:22.580
 You take daisies.

00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:23.780
 They're the cheapest we've got.

00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:24.780
 They are?

00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:26.380
 Well, yes.

00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:28.580
 Yes, I think daisies would be just about perfect.

00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:29.080
 Sure.

00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:30.780
 I'll make up a corsage right away.

00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:32.580
 I hope you don't mind if I rush you a little.

00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:34.580
 We're very busy getting ready for the wedding this afternoon.

00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:35.280
 The wedding?

00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:36.980
 Yeah, I'm getting ready for that too.

00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:39.660
 You have to get a haircut and get my shoes shined.

00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:42.320
 I sure am be the lucky guy that wins Helen Forbes today.

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:43.380
 Helen Forbes?

00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:45.380
 Well, she wins, that's me.

00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:45.880
 You?

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:46.580
 Sure.

00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:47.480
 Go on.

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:49.880
 Yeah, boy, I can hardly believe it myself.

00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:51.200
 But I thought you'd be--

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:52.960
 well, aren't you a little--

00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:54.720
 well, congratulations.

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:55.280
 Thank you.

00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:57.320
 I certainly wish you all the best of luck.

00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:59.080
 And may all your troubles be little ones.

00:16:59.080 --> 00:16:59.480
 Yes.

00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:00.400
 What, sir?

00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:02.520
 But say, what do you want these daisies for?

00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:03.960
 Why, they're for Helen.

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:05.040
 Miss Forbes?

00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:06.680
 But her flowers have already been ordered.

00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:08.680
 Van? What kind did she order?

00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:09.680
 White roses.

00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:10.680
 White roses?

00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:12.680
 How much is that going to cost me?

00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:13.680
 Oh, they're all paid for.

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:15.680
 They are? They're paid for?

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:18.680
 Well, gee whiz, that's considerate of her.

00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:20.680
 Hey Henry!

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:21.680
 Oh, Homer.

00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:24.680
 Gee, old timer, what a coincidence.

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:28.680
 I just happened to be passing in just by coincidence. I saw you in here.

00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:30.680
 Yeah, well, it's been nice seeing you, Homer.

00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:32.680
 Isn't this a swell day, Hen?

00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:35.680
 Yeah. Just forget about those daisies, mister.

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:39.040
 Okay. Isn't it a perfect day for a picnic?

00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:45.040
 Hand? Boy, you see out of his mind, he doesn't know what he's doing.

00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:47.760
 He does seem pretty young to be taking a step like this.

00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:50.980
 Well he does the same thing every spring.

00:17:50.980 --> 00:17:55.520
 Every spring? Sure. One thing though, it doesn't last long.

00:17:55.520 --> 00:18:01.040
 How long? About a week. Now wait a minute, do you mean to say he only stays married for a week?

00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:03.360
 Mary. Mary.

00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:05.360
 - We're sure. Didn't you know he's getting married today?

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:07.080
 - Who told you? Who told you?

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:07.740
 - He did.

00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:12.720
 - Oh boy, I knew I would come to this. Oh boy.

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:15.300
 (upbeat music)

00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:22.840
 - Halle!

00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:24.480
 - I'm in the living room, Sam.

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:25.320
 - Where's Mary?

00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:28.560
 - She's upstairs getting ready for Henry Ford's wedding.

00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:31.400
 - Oh, is that today? Well, I'm glad we don't have to go.

00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:33.400
 Don't you like weddings there?

00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:35.400
 One's enough in any man's life.

00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:37.400
 Mother! Mother!

00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:38.400
 Yes, Henry?

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:40.400
 Where's my blue shirt suit?

00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:42.400
 It's in your closet, dear.

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:44.400
 Well, I think maybe I'll go out to the golf course.

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:47.400
 Mother! Mother!

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:48.400
 What is it, Henry?

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:50.400
 Who hid my polka dot tie?

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:53.400
 Then nobody hid it. It's in your top drawer.

00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:57.400
 No, it is, and I dumped out every one of my drawers, and it is.

00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:59.400
 Oh

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:07.920
 That's where's he going this afternoon. I think to a baseball game. He's wearing his blue-seared suit to a baseball game

00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:10.200
 What's he going to do umpire?

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:17.040
 I haven't wanted to worry you, but frankly the whole thing has me puzzled to how do you mean well first thing this morning?

00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:20.920
 He borrowed a dollar for a cosage. He said his life depended on it of course I

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:25.160
 Sam I asked him who it was for and do you know what he said?

00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:25.660
 What?

00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:26.660
 Sam he heads.

00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:28.660
 Well, he's probably taking some girl.

00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:33.160
 But dear, if he's just taking a girl to a baseball game, why wouldn't he come out and say so?

00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:36.160
 And do you know he hasn't eaten a bite of food since yesterday?

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:38.160
 Hey Mrs. Aldrich!

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:40.160
 Ah, this can't we keep that front door locked?

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:44.160
 Every time I try it, Sam he comes in the dining room window.

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:47.160
 Oh, there he is, why?

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:52.000
 I just want to say Mrs. Aldrich and Mr. Aldrich that you can count on me.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.760
 Wait, such as the can.

00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:56.560
 You'll miss Henry at first, sure.

00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:59.280
 But I'll try to be a real son to you.

00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:00.640
 I beg your pardon.

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:04.480
 Only boy, after all these years, wouldn't you think he would at least have told me?

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:05.480
 Tell you what?

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:07.880
 Well, I'm not holding it against him, Mr. Aldrich.

00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:12.440
 Gee, if he wants somebody else to be best man, Gee, I understand.

00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:13.440
 Now, wait a minute.

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:14.440
 Homer, what are you talking about?

00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:16.920
 Well, you know when Henry gets married.

00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:20.920
 Oh, well, I'm sure you'll be best man, dear.

00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:23.920
 But Henry won't be getting married for some time.

00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:26.920
 She was, don't you think this afternoon's pretty close?

00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:27.920
 This afternoon!

00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:28.920
 -Sant!

00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:41.920
 Who is it?

00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:43.920
 Oh, Father!

00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:44.920
 May I come in, son?

00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:45.920
 Sure, Father.

00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:49.720
 Come on in. I hope you don't mind if I go on getting ready.

00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:54.480
 You go right ahead. You are getting ready for something pretty important.

00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:57.560
 I'll say. Boy, this is the biggest day of my life.

00:20:57.560 --> 00:21:01.360
 I see. Going to the baseball game, I saw?

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:03.280
 Yes, sir. That's one of the things.

00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:07.760
 I see. Well, now, I hope you won't think I'm trying, but

00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:10.520
 would you feel like telling me what the other things are?

00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:14.480
 Just something I'm doing first, Father. I don't think you'd be interested.

00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:15.480
 I might be.

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:17.400
 Well, you don't leave laugh at me.

00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:18.400
 Oh, why should I laugh?

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:20.760
 I think I was too young.

00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:24.840
 I mean, just because a girl happens to be a couple years one way or the other.

00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:27.360
 I suppose I give you my word, I won't laugh.

00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:30.880
 Well, I'm just stopping off at the church for a little while.

00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:31.880
 [LAUGHTER]

00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:32.880
 That church.

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:33.880
 I see.

00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:35.920
 Deep father, it's the funniest thing.

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:37.840
 I never even thought she was interested in.

00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:42.520
 Boy, right out of a clear blue sky, she asks me point blank.

00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:43.520
 She asks you?

00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:45.440
 Sure, that's the wonderful part.

00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:47.340
 Boy, I never could have gotten around,

00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:49.560
 get up enough nerve to ask her.

00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:52.160
 She even paid for her own flowers.

00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:55.920
 Henry, did it occur to you that your mother and I

00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:57.360
 might have liked to meet her?

00:21:57.360 --> 00:21:58.520
 You have met her father.

00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:00.280
 Her name's Helen Forbes.

00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:01.600
 Helen Forbes?

00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:03.840
 But she's going to-- Helen Forbes?

00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:04.880
 What's the matter for him?

00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:06.040
 Excuse me.

00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:07.640
 Gee, he was.

00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:08.480
 Alice.

00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:09.240
 Sam, what did he say?

00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:10.040
 Did you find out?

00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:11.360
 Alice has nothing to worry about.

00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:12.640
 I don't know where he got the idea,

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:14.720
 but he thinks he's marrying Helen Ford.

00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:15.560
 - Huh?

00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:16.400
 Oh my, Henry.

00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:18.200
 - So all we have to do is to tell him point, Blake,

00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:19.560
 that she's marrying somebody else.

00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:21.120
 - Sam, we can't possibly do that.

00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:21.960
 - Why not?

00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:23.840
 - A sensitive boy like Henry?

00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:26.520
 Sam, we'll have to find a way to soften the blow.

00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:29.320
 A shop like that could turn him against women for life.

00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:31.900
 (upbeat music)

00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:36.320
 - Hello, mother.

00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:38.560
 I'm phoning from the Haven's drugstore.

00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:41.500
 And look, do we have any rice at home?

00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:42.500
 We don't.

00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:45.000
 But mother, I have to have some.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.900
 And listen, if your best friend was getting married, what would you think of a pair of

00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:51.900
 stuffed rattlesnakes for a present?

00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:53.100
 One for each of them.

00:22:53.100 --> 00:23:04.500
 Well, Miss Forbes, Miss Forbes, the minister is waiting.

00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:05.500
 Everyone's ready to stop.

00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:07.500
 Everyone will just have to wait, Mr. Burgess.

00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:09.500
 Please hold everything up for a few minutes.

00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:11.000
 Now then, Mrs. Aldrich, where were we?

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.600
 Well, first of all, Helen, I'd better be the one to tell him.

00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:14.400
 Yes, I think so.

00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:15.800
 And then I'll give him his new wristwatch.

00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:16.500
 Yes, Mary.

00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:19.900
 And then I'll tell him that he's going on a nice trip to visit his Uncle John.

00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:21.700
 And I'll tell him about doubling his allowance.

00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:23.500
 And then Helen, you step forward.

00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:26.800
 Yes, and I'll say, "Henry, we want to be good friends of yours, Tom and I."

00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:27.300
 That's good.

00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:30.900
 "We want you to know that our house is open to you and we hope to see you there often."

00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:32.500
 Why, that's lovely.

00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:34.600
 And Helen, I'll promise to keep him away.

00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:35.400
 No.

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:37.000
 Has anyone know where...

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:37.800
 ...where Henry is?

00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:39.500
 I think he's out in the vestibule.

00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:42.500
 Come along, everyone. Oh, not you, Helen. You wait a minute.

00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:52.500
 - Henry. - Father.

00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:55.500
 - And mother. She wins. What are you doing here?

00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:58.500
 - Well, dear. - Hello, Henry.

00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:01.500
 - Henry. - Yes, mother.

00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:03.500
 - Henry. - Excuse me.

00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:06.500
 But does anybody happen to know why the wedding is being held?

00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:08.500
 - Yes, Doreen. - Margie.

00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:14.500
 Hello. Hello. And my name is Doreen. I'm a bridesmaid.

00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:20.500
 Yes, you are. See, you're about the prettiest bridesmaid I ever...

 - Congratulations, and many of them.

00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:08.700
 Long life and happiness.

00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:09.940
 Happy wedding day.

00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:11.380
 - Hey, cut it out!

00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:12.980

00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:15.180
 - Macaroni, I couldn't get any money.

00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:16.020
 (audience laughing)

00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:17.540
 - No, listen, Homer.

00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:20.540
 (audience laughing)

00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:23.720
 (audience applauding)

00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:26.300
 (upbeat music)

00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:36.780
 Boy, Homer, after what we've been through, do I need a pick up?

00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:38.300
 Come on, let's go down to dehaven.

00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:39.300
 Sure, him.

00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:42.980
 Only thing is, gee, we've only got a nickel between us.

00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:45.300
 Come on, think fast, Homer, think fast.

00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:48.540
 Well, Henry, when I came through your kitchen.

00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:49.540
 Yeah.

00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:52.980
 Just by coincidence, the refrigerated door sort of opened.

00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:57.660
 And just by coincidence, there was a bowl of yellow butterscotch pudding.

00:25:57.660 --> 00:25:59.160
 marshmallows on top.

00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:02.020
 Boy, Homer, what are we waiting for?

00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:04.220
 That's a swell idea.

00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:07.780
 Why, of course, jello puddings always are a swell idea,

00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:10.620
 because you never tasted anything better.

00:26:10.620 --> 00:26:13.460
 Jello chocolate, butter, scotch, and vanilla puddings,

00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:14.940
 a trio of treats.

00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:17.180
 And that's why folks enjoy them so much.

00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:19.020
 Sure, jello puddings are nourishing.

00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:20.980
 Sure, they look tempting and luscious,

00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:22.740
 and sure, they're easy to fix.

00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:24.380
 But the main thing about jello puddings

00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:30.260
 It is they taste so grand, smooth as cream, chock full of old-fashioned homemade goodness.

00:26:30.260 --> 00:26:31.820
 They're made with milk and nourishing.

00:26:31.820 --> 00:26:34.380
 They cook to perfection in just about five minutes.

00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:52.140
 But first and foremost, when it comes to jello puddings, you never tasted anything better.

00:26:52.140 --> 00:26:56.600
 hoping you'll be in your living room and ours next week at this same time tonight

00:26:56.600 --> 00:27:03.600
