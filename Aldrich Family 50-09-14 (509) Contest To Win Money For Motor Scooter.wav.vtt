00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 Somebody once said, "When trouble comes, it never rains but that it pours."

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 But with Henry Orridge, it's just one long deluge.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 Boy, Homer, wait a year, see ya.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 Henry, I don't want to be late for school.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 Don't worry, it's right on the way.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
 Listen, Henry, if it's such a bargain, how come nobody's grabbed it all?

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 Well, Gee whiz, Homer, not everybody can use a motor scooter.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 And you sure are giving it away?

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.600
 Well, not exactly giving it, but it's almost the same thing.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.000
 There it is, Homer.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 Where?

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.400
 Can't you see the sign?

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.800
 Use cars.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.700
 Get a square deal from Chris O'Neill.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.000
 But where's the scooter?

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
 There, right under the sun.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.600
 Boy, Henry.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.600
 Boy.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:08.600
 You like it, huh?

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:09.600
 Mm-hmm.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.600
 Mm-hmm.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.000
 But show me where it says they're giving it away.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.600
 Can't you read all my name from the handlebars?

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.600
 Special.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.600
 Me and your own price.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.800
 You know what, I mean, I think I'll go in and buy it, right?

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:21.640
 right now.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.300
 - Can we look at the time we have to be at school

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:24.680
 in three and a half minutes?

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.240
 - Oh my no, one will take me to go in

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.160
 and buy that scooter at my own price.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.400
 - Boy, Henry, you're forgetting about Ms. Siegel.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.400
 - Let's go.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.240
 - Forget it, Homer.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.480
 Her bark is worse than her bite.

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:35.480
 - Oh no, Henry.

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:36.960
 She's never tried to bite me,

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.960
 but her bark is bad enough.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:39.800
 - Hurry up.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.380
 (upbeat music)

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.380
 And I am the best friend of the world.

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:54.380
 Good morning, Henry. Good morning, Homer.

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.380
 Good morning, Mr. Goulston.

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.380
 A noble effort, but I think you would just send it to the lake.

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.380
 I don't like to disagree with you, Mr. Goulston, but we won't.

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.380
 No, I'll be here when the bell rings,

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.380
 because if anybody needs ancient history, it's you too.

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:16.380
 Oh, uh, by the way, class, the Emporium Department Store is running a quiz contest for students.

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.380
 I'm sure you're all thrilled at the prospect.

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.380
 Is anyone interested?

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.380
 I'm overwhelmed that you're response.

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.380
 All right, class.

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:33.380
 Now, today we're going to talk about the development of commerce in copies and its threats to the Roman Empire.

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.380
 I hope you'll find it interesting, Henry.

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.380
 Oh, I'm sure I will, Mr. Dagobson.

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:45.380
 Thank you. Although it first lands, it would be in the mighty way of remembering.

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:50.380
 When somebody finds the scooter before we go get back, boy, that would be a dirty trade.

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.380
 No, you don't want to go on. I'm going down to the ring one round.

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.380
 I'll bring my head to the ring. Okay, Henry, I'll go with you.

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.380
 I'm about, and the old Rick stand up.

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.380
 Yes, Miss Siegel, sir.

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.380
 May I ask why will it bring?

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.380
 We didn't know who disturbed the class.

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.620
 (audience laughing)

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.420
 - It is a very commendable.

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.340
 Now, would you mind paying a little attention

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.300
 to ancient history?

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.380
 I know it's a very dull subject

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.300
 and it's not very important.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:21.860
 And that it really means nothing

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.540
 and you shouldn't even have to learn it here in school.

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:25.640
 - Gee, where's Ms. Agleton?

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.020
 That isn't your fault.

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:28.580
 - To downbook you.

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:29.660
 - Yes, Ms. Agleton?

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:30.580
 - Yes, Ms. Agleton.

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.260
 - Henry, I'm going to see

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.740
 if you've been getting anything out of these classes.

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:39.380
 Am I safe in assuming that you've heard of Rome?

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.300
 Oh, yes ma'am.

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.580
 And am I safe in further assuming that you know Rome

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:45.980
 was at war with Gaul?

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:47.220
 Yes, in a tagleston.

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.460
 Well, can you tell me the date of that war?

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:52.300
 Date.

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.780
 Well, gee, I have a wonderful memory for faces,

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.820
 but I can't remember dates at all.

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.940
 Well, Rich, I ought to see you during lunch hour.

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:01.820
 You do?

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:02.940
 Lunch hour?

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.620
 Even though I plan on something else?

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.420
 You make 16 minutes to eat and then report here.

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:08.420
 15 minutes?

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:10.420
 Well, what about my indigestion?

 They haven't sold it yet.

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:22.720
 Boy.

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.780
 Now listen, and they'll be smart.

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.420
 Don't let them know you want it.

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:28.380
 Pretend you're interested in something else,

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:29.700
 then they won't raise the price.

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.180
 You're absolutely right.

 Hello, boys. Can I do anything for you? My name is Randall.

 Oh, we're just looking around, Mr. Randall.

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.660
 Well, we've got the best buys in town.

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:43.500
 You have anything special in mind?

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.420
 Oh, and how much is that dump truck over there?

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:50.740
 Dump truck. What more would you want with a dump truck?

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.300
 Well, for picnics.

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.340
 Now, if you want something a nice sporty job,

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.060
 how about this little convertible?

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.460
 Leather upholstery, automatic top, free throw.

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.060
 - Where are you? - A scooter.

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:04.960
 - Where? - Over there.

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.260
 - Well, gee, where?

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
 (laughing)

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.760
 - It belongs to an elderly school teacher

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.460
 who only drove it on weekends.

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:14.460
 - The scooter?

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.460
 - No, the-- the convertible.

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.960
 the convertible or the scooter?

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:22.960
 - Well, I don't know.

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:34.660
 Sure.

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:35.940
 We're having a special on it.

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:37.980
 You can have it at your own price.

 $25.

 $25?

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:42.980
 Jean, that was in my price.

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:44.620
 $45.

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:46.940
 What if you had a mine?

 $2.40.

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:54.780
 Why, you couldn't buy the seat for that.

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:57.860
 OK, Mr. Rarely, you can keep the seat.

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:58.420
 I don't know.

00:05:58.420 --> 00:05:59.260
 I'll tell you what.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:00.820
 You can have it for twenty dollars.

 Twenty.

 Oh my mind isn't close.

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:04.540
 Would you care to make a counter offer?

 Yes sir.

 Two dollars and forty cents.

 Two dollars boys.

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:12.900
 We're willing to take a loss on this but uh...

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:13.700
 I tell you what.

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:17.380
 You can have it for fifteen dollars but that's the rock bottom price.

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:19.500
 You know what are you going to do Mr. Random?

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:22.380
 Would you be willing to consider a financial arrangement?

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:24.060
 Right on time.

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:25.980
 How much of a dollar payment could you make?

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:27.140
 The exact figure?

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:27.500
 Yes.

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:28.980
 Two dollars and forty cents.

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:31.980
 Boy, here's another idea.

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:33.980
 Why don't you leave a deposit and take the scooter home?

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:36.980
 Keep it a day and maybe your father will buy it for you.

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:38.980
 Gee, three, that's swell.

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:40.980
 How much of a deposit can you leave?

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:42.980
 Two dollars and forty.

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:44.980
 Two, forty. Now, no.

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:45.980
 Homer, do you have any money?

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:47.980
 I have a dollar, but...

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:48.980
 Oh, let me have it, Homer.

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:50.980
 Okay, here we are.

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:52.980
 You're looking, Mr. Randall.

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:55.980
 I usually don't carry this much with me.

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:56.980
 Yes.

00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:57.980
 Oh, this will do.

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:00.280
 Now, remember boys, you're gonna have it for one day.

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:03.480
 Oh boy, we're going to go home and style.

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:07.480
 Well, a guy's be surprised when they see us whizzing down the street.

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:09.980
 Boy, we ever pass them up on their old bike.

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:10.580
 Yeah.

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:12.480
 Okay, we're getting our outfit here in the back.

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:13.580
 You can drive.

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:14.580
 Me?

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:17.280
 And then I'm going to drive a scooter.

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:19.180
 No.

 You need a new line.

 Well, camping much, too, it probably starts the same way as a motorcycle.

 Oh, sure.

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:28.580
 You know how to start a motorcycle? No

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:32.220
 Don't you step on this thing

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:36.220
 You almost had it here. We try it again. Okay

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:41.540
 Maybe this brother starts something I guess no

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:47.300
 Anyway, the motor sure sounds good now in the windman home. I think I've got it first you give her plenty of gas

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:50.060
 And I choke it a little then you step on this thing

 No, Homer, we won't always have to push it.

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:06.060
 Come on, I want my father to see it.

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:08.060
 Father!

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:09.060
 Mother!

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:11.060
 Mother!

00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:14.060
 Mother!

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:17.060
 Goodness, Henry, what's the matter? Is anything wrong?

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:18.060
 What is it, Henry?

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:20.060
 How are you on the front lawn?

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:22.060
 Look, do you see anything?

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:23.060
 I certainly do.

00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:26.060
 Wouldn't the wall left that pile of junk on our lawn?

00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:29.060
 Law? Father, it's a scooter and it's wrong.

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:32.060
 Yeah, great. You did it. I bought it on approval.

00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:33.060
 Approval? Who?

00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:34.060
 Yours, Folling.

00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:38.060
 I was hoping you could see your way clear to advance me something on my allowance.

00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:42.060
 Well, I don't know, Henry. I'd like you to learn the value of money.

00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:47.060
 When I was a boy, I always made a point to save something every week out of my allowance.

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:50.060
 What did you do with the money you saved father?

00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:53.060
 Why I got married.

00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:57.060
 Frankly father, I'd rather have the scooter.

00:08:57.060 --> 00:09:00.060
 Never mind how this all got it.

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:03.060
 Don't worry Henry, I'll talk to your father.

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:06.060
 Boy, did you hear that? I can have the scooter.

00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:09.060
 But Henry earlier mother said, "Well she talked to your father."

00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:10.060
 I can't explain at home.

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:14.060
 But all my mother has to do is just keep on talking and talking.

00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:17.860
 And somehow she always gets my father to see her point of view.

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:18.860
 She died?

00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:19.860
 Sure.

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:22.300
 What happens when your mother talks to your father?

00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:25.260
 He goes out to the garage and starts pounding nails.

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:28.060
 Come on, let's go for a ride.

00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:30.060
 You don't even know how to start it.

00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:34.060
 Let's see if we've tried everything, gas, choke, or release of mercy.

00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:36.060
 Boy, here we go.

00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:37.060
 Why him?

00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:39.060
 We've got to be ignition turned on.

00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:40.060
 Oh, here it is.

00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:41.060
 I got it going.

00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:43.060
 All right, in, home, all right.

00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:45.060
 Keep going Henry

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:47.060
 Why is this well?

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:52.060
 They didn't bother me with heart-making, or I better die invested.

00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:54.060
 Okay, Homer, you can go back.

00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:57.060
 Henry, can we look out for that tree?

00:09:57.060 --> 00:10:00.060
 Okay, Homer, I can't stop!

00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:02.060
 But I'm the brave.

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:03.060
 Where is this?

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:06.060
 The area, the area, come far!

00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:08.060
 [GUNSHOT]

00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:10.060
 [LAUGHTER]

00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:12.060
 He's a [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:13.060
 I'm a whore.

00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:15.060
 You're a whore, you know.

00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:16.060
 Never.

00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:18.060
 Never mind about me.

00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:21.060
 What happened to the scooter?

00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:23.060
 Look at it.

00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:25.060
 Gosh, Homer.

00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:26.060
 What a wreck.

00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:28.060
 Here's the part that still works.

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:30.060
 [Laughter]

00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:33.060
 I took my private pieces in the garage before my father's season.

00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:36.060
 You grab the insurance, I'll take an order.

00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:37.060
 Okay, come on.

00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:39.060
 Let's plug it over into the garage.

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:40.060
 Hey, what's your pharmacy in?

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:41.660
 I see it if we put in there.

00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:43.860
 No, he always parts the car in the driveway.

00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:46.660
 There.

00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:49.060
 Boy, what am I going to tell him?

00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:49.760
 I'm coming.

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:50.760
 I'll wait here.

00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:52.060
 Yes, Father?

00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:54.260
 Hey, that was the segostin on the pole.

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:55.760
 It was, Father.

00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:57.860
 You can forget all about me buying that scooter

00:10:57.860 --> 00:10:59.660
 until your ancient history improves.

00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:00.660
 Yes, Father.

00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:04.260
 But Father, would it be all right if I bought it out of my allowance, though?

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:07.860
 I'm also cutting off your allowance until you catch up in your studies.

00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:10.500
 Even though I have debts to pay, legal obligations.

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:12.000
 That's all I have to say, Henry.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.820
 You can convince me of your sincerity

00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:15.900
 by doing better in your schoolwork.

00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:16.820
 She wins.

00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:17.820
 Hey, Henry.

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:18.820
 Come here, Homer.

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:20.100
 Heard what your father told you.

00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:21.260
 What are you going to do?

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:24.060
 All I know is, Homer, are we in trouble?

00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:25.060
 We.

00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:27.060
 I like it in this.

00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:29.180
 But then you say you want to be a partner?

00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:29.900
 Sure, Henry.

00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:31.580
 Believe me, Homer, it's legal.

00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:33.420
 You ask, and I accept it.

00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:34.500
 It's a contract.

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:35.620
 Ask any lawyer.

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:36.620
 Oh, boy.

00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:39.120
 Henry, you get me in the dine this trouble.

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:42.820
 Look, Homer, old pal, all we need is $11.60.

00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:44.620
 Now, what did you ask your father?

00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:47.620
 I will not. Absolutely no, Henry.

00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:50.620
 You know my father. I wouldn't dare ask him.

00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:57.620
 Father, can I speak to you a minute?

00:11:57.620 --> 00:11:59.620
 What is it, Homer?

00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:02.120
 I'd like to ask you an embarrassing question.

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:03.620
 Well?

00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:06.460
 I have $11.60.

00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:09.900
 I'll give you an answer, which causes me no embarrassment.

00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:10.900
 No.

00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:11.900
 [LAUGHTER]

00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:12.740
 She was father.

00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:14.580
 Don't you mean you want to score?

00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:16.620
 Frankly, no.

00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:17.780
 What is it for?

00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:20.660
 Well, you see, Henry and I want to buy this motor scooter.

00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:21.860
 A motor scooter?

00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:23.180
 I used one?

00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:23.940
 Yes, sir.

00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:25.060
 Quite a bit.

00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:26.900
 I'm afraid not.

00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:29.140
 Accidents happen with scooters.

00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:30.100
 They do, father.

00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:33.020
 I can't imagine why you want a scooter, Homer.

00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:35.620
 Now I could understand it if it was a new bicycle.

00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:37.020
 I can't have a new bicycle?

00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:37.820
 No.

00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:39.220
 For a father.

00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:56.020
 Lace, have you ever wondered why we recommend that you keep several jello flavors on hand

00:12:56.020 --> 00:12:58.020
 instead of buying just one at a time?

00:12:58.020 --> 00:12:58.360
 [

00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:03.020
 [

00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:04.020
 ]

00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:10.020
 Three way to get the package with the big red letters, J-E-L-L-O.

00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:13.020
 Your drosser has Canada's red letter dessert.

00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:16.020
 And now we're getting back to the troubles of Henry Alders.

00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:21.020
 [

00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:22.020
 ]

00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:24.020
 The scene opens and the Alders living room.

00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:32.180
 paper down Sam. Sam. Dear. What is the dollar? I want to talk to you about Henry.

00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:39.460
 Before I fortified myself with breakfast. Sam. All right. Why isn't Henry more like

00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:45.140
 some of the other boys at school? What boys? Well, as Christmas and the news, he's an

00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:50.180
 outstanding student. Alice, the boy that plays the pickle on. There's nothing wrong

00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:52.060
 with Henry, you straighten himself off.

00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:55.820
 - Maybe he'd only take a real interest in your studies.

00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:58.180
 If I could only get him to make a game of it,

00:13:58.180 --> 00:14:00.300
 that's how Roslyn Burke got hurt to girls

00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:03.220
 to enter the quiz contest at the Emporium.

00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:05.340
 Then why couldn't I do that with Henry?

00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:07.700
 - If they didn't get Henry to enter the quiz contest

00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:09.300
 by pretending it's a game.

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:11.700
 - Then at least I can call it to his attention.

00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:13.780
 - Good morning, mother, good morning, father.

00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:15.980
 - Good morning, how do you feel there?

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:17.420
 - Fine, mother.

00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:19.780
 Father, could I ask you a legal question?

00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:24.580
 If you'll make it short, Henry, I always dislike giving free legal advice.

00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:31.020
 Suppose A is driving something belonging to B.

00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:33.700
 - This car? - Yes, it is.

00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:40.500
 Could be. And A has an accident and ruins the scooter, the car.

00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:45.140
 What could happen to A if we can't pay for the damages?

00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:46.980
 Does A have a driver's license?

00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:48.380
 No, three doesn't even have a car.

00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:50.780
 I mean, no sir.

00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:53.180
 The day is in serious trouble.

00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:56.180
 Not only can we have a jail for the non-settlement

00:14:56.180 --> 00:14:59.280
 of a legal death with a judgment obtained in court,

00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:02.480
 but the police can press criminal charges against they.

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:04.480
 I wouldn't even recommend the lawyer for it.

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:05.980
 Nothing can help him.

00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:07.480
 I think.

00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:09.380
 You don't think the law may have been changed

00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:10.980
 since you went to school, huh?

00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:12.980
 [LAUGHTER]

00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:13.980
 Yes, sir.

00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:15.180
 It's not like the Henry.

00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:19.580
 Look, Henry, the Emporium Department store is running a quiz contest.

00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:23.780
 They've got a big ad in the paper, which should be a lot of fun.

00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:24.780
 Yes, Mom.

00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:27.980
 It's like a game. They ask you all sorts of questions.

00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:28.980
 Yes, Mom.

00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:32.380
 Do you put it in your pocket? You can look at it later if you're interested.

00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:35.180
 Hi.

00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:38.380
 Boy, Homer, did I just get some bad news?

00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:39.980
 Listen, Henry, we're able to...

00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:41.980
 Don't you feel well?

00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:43.580
 Here you pale.

00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:46.580
 Yeah, must be prison power setting.

00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:49.580
 - Did you get some money from Mr. Randall?

00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:51.580
 - Not yet, and I just found out, but unless we pay,

00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:54.580
 we can go to prison for years.

00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:57.580
 - I'd be telling you, Henry, I had nothing to do with it.

00:15:57.580 --> 00:16:01.580
 - Apparently you don't realize that you're in a accessory after the fact.

00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:03.580
 - Henry, that doesn't make sense.

00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:06.580
 - Not supposed to make sense. It's legal talk.

00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:11.580
 - Henry, will you get that out in the kitchen?

00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:12.580
 All right, mother.

00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:13.580
 Just a minute, almost.

00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:14.580
 Hello?

00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:15.580
 Hello.

00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:16.580
 Can I stick to Henry Aldrich?

00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:17.580
 This is he talking.

00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:19.580
 This is Mr. Randall, Henry.

00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:21.580
 What about the scooter?

00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:23.580
 Do you want to buy it?

00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:26.580
 Yes, Mr. Randall, but I don't have the money right this minute.

00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:29.580
 I'll be happy to give you my personal I/O you though.

00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:32.580
 Well, that won't be necessary as long as you're going to buy it.

00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:33.580
 Your father is good for it.

00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:34.580
 Oh, sure.

00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:35.580
 Tell me, how's it run?

00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:37.580
 Is the motor missing?

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:38.580
 Oh, no.

00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:40.580
 I know just where it is.

00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:42.180
 (audience laughing)

00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:44.580
 - Now, you are every single piece.

00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:45.820
 - I think you are.

00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:48.660
 - I mean, I'm keeping it in the garage where it's safe.

00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:50.500
 - Oh, that's fine, and I'll hear from you soon.

00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:52.340
 - Yes, sir, you will.

00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:53.700
 I can almost promise.

00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:54.540
 - Okay.

00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:57.220
 - Hey, where are we gonna get some money from, sir, in?

00:16:57.220 --> 00:16:59.860
 - Homer, I'm afraid we're gonna have to do something desperate.

00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:00.700
 - What?

00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:03.540
 - Tell Mr. Randall and my father the truth.

00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:06.100
 - You don't have to go overboard.

00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:07.660
 Maybe something will happen.

00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:09.020
 - Homer, what could happen?

00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:15.020
 We might get a job or inherit some money or win a prize on a quiz show.

00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:21.020
 A quiz show? Where's that newspaper ad my mother gave? Here, home, or look at this.

00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:24.020
 And we access an ad for that silly quiz show at the employee.

00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:33.020
 Look at what they're giving away for prizes. Any contestant who correctly answers two out of three questions will receive a prize of $15.

00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:35.020
 $15?

00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:36.020
 So I don't know.

00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:37.020
 Homer, it's a...

00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:40.500
 When you get up on the stage you're allowed to pick any category you like, if it hasn't

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:41.500
 already been taken, right?

00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:44.100
 So what's the easiest category here?

00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:45.100
 Let's see.

00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:46.100
 Four.

00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:47.100
 That's right.

00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:48.100
 What's the hardest one?

00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:49.100
 You know what it is.

00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:50.100
 Harry ain't in history.

00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:55.380
 Well, nobody in his right mind would ever pick ancient history, so I'll take that.

00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:56.380
 And...

00:17:56.380 --> 00:17:59.380
 Then it's a library studying.

00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:00.380
 It's ancient history.

00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:01.380
 Why not?

00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:03.380
 Lots of people are gonna be studying.

00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:06.380
 - It's a library study. - It's a library study.

00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:08.380
 Please think you can learn ancient history.

00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:11.380
 - No, not lots of people learn it. Look at Ms. Agleston.

00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:15.380
 She didn't learn it, Henry. She was there one and half.

00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:17.380
 [laughter]

00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:30.380
 - More calls, sir? - Thank you, Alice.

00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:32.860
 I know that Henry was at the

00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:37.500
 six o'clock this morning reading perfectly normal I did it myself when I was

00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:42.500
 Henry's age I just couldn't get enough of Frank Madewell normally with Henry it's

00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:47.260
 never because never it's about the same thing they all have their boyhood heroes

00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:52.940
 and don't you realize Henry's been studying Henry studying Alice I don't

00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:57.380
 believe it good morning good morning good morning sit down here I'll have

00:18:57.380 --> 00:19:00.380
 your breakfast in a moment. I'll thank you mother. I just had a glass of milk and a

00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:04.340
 couple cookies in the kitchen. Henry, really, you must get to school early this

00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:09.420
 morning. Homer and I are going to spend a little time in the library. The library?

00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:14.500
 Yes, Father. If you have no objection. None it's all, Henry.

00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:20.500
 Yeah, don't work too hard. All right, Father. Alice, now I've seen everything.

00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:24.460
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:32.980
 All right, sir.

00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:35.220
 All right, quiet.

00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:37.900
 Now, yesterday, we were talking about the athletes

00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:39.740
 of ancient Greece.

00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:43.540
 What were some of the sports in which they excelled?

00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:48.140
 Well, I see an unfamiliar hand from a brown.

00:19:48.140 --> 00:20:00.140
 One of the most popular Greek sports was throwing the discus. The modern record is 181 C, 6, and 3/8 inches, held by a dawpaul consolini of Italy. He established his record.

00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:02.140
 That's his enough, Pomer.

00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:06.140
 Let's return to ancient Greece with the rest of the class, shall we?

00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:08.140
 Yes, Ms. Eggleston.

00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:17.140
 Now, many of the famous athletes of their day were engaged in the Second Telepenetian War, which took place in more 31 B.C.

00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:19.540
 And we all rich you will answer on it.

00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:22.440
 What did you say, Henry?

00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:24.440
 431 BC.

00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:25.440
 But that's right.

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:28.040
 I know that you're silly, but then

00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:29.040
 can we?

00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:32.540
 Who was the outstanding figure of that war?

00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:33.540
 Pericles.

00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:34.540
 What happens?

00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:39.440
 In the always just tell me one more thing.

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:40.440
 Sure.

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:43.440
 When did the second Peloponnesian war end?

00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:45.940
 421 BC.

00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:50.940
 Well, I have been teaching for 23 years,

00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:55.940
 and in all that time, this is the most wonderful thing that has happened.

00:20:55.940 --> 00:20:59.940
 If it were in my power, I'd get the entire class of holidays.

00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:02.940
 Now, Henry, tell me, when did this?

00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:05.940
 No, no, I better not deserve the miracle.

00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:06.940
 in there.

00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:19.300
 Well folks this is very exciting quiz show so far.

00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:23.420
 The first six contestants were all girls and each of them was able to answer two out of

00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:27.020
 three questions correctly and win a fifteen dollar prize.

00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:30.060
 In fact there have been no losers so far.

00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:33.620
 We have left only two contestants both born.

00:21:33.620 --> 00:21:36.620
 I'm sure they're not going to let the girls beat them.

00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:38.620
 Ha ha ha! No, sir, read!

00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:41.620
 Now, the two categories left are...

00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:43.620
 Ancient history and sport.

00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:45.620
 Oh, wait, Homer, it sure worked out on her feet.

00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:47.620
 What in hell did he say?

00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:48.620
 Oh, Henry, this is your son.

00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:49.620
 Sure.

00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:52.620
 How's the next contestant will be Homer Brown?

00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:54.620
 He has his choice of two categories.

00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:55.620
 Sport, San Asian history.

00:21:55.620 --> 00:21:56.620
 Now, don't forget, Homer.

00:21:56.620 --> 00:21:58.620
 I'm taking ancient history, dear.

00:21:58.620 --> 00:21:59.620
 Homer, do you hear?

00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:00.620
 Sure, I hear, Henry.

00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:02.620
 You said all take ancient history.

00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:05.860
 - I'll take ancient history. - Oh, they're brown picks ancient history.

00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:11.100
 - Why, do you know why, Homer? - Oh, there must be a wiz in ancient history to pass up for...

00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:14.100
 - Why, never... - Why, this will probably be duck soup for you.

00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:16.200
 - Please, I would like it. - Oh, you like it, son.

00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:18.860
 - All right, Homer, here's your first one.

00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:22.500
 Was Julius Caesar a Roman or a Greek?

00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:27.820
 - He's got to be one of the others. - That's right.

00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:32.480
 - Did he ever throw the discus? - Well, I'm sure I don't know. He probably did.

00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:33.880
 Then he was a Greek.

00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:37.180
 Oh, I'm sorry, that's wrong.

00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:39.980
 [HORN HONKING]

00:22:39.980 --> 00:22:42.580
 No, Julius Caesar was a rogue.

00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:46.880
 Now, for your next question, who, according to legend,

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:49.140
 fiddled while Rome burned?

00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:51.180
 He had no much about music.

00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:54.880
 Hi, if the question in ancient history, Homer,

00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:55.880
 he was a Roman.

00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:58.480
 Roman Julius Caesar?

00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:01.580
 Oh, I'm sorry, that's wrong again.

00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:07.340
 Oh, you missed two out of three and I'm afraid you've lost your chance to win the

00:23:07.340 --> 00:23:13.260
 fifteen dollar prize. Better luck next time, hold around. And now for our last contestant,

00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:17.820
 Henry Aldrich, who takes the last category sport. Now here's your first question,

00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:23.340
 Henry. In the year 1926, there were only two left-handed batters who hit over 350.

00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:26.980
 One of them threw right hand. Can you tell me the name of the other player?

00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:29.980
 Would you mind repeating the question?

00:23:29.980 --> 00:23:35.980
 Not all. In the year 1926, there were only two left-handed batters who hit over 350.

00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:37.980
 One of them threw right hand.

00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:40.980
 Can you tell me the name of the other player?

00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:43.980
 Would you mind repeating the question just one more?

00:23:55.980 --> 00:23:58.580
 Henry, what's the good of sitting here in the front porch?

00:23:58.580 --> 00:23:59.900
 Let's go in the house.

00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:02.580
 Boy, Homer, did you mess things up?

00:24:02.580 --> 00:24:04.940
 May, you got me into this, Henry.

00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:07.260
 I was an unwarying victim.

00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:09.860
 Besides all the aggravation and loss of sleep,

00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:12.460
 I've had its already cost me a dollar in cash.

00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:14.260
 Look, Homer, if you hadn't been so dumb--

00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:16.060
 Oh, I thought you were, Henry.

00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:17.460
 I've been looking for you.

00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:18.460
 I want to talk to you.

00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:20.180
 You do, Bobby.

00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:22.380
 Henry, I saw Mr. Randall yesterday.

00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:25.460
 Father, please remember that there are two sides to every store.

00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:30.460
 I saw him because Mr. Eggleston called and told me how well you've been doing in ancient history.

00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:32.460
 Henry, I'm proud of you.

00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:35.460
 Father, what has ancient history got to do with Mr. Randall?

00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:41.460
 Well, your mother and I were so pleased that I went to Mr. Randall, and I bought you the scooter you wanted.

00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:43.460
 Thank you very much, Father.

00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:47.460
 But, I'm sorry, Henry, to tell you this.

00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:52.460
 I don't know how it happened, but backing the car into the garage, I ran over the scooter.

00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:55.460
 I'm afraid I smashed it up quite a bit.

00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:56.460
 You did?

00:24:56.460 --> 00:24:57.460
 Yes.

00:24:57.460 --> 00:24:58.460
 Father!

00:24:58.460 --> 00:25:02.460
 I mean, but Father really did to tell you...

00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:04.460
 I don't try to take the blame.

00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:06.460
 It was entirely my fault.

00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:08.460
 Well, it's alright, Father.

00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:11.460
 Fortunately, Mr. Randall carried insurance.

00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:14.460
 He asked the scooter and is being repaired right now.

00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:16.460
 Boy, Henry.

00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:19.460
 And this time, find out where the brake is before you ride it.

00:25:19.460 --> 00:25:20.460
 Oh, Mary.

00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:25.460
 And, Henry, I'm glad that from now on you'll be able to ride to the library.

00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:26.460
 Library?

00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:29.460
 Classfather, what would I be doing in a library?

00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:45.460
 [MUSIC]

00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:47.460
 Good evening, Miss Agleston.

00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:54.460
 Well, sir, what? Can we order it? It's a surprise. Come right here. Oh, no, thank you, Ms. Eggleston.

00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:59.460
 We just came to extend an invitation to you. An invitation? Well, how nice.

00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:04.460
 Well, here's the least we can do. After the slow way you call out my family about my schoolwork.

00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:10.460
 So, Ms. Eggleston, we hereby cordially invite you to be our very first guest.

00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:15.460
 To take a ride on Henry's new school there. Well, really.

00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:17.460
 Well, really is right.

00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:20.460
 But here's really the kind of invitation that folks will snap up.

00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:24.460
 That's an invitation to dinner with jello for dessert.

00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:27.460
 Serve your family and friends delicious jello often.

00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:29.460
 They're sure to like it.

00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:31.460
 You have seven flavors to choose from.

00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:35.460
 Strawberry, raspberry, cherry, orange, lemon, lime, or pineapple.

00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:39.460
 Each flavor tastes just like the real ripe fruit itself.

00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:43.460
 For every jello flavor is lost in by a special jello process.

00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:48.460
 So it's sealed right in so it can't... until you're ready to handle it.

00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:50.960
