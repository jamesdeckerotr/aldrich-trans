00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
 Henry Henry Olgridge!

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 The coming mother!

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 [Applause]

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
 Here's to the Olgridge family written by

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 Clifford Goldsmith.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 [Music]

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 A teenage boy has always scampered across the American scene.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 Tom Sawyer, a huckleberry fin, Kenrod, pecs bad boy.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 Maybe there's a good reason why.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 Maybe in a typical American boy like Henry Aldrich,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
 people can see someone they once were or once knew.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 The scene opens on the front porch of the Aldrich home.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.440
 home. The time is late afternoon.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.500
 G. Homer, you're just worrying over nothing.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.160
 Well, Henry, that isn't the way my father said he would have done it.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.780
 My father will get it, Homer.

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.000
 Why do you think he's taking the time to drive way out to Mr. Frederick's farm if you can?

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 Well, boy, I certainly hope he can collect it.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.440
 Homer, he's going to tell Mr. Frederick right straight to his face how much he owes us for the work we did this summer.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.280
 And your father thinks he can get it all?

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.040
 Sure he can, Homer. He'll get our whole eight dollars.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.000
 Well, my father said that if a man owed him that much for working as hard as we did,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.140
 He wouldn't go all the way out there, he'd just sue him.

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.640
 Boy, your father doesn't know anything about a thing like that.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.840
 All he does is sell lumber.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.280
 Because my father's one of the best lawyers in the state.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.920
 He can talk anyone into giving him money.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.120
 How?

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.800
 I don't know, but it's an act you have if you're a lawyer.

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.040
 And nobody puts anything over on my father.

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.360
 When he goes after a thing, he gets it.

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:37.920
 He does?

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.200
 And how?

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.360
 You just wait until he comes back and hands us each $4.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.360
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:52.160
 [Music]

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.560
 But father, didn't I make it clear Mr. Frederick owed us eight dollars?

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.260
 Henry, for the last time I collected it.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.160
 In money, Mr. Aldrich?

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.960
 No, Homer, not in money.

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.260
 As I said before, I collected the equivalent.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.060
 Sam, what do you mean by the equivalent?

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.260
 I mean, Alice, that Mr. Frederick didn't have the cash.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.360
 So he paid it in corn.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.360
 In what?

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.860
 [Laughter]

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.260
 Corn Mrs. Alvich, G. Father, and not that we don't appreciate your trying,

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.860
 but what Homer and I had really planned and was, well, you know, money.

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.460
 Gee whiz, Mr. Alvich, my father said...

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.060
 Never mind what your father said, Homer.

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.060
 There's nothing wrong with being paid in corn.

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.260
 It's the ancient principle of barter and exchange.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:34.360
 - It is? - Of course.

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.660
 It's a simple case of applied economics.

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.260
 You boys will learn a great deal from this transaction.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:40.860
 It's taught me one thing already.

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.460
 - I'm glad to hear it, Homer. - The next time I do any work,

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.460
 I'm getting my money in advance.

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:47.260
 (audience laughing)

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:48.340
 - Now Homer.

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.620
 - Sam, how much corn did he give the boys?

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:51.700
 - Tomorrow morning Alice,

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.500
 he's driving his truck in with 12 bushels.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:55.780
 - 12 bushels?

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:56.700
 A corn?

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.340
 - Yes Mrs. Aldrich, 12 bushels.

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.300
 - Where in heaven's name are you gonna keep it?

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:02.700
 - In the basement, mother.

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.580
 Until we can figure out what to do with it.

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.020
 - Well, that's very nice, I'm sure.

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.180
 Mr. Aldrich, how much is it worth a bushel?

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.420
 - Well, I'm afraid it isn't worth a great deal right now.

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.420
 Oh, but naturally if you hold it, you'll find the price will fluctuate.

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.420
 Sure, sure it will. What do you mean "flutuate" Henry?

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.420
 Boy, how many of you are dumb. It means that...

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.420
 Tell him, will you father?

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.420
 The fluctuation reflects the cost of living. The price may be down, but only temporarily.

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.420
 Sooner or later it'll go up.

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.420
 Sam, what is it you're suggesting the boys do? Trade in car?

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.980
 Now Alice, it would be a very good experience for them.

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.780
 They'll learn the principles of supply and demand.

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.100
 This will teach them the value of money.

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.380
 - When she was father, I know the value of money.

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.140
 It's the value of corn, I'm worrying about it.

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:51.540
 (audience laughing)

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.780
 - Well, don't worry about it, dear.

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.700
 You and Homer can corner the market

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.620
 with your 12 bushels and make a killing when it goes up.

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.060
 - Alice, for heaven's sake.

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.780
 - I'm sorry, Sam.

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:03.580
 Please hurry and get ready for dinner.

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:05.140
 - Were you including me, Mrs. Aldrich?

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:07.300
 - Why, no, Homer, I wasn't.

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:11.860
 However, if you feel that you want to stay, I couldn't stay unless I was specially asked.

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:14.560
 Oh, in that case, dear, perhaps the next time.

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:21.060
 Could you start that over again, Mrs. Aldrich?

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.100
 Come on, I'll go to the door with you.

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.140
 Well, thanks for your trouble, Mrs. Aldrich.

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:28.840
 And thank you for your trouble, Mr. Aldrich.

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.140
 No trouble at all.

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:32.140
 Understand, Henry, I'm not criticizing.

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:34.140
 Only you should have gotten my father to handle this.

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:36.040
 Now, listen, is that a slur on my father?

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.640
 Oh, gee whiz no.

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:40.040
 The only thing is, I don't know how he makes a living.

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:41.040
 Homer.

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.540
 Twelve bushels of corn or twelve bushels of corn?

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:45.340
 I can figure that much myself.

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.440
 But when I go up to the dance committee and get two tickets for the class dance,

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:49.540
 what am I going to hand them?

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:51.540
 Six bushels of corn?

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:54.540
 That hasn't even fluctuated yet?

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:57.040
 Are they already worse off than I am?

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.040
 I asked Eleanor Wentworth, haven't I?

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.540
 Boy, I don't know how I'm going to be able to face Betty Newton.

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:05.540
 Listen, Homer, why don't you see if your mother wouldn't be interested in buying it?

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:08.540
 It's a can. The whole twelve bushels?

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:10.540
 We could quote a reasonable price.

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:13.540
 Sure. You want my mother to get us out of a hole that your father got us into.

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:16.540
 Who are we? Who are we? We aren't in any hole.

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:19.540
 You just don't realize how valuable that corn is going to be.

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:23.540
 When? When it fluctuates. When it fluctuates.

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:33.540
 Henry, in which room is the class holding the meeting?

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:37.920
 right there in two way did you try the wayside market Homer yes Henry I've

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:41.940
 been everywhere did you go to the neighborhood grocery yes and they said

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:46.080
 the same thing everybody else did no they just laughed well didn't you tell

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:49.040
 them what your father said about the price Homer people who are laughing

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:54.080
 aren't in the mood to talk business boy I want to go to this meeting anyway all

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:58.040
 they're gonna talk about is the class dance did Eleanor wet worth go in sure

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:02.360
 and I'll bet the first thing they ask us is have we bought our tickets quiet

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.360
 Henry is the meeting started?

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:06.360
 No, President, I'm going to be teaching the chair!

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:10.360
 You've all heard the names of the last meeting. Are there any announcements?

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:13.360
 Mr. President, the chair recognizes Toby Wilson.

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:19.360
 All though most of the tickets for the dance a week from this Saturday have been sold, there are still a few guys holding back.

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:20.360
 Oh boy.

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:23.360
 Let's not have any slack, Miss Fosse. Let's make it a hundred percent!

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:25.360
 [cheering]

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.360
 I'm going out, Henry. No one will see ya.

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.360
 Are there any other announcements? Mr. President!

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:36.360
 Jimmy Bartlett. Mr. President, I've been a member of this class for a good many years now.

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:40.360
 I like to ask, why did ticket-tack the cost so much?

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:42.360
 Mr. President, that's what I say.

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:43.360
 Oh, shit!

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:45.360
 Oh, shit!

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:49.360
 Well, I think the price of the ticket should fluctuate like the cost of living.

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:52.360
 Homer, would you mind explaining that?

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:57.360
 Well, if you don't know, it's not going to do any good to tell you.

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:59.680
 The beneditions of money I mined is the principal.

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:03.620
 Homer, I believe the price of tickets was fully discussed at the last meeting.

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:04.580
 And you're out of order.

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:06.060
 What do you mean I'm out of order?

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:08.000
 I wasn't even at the last meeting.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.700
 I think we ought to have more principal all the way around.

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:13.540
 [crowd murmuring]

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:14.500
 Homer, be quiet.

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:15.740
 Water, please.

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:17.000
 Water.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
 Are there any other announcements?

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.140
 Mr. President.

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:21.100
 Betty Newton.

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:26.140
 I make a motion that the chairman of the dish read off the list of those boys who hadn't bought their tickets here.

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:28.060
 The last will be right at the next meeting.

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:29.380
 Are there any other announcements?

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:30.780
 - Mr. President?

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:31.700
 - Yes, Shanery.

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:34.620
 - I make a motion that we postpone the dance.

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:37.360
 (crowd cheering)

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:40.380
 - For how long?

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:41.920
 - For about four weeks.

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:43.260
 - Oh, yeah.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.980
 - All in favor signify by saying aye.

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:46.820
 - Aye.

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:47.740
 - Don't oppose.

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:48.900
 - No!

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:51.860
 - Mr. President, I make a motion that no more in this class

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:53.700
 feel allowed to bring any girl to the dance

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:55.100
 that isn't in the class.

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:58.940
 Mr. President, yes, darling, I object not amongst the no less than

00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:02.640
 confiscation of personal rights.

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:06.040
 Mr. President, Henry Orridge,

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:09.940
 I've been listening with great interest to all the complaints about this dance

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:12.260
 and naturally it worries me.

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:15.580
 I'm not sure, but I think I have a suggestion.

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:19.540
 We had a good dance last year and we had a good dance the year before.

00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:22.620
 And I guess if we're all here we'll have another one next year.

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:25.620
 I certainly hope we will because I like to dance.

00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:27.620
 But, gee, I don't know.

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:31.620
 Sometimes I start wondering if dancing is everything in life.

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:34.620
 How about trying something else, just one year?

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:36.620
 The evenings are nice now.

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:39.620
 They're a little chilly maybe, but we're going to have a moon, I think.

00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:42.620
 Why waste our time indoors?

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:43.620
 Just dancing.

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:46.620
 Well, what do you suggest?

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:49.620
 Why, uh, sort of cornrows.

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:57.860
 I make a motion that this class show a little originality and initiative and have a corn

00:08:57.860 --> 00:08:58.860
 roast.

00:08:58.860 --> 00:08:59.860
 I second the motion.

00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:00.860
 On our place.

00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:01.860
 On our...

00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:02.860
 That's the present.

00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:03.860
 I've never heard of anything so ridiculous.

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:04.860
 All I can say is who wants a corn roast?

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:05.860
 I do, Mr. President.

00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:06.860
 Why do you have an NREO return on through dancing yet?

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:07.860
 I mean corn!

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:14.300
 The only trouble with having a corn roast is where are you going to get a corn roast?

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:16.300
 I mean corn!

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:18.800
 The only trouble with having a corn roast is,

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:20.800
 "Where are you going to get the corn?"

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:22.800
 It's hard to find this time of year.

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:23.800
 Oh, my God.

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:29.300
 But if we have enough initiative and originality to want a corn roast,

00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:33.300
 then I'm willing to personally guarantee that I will find the corn.

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:34.300
 Somehow.

00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:36.800
 [cheering]

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:38.800
 I second that motion too.

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:39.800
 What motion, Homer?

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:40.800
 What?

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:41.800
 There wasn't any motion.

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:42.800
 Well, then I made one.

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:43.800
 Oh, I second that.

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:46.140
 Now wait a minute, where are your principles?

00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:48.200
 - At whom are shut up? - Here has been a motion

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:51.040
 that instead of a dance, we show little originality

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:53.680
 and initiative by holding a corn roast.

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:56.640
 All those in favor signify by saying aye.

00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:57.580
 - Aye! - Aye!

00:09:57.580 --> 00:09:59.440
 - Pause! - No!

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:01.440
 - The boys have it, it'll be a corn roast.

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:04.280
 (crowd cheering)

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:06.280
 - This is the best! - Hold up.

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:08.880
 Homer, tell Henry Audrey somebody wants him outside.

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:10.000
 I'm wanted outside?

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.680
 Somebody wants you out in the main office.

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:13.120
 Hey, come on, Homer, I'm wanted.

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:17.360
 Mr. President, the good meat we will or will not have punch also.

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:20.660
 [CHEERING]

00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:22.920
 Gee, Henry, did you steamroll or that?

00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:25.680
 Oh, Henry, it just happens that I did it for the sake of the class.

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:26.200
 You did?

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:27.200
 Sure.

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:30.080
 I really think a corn roast is a better idea than a dance.

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:32.080
 And if it happens that we have the corn, they need,

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:33.160
 we'll let them have it.

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:35.560
 Just what they need, no more and no less.

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:37.880
 Well, how much do you think they'll need, Hen?

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:40.320
 About 12 bushels.

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:42.440
 Henry, I wonder who wants you in the front office.

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:43.940
 Henry Oh, Ritchie.

00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:45.140
 Where did you come from, Eleanor?

00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:47.160
 I just followed you on a class meeting,

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:48.760
 and I want to tell you that every girl in there

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:51.280
 is so mad at you, they're never going to speak to you again.

00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:52.160
 They're all mad at me?

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:53.480
 My goodness, Henry.

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:56.160
 You even invited me to go to the class dance with you.

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:57.600
 Well, sure, Eleanor, but let me explain it.

00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:59.080
 Henry, I even bought a dress for the dance,

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:00.800
 a brand new Tafforda dress.

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:01.640
 Well, look here, watch that.

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:04.080
 Oh, and I look nice eating corn on the cob in Tafforda.

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:04.920
 But she was Eleanor.

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:07.040
 Oh, we did with Substitute a corn roast for the dance.

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:09.160
 And you can just substitute another girl.

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:10.000
 Goodbye.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.300
 Eleanor, wait.

00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:12.360
 Eleanor, wait.

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:15.360
 Oh boy, come on Henry, here comes Betty.

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:17.360
 You wait for me, Homer Brown.

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:19.360
 Oh, did you want to speak to me?

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:20.360
 Yes, I do.

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:23.360
 Do you realize I can't eat sweet corn?

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:24.360
 Why not?

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:26.360
 Because I got this breeze on my teeth.

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:28.360
 And I've got to wear it for three more months.

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:30.360
 She, Whiz Betty, are too self-conscious about it.

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:31.360
 That's right.

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:33.360
 It's not the least bit noticeable.

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:34.360
 Unless you smile.

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:37.360
 No, but she whiz Betty.

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:39.360
 Henry Aldrich!

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:40.360
 Oh boy, who's that?

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:41.360
 Who's that?

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:42.360
 It's your sister, Henry.

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:43.360
 Mary?

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:44.360
 What's she doing here in school?

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:45.360
 She got a complaint too.

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:48.360
 Henry, I've been waiting for you in the main office.

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:51.360
 Here, you left this morning without your lunch box.

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:53.360
 Oh, well, thanks very much.

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:56.800
 And Henry, when you come home from school this afternoon, you'll stop at the store and see

00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:00.360
 if you can get 12 years of fresh picked corn.

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:01.360
 Corn?

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:02.360
 Yes.

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:03.360
 We've got corn.

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:05.360
 She was 12 bushels came this morning before I left the house.

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:07.360
 But Mother says we can't eat that, Henry.

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:09.360
 My goodness, how could we eat it?

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:10.620
 Why couldn't we?

00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:11.820
 It's horse gone.

00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:16.560
 [laughter]

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:18.360
 It's what corn costs?

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:19.200
 Horse?

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:20.200
 Horse?

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:22.200
 Does that mean we can't have the corn roast?

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:26.100
 Homer, that means if anything is going to be roasted, it'll be us.

00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:33.040
 [applause]

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:36.040
 The Aldrich family will be back in just a moment, but first,

00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:41.320
 Tonight on most of these same NBC stations, you can enjoy more comedy with Theatre Guild on the Air.

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:47.720
 This week Theatre Guild on the Air stars Van Hefflin and Rutherford and Kenny Delmar in George Washington slept here.

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:54.760
 Already seen on Broadway and a hit in the movies, this George S. Corp and Mosshard comedy deals with a city man who discovers the country,

00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:58.120
 where running water usually means there's a brook in the backyard.

00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:03.240
 Here in Theatre Guild on the Air's presentation of George Washington slept here later this evening.

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:08.720
 And finally, no program lineup would be complete without some of the top NBC news shows.

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:10.320
 And Sunday is no exception.

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:14.040
 For tonight, NBC brings you "Moth Around Trees Meet the Press."

00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:17.080
 Tonight's second-use feature is the American Forum of the Air,

00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:21.200
 and the discussion topic is "Which Party is the Working Man's Friend?"

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:24.760
 Offering as guest panel members, Secretary of Labor, Maurice Tobin,

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:27.920
 and Fred Hartley, co-author of the Taft Hartley Labor Act.

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:30.120
 Your moderator will be Theodore Grannick.

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:32.880
 Yes, that's the NBC program scheduled for tonight.

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:35.880
 Just stay tuned for the tops in radio.

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:42.520
 [Music]

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:45.520
 And now getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldrich.

00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:50.160
 Henry and Homer have talked to junior class into holding a corn roast instead of a dance

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:52.960
 in order to sell their 12 bushels of corn.

00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:55.520
 While congratulating themselves on their success,

00:13:55.520 --> 00:14:00.400
 they learn that they have in their possession not sweet corn, but horse corn.

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:03.400
 The scene opens that afternoon in the Aldrich basement.

00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:08.100
 Understand, Henry, I'm not criticizing your father, but don't you think he should have

00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:09.800
 known this was horse corn?

00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:11.320
 Why should he have?

00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:13.800
 After all, my father's a lawyer, not a farmer.

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:15.800
 To him, corn is corn.

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:18.080
 Well, listen, Henry, I've been thinking.

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:22.280
 Couldn't we still sell it to the class, even if it is really just for horses?

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:24.080
 Look, Homer, you see this front tooth?

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:25.080
 Yes?

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:27.240
 I lost that tooth once, biting into an air of horse corn.

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:28.240
 Looks alright to me.

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:29.640
 Sure, I threw out again.

00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:31.240
 But the one I had, I lost.

00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:32.240
 You did?

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:33.240
 Sure.

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:36.440
 And do you want us to be responsible for the whole class losing their front teeth?

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:41.280
 Well, couldn't we soak it in butter and soften it up a little?

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:43.560
 And not serve it until after dark?

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:44.560
 No, Homer.

00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:48.960
 Oh, well here we are Henry, stuck with those 12 bushels of horse food and the whole junior

00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:52.800
 class is waiting for something to eat.

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:54.800
 [Music]

00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:58.300
 [Music]

00:14:58.300 --> 00:15:00.300
 Mother, please let me finish!

00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:03.300
 Eleanor, I don't want to hear another word about the class dance.

00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:05.800
 Mother, it isn't to be a dance, it's to be a corn roast,

00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:08.300
 and Henry Aldrich expects me to go with him.

00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:11.800
 But you're not going out and by close just for a corn roast.

00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:14.800
 We bought you a lovely taffet address to dance in.

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:15.800
 I understand.

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:18.300
 Why aren't you having the dance?

00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:21.800
 Henry thought it would be much more original for us not to have one.

00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:24.960
 Well, you have plenty of clothes that are good enough to eat corn in.

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:27.800
 But nothing that Henry hasn't seen me in before.

00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:30.560
 And this is going to be a very original occasion.

00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:34.200
 There, you can't expect me to buy your address for every single occasion.

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:35.720
 It's silly Eleanor.

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:37.720
 But mother, I'll economize.

00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:41.320
 I'll get something like a wear to corn roasts and weenie roasts.

00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:45.160
 Oh, mother, if I don't get a new dress, I'll just die. I know which.

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:48.360
 Oh, I'd have a hard time explaining that to your father.

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:50.360
 Oh, I'll die.

00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:52.360
 Oh, right.

00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:55.360
 Can you meet me at the Emporium tomorrow?

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:57.360
 Oh, yes, Mother, and thank you.

00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:00.360
 I saw just the thing down there I have in mind.

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:02.360
 It's good night where you are, Mother.

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:04.360
 I'll answer the phone for you.

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:05.360
 Hello?

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:06.360
 Hello, is this Eleanor?

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:09.360
 Yes, this is Betty. I just had a great idea.

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:10.360
 What about?

00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:12.360
 Well, you know that cornrolls we're having?

00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:13.360
 Yes.

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:15.360
 Well, my uncle has a cabin down by the lake,

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:17.360
 and I ask him whether the whole class could meet there.

00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:19.360
 And what do you think, Eleanor?

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:24.240
 He said he'd be very glad to let us have it, and he's sending two men out there to get the whole thing cleaned up for us.

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:28.240
 Really? Yes. I think it's a very original idea, don't you?

00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:30.240
 Yes, I was just telling my mother.

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:31.360
 And what else do you think?

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:32.000
 What?

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.800
 But Dennis is gonna take the brace off my teeth.

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:36.000
 He is?

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.080
 And the special favor, just for the weekend.

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:39.440
 That's wonderful.

00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:40.560
 No, why?

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:42.160
 Am I looking forward to it?

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:43.360
 I should imagine.

00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:44.960
 I think it's terribly exciting.

00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:46.160
 I should think you were.

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:47.440
 And how?

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:50.440
 You know what's been here since I've eaten sweet corn?

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:51.440
 Hey!

00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:53.440
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:16:53.440 --> 00:17:01.440
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:07.440
 Quiet, please. Quiet. Why can't we have an orderly clash meeting for a change?

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:10.440
 Gee Henry, everything's going swell. They haven't even mentioned the corn roast.

00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:12.440
 Quiet, Homer. I think they've forgotten they voted on.

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:15.440
 Quiet, please. Quiet.

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:19.880
 The next item on the agenda is report on the corn roast.

00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:21.380
 Where is Henry Orich?

00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:22.380
 Oh boy, who?

00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:23.380
 There he is, Mr. President.

00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:25.380
 Is that Orich back in the corner?

00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:26.380
 Yes.

00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:27.380
 Yes, Mr. President.

00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:28.980
 Will you make a report?

00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:32.780
 Well, I'd like to say a few words on that subject.

00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:37.760
 It has come to my attention that some of the people around here are a little upset by the

00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:39.800
 corn situation.

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:43.540
 We've always been pretty proud of the harmony in the class, and I think would be a great

00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:48.340
 mistake if we let an innocent suggestion by me about having a cornrow split us wide open.

00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:55.140
 After all, we have our annual what you may call it's to have a good time. And for that

00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:59.940
 reason I think it's foolish to go ahead willy-nilly with a cornrow. I second the motion. No motion

00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:07.060
 has been made yet, Norman. Then I second it when it's me. Oh, you're out of water. You

00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:10.020
 That's so well just as a matter of principle I like to know

00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:16.940
 To a corn rose tan rate what are you suggesting its place?

00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:22.860
 We girls have a right to know where we stand around here

00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:31.580
 And don't misunderstand me Betty I think we ought to have a dance and corn

00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:36.820
 Only only working together so that everybody will be satisfied and that won't be any hard feelings

00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:39.740
 Well

00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:44.100
 Why couldn't we show a little originality and initially I'm gonna have sort of a farm dance

00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:45.820
 You know what I mean?

00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:51.040
 The only not a plain ordinary barn dance. This would be different the decorating

00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:55.060
 Nothing but ears of corn. Mr. President. I second that motion

00:18:57.060 --> 00:19:01.060
 I can't have corn to eat instead of just corn for decorations.

00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:05.060
 Because along this time of the year, Toby, you take corn for instance.

00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:10.060
 It's very colorful and nice to look at, while sweet corn is liable to be tough.

00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:13.060
 If you don't want to lose a tooth when you're out on a social event, do you?

00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:15.060
 I can take care of my teeth.

00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:18.060
 But I say why take a chance?

00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:22.060
 After all, we can eat corn any old time. Why get into a rut?

00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:27.100
 I think we ought to be the first class in the history of Central High or any other school

00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:31.060
 that has the originality and initiative to have a plain card dance.

00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:35.060
 [cheering]

00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:37.060
 Mr. President, I have the floor for...

00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:39.060
 Yes, my name is...

00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:43.060
 Order, please. The chair recognizes on our work worth...

00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:46.060
 Mr. President, I'd like to protest.

00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:49.060
 Just because the majority in this class is composed of boys,

00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:53.060
 That doesn't give the boys any right to change their minds every ten seconds.

00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:56.060
 We girls have a right to know what's going to happen to us!

00:19:56.060 --> 00:20:00.060
 I demand that a ball be taken!

00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:01.060
 No, wait a minute, Eleanor!

00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:07.060
 I demand that a ball be taken on our having a simple, informal dance in evening clothes!

00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:08.060
 No!

00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:09.060
 Yes!

00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:10.060
 No!

00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:13.060
 Mr. President, Mr. President, Mr. President!

00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:14.060
 Mr. President!

00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:22.800
 [Music]

00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:25.760
 Mother, did you hear what happened at Henry School today?

00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:26.760
 No Mary.

00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:30.760
 My goodness, I don't know what started it, but one of the classes practically had a riot.

00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:31.760
 Really?

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:35.960
 I understand they had to call in six hall monitors and the gym teacher to quiet them down.

00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:36.960
 What was the trouble?

00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:40.960
 I don't know, but they tell me the class is in a terrible condition.

00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:42.960
 Nobody's speaking to anybody.

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:47.960
 There's even some talk of when they graduate, they're going to have two separate commencements.

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:48.960
 Or four!

00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:54.960
 Well, all the girls say they won't be seen graduating from the same platform as the boys.

00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:55.960
 What is the living home?

00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:56.960
 Is that you, Henry?

00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:57.960
 Yes, mother.

00:20:57.960 --> 00:20:58.960
 Oh, Mrs. Aldrich.

00:20:58.960 --> 00:20:59.960
 Hi, Mary.

00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:00.960
 Hello, Homer.

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:03.960
 Henry, how on earth did you get your shirt torn?

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:04.960
 My shirt?

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:05.960
 My shirt?

00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:06.960
 Oh, Gee whiz.

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:08.960
 Do you know who I think tore it, Henry?

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:09.960
 Oh, Betty.

00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:11.960
 When did she do that?

00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:14.220
 Right after Natalie White slapped his face.

00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:18.760
 Henry, why don't you slap your face for?

00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:20.360
 I took the floor away from her.

00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:21.360
 The floor?

00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:22.360
 You blocked?

00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:24.360
 I took the floor away from her.

00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:26.360
 We had a class meeting.

00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:28.560
 Homer, you better get some Akira Crump for your face.

00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:29.760
 It's all scratched up.

00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:31.260
 That was Madeline Miller.

00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:34.460
 Yeah, I goodness, she must have long fingernails.

00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:35.460
 Not anymore.

00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:41.460
 Henry, you didn't get into a fight with any of the girls, did you?

00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:43.900
 She was no. I was a gentleman through the whole thing.

00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:47.060
 I don't understand what caused the whole thing.

00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:50.340
 Well, we had what you might call a close vote.

00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:52.700
 See, Mother? But we got it through, didn't we, Henry?

00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:54.620
 What did you get through?

00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:56.500
 Oh, just a little motion I made.

00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:58.500
 Listen, Mother, where'd you put the corn?

00:21:58.500 --> 00:21:59.340
 The corn?

00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:00.780
 Sure, my 12 bushels.

00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:02.780
 Oh, no, it isn't Mrs. Aldrich.

00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:04.660
 Yes, it is, Homer.

00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:06.260
 Mary, we were just down there.

00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:08.060
 And there wasn't even one basket there.

00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:09.540
 Well, I don't understand.

00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:12.300
 Mother, did you go out at all the day?

00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:13.200
 Yes, I did.

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:14.600
 Did you lock all the doors?

00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:16.100
 Oh, but the back door.

00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:17.200
 Oh, boy.

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:18.900
 You think our corn's been stolen him?

00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:20.700
 Sure it has, Homer. Sure it has.

00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:22.400
 There don't be ridiculous.

00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:26.200
 No one is going to steal 12 bushels of corn you can't eat.

00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:26.900
 Corn?

00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:29.100
 You boys aren't worried about the corn, are you?

00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:30.100
 We sure are, Father.

00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:30.900
 Hello, Sam.

00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:31.500
 Hello, dear.

00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:33.300
 Do you know anything about the corn, Sam?

00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:34.600
 I certainly do.

00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:35.200
 Who took it?

00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:36.300
 Who took it, I did.

00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:37.100
 You did?

00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:39.700
 After all, I wasn't going to let Mr. Frederick stick.

00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:42.620
 my own son with the load of useless horse corn.

00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:43.500
 No sir.

00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:46.260
 So I just went out there and made him take it back.

00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:47.860
 You haven't got the corn anymore?

00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:49.140
 I should say not.

00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:51.500
 Did Mr. Fredericks give you the money?

00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:53.340
 No, potatoes.

00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:55.780
 [LAUGHTER]

00:22:55.780 --> 00:22:57.260
 Potatoes?

00:22:57.260 --> 00:23:00.180
 Nobody puts anything over on Sam always let me tell you,

00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:01.860
 I'm a pretty sharp trader, you know.

00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:03.340
 But father, you're all rich.

00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:04.340
 No bother to thank me.

00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:06.700
 It was my own fault for not being more careful in the first place.

00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:07.900
 But father, you're all rich.

00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:10.500
 I let him know quite plainly I would stand for no nonsense.

00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:12.660
 But, Paul, Mr. Oldrich!

00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:24.500
 Look, Daddy, see that window in the Emporium? That person, the senator?

00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:28.500
 Yeah, that's exactly like the one I got for the corn roast. Only mine was blue.

00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:30.100
 And they won't let you take it back?

00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:32.900
 No, that's why my mother's so mad at our class.

00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:37.300
 Well, look, Daddy, I guess you're going on and this is about as far as I go.

00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:38.500
 Well, I'll see you tomorrow.

00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:39.340
 Goodbye.

00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:40.180
 - Bye.

00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:41.020
 - Bye.

00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:43.060
 - Oh, hello mother.

00:23:43.060 --> 00:23:45.300
 I wondered whether you'd be here.

00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:47.620
 - Now Eleanor, are you sure you have to buy

00:23:47.620 --> 00:23:50.260
 a special outfit just for a barn, Dan?

00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:51.820
 - Oh my goodness, yes.

00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:53.900
 After all, I can't wear a corn roast dress

00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:56.860
 to a corn dance, especially when the whole dance

00:23:56.860 --> 00:23:58.520
 was Henry's idea.

00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:01.100
 (upbeat music)

00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:08.600
 Quietly! Quiet!

00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:11.800
 Henry, what are we gonna do?

00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:13.700
 Let's just wait and see if something happens.

00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:15.300
 Well, we're still stuck with the potatoes.

00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:17.400
 Homer, relax. Take it easy.

00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:19.000
 My father says that's a trouble.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.300
 We've been taking it easy when we should have been tough.

00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:22.900
 I'm gonna make a motion. What motion?

00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:23.900
 I don't know yet.

00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:26.100
 But Mr. President, Homer Brown...

00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:27.300
 I had the floor first.

00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:28.300
 Nobody recognized you.

00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:29.300
 Sit down.

00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:31.300
 Sit down, Homer.

00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:35.000
 As long as there is some doubt about who had the floor first,

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.000
 I think we should recognize the young lady.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.000
 (cheering)

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:40.000
 Thank you Mr. President.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.000
 I'm glad to see there's a little chivalry left in this school.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.000
 Mr. President, this is a matter of principle!

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.000
 Betty Noten has the floor.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:48.000
 Thank you.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:54.000
 I should like to bring to your attention an article in today's school paper, which is the most sensible thing I've ever read in my life.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:57.000
 It's called "In These Times."

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:04.000
 It says, "In these times it hardly seems fitting in proper for students who are planning a dance to spend their money on unnecessary decorations."

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.720
 decorations such as corn. If the junior class really wants to hold a dad so it

00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:12.640
 will be long remembered, why don't they give a dance without the decorations and

00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:16.360
 show a little originality and initiative by contributing that money in the fall of

00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:20.080
 food like potatoes.

00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:25.360
 They are very generous and appreciated steps and would eliminate a lot of

00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:30.080
 worries. Time a loyal classmate.

00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:33.280
 Mr. President, why must it be potatoes?

00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:36.280
 Because in the staff of life, that's Brad.

00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:39.280
 The professor told me the person who wrote that article

00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:40.280
 knew what he was talking about.

00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:42.280
 And we're going to carry out his wishes.

00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:45.280
 Mr. President, I make a motion that this class give a dance,

00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:49.280
 just a plain informal dance, an evening dress,

00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:51.280
 without any other decoration.

00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:55.280
 And then we use the proceeds to buy potatoes for people that are worried.

00:25:55.280 --> 00:26:00.280
 Mr. President, Henry Olrich, I just want to say that since I was the one who first

00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:05.200
 suggested the court dance after hearing that article I'm ashamed of myself I

00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:13.480
 not only would grow my suggestion but I second Betty's motion hey Henry who wrote

00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:18.360
 that article what do you think why didn't you tell me I even put the paper on

00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:22.360
 Betty's desk hey Homer Homer there's a fella in the hall it wants to see you he

00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:26.280
 wants to see me who is it I don't know somebody just told me come on Homer let's

00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:31.740
 get out we're sitting pretty I'll say we are order order all those in favor of

00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:36.540
 our country the banks proceeds to potatoes you said that's ready for corn please

00:26:36.540 --> 00:26:47.100
 say hi Henry do you see anyone out here no hello Homer father what are you doing

00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:50.980
 here I just went out and had a talk with that farmer who owed you money you did

00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:55.740
 mr. Brown yes sir and I fixed things I told him he couldn't unload first horse

00:26:55.740 --> 00:26:58.140
 and then old potatoes that were even sprouting.

00:26:58.140 --> 00:26:59.740
 Maybe he could do that to Sam Alrich,

00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:01.340
 but he couldn't do it to me.

00:27:01.340 --> 00:27:03.140
 You mean you got our money, Father?

00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:05.540
 No, he didn't have any cash.

00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:09.140
 But I made him come across with 25 baskets of spinach.

00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:11.140
 Spinnish!

00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:15.140
 Oh boy, Homer, not even the poor will take spinach!

00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:17.140
 [applause]

00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:26.140
 [applause]

00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:30.140
 Within the next 20 seconds that fire will break out somewhere in the United States,

00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:34.140
 yes, there are 4,600 fires in America each day.

00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:38.140
 By obeying a few simple rules, we can protect ourselves from dis-devastating menace.

00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:43.140
 Don't smoke in bed or discard lighted cigarettes carelessly, and be careful with matches.

00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:47.640
 Remember, it doesn't pay to gamble with fire. You can't win.

00:27:47.640 --> 00:28:00.340
 Hello?

00:28:00.340 --> 00:28:02.140
 And just one more thing, Henry.

00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:03.340
 Wasn't she again, Eleanor?

00:28:03.340 --> 00:28:06.140
 It certainly is the more I think about it.

00:28:06.140 --> 00:28:09.140
 A spinach dance! A spinach dance!

00:28:09.140 --> 00:28:11.640
 And I have a brand new yellow chafeta!

00:28:12.140 --> 00:28:15.140
 Well, couldn't you go as a slice of egg?

00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:17.140
