 Henry! Henry Aldrich!

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.000
 Coming, Mother!

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 The Aldrich family! A special rebroadcast for you soldiers, sailors, and Marines of the United Nations.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 Watch a teenage boy in action, and you can probably discover the source of his impulsive vitality.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
 Whatever he does is immensely important and all engrossing.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 Henry Aldrich proves that.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
 The scene opens at the Aldrich breakfast table.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
 Thank you, Sam. I think I will.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 Mary.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 Thank you, Father.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 Henry.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 Henry.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 Why?

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.000
 Oh, no, thanks, Father.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 Well, Henry, I want you to at least eat your oatmeal.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
 Mother, I ate all the milk on it.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 And you know how much nourishment there is milk, don't you?

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 Henry, did you get over-tired at the dance last night?

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 Who I, Mary? Tired?

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 Henry, if you're old enough to dance, you're old enough to eat oatmeal.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 Now, don't let me hear your mother speak about it again.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
 Even when I don't have any appetite, Father.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 Henry, didn't you hear your father or do you either eat or stop dancing?

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.080
 - You stop dancing? - Mary, I'm eating it.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.400
 I want to know whether I have to go clear through the bottom.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.800
 It seems to me, Henry, you have the wrong attitude.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.840
 There are lots of people in this world who give anything for a dish about me.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.680
 Mother, it isn't that I don't appreciate it.

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.320
 It's girls that I'm sick of.

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.720
 - Girls, dear? - Boy, never again.

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.160
 - Why should I want to furl away my life dancing? - What's that?

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.160
 - Why should I... - Boy, the way I look at it...

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:47.360
 - What are you holding your cup up in the air like that for? - I'm fascinated. Go on, Henry.

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.740
 Well, I just thought things over that salt.

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.940
 I don't feel I'm getting anywhere the way I'm going.

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.240
 You know what I mean? Being a darn butterfly?

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.740
 So, Mother, don't you think I could just forget my oatmeal?

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.140
 You certainly may not.

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.440
 By the way, Alice, is anyone phone for me this morning?

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:01.840
 No, Sam, not that I know of.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.940
 No. Well, if any call does come for me, it'll probably be a Mr. Gilcrest.

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:05.540
 Who?

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.940
 Mr. Gilcrest. And please be sure to call me. I'll probably be up in the attic working.

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.240
 - How do you mean you're not going to the office today? - I am not.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.940
 And that phone call is very important.

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.440
 - Is that clear, Alice? - Yes, Sam. Of course it's clear.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.340
 - And, Mary, do you understand? - Yes, Father.

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.340
 And, Anne-Ray, Anne-Ray, what are you staring into your oatmeal for?

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.340
 Who I, Father? I wasn't staring, I was just watching the spoon sing.

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.340
 Hi, Anne-Ray. She was home. Are you here?

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.340
 We have to wait that bathroom news for you.

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:32.340
 Anne-Ray. I'm coming, Homer.

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.340
 Anne-Ray.

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:34.340
 Anne-Ray. Yes, Father?

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.340
 When Homer came in, I was asking you whether you understood.

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.340
 I heard you, Father. She, you can depend on me.

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.340
 Hey, Henry, who do you think I just saw? Who do you think I just had a talk with?

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:43.340
 Who?

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:44.780
 Agnes, and do you know what she said?

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.500
 She said that when Kathleen got home from the dance last night,

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.900
 she was so upset over the fight you and she had she couldn't sleep all night.

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.420
 She couldn't, Homer, she couldn't.

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.300
 And do you know what Agnes said she told her to do?

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.800
 Why?

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.540
 She said, Kathleen, or the telephone you want to apologize.

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:58.780
 Is that right, Homer?

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.440
 Kathleen's going to apologize to me?

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:01.140
 Sure.

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.260
 As a matter of fact, hasn't she called you, yes?

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.680
 No, but she probably will any minute, though.

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.500
 She's a-- you know, well, I mean, if she wasn't able to sleep last night,

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:10.940
 she's probably having a late breakfast.

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:11.980
 That's true.

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.260
 Are you gonna forgive her?

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.160
 Well, I'll certainly be fair. She was at the least I can do.

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.260
 Henry, could you and Homer please get out of my way?

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.960
 Mary, Homer and I happen to be very busy discussing something.

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.660
 Now please don't hang around and try to listen.

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.260
 Henry, all I want to do is use the phone.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.260
 Use the phone? I'm sorry, but you can't use it right now, Mary.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:29.860
 Why not? I'm using the phone.

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.760
 You're using it by Henry Aldrich. You're standing ten feet away from it.

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.360
 And all I want to do is phone Daisy Harper and say hello.

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:41.360
 Daisy Harper? She was. You've never gotten Daisy Harper on the poor near life of what you just hung there for a couple of hours at a stretch.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.080
 Well, I know my right, Henry Older.

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.280
 Don't let her buy you, Henry. Don't let her buy you.

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.720
 Now, Mary, wait a minute.

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.480
 Oh, no, I won't let go of me.

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.120
 There, Mary. Now look at what you've done.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.240
 - And we had to knock the table over you, dear. - Henry?

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:55.720
 Yes, Mother. - What was that?

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.960
 Why, I'll tell you, Mrs. Older, she was just explaining something to Mary.

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:02.480
 Well, see, Dad, you come in here and finish your boat, Beale.

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:03.680
 See that, Henry? See that?

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.480
 Mother, couldn't you save my oatmeal for me so I can have it for lunch?

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:08.160
 For lunch?

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.520
 Sure. Just slice and buy it for me.

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.020
 Oh boy, there's the phone.

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:13.720
 And now, Mary, will you please get out of this hall

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:14.920
 while I have my conversation?

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.320
 - I mean, I won't listen to you. - That is in the point, Mary.

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.020
 Do you want to make us feel uncomfortable?

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:20.120
 Well, all right.

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.120
 But don't expect me to do this before you all the time.

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.320
 - Hello? - Hello?

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.520
 Hello, is this Kathleen's father? I mean...

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.820
 May I speak with Mr. Aldridge, please?

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:31.020
 - Mr. Aldridge? - Yes, this is Mr. Gilchrist.

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.820
 I'm very anxious to get in touch with him.

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.120
 Oh, yes, it seems as though I remember him mentioning

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.520
 your name at breakfast or something.

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.520
 - I beg your pardon? - Just a minute, I'm calling.

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:39.920
 Father!

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.260
 Father!

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
 Mr. Aldrich!

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.300
 Listen, can we get rid of him fast?

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.040
 Maybe Kathleen is trying to get you.

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.840
 Hello?

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.140
 Hello? Is this Mr. Aldrich?

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:51.500
 No, sir, I just happened to remember Mr. Gilchrist.

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.440
 My father said you should call him at his office.

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:54.180
 I think.

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:55.640
 - Is that the office? - Sure.

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:57.340
 And I remember he said it was very important.

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:58.640
 And he must be on his way by now.

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:01.080
 - Can we hang up? - The only thing is...

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.340
 Well, maybe I can get him before my train leaves.

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:04.120
 Thank you very much.

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.380
 That's all I. Goodbye.

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:13.380
 [Squeaking]

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.380
 Hello, Mr. Aldrich's office.

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:16.380
 Hello, is Mr. Aldrich there?

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:17.380
 No, he isn't.

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:18.380
 Well, this is Mr. Brown.

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:21.380
 Do you know where the Mr. Aldrich has gotten in touch with Mr. Gilcrest yet?

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:25.380
 Well, Mr. Brown, Mr. Aldrich was expecting him to go over to his house for a conference, I believe.

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:26.380
 This morning?

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:28.380
 Yes, you see, Mr. Aldrich isn't coming into the office today.

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:29.380
 Oh.

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:32.380
 Well, I'll jump in the car and go right over to Mr. Aldrich's house.

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:34.380
 I want to get in on that conference if I can.

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:37.980
 I'm sure Mr. Aldrich will be very glad to get the two of you together.

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:38.580
 Goodbye.

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:39.580
 Goodbye, Mr. Brown.

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:47.380
 Hello, Mr. Aldrich's office.

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:49.580
 Hello. May I speak with Mr. Aldrich, please?

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:51.980
 Mr. Aldrich isn't in right now. May I take any message?

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:53.380
 Well, this is Mr. Gilchrist.

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:55.580
 About how long before you expect him in?

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:58.380
 Mr. Gilchrist, Mr. Aldrich isn't expecting to see you here.

00:05:58.380 --> 00:05:59.780
 He's waiting for you up at his house.

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:02.380
 Up at his house? I just honed his house.

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:04.000
 They said he was on his way down to the office.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.380
 Really? He's decided to come down here?

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:07.540
 That's what they said.

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:09.940
 And I'm supposed to catch a train in 25 minutes.

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:12.880
 Well, Mr. Gilchrist, you better hurry up and come right down here then.

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:14.580
 You think I'll be able to see him?

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:17.680
 Oh, yes. It's a told you he's coming down here. He ought to be here any minute.

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:18.380
 Very well.

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:21.580
 And then, oh my goodness, I wonder if I can get hold of Mr. Brown.

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:32.080
 Oh, and what are you going to do to spend all Saturday here by this phone?

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:35.180
 Mrs. Aldrich, that's just exactly what I've been trying to tell him.

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:38.380
 Mother, I don't need any fresh air. I slept with my window open all night.

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:40.980
 Well, get away from that phone, dear. I want to put in a call.

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:43.180
 Now? Now, Justice Cackley?

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:46.380
 Mother, couldn't you please wait just a few more minutes?

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:47.780
 Oh, you're waiting for a call?

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:48.580
 Yes, sure.

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:51.580
 Well, let me know just as soon as you're through, because I have to order the groceries.

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:53.280
 Yes, Mother, and thank you very much.

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:56.780
 Listen, Henry. I know you slept with your window open last night.

00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:59.980
 But why don't you look at it this way? The sun shining.

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:02.580
 Alright Homer, alright, why don't you go out then?

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:03.380
 Alone?

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:04.980
 What is there I could do alone?

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:06.480
 Look, why don't you do this?

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:08.780
 Why don't you phone Kathleen and get it over with?

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:13.580
 Oh no, Homer, long ago it was her fault and she practically died and apologized to me.

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:14.080
 Henry!

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:15.680
 Mary, there's no use asking me.

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:17.080
 I'm not doing this phone yet.

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:18.780
 Henry, I'm not even asking you about the phone.

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:22.680
 I just wanted to tell you that Mother has a can of peas out in the kitchen she wants you to open for.

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:24.380
 Sure, I know, Mary, I know.

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:25.580
 Now run along.

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:28.680
 If you think you're gonna get me away from this phone with a can of peas, you're crazy.

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:31.940
 Henry, must I ask Mother to beg you in writing to open her canopy?

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:32.680
 A merry mail.

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:33.480
 I know, Homer.

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:36.220
 Mother, still remember the time you pulled the clock out of the vinegar bottle.

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:38.880
 Mary, I wasn't going to offer to open your darn can.

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:41.760
 I was just going to suggest if it's so important to get it open.

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:44.220
 Why don't you bring the can and the can opener in here?

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:45.820
 All right, just to show you, I will.

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:46.720
 I certainly will.

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:47.720
 And she reserves the phone.

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:48.720
 There's the phone.

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:49.420
 Hello?

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:50.520
 Hello, Kathleen.

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:51.860
 Henry, you're completely crazy.

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:52.920
 That's the front door.

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:54.360
 And Homer, can't you please answer it?

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:55.320
 Sure, Mary.

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:55.920
 Number three.

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:56.960
 And never mind off, right?

00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:58.560
 My sister just asked home an answer.

00:07:58.560 --> 00:07:59.460
 - I beg your pardon?

00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:00.960
 - It isn't a phone, goodbye.

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:02.560
 - Oh, my, what are you doing over here?

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:03.660
 - Oh, hello, Father.

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:05.860
 I'm helping Henry wait for a phone call.

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:06.760
 - For Mr. Brown.

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:07.660
 - Good morning, Henry.

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:08.560
 Where's your father?

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:09.960
 - My father, are we out the office?

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:10.960
 - Down at the office.

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:11.760
 - Oh, no.

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:12.560
 - Yes, sir.

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:13.960
 He particularly mentioned at breakfast

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:15.160
 that he was going to the office.

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:17.760
 - Well, what did they tell me he was up here for?

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:19.460
 Look out, while I use your phone a minute.

00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:21.060
 - You wanna use this phone, Mr. Brown?

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:21.560
 - I do.

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:23.160
 - The father, I'm sorry, but it's busy.

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:24.160
 - What do you mean it's busy?

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:25.420
 I've got to call Mr. Aldrich.

00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:26.560
 What do you mean you're going to call me?

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:27.220
 Hello there Will.

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:28.220
 Bam!

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:29.960
 I thought you were down at the office.

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:32.000
 She was, Father, how'd you get back so soon?

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.460
 From where I've been up in the attic.

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:34.560
 With Mr. Gilchrist.

00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:35.160
 But who?

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:37.200
 With Mr. Gilchrist, Father, did you find him all right?

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:37.760
 What do you mean?

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:39.300
 Did Mr. Gilchrist find me?

00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:40.640
 Henry, where is Mr. Gilchrist?

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:44.140
 Well, I'm not sure, but I think he said he'd be very glad to wait for you,

00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:45.040
 Don't you're all?

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:46.240
 That's a fine thing.

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:47.240
 Here, let me have that phone.

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:48.440
 Oh boy.

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:50.920
 Father, couldn't you please wait just a little while longer?

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:51.680
 Wait, wait.

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:53.280
 Henry, do you realize what you've done?

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:55.680
 - Do you realize it? - There she is, Henry. There she is.

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:56.680
 Homer, let me have that phone.

00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:58.880
 I'm just handing it to you, Henry, here.

00:08:58.880 --> 00:08:59.880
 Hello?

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:00.780
 Yes?

00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:02.680
 - Henry, is that my office? - No, it isn't, Father.

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:03.580
 It's a sort of a girl.

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:06.280
 Well, come with me. Maybe my wife knows something about Gilchrist phoning.

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:07.480
 - I'm coming. - Hello?

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:08.880
 - How is? - Listen, baby, Barbara,

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:10.680
 this is no time to be calling our house.

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:11.680
 That's late, hang on.

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:12.480
 - Hi! - Hey!

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:13.780
 - I'm not in the kitchen, Sam.

00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:15.480
 - Well, you were around when Gilchrist phoned?

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:16.880
 - Yeah, I don't know anything about it.

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:19.580
 - Sam, I've got my car outside. We'd better go right down the door.

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:20.380
 - That's true.

00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:22.940
 Sam, there are two things I want you to do for me on the way down.

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:24.940
 First, take this list into the grocer and leave it.

00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:25.620
 Now, Alice?

00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:28.340
 All you have to do is leave it and run, and they'll fill the order.

00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:30.620
 And then stop off with this note at the emergency aid.

00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:32.540
 Alice, why can't you use the phone for all that?

00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:35.620
 Now, Sam, I can't touch the phone. Henry's waiting for a call from Kathleen,

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:36.980
 and his heart is practically broken.

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:38.860
 And do you realize my day is practically ruined?

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:41.100
 And besides, I don't even go near the grocery store.

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:43.180
 All right, then, Mary can go to the grocery.

00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:45.700
 But you can stop off with this list at the emergency aid.

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:47.500
 It's right in the block above your office.

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:48.460
 What are we giving them?

00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:51.100
 some ging of aprons and a hundred pounds of potatoes we have down the

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:54.640
 basement and a few other things and i have to carry them no did just take

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:56.860
 this list so they'll know what they're going to get

00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:57.820

00:09:57.820 --> 00:10:01.500

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:16.720
 Hello?

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:18.720
 Here's the can opener and here's the can Henry.

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:20.320
 Thank you, Marie. Put it right down there.

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:24.720
 And if you ask me, Henry, all right, no girl in the world is important enough to tie up a whole family like this.

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:25.220
 Hello?

00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:26.520
 Does Henry answer Henry?

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:27.520
 Hello.

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:28.720
 Hello, Ms. Aldridge's office.

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:31.220
 Oh boy, am I glad to get you. This is Henry Aldridge.

00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:31.920
 Yes, Henry.

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:36.120
 Oh, look. My father says I made a terrible mistake and then I can only talk for a minute.

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:36.920
 What did you say?

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:40.920
 I've got a call coming. She and then if the line is busy all the time, she might get discouraged.

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:42.920
 And my father isn't down there. He's up here.

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:44.320
 Mr. Aldridge is up there at the house?

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:45.720
 Yes, he turned up in the attic.

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:49.000
 Well, I'm awfully glad you thought I'll send Mr. Gilcrest off right away.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.160
 That's fine, because my father's pretty mad.

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:51.960
 Why?

00:10:51.960 --> 00:11:02.120
 But Kathleen, I've been expecting you to ask Henry.

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:03.640
 I can't help that, Milly.

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:06.280
 But we're gonna have such fun on the picnic.

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:09.200
 Why don't you go to the phone now and call Henry

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:11.640
 and ask him whether he wouldn't like to come along with us?

00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:12.520
 Oh, no, Milly.

00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:14.160
 If you'd like to ask him, you go ahead.

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:16.460
 But I'm certainly not going to be the one that calls in.

00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:17.620
 All right.

00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:18.420
 Hello?

00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:19.220
 No, but please.

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:20.720
 M303.

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:22.220
 M303.

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:24.360
 Kathleen, tell me, couldn't I potentially?

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:26.260
 Have you and Henry had a falling house?

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:27.160
 That's falling out.

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:29.800
 My goodness, Nelly, whatever gave you an idea like that.

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:32.200
 I just said I wasn't going to be the one that phones in.

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:33.000
 Hello?

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:33.500
 Hello?

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:34.600
 Is that you, Henry?

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:36.140
 Yes, is that you, Kathleen?

00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:37.300
 Kathleen?

00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:38.140
 No.

00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:39.440
 Did you want to speak to her?

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:40.240
 Why not?

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:41.940
 No, I mean, but it's--

00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:42.980
 Who is this?

00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:44.480
 This is Nellie Miller.

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:46.620
 Could you hold the line just a second?

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:48.520
 Kathleen, you're a secretary, say you're a no-nilly.

00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:49.920
 Don't you dare tell me I'm here.

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:51.180
 Well, I'm gone now.

00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:52.980
 Hello?

00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:55.120
 Nellie, is there somebody there with you?

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:57.520
 Well, I... No, not exactly.

00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:00.920
 And Henry, how would you like to go on a picnic with a few of us?

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:02.620
 A picnic? Today?

00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:04.960
 Yes, we're gonna have a wonderful time.

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:07.260
 And all you'd have to furnish would be leather.

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.560
 Lettuce? Well, actually, I'm certainly...

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:10.400
 I'm certainly...

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:12.800
 Henry, look at all of my...

00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:15.200
 Nothing, Nelly. I'm just trying to open a can of peace.

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:17.400
 - Yeah, what? - I certainly like to go with you,

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:19.200
 but I'm expecting a telephone call.

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:21.200
 It's very important, and...

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:24.200
 No, Nelly, I don't think I'd better go with you.

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:26.000
 - Really? - And, and listen, I...

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.500
 I don't like the same room, but could you hang up in case...

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:30.200
 In case that call comes for me?

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:32.400
 All right, Henry, if you want to talk to me that way,

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:34.400
 I was just trying to be nice to you.

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:36.700
 - See, I didn't mean it that way. - Son of a apologize.

00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:38.400
 I was only wasting your time. Goodbye.

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:40.600
 - But listen! - What do you say, Nelly?

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:42.600
 - You asked me to hang up. - Son of a ball, look.

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:45.600
 Abola, my goodness, I don't know what's gotten into Henry.

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:54.600
 Miss Thompson, do you have him yet?

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:57.200
 I'm trying to get him, Mr. Oldrich. The operator is ringing your house right this minute.

00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:00.400
 Sam, after you get through talking to Henry, let me have a chance at home.

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:02.800
 I'll turn him over to you, Will, with pleasure.

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:04.200
 Hello? Hello?

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:05.600
 Hello, is Henry Oldrich there?

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:07.400
 Yes, hello. Is this you, Kathleen?

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:09.600
 Who? Isn't this Kathleen speaking?

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:12.600
 No, it isn't. But just a moment, there is someone that would like to speak to you.

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:14.440
 There is? Oh, boy.

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:16.200
 - Henry. - What's that?

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:20.800
 Henry, I want to ask you just one simple question. Where is Mr. Gilchrist?

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:25.000
 Well, I'm certainly glad you called, Father. He's right in the living room reading the National Geographic.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.800
 - What happened to you? - What happened to me? What happened to me?

00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:30.200
 Wait until you hear what's going to happen to you.

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:34.800
 - Henry, what's that noise? - That noise? I'm beating a rug for Mary.

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:38.000
 - What? - I've got a hanging on the bastard and I'm being very careful.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.640
 You tell Mr. Gilchrist we're coming up there and he's to wait.

00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:28.120
 This is Mr. Orich's residence.

00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:29.760
 Well, this is Mr. Gilchrist, Mr. Orich.

00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:31.960
 Oh, how is it when I call your house?

00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:35.360
 I get Mr. Brown, and when I call Mr. Brown's house, I get you?

00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:37.080
 Could you say that again, please?

00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:39.560
 I'm down at the station, and I just wanted to tell you

00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:42.280
 that in less than one minute, I'm stepping on board my train.

00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:43.040
 You're leaving?

00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:44.320
 Right now, goodbye.

00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:46.360
 But Mr. Gilchrist, Mr. Gilchrist!

00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:48.560
 - Sam, that wasn't a call for Henry, was it? - It was not.

00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:51.520
 Alice, will you please try to tell me what has happened to this telephone system?

00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:55.160
 Well, I've been wondering about that myself, because Henry is just terribly upset.

00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:56.320
 Henry is, Henry is.

00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:58.840
 I think you ought to call the company, dear, and complain to them

00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:02.400
 that Henry's been sitting here by this phone most all morning, and nothing has happened.

00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:04.880
 What do you mean nothing has happened?

00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:07.280
 Now, Sam, this isn't anywhere for you than for Henry.

00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:10.000
 Just remember the poor boys in the living room completely sunk.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:10.800
 What's the matter with him?

00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:12.000
 He's so depressed, Sam.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.440
 He wouldn't eat his fried-out meal even if I warmed it over for him.

00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:16.940
 Oh my goodness, there's the phone again.

00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:18.340
 Mother, do I have the phone ring?

00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:20.440
 You do, and if you want to answer it, you may.

00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:22.140
 Well, thank you, Father. Thank you very much.

00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:24.640
 As soon as you're through answering it, I want to have a talk with you.

00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:25.440
 Yes, Father.

00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:26.440
 Nothing?

00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:27.440
 Hello?

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:28.440
 Hello?

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:30.440
 This isn't Kathleen, but listen.

00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:34.140
 If I were you, I wouldn't come anywhere near my house.

00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:34.940
 Why not?

00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:37.740
 The telephone company was just there and they took out our phone.

00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:39.240
 What did they do that for?

00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:40.940
 What do you say you told them to?

00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:41.940
 For me?

00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:43.240
 Oh my, I give you my word.

00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:45.240
 I'm coming from the Haven Drug Store.

00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:47.200
 And you better keep away from my father.

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:47.880
 Goodbye.

00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:49.480
 - But Homer! - Homer!

00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:50.720
 Henry, where did your mother go?

00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:51.680
 I don't know, Father.

00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:52.840
 What do you think just happened?

00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:54.480
 I know what just happened, Alice.

00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:55.760
 What is it, Sam? What is it?

00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:57.360
 Alice, they just delivered some groceries.

00:23:57.360 --> 00:24:00.040
 And may I ask just what it was you ordered?

00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:01.080
 Why, a lot of things.

00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:02.800
 Did you order a hundred pounds of potatoes?

00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:03.280
 No.

00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:04.560
 Did you order any lentils?

00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:06.600
 No, we've got all that down in the basement.

00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:08.600
 It's what we're giving to the emergency aid.

00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:10.520
 Well, the store just delivered them to you with a note

00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:13.120
 pinned on the potatoes, saying they're all out of Gingham aprons.

00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:15.200
 Sam Aldrich, how could they have done a thing like this?

00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:16.700
 That's Henry know anything about that.

00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:18.200
 Henry! Henry!

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:20.200
 He probably went upstairs.

00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:21.200
 I'll answer it.

00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:22.200
 Hello.

00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:24.200
 Hello, Mrs. Aldrich. Is that you?

00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:25.200
 Yes?

00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:26.200
 Well, this is Kathleen Anderson.

00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:29.200
 Oh, hello, Kathleen. I guess I know who you want to speak to.

00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:31.200
 Oh, no, I'm calling you Mrs. Aldrich.

00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:32.200
 Me, dear.

00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:35.200
 Yes, my mother just looked over the list of things you promised to donate to the emergency age.

00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:37.200
 But she wanted me to phone and thank her right away.

00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:40.200
 Well, it wasn't that nice of her. I hope you'll need potatoes.

00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:43.200
 Potatoes? You mean you're going to get potatoes, too?

00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:44.960
 Hard potatoes and laddles on the list?

00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:47.360
 No, I don't think so. I had your list right here.

00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:52.440
 Two pounds of butter, one pound of cheese, two pounds of bacon, five lamb chops,

00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:54.440
 dozen and a half of eggs, two cans of plain apples.

00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:56.880
 Kathleen, where did you get that list?

00:24:56.880 --> 00:25:00.160
 My Mr. Olridge left it at the emergency aid on his way to his office.

00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:03.080
 He took that and s-- Well, isn't that nice?

00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:04.240
 Yes, it certainly is.

00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:06.040
 Yes, it is, isn't it?

00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:09.160
 Kathleen, could you hold the phone just a second while I speak to Mr. Olridge?

00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:10.800
 So you weren't asking about the potatoes?

00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:14.040
 Yes, that's exactly what I want to ask him about. Just hold the line.

00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:17.200
 Sam! Sam! Oldie, where are you?

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:19.200
 I think he went upstairs, Mother.

00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:20.800
 She wins.

00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:24.200
 Mother, did you know someone left the receiver off the telephone?

00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:25.800
 Mother?

00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:27.600
 Whoa, she wears.

00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:28.600

00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:30.400
 Whoa, she wears.

 Hello?

00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:34.400

00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:35.400
 Listen, Kathleen.

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:36.400
 What, Henry?

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:37.400
 Well, imagine that.

00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:38.400
