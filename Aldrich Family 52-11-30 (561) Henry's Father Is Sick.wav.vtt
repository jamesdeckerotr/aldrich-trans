00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000
 Now it's the Aldrich family on NBC. But first this is Bob McKenzie, beginning Monday over most of these stations, two of your favorite NBC friends will be coming to you at a new time.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:19.000
 The first will be Bob Hope and his quips and comments, and by the way Bob's guest editor this coming week will be Screenstar and Baxter.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 The second will be that master of the easy style Dave Garaway.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.100
 Now a lot of us have gotten into the habit of tuning in the boys, so check your

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:31.220
 newspaper for broadcast times and listen at the New Time Monday for two of the

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:37.260
 most entertaining 15 minutes in radio with Bob Hope and Dave Garaway. Now it's

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.460
 the Aldrich family on NBC.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:50.260
 Henry! Henry Aldrich!

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:51.260
 Coming Mother!

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:59.860
 Yes, it's the Audrey family, it's time.

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.060
 Written by Pippa Goldsmith.

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:20.960
 The everyday existence of an average teenage boy like Henry Aldrich

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.600
 is always a very complicated affair.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.200
 Life is one crisis after another.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.460
 And if the normal run of problems isn't baffling enough,

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.560
 there are always adults around to make things even more difficult.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.120
 The scene opens in the Aldrich Breakfast Nook, and the time is morning.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.800
 Well, Stan, it's good to have you downstairs again.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.800
 Thank you, Alice.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.800
 Good morning, everybody.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.840
 Can we don't you know you shouldn't whistle?

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:50.840
 Well, not Mary.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.000
 Don't you realize Father's just recovering from a virus attack?

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.480
 Oh. Did it disturb you, Father?

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.800
 Well, I did feel a slight draft.

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.480
 Sam, I just happened to remember.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:01.680
 What have you got in your hand?

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.080
 I forgot to take your temperature before you came down.

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.200
 Alice, you're not going to take my temperature at the breakfast table.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.880
 But, dear, I really think we should.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.600
 I haven't had any temperature for three days.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.240
 Father, is there anything I can do for you?

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.240
 No, thank you, Mary.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.240
 [whistling]

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.240
 Henry!

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.240
 Oh, she was, I forgot.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.240
 Sam, take this scarf and pull your bathrobe collar up.

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.240
 Alice, I don't need anything more around my neck.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:26.240
 Can I get you anything, Father?

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.240
 No, thank you.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.240
 I just wish you'd all stop acting so I would die.

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.240
 After all, I'm out of bed.

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.240
 Back the doctor says I can stay downstairs two hours today.

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.240
 May I have the hotcakes and sausage, please?

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.240
 Nia, dear.

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.240
 Why can't I have hotcakes and sausage?

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.640
 because milk toast is better for you.

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.240
 That's all I've had for five days.

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.040
 Well, there if you continue to improve

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.640
 how would you like a boiled potato for dinner?

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.440
 That is certainly something to look forward to.

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.240
 If I eat my milk toast this morning,

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.440
 I may have a boiled potato tonight.

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.640
 Harry!

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:04.840
 Oh, I'm sorry, Mary.

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.640
 Can't you see that father's already irritable?

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.040
 What do you mean I'm irritable?

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.240
 Oh, by the way, Mary, when you come home this afternoon,

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.640
 Will you be sure to put the vegetables on in time for dinner?

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.840
 Oh, but Mother, I've got to run over to the hospital this afternoon.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:17.740
 The hospital, Mary?

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:18.740
 Yes, Henry.

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:21.240
 Any reason why Joe Graham can't come over here?

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.640
 Father, he's an intern.

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.640
 He only has two hours off, and I told him I'd meet him there instead of his coming all the way over here.

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.240
 Well, and Henry, you'll have to get the vegetables ready when you get home from school.

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:32.040
 Yes, Mother.

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.640
 Must Henry get the vegetables ready?

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.240
 Oh, my goodness, Sam.

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:39.340
 I don't know why you can't peel a few potatoes and drop them in a pod.

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.340
 After all, I promised to work at the Red Cross today.

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.340
 I'm going to be left alone all day.

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.340
 Henry, didn't Mary ask you not to hear so?

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.340
 Oh, yes, Mother. I just can't get that tune out of my head.

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.340
 And Father, don't you worry about a single thing.

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.340
 I'll be home the minute school is out and do anything I can to make you feel better.

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:58.340
 That's fine, dear.

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:59.340
 I'll take you temperature.

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.340
 Henry, I don't have a temperature.

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.340
 Well, then I'll keep you bundled up.

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.340
 I don't want to be bundled up.

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.340
 She was, and I'll just peel the potatoes.

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.340
 - That was splendid.

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.760
 (jazz music)

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:22.300
 - Hey, hold on a second, call me on.

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.600
 - Hey, Henry, wait a minute, I'll walk down the hall with you.

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.260
 - Well, hurry up, we'll be late for biology.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:27.820
 - You done your assignment for the day?

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:29.300
 - Well, I sorta glanced through it, Homer,

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.140
 but that's all right, I don't have to know it.

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:32.980
 - Well, you mean you don't have to know it.

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.660
 - Oh my god, Ms. Walker's system all figured out.

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:36.940
 They haven't you ever noticed what she does?

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:41.940
 Sure. What? Well, she always calls in this alphabetically. That's a fact.

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.440
 And last time she stopped way down in the K's.

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.940
 Oh no, Henry, you're wrong. She stopped with W.

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.940
 And there's only one other person after that before she comes to Aarbridge.

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:51.440
 Are you sure about that, Homer?

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.440
 Sure, I'm sure. That's why I studied last night.

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.940
 Today she's a synced to calling the A's and the B's.

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:58.940
 Well, she whiz, let me start studying this.

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.440
 Well, you haven't time to cram now, Henry. The bell's gonna ring any minute.

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:06.440
 But once, Homer, once back, last November, she got up to W and then started going backwards.

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:08.440
 So how do you know she's gonna do it again?

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.240
 She might, Homer. She just might.

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.640
 Boy, I pity you if she doesn't though, Henry.

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:16.240
 This is the last period of the day, and she'll make you stay after school.

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.640
 But Homer just can't stay after school today.

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:19.440
 Why not?

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.240
 We have to go right home and pee on my father.

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.040
 What? I mean, the potatoes.

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:26.240
 Well, why do you have to pee on potatoes for?

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.040
 Because we're going to eat them.

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.640
 Oh.

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:30.440
 Come on, cut it out!

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.440
 Homer, you know what I think I better do, maybe?

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:35.440
 Why? Get an excuse to go home and just skip biology.

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.040
 Well, you tell Mr. Bradley.

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:39.840
 Well, just tell him frankly that I've got to put the potatoes on.

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:40.600
 But Henry--

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:41.640
 Homer, you go on to class.

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.440
 I'm going to go into Mr. Bradley's office here.

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.940
 Henry, will they take potatoes for an excuse?

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:47.040
 I don't know why they wouldn't.

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:48.640
 They're perfectly legal.

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:50.240
 Well, so long.

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.200
 So long.

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:55.040
 Was there someone you wanted to see, Henry?

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:56.440
 Yes, Mr. Bradley.

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.440
 If you haven't got anything on your mind--

00:05:58.440 --> 00:05:59.440
 Yes.

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:00.240
 Come here, Adam.

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:03.140
 Yes, sir.

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:06.940
 Mr. Bradley, I'd like to be excused from biology today.

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:09.140
 You were? What for?

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:11.440
 Well, I've got to help my mother get some vegetables ready.

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:15.940
 I see. You feel vegetables are more important than biology?

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:17.440
 Well...

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:20.240
 But I've also promised to get home and take care of my father.

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:21.140
 Your father's ill?

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:21.940
 Yes, sir.

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:23.740
 How serious is his illness?

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:25.740
 Well, he was running a temperature of 103.

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:26.740
 103?

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:27.740
 Yes, sir.

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:30.840
 That was about four days ago, and nobody knew what it was when I left this morning.

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:32.140
 The doctor wouldn't say it.

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:34.780
 My father wouldn't even let anybody near him with a thermometer.

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:37.100
 Well, I'm sorry to hear that about your father.

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:38.140
 Yes, sir.

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:42.140
 Henry, is there any reason why your mother couldn't prepare the vegetables?

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:45.140
 Well, no, Mr. Bradley. Not under ordinary circumstances.

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:47.140
 But she can today, though. She's out working.

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:49.640
 Working? Your mother's out working, Henry?

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:53.140
 Yes, Mr. Bradley. She feels that at a time like this, it's the least she can do.

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:56.140
 Oh, I didn't know about that.

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:59.140
 Your sister, Mary, isn't working, though, is she?

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:00.140
 No, sir.

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:01.140
 Couldn't she help at home?

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:04.740
 Well, the only trouble is she had to go to the hospital this afternoon.

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:05.740
 To the hospital?

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:07.540
 Yes, sir. To the general hospital.

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:10.740
 Well, I guess there's only one thing we can do under those circumstances.

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:12.640
 I'll write out an excuse for you.

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:14.140
 Well, thank you, Mr. Bradley.

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:17.340
 This all puts quite a responsibility on you, doesn't it, Henry?

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:20.840
 Well, I don't mind, Mr. Bradley, and I'm sure my entire family will appreciate this.

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:24.540
 Well, did I remember your father wasn't present at the luncheon club Monday.

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:25.640
 No, no, Mr. Bradley.

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:28.640
 Come to think of it, I don't believe he was present last week either, was he?

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:31.640
 No, sir. It was just a week ago today he began to go under.

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:34.640
 And how's your mother holding up?

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:39.340
 Well, you know, Mother. Father keeps saying I wish she wouldn't try to be two places at once.

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:41.640
 She'll exhaust herself. And him too.

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:43.640
 Here's your excuse, my boy.

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:45.140
 Well, thanks again, Mr. Bradley.

00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:48.640
 And Henry, don't you worry too much about your schoolwork during this.

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:51.640
 No, sir, Mr. Bradley. I'll try not to.

00:07:51.640 --> 00:08:01.640
 (music)

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:03.640
 Can I get you anything else, Father?

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:05.640
 No, thank you. I have my book here.

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:06.640
 Is your pillow all right?

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:07.640
 Yes, thank you.

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:09.640
 Here, I'll throw one more blanket over you.

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:11.640
 Henry, I don't want any more blankets.

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:13.640
 Now, please let me read.

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:17.640
 Well, just in case you do want anything, I'll be right here.

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:19.640
 Now, where'd I leave my knife?

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:22.640
 What are you doing peeling potatoes right here next to my bed?

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:25.640
 I spread a newspaper on the floor father.

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:27.640
 You know what father?

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:34.640
 I saw somebody once would take the whole skin off a potato in one long strip.

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:36.640
 Father?

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:37.640
 Mmm.

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:39.640
 Who was it?

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:41.640
 The sailor in the news reel.

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:44.640
 He had a cat too.

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:45.640
 A cat?

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:47.640
 Oh, who has a cat?

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:57.360
 a cat. But say hello. Henry I'm trying to read. Oh excuse me. You know Mr. Bradley's

00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:02.120
 a pretty nice guy isn't he? He said he missed you at the luncheon club. Did he? Yes sir.

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:07.800
 He said he hoped we'd all bear up under this. Bear up under one. Well you and bad and meet

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:14.520
 peeling. Father do you like that intern at the hospital Mary's going over to see this

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:19.560
 afternoon I do appreciate your helping but I would like very much to finish this

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:25.320
 book in peace and quiet she was I keep forgetting boy there's the telephone

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:28.360
 that's your mother phoning from the Red Cross tell it to stop and get some

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:30.320
 negative

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:35.720
 hello yes Homer can you come over to my house and work on to bargain no no

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:39.840
 Homer not this afternoon why not because I've got my father on my hands

00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:43.640
 For Henry, if we don't finish out to bother him this month, we'll miss all a good sledding.

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:45.640
 Well, wait a minute, Homer, hold the line.

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:47.040
 Father...

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:47.540
 Well...

00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:51.040
 Father, would you mind if Homer came over very quietly for a little while?

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:53.840
 I'll be delighted if you stay downstairs.

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:55.340
 See, thanks, Father.

00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:57.040
 Homer, you can come over here.

00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:57.840
 Okay.

00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:00.440
 George Johnson is here with me. I'll bring him along to help.

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:02.040
 And also, Toby Smith.

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:03.240
 Oh...

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:04.640
 Well...

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:05.940
 Alright, Homer.

00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:06.840
 And Henry.

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:08.940
 What do you think happened in biology today?

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:09.540
 What?

00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:12.300
 Miss Walker didn't even show up. She got the flu.

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:15.180
 - He didn't have any class? - No. Goodbye.

00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:18.100
 Well, imagine that. She whiz.

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:28.700
 Hello? Hello?

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:30.460
 - Hello? - Is that you, Johnson?

00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:32.900
 Yes. This is Bradley up at the high school.

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:35.900
 - Hi, Bradley. - You're on my committee at the Luncheon Club, aren't you?

00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:37.900
 - You're a committee. - The sick committee.

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:38.700
 Oh, yes!

00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:40.700
 Johnson, I got some bad news this morning.

00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:41.400
 Oh, is it?

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:42.300
 Sam Aldrich.

00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:43.200
 He's laid up.

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:44.100
 Sam Aldrich is.

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:47.300
 And just between ourselves, Johnson, it's apparently rather serious.

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:47.800
 No!

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:48.900
 Oh, yes.

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:50.500
 In bed with a high temperature.

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:51.800
 And his wife's out working?

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:53.000
 His daughter's in the hospital.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.200
 Well, she don't say so.

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:55.900
 Yes.

00:10:55.900 --> 00:11:00.300
 Evidently from what his son said, the family's been having a hard time just making ends meet.

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:03.200
 But, uh, badly, I just thought Sam Aldrich was pretty well sex.

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:04.300
 So did I.

00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:08.620
 probably everything's been piling up until this is what you might call a knockout blow

00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:09.980
 well

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:11.160
 and here's what i suggest

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:14.320
 why don't we send flowers to sam and to his daughter too

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:15.100
 good idea

00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:18.100
 as she's at the general hospital i believe Henry said

00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:20.980
 and would you take care of that johnson i certainly will

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:24.780
 uh... only i have a better suggestion if you don't mind it is instead of sending

00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:28.020
 flowers to sam why don't we send something for the whole family say uh...

00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:29.500
 basket of canned goods

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:32.860
 you don't think you might hope we don't have to say what came from doing

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:34.620
 Good idea. Take care of it, will you?

00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:36.320
 Well, you're by Johnson.

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:38.560
 Come in.

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:41.360
 Are you busy, Mr. Bradley?

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:42.960
 You wish to see me in his rumpoon?

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:45.960
 Mr. Bradley, is there any reason why,

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:48.360
 when the Board of Education buys window shades,

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:50.360
 they can't buy good window shades?

00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:51.960
 I beg your pardon?

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:55.360
 I'm speaking of the shades in the school cafeteria.

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:58.160
 Those that are up won't come down,

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:00.860
 and those that are down won't go up.

00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:05.860
 Miss Rumford, please sit down a moment.

00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:07.860
 Yes, Mr. Bradley.

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:10.860
 That is all you have on your mind.

00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:14.860
 But Mr. Bradley, there are fourteen windows in the cafeteria.

00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:18.860
 I'm afraid Miss Rumford, some of us don't know what trouble really is.

00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:21.860
 But you have Venetian blinds, Mr. Bradley.

00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:23.860
 That is not what I'm referring to.

00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:27.860
 Miss Rumford, let me tell you about a student in this school.

00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:32.420
 His father, we all suppose, was one of the most successful practicing lawyers in town.

00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:35.420
 It now appears, however, that the man is in desperate straits.

00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:36.620
 What's the matter with him?

00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:40.980
 Alas, I heard he had a temperature of 103 that was still rising, and there was a daughter

00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:46.180
 in the general hospital, and his mother works out, and the boy himself has to do all the

00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:49.900
 cooking for the entire family.

00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:53.900
 And yet some of the members of the faculty here have been jumping on the boy for not

00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:56.340
 being able to keep his mind on his studies.

00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:57.340
 Is that right?

00:12:57.340 --> 00:13:01.900
 While the rest of us go around complaining, because a window shade that's down won't go up.

00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:05.340
 Hello, Bradley's office.

00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:07.580
 Oh, this is Johnson again. I just had another idea.

00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:08.540
 Yes, Johnson?

00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:11.020
 I've been talking with the rest of the committee.

00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:15.020
 Oh, why don't I pick you up, Milgo over and call on Sam Aldrich this afternoon in person?

00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:17.500
 Good idea. He's probably all alone.

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:18.300
 Sure.

00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:19.420
 Good cheer him up a little.

00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:19.820
 Right.

00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:20.460
 And Bradley?

00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:21.260
 Yes, Johnson?

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:24.540
 Why don't I try rounding up our barbershop quartet?

00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:34.540
 [Music]

00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:37.540
 We'll return to the Aldrich family in just a moment.

00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:41.540
 Fight communism by joining the Crusade for Freedom,

00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:44.540
 the independent movement of the American people,

00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:47.540
 which supports Radio Free Europe and Radio Free Asia.

00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:50.540
 These two freedom networks are shattering the isolation

00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:53.540
 which the Kremlin has imposed on its slave states.

00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:59.640
 As a private enterprise, radio free Europe and radio free Asia can hit hard.

00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:04.960
 Exiles speak to their own countrymen, weakening the Red's morale and authority.

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:10.300
 They identify informers, denounce brutality, ridicule and expose the falseness of the

00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:11.840
 communist line.

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:16.360
 They spike the hate and lie campaign of the Soviets against the free world, and spread

00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:19.840
 news the communist would try to suppress.

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:25.120
 and educational programs meet the spiritual and intellectual needs of its listeners.

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:32.320
 Broadcast to youth tell the truth about communism and the free world. Help build more transmit

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:37.960
 us for Radio Free Europe and expand the operation of Radio Free Asia. Send your contribution

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:42.560
 to crusade for freedom care of your local postmaster.

00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:49.960
 [Music]

00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:52.960
 And now getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldrich.

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:57.960
 Because his mother is helping at the Red Cross, and Mary is visiting at the hospital,

00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:02.960
 Henry is asked to be excused from school early in order to go home and take care of his father,

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:04.960
 who is recovering from a cold.

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:09.380
 explanations however have been inadvertently misleading

00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:12.400
 the scene opens in mister all rages

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:15.200
 father would you like some toast in another cup of tea

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:16.440
 no thank you

00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:21.000
 you sure you don't want any i do not want another cup of tea

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.840
 you have been very helpful henry all afternoon

00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:29.120
 suppose now you take up your potatoes and your pans and your pairing night

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:32.880
 the these two things in that cake in this picture of lemonade

00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:35.080
 go downstairs and let me have a little sleep

00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:37.680
 and leave you all alone i won't mind one bit

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:40.160
 or g father i don't think mother would want to go to sleep without someone

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:42.680
 right here to take the responsibility

00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:45.040
 i won't mention it to your mother

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:47.680
 i'll tell you what i'll do i'll find something you can thump on the floor

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:49.840
 with just in case you need me

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:51.680
 i wonder if there's anything here in this cause

00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:54.360
 and then it please just forget i'm even up here

00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:57.520
 here father which would you rather have this umbrella or this baseball bat i

00:15:57.520 --> 00:15:58.920
 don't care either one

00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:01.440
 go ahead tell me after all you're the one that's gonna have to do the

00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:03.040
 I said either one.

00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:06.440
 Well, I guess the bat would make the most noise.

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:08.440
 Alright, then, give me the bat.

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:10.440
 Oh, here, I'll give you both and you can make your own choice.

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:12.440
 (Laughter)

00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:14.440
 Now I'll just take this tree down.

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:16.440
 (Loud clattering)

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:17.440
 What was that?

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:19.440
 The top of the butter dish.

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:21.440
 Oh, well, I'll get it. It's right here by your bed.

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:22.440
 Just leave it there.

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:23.440
 Yes, sir.

00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:24.440
 (Loud clattering)

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:25.440
 Right now.

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:26.440
 Whoops!

00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:28.440
 So, I'll come back to that one, too.

00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:31.440
 You needn't come back for it, just leave.

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:33.440
 And if you don't gotcha gonna drop another--

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:34.440
 I got it.

00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:36.440
 You don't have to worry about a thing, father.

00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:43.440
 Henry!

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:47.440
 Henry! Henry!

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:50.440
 Henry, old rich!

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:53.440
 That's the fine thing.

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:54.440
 Henry!

00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:56.440
 What are you calling our thoughts?

00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:57.440
 I was.

00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:58.440
 Please answer the telephone.

00:16:58.440 --> 00:16:59.440
 Oh, yes sir.

00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:01.440
 Then pick up what's left of this letter dish.

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:02.440
 Yes sir.

00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:03.440
 Hello?

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:04.440
 Hello?

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:05.440
 Who is it?

00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:07.440
 What number did you call please?

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:09.440
 Father, what number did you call?

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:11.440
 I didn't call any number.

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:13.440
 Well, I guess you called the wrong one.

00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:16.440
 I didn't call any number.

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:18.360
 I didn't call it a number.

00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:20.920
 Well, I guess you called it wrong one.

00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:23.480
 Operator, it's our mistake.

00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:25.360
 Well, isn't that strange?

00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:27.960
 Listen, father, why do you think I found downstairs?

00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:28.680
 What?

00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:30.840
 Well, just as I went down, I had to see somebody running off

00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:31.640
 the front porch.

00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:33.280
 So I opened the door.

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:36.040
 There was a great big basket of groceries.

00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:38.200
 Why did the boy leave them at the front door?

00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:39.440
 Well, I don't know.

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:42.280
 It's canned goods and oranges, and there's two chickens.

00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:42.780
 Good.

00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:43.960
 Apparently your mother's planning

00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:46.560
 to have a real dinner for me for a change.

00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:48.760
 And right on top of this basket, there was a card.

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:50.360
 What did it say?

00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:54.080
 Head up, chin up, chest up, grin.

00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:57.800
 Step up, fuck up, step up, grin.

00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:01.320
 Why would the grocery leave a message like that?

00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:05.520
 Probably the price of chicken is going up again.

00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:07.240
 Will you please pick up that broken dish?

00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:08.520
 Oh, yes, Father.

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:09.720
 Ouch!

00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:10.440
 Well, imagine that.

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:11.160
 What's the matter?

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:11.720
 Oh, it's all right.

00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:13.200
 I just cut my finger on a piece of the dish.

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:15.200
 Let me see it. It isn't anything.

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:18.200
 If it's as deep as it looks, you'd better put something on it.

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:21.200
 Well, I get something in the bathroom. Don't worry about it, Father.

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:28.200
 Henry! Henry! Henry!

00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:32.200
 Henry, where are my slippers?

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:34.200
 Hello?

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:36.200
 May I speak with Mrs. Orrich please?

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:38.200
 Mrs. Orrich isn't here.

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:39.200
 Is this Mr. Orrich?

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:40.200
 It is.

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:42.200
 Well, this is Miss Runford.

00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:44.600
 The cafeteria manager up at the high school.

00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:45.300
 Yes?

00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:50.900
 Mr. Arbridge, the use of pose Mrs. Arbridge would like a part-time position in our lunch room.

00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:52.900
 [laughter]

00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:55.500
 - I beg your pardon? - It wouldn't be a great deal of course,

00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:59.000
 but she'd get her lunch free, and after all, that would help.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.200
 - Would you say that again very slowly, please?

00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:05.800
 - Father, you see the eye alone anyplace? - Henry, I'm talking on the telephone.

00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:09.000
 - What was that, Mr. Arbridge? - I'm sorry, but my son is just hurt.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.400
 - Oh, you're some fat too bad.

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:15.400
 My goodness, troubles never come soon, did you, they?

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:16.400
 What was that?

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:20.400
 Why don't I call when Mrs. Aldridge comes in from work and talk to her then?

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:22.400
 That would probably be best.

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:23.400
 Yes, goodbye.

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:24.400
 Goodbye.

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:25.400
 Did you realize you're out of bed?

00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:26.400
 Did you find the eye out on it?

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:27.400
 No, sir.

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:28.400
 Come into the bathroom with me.

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:29.400
 Why, just look, Father.

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:30.400
 Come with me.

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:33.400
 Who do you suppose that could be at the front door?

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:34.400
 I have no idea.

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:35.400
 Go, I'll go down.

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:36.400
 Hey, Henry.

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:37.400
 Is that you downstairs, Homer?

00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:38.400
 Yes, come on down.

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:40.400
 Again, she had a huff in the shot to bother.

00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:41.400
 I'm not a bargain!

00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:42.400
 I am a bargain!

00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:45.400
 No, wait a minute!

00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:58.400
 Boy, Toby, you don't know a darn thing about fixing tobogans.

00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:02.400
 I sure do, Homer. When you sand the bottom, you gotta hold a sander like this.

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:03.400
 Oh, wait a minute, fellas.

00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:06.400
 Look, if we're gonna make any noise, we shouldn't stay here in the living room.

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:08.400
 But Henry, we stopped hammering on the tobogans, didn't we?

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:11.000
 Well, should we, George, only I think my father can still hear us.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.400
 Why don't we go down on the basement?

00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:15.300
 Because Homer, I have to be here when my father calls for help.

00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:17.600
 Come on, George, why don't we finish the Santa? We're all through.

00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:18.600
 Okay, Toby.

00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:25.900
 Oh, she wins.

00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:28.400
 I'm sorry, father!

00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:35.700
 Now, keep it quiet, fellas.

00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:37.900
 Toss the football here, Toby.

00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:39.900
 Now to me Homer.

00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:42.900
 Nice catch George, back to me.

00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:44.900
 Here I am Toby.

00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:46.900
 Boy, what a pass.

00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:47.900
 Here you are Homer.

00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:49.900
 Wait, Henry, I'm trying my shoes.

00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:52.900
 Oh, she whizzed.

00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:57.900
 I'm sorry, Father.

00:20:57.900 --> 00:21:04.900
 Here's the rest of the string beans, Henry.

00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:05.900
 Chief, I'm sure.

00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:07.400
 Can we all throw here in the kitchen?

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:09.580
 Sure, Homer, the potatoes are peeled, the lettuce is washed,

00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:11.000
 and the string beans are strong.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.000
 Well, we put 'em.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.900
 Oh, yeah.

00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:16.500
 I told me, would you reach up in that cupboard and get that big pot?

00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:17.400
 Well, I'll get it, Hen.

00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:18.400
 No, you two sure are Homer.

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:19.100
 Let's hold it!

00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:24.100
 Oh, gee whiz.

00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:28.800
 We're sorry, Mr. Hollerish!

00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:31.600
 Father!

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:35.100
 Father, did you know you knocked some plaster out of the ceiling?

00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:38.900
 What's that? Goodbye, dear, all of it!

00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:54.500
 Hello there, Henry.

00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:56.380
 She wears Mr. Bradley.

00:21:56.380 --> 00:21:57.620
 Howdy, son.

00:21:57.620 --> 00:22:00.900
 How do you do, Mr. Johnson?

00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:05.660
 You don't suppose we could step upstairs and say hello to your father, could we?

00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:07.660
 Why? Why?

00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:08.660
 See, you sleep.

00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:10.660
 Henry!

00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:12.660
 No, I guess he isn't.

00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:13.660
 No, he is.

00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:15.660
 We go right up these stairs here.

00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:16.660
 Yes, sir. We're right up there.

00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:18.660
 Now don't you overdo, Henry.

00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:21.660
 You've got quite a load there these days and those shoulders of yours.

00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:22.660
 Aye.

00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:25.660
 Sam's place is certainly run down.

00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:27.660
 Did you see that broken window?

00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:30.660
 I know. And plaster all over the floor.

00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:32.660
 And now tell you the Sam Lord boy's home.

00:22:32.660 --> 00:22:34.660
 It's only us, Sam.

00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:37.060
 Oh, a committee from the luncheon club.

00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:38.500
 Whoa, a junction!

00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:40.660
 Hello, Bradley, how do you happen to come over?

00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:43.660
 Just thought we'd drop in and see how you are.

00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:47.660
 Well, I must have stepped on a plate here on the floor.

00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:49.660
 Didn't Henry pick that up?

00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:51.660
 Oh, that's all right, Sam.

00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:52.660
 Sleeping dogs lie, eh?

00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:53.660
 Well, sit down, sit down.

00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:55.660
 Oh, we can't stay but a minute, Sam.

00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:57.660
 Hey, don't step on that piece of code.

00:22:57.660 --> 00:23:00.660
 Yes, thanks for the warning.

00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:03.660
 You know, Sam, I can say it sincerely.

00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:05.660
 You never looked so well on your life.

00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:07.660
 - And I feel well, I feel fine.

00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:09.660
 - Oh, I was keeping up the old spirits.

00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:11.660
 - You're not worried, are you?

00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:12.660
 - Who I worried?

00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:15.660
 - You tried to round out the barbershop quartet for you.

00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:17.660
 - Well, I never felt better than the barbershop quartet.

00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:20.660
 - Sam, why didn't you let us know about all this?

00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:23.660
 - Well, I figured it was one of those things.

00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:25.660
 I'd better grin and bear it alone.

00:23:25.660 --> 00:23:26.660
 - It's not like them raffy.

00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:27.660
 The same old Sam.

00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:30.660
 Sam, they say it never rains, but it pours.

00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:31.660
 But remember this?

00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:33.960
 That always shines afterwards.

00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:35.360
 Yeah.

00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:39.360
 Well...

00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:42.360
 I suppose we'd better be going.

00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:45.360
 Yes, Bradley. We probably tired him as it is.

00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:47.760
 - You've tired me. - Goodbye, Sam.

00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:49.660
 Take care of yourself.

00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:51.760
 Well, I certainly appreciate your coming over.

00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:54.360
 - And don't worry, Sam. - I never worry. Goodbye.

00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:57.760
 There, Johnson is a man of courage.

00:23:57.760 --> 00:23:59.660
 He's still a young, Bradley.

00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:04.220
 Bigorous you can start all over say let's go back to this room for a minute

00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:07.000
 What for no reason why I can't throw a little business as way as there

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.860
 Sam oh did you leave something?

00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:15.020
 As soon as you get on your feet old man drop into my office. I'd like to have a little talk with you

00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:17.020
 Oh certainly I'd be glad to give you any help I can

00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:22.460
 Bradley

00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:28.100
 Well, Mrs. Allridge you're looking well and how is Sam feeling have a nice quiet day dear

00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:35.480
 Quiet isn't the word or you're not used to being alone Sam. How do you like my new coat? Oh you bought that coat today?

00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:42.320
 Yes, dear. I worked so hard. I had to do something to cheer myself up. Well, Mrs. All read you it's very good looking

00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:45.860
 Yes, it certainly is Alice. Where'd you get enough money to pay for it?

00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:51.100
 I charged it but looking for I brought you Sam to make up for it. What is it some travel folders?

00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:57.300
 I think it'd do you a world of good dear if you took a trip to South America South America South America South America

00:24:57.660 --> 00:25:04.660
 Yes, how could I possibly afford a trip to South America?

00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:05.660
 I go with you.

00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:06.660
 Oh, it's not like a brat.

00:25:06.660 --> 00:25:09.660
 No matter how things look, she's always the one to joke about it.

00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:10.660
 Hello, Father.

00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:12.660
 How do you do, Mr. Johnson?

00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:13.660
 Mr. Bratter.

00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:14.660
 How do you do, Mary?

00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:17.660
 Father, look at the lovely flowers that were sent to me at the hospital.

00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:18.660
 Do you?

00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:19.660
 Yes.

00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:23.660
 And it's the strangest thing all the cards said was to a brave little girl.

00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:26.660
 Probably Joe Graham sent them to use a joke.

00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:29.440
 Mary, are you home from the hospital for good?

00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:30.260
 For good?

00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:31.700
 How long were you there?

00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:33.700
 About three-quarters of an hour.

00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:36.340
 Well, isn't that fine?

00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:39.540
 Why don't we all sit down? I confess I'm a little tired.

00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:40.740
 Have a hard day, Alex.

00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:43.880
 I wouldn't work this hard for anyone but the Red Cross.

00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:46.280
 Mrs. Orrich, did you say the Red Cross?

00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:49.320
 Yes, with a war in Korea, it's the least anyone can do.

00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:52.420
 Yes, you've been working at the Red Cross.

00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:54.260
 He and I certainly have.

00:25:54.260 --> 00:25:56.060
 Yeah, yeah.

00:25:56.060 --> 00:25:58.460
 Well, isn't that pie?

00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:00.300
 Bradley, I think maybe we better be going.

00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:00.800
 Yeah.

00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:04.460
 Mother, did you order that big basket of groceries down in the kitchen?

00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:05.360
 What basket?

00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:07.900
 I'm sure the store must have sent them by mistake.

00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:12.700
 Mary, supposing you give us that basket and let us return it to the store for you.

00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:16.300
 Oh, would you mind Mr. Bradley? Somebody must have gotten things confused.

00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:18.340
 Yeah, somebody must have.

00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:19.540
 Well, goodbye Sam.

00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:20.060
 Goodbye.

00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:21.060
 Goodbye.

00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:21.560
 Goodbye.

00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:25.420
 Alice, I don't know what the make of all this.

00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:26.620
 Make a what's happened?

00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:29.140
 Mother, father, what do you think's just been delivered?

00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:29.740
 What?

00:26:29.740 --> 00:26:30.980
 A ton of coal.

00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:34.300
 And there's another poem with it.

00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:36.340
 I didn't order any coal.

00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:38.340
 It's from the Centerville Luncheon Club.

00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:40.900
 Sam, will you please tell me what's going on here?

00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:44.980
 Will someone please tell me why those two men acted as though I'm dying?

00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:45.740
 That's what I say.

00:26:45.740 --> 00:26:49.220
 This afternoon when I went into Mr. Bradley's office, you didn't even know you'd been sick.

00:26:49.220 --> 00:26:52.460
 Henry, when you went in there, what did you say to Mr. Bradley?

00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:54.500
 Nothing. I just told him I had appealed to potatoes.

00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:57.800
 Mother, Ms. Rumford just arrived to help us get dinner.

00:26:57.800 --> 00:26:59.600
 Get dinner? Our dinner?

00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:02.800
 Yes, she said father told her on the phone that Henry was hurt.

00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:05.500
 Sam, what did you say to Ms. Rumford?

00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:10.100
 Call us before this goes any further. Get me some aspirin and an ice bag.

00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:23.800
 In these days of world crisis, when our nation and its citizen needs spiritual strength and guidance,

00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:27.800
 All of us should think about what religion means to us and to our country.

00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:30.800
 More than anything else, it is religious faith

00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:34.800
 that makes our way of life possible and worthwhile.

00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:40.800
 During this month of November, people of many faiths are joining in a great religion in American life campaign.

00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:46.800
 Wherever you are, whatever your faith may be, you're asked to join in this campaign.

00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:50.800
 Take your problems to church this week. Millions lead them there.

00:27:50.800 --> 00:28:06.880
 Henry, you peeled the potatoes very well. Thank you, Mother. Now, who could that be?

00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:12.320
 Gagrocy father. You're tired, aren't you, Sam? That is an understatement. It's been

00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:17.280
 a hard day, Alice. All I want now is a little quiet. Well, you can go to bed right after

00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:22.160

00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:29.160
