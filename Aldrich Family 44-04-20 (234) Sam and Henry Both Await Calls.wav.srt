 Coming, Mother!

 Watch a teenage boy in action, and you can probably discover the source of his impulsive vitality.

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 Whatever he does is immensely important and all engrossing.

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 Henry Aldrich proves that.

00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 The scene opens at the Aldrich breakfast table.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 Thank you, Sam. I think I will.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 Mary.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 Thank you, Father.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 Henry.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 Henry.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 Why?

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 Oh, no, thanks, Father.

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 Well, Henry, I want you to at least eat your oatmeal.

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 Mother, I ate all the milk on it.

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 And you know how much nourishment there is milk, don't you?

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 Henry, did you get over-tired at the dance last night?

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 Who I, Mary? Tired?

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 Henry, if you're old enough to dance, you're old enough to eat oatmeal.

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 Now, don't let me hear your mother speak about it again.

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 Even when I don't have any appetite, Father.

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 Henry, didn't you hear your father or do you either eat or stop dancing?

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,080
 - You stop dancing? - Mary, I'm eating it.

27
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,400
 I want to know whether I have to go clear through the bottom.

28
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,800
 It seems to me, Henry, you have the wrong attitude.

29
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,840
 There are lots of people in this world who give anything for a dish about me.

30
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,680
 Mother, it isn't that I don't appreciate it.

31
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,320
 It's girls that I'm sick of.

32
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,720
 - Girls, dear? - Boy, never again.

33
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:39,160
 - Why should I want to furl away my life dancing? - What's that?

34
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:42,160
 - Why should I... - Boy, the way I look at it...

35
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:47,360
 - What are you holding your cup up in the air like that for? - I'm fascinated. Go on, Henry.

36
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,740
 Well, I just thought things over that salt.

37
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,940
 I don't feel I'm getting anywhere the way I'm going.

38
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:54,240
 You know what I mean? Being a darn butterfly?

39
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,740
 So, Mother, don't you think I could just forget my oatmeal?

40
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:58,140
 You certainly may not.

41
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,440
 By the way, Alice, is anyone phone for me this morning?

42
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,840
 No, Sam, not that I know of.

43
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,940
 No. Well, if any call does come for me, it'll probably be a Mr. Gilcrest.

44
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:05,540
 Who?

45
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:08,940
 Mr. Gilcrest. And please be sure to call me. I'll probably be up in the attic working.

46
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,240
 - How do you mean you're not going to the office today? - I am not.

47
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,940
 And that phone call is very important.

48
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:15,440
 - Is that clear, Alice? - Yes, Sam. Of course it's clear.

49
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,340
 - And, Mary, do you understand? - Yes, Father.

50
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:22,340
 And, Anne-Ray, Anne-Ray, what are you staring into your oatmeal for?

51
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:26,340
 Who I, Father? I wasn't staring, I was just watching the spoon sing.

52
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:29,340
 Hi, Anne-Ray. She was home. Are you here?

53
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,340
 We have to wait that bathroom news for you.

54
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:32,340
 Anne-Ray. I'm coming, Homer.

55
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,340
 Anne-Ray.

56
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:34,340
 Anne-Ray. Yes, Father?

57
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:36,340
 When Homer came in, I was asking you whether you understood.

58
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:39,340
 I heard you, Father. She, you can depend on me.

59
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:42,340
 Hey, Henry, who do you think I just saw? Who do you think I just had a talk with?

60
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:43,340
 Who?

61
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:44,780
 Agnes, and do you know what she said?

62
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:47,500
 She said that when Kathleen got home from the dance last night,

63
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,900
 she was so upset over the fight you and she had she couldn't sleep all night.

64
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,420
 She couldn't, Homer, she couldn't.

65
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:54,300
 And do you know what Agnes said she told her to do?

66
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:54,800
 Why?

67
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,540
 She said, Kathleen, or the telephone you want to apologize.

68
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:58,780
 Is that right, Homer?

69
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,440
 Kathleen's going to apologize to me?

70
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,140
 Sure.

71
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,260
 As a matter of fact, hasn't she called you, yes?

72
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:05,680
 No, but she probably will any minute, though.

73
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,500
 She's a-- you know, well, I mean, if she wasn't able to sleep last night,

74
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,940
 she's probably having a late breakfast.

75
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:11,980
 That's true.

76
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:13,260
 Are you gonna forgive her?

77
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:17,160
 Well, I'll certainly be fair. She was at the least I can do.

78
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,260
 Henry, could you and Homer please get out of my way?

79
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:21,960
 Mary, Homer and I happen to be very busy discussing something.

80
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,660
 Now please don't hang around and try to listen.

81
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:25,260
 Henry, all I want to do is use the phone.

82
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:28,260
 Use the phone? I'm sorry, but you can't use it right now, Mary.

83
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:29,860
 Why not? I'm using the phone.

84
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:32,760
 You're using it by Henry Aldrich. You're standing ten feet away from it.

85
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,360
 And all I want to do is phone Daisy Harper and say hello.

86
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:41,360
 Daisy Harper? She was. You've never gotten Daisy Harper on the poor near life of what you just hung there for a couple of hours at a stretch.

87
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,080
 Well, I know my right, Henry Older.

88
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,280
 Don't let her buy you, Henry. Don't let her buy you.

89
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,720
 Now, Mary, wait a minute.

90
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,480
 Oh, no, I won't let go of me.

91
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,120
 There, Mary. Now look at what you've done.

92
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,240
 - And we had to knock the table over you, dear. - Henry?

93
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,720
 Yes, Mother. - What was that?

94
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:59,960
 Why, I'll tell you, Mrs. Older, she was just explaining something to Mary.

95
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,480
 Well, see, Dad, you come in here and finish your boat, Beale.

96
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,680
 See that, Henry? See that?

97
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,480
 Mother, couldn't you save my oatmeal for me so I can have it for lunch?

98
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,160
 For lunch?

99
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,520
 Sure. Just slice and buy it for me.

100
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,020
 Oh boy, there's the phone.

101
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,720
 And now, Mary, will you please get out of this hall

102
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,920
 while I have my conversation?

103
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,320
 - I mean, I won't listen to you. - That is in the point, Mary.

104
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,020
 Do you want to make us feel uncomfortable?

105
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:20,120
 Well, all right.

106
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,120
 But don't expect me to do this before you all the time.

107
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,320
 - Hello? - Hello?

108
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,520
 Hello, is this Kathleen's father? I mean...

109
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,820
 May I speak with Mr. Aldridge, please?

110
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:31,020
 - Mr. Aldridge? - Yes, this is Mr. Gilchrist.

111
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,820
 I'm very anxious to get in touch with him.

112
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:35,120
 Oh, yes, it seems as though I remember him mentioning

113
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,520
 your name at breakfast or something.

114
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,520
 - I beg your pardon? - Just a minute, I'm calling.

115
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,920
 Father!

116
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,260
 Father!

117
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:43,260
 Mr. Aldrich!

118
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:45,300
 Listen, can we get rid of him fast?

119
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,040
 Maybe Kathleen is trying to get you.

120
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:47,840
 Hello?

121
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,140
 Hello? Is this Mr. Aldrich?

122
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:51,500
 No, sir, I just happened to remember Mr. Gilchrist.

123
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,440
 My father said you should call him at his office.

124
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,180
 I think.

125
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,640
 - Is that the office? - Sure.

126
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,340
 And I remember he said it was very important.

127
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,640
 And he must be on his way by now.

128
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,080
 - Can we hang up? - The only thing is...

129
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,340
 Well, maybe I can get him before my train leaves.

130
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:04,120
 Thank you very much.

131
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,380

 Hello, is Mr. Aldrich there?

136
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:17,380
 No, he isn't.

 Well, this is Mr. Brown.

138
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:21,380
 Do you know where the Mr. Aldrich has gotten in touch with Mr. Gilcrest yet?

139
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:25,380
 Well, Mr. Brown, Mr. Aldrich was expecting him to go over to his house for a conference, I believe.

140
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:26,380
 This morning?

141
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:28,380
 Yes, you see, Mr. Aldrich isn't coming into the office today.

142
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:29,380
 Oh.

143
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:32,380
 Well, I'll jump in the car and go right over to Mr. Aldrich's house.

144
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:34,380
 I want to get in on that conference if I can.

145
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:37,980
 I'm sure Mr. Aldrich will be very glad to get the two of you together.

 Hello. May I speak with Mr. Aldrich, please?

150
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:51,980
 Mr. Aldrich isn't in right now. May I take any message?

151
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,380
 Well, this is Mr. Gilchrist.

152
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:55,580
 About how long before you expect him in?

153
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:58,380
 Mr. Gilchrist, Mr. Aldrich isn't expecting to see you here.

154
00:05:58,380 --> 00:05:59,780
 He's waiting for you up at his house.

155
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:02,380
 Up at his house? I just honed his house.

156
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:04,000
 They said he was on his way down to the office.

157
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,380
 Really? He's decided to come down here?

158
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:07,540
 That's what they said.

159
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:09,940
 And I'm supposed to catch a train in 25 minutes.

160
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:12,880
 Well, Mr. Gilchrist, you better hurry up and come right down here then.

161
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,580
 You think I'll be able to see him?

162
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:17,680
 Oh, yes. It's a told you he's coming down here. He ought to be here any minute.

163
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,380
 Very well.

164
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:21,580
 And then, oh my goodness, I wonder if I can get hold of Mr. Brown.

165
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:32,080
 Oh, and what are you going to do to spend all Saturday here by this phone?

166
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,180
 Mrs. Aldrich, that's just exactly what I've been trying to tell him.

167
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:38,380
 Mother, I don't need any fresh air. I slept with my window open all night.

00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,980
 Well, get away from that phone, dear. I want to put in a call.

00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:43,180
 Now? Now, Justice Cackley?

170
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:46,380
 Mother, couldn't you please wait just a few more minutes?

00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,780
 Oh, you're waiting for a call?

172
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:48,580
 Yes, sure.

173
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:51,580
 Well, let me know just as soon as you're through, because I have to order the groceries.

174
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:53,280
 Yes, Mother, and thank you very much.

175
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,780
 Listen, Henry. I know you slept with your window open last night.

176
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:59,980
 But why don't you look at it this way? The sun shining.

177
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:02,580
 Alright Homer, alright, why don't you go out then?

178
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:03,380
 Alone?

179
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:04,980
 What is there I could do alone?

180
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:06,480
 Look, why don't you do this?

181
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,780
 Why don't you phone Kathleen and get it over with?

182
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:13,580
 Oh no, Homer, long ago it was her fault and she practically died and apologized to me.

183
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:14,080
 Henry!

184
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,680
 Mary, there's no use asking me.

185
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,080
 I'm not doing this phone yet.

186
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,780
 Henry, I'm not even asking you about the phone.

187
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:22,680
 I just wanted to tell you that Mother has a can of peas out in the kitchen she wants you to open for.

188
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,380
 Sure, I know, Mary, I know.

189
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:25,580
 Now run along.

190
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:28,680
 If you think you're gonna get me away from this phone with a can of peas, you're crazy.

191
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,940
 Henry, must I ask Mother to beg you in writing to open her canopy?

192
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:32,680
 A merry mail.

193
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,480
 I know, Homer.

194
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,220
 Mother, still remember the time you pulled the clock out of the vinegar bottle.

195
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:38,880
 Mary, I wasn't going to offer to open your darn can.

196
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,760
 I was just going to suggest if it's so important to get it open.

197
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,220
 Why don't you bring the can and the can opener in here?

198
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,820
 All right, just to show you, I will.

199
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:46,720
 I certainly will.

200
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,720
 And she reserves the phone.

201
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,720
 There's the phone.

202
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,420
 Hello?

203
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:50,520
 Hello, Kathleen.

204
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,860
 Henry, you're completely crazy.

205
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:52,920
 That's the front door.

206
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,360
 And Homer, can't you please answer it?

207
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,320
 Sure, Mary.

208
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:55,920
 Number three.

209
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,960
 And never mind off, right?

210
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,560
 My sister just asked home an answer.

211
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,460
 - I beg your pardon?

212
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:00,960
 - It isn't a phone, goodbye.

213
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,560
 - Oh, my, what are you doing over here?

214
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,660
 - Oh, hello, Father.

215
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,860
 I'm helping Henry wait for a phone call.

216
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:06,760
 - For Mr. Brown.

217
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,660
 - Good morning, Henry.

218
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:08,560
 Where's your father?

219
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,960
 - My father, are we out the office?

220
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,960
 - Down at the office.

221
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,760
 - Oh, no.

222
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,560
 - Yes, sir.

223
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,960
 He particularly mentioned at breakfast

224
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,160
 that he was going to the office.

225
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,760
 - Well, what did they tell me he was up here for?

226
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,460
 Look out, while I use your phone a minute.

227
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:21,060
 - You wanna use this phone, Mr. Brown?

228
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:21,560
 - I do.

229
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,160
 - The father, I'm sorry, but it's busy.

230
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,160
 - What do you mean it's busy?

231
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,420
 I've got to call Mr. Aldrich.

232
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:26,560
 What do you mean you're going to call me?

233
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,220
 Hello there Will.

234
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:28,220
 Bam!

235
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:29,960
 I thought you were down at the office.

236
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,000
 She was, Father, how'd you get back so soon?

237
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,460
 From where I've been up in the attic.

238
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:34,560
 With Mr. Gilchrist.

239
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,160
 But who?

240
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:37,200
 With Mr. Gilchrist, Father, did you find him all right?

241
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:37,760
 What do you mean?

242
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,300
 Did Mr. Gilchrist find me?

243
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,640
 Henry, where is Mr. Gilchrist?

244
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,140
 Well, I'm not sure, but I think he said he'd be very glad to wait for you,

245
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:45,040
 Don't you're all?

246
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,240
 That's a fine thing.

247
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,240
 Here, let me have that phone.

248
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,440
 Oh boy.

249
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,920
 Father, couldn't you please wait just a little while longer?

250
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,680
 Wait, wait.

251
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,280
 Henry, do you realize what you've done?

252
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,680
 - Do you realize it? - There she is, Henry. There she is.

253
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,680
 Homer, let me have that phone.

254
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,880
 I'm just handing it to you, Henry, here.

255
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,880
 Hello?

256
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,780
 Yes?

257
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,680
 - Henry, is that my office? - No, it isn't, Father.

258
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,580
 It's a sort of a girl.

259
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:06,280
 Well, come with me. Maybe my wife knows something about Gilchrist phoning.

260
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,480
 - I'm coming. - Hello?

261
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,880
 - How is? - Listen, baby, Barbara,

262
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,680
 this is no time to be calling our house.

263
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,680
 That's late, hang on.

264
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,480
 - Hi! - Hey!

265
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,780
 - I'm not in the kitchen, Sam.

266
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:15,480
 - Well, you were around when Gilchrist phoned?

267
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,880
 - Yeah, I don't know anything about it.

268
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,580
 - Sam, I've got my car outside. We'd better go right down the door.

269
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:20,380
 - That's true.

270
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:22,940
 Sam, there are two things I want you to do for me on the way down.

271
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:24,940
 First, take this list into the grocer and leave it.

272
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:25,620
 Now, Alice?

273
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:28,340
 All you have to do is leave it and run, and they'll fill the order.

274
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:30,620
 And then stop off with this note at the emergency aid.

275
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,540
 Alice, why can't you use the phone for all that?

276
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:35,620
 Now, Sam, I can't touch the phone. Henry's waiting for a call from Kathleen,

277
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:36,980
 and his heart is practically broken.

278
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:38,860
 And do you realize my day is practically ruined?

279
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:41,100
 And besides, I don't even go near the grocery store.

280
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,180
 All right, then, Mary can go to the grocery.

281
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:45,700
 But you can stop off with this list at the emergency aid.

282
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,500
 It's right in the block above your office.

283
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,460
 What are we giving them?

284
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:51,100
 some ging of aprons and a hundred pounds of potatoes we have down the

285
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:54,640
 basement and a few other things and i have to carry them no did just take

286
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,860

00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,720
 Here's the can opener and here's the can Henry.

294
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,320
 Thank you, Marie. Put it right down there.

295
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,720
 And if you ask me, Henry, all right, no girl in the world is important enough to tie up a whole family like this.

296
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,220
 Hello?

297
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:26,520
 Does Henry answer Henry?

298
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,520
 Hello.

299
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,720
 Hello, Ms. Aldridge's office.

300
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,220
 Oh boy, am I glad to get you. This is Henry Aldridge.

301
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:31,920
 Yes, Henry.

302
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:36,120
 Oh, look. My father says I made a terrible mistake and then I can only talk for a minute.

303
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:36,920
 What did you say?

304
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:40,920
 I've got a call coming. She and then if the line is busy all the time, she might get discouraged.

305
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,920
 And my father isn't down there. He's up here.

306
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,320
 Mr. Aldridge is up there at the house?

307
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,720
 Yes, he turned up in the attic.

308
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:49,000
 Well, I'm awfully glad you thought I'll send Mr. Gilcrest off right away.

309
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,160
 That's fine, because my father's pretty mad.

310
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:51,960
 Why?

311
00:10:51,960 --> 00:11:02,120
 But Kathleen, I've been expecting you to ask Henry.

312
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,640
 I can't help that, Milly.

313
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,280
 But we're gonna have such fun on the picnic.

314
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:09,200
 Why don't you go to the phone now and call Henry

315
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,640
 and ask him whether he wouldn't like to come along with us?

316
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,520
 Oh, no, Milly.

317
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,160
 If you'd like to ask him, you go ahead.

318
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,460
 But I'm certainly not going to be the one that calls in.

319
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:17,620
 All right.

320
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:18,420
 Hello?

321
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:19,220
 No, but please.

322
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,720
 M303.

323
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,220
 M303.

324
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:24,360
 Kathleen, tell me, couldn't I potentially?

325
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,260
 Have you and Henry had a falling house?

326
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:27,160
 That's falling out.

327
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,800
 My goodness, Nelly, whatever gave you an idea like that.

328
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,200
 I just said I wasn't going to be the one that phones in.

329
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,000
 Hello?

330
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:33,500
 Hello?

331
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,600
 Is that you, Henry?

332
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,140
 Yes, is that you, Kathleen?

333
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:37,300
 Kathleen?

334
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,140
 No.

335
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,440
 Did you want to speak to her?

336
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,240
 Why not?

337
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,940
 No, I mean, but it's--

338
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:42,980
 Who is this?

339
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:44,480
 This is Nellie Miller.

340
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,620
 Could you hold the line just a second?

341
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:48,520
 Kathleen, you're a secretary, say you're a no-nilly.

342
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,920
 Don't you dare tell me I'm here.

343
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,180
 Well, I'm gone now.

 Nellie, is there somebody there with you?

346

 Well, I... No, not exactly.

 And Henry, how would you like to go on a picnic with a few of us?

348
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,620
 A picnic? Today?

349
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:04,960
 Yes, we're gonna have a wonderful time.

350
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,260
 And all you'd have to furnish would be leather.

 Henry, look at all of my...

354
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:15,200
 Nothing, Nelly. I'm just trying to open a can of peace.

355
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,400
 - Yeah, what? - I certainly like to go with you,

356
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,200
 but I'm expecting a telephone call.

 It's very important, and...

 No, Nelly, I don't think I'd better go with you.

00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,000
 - Really? - And, and listen, I...

360
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,500
 I don't like the same room, but could you hang up in case...

361
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,200
 In case that call comes for me?

362
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,400
 All right, Henry, if you want to talk to me that way,

363
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,400
 I was just trying to be nice to you.

364

 - See, I didn't mean it that way. - Son of a apologize.

 I was only wasting your time. Goodbye.

 - But listen! - What do you say, Nelly?

367
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,600
 - You asked me to hang up. - Son of a ball, look.

 Abola, my goodness, I don't know what's gotten into Henry.

 Miss Thompson, do you have him yet?

370
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,200
 I'm trying to get him, Mr. Oldrich. The operator is ringing your house right this minute.

371
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,400
 Sam, after you get through talking to Henry, let me have a chance at home.

 Yes, hello. Is this you, Kathleen?

 Who? Isn't this Kathleen speaking?

377
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,600
 No, it isn't. But just a moment, there is someone that would like to speak to you.

 There is? Oh, boy.

 - Henry. - What's that?

380
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:20,800
 Henry, I want to ask you just one simple question. Where is Mr. Gilchrist?

381
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:25,000
 Well, I'm certainly glad you called, Father. He's right in the living room reading the National Geographic.

382
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,800
 - What happened to you? - What happened to me? What happened to me?

383
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,200
 Wait until you hear what's going to happen to you.

384
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:34,800
 - Henry, what's that noise? - That noise? I'm beating a rug for Mary.

385
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,000
 - What? - I've got a hanging on the bastard and I'm being very careful.

386
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,640
 You tell Mr. Gilchrist we're coming up there and he's to wait.

387
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:43,280
 Then you're to get away from there and stay away for the rest of the day.

388
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:46,280
 I'm to stay away from Mr. Gilchrist or the carpet.

389
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,280
 From the phone, of course, the phone.

390
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,980
 But suppose my call comes for me.

391
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:52,880
 Did you hear me? You're not even to touch that telephone until I say you may.

392
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,280
 Yes, Father, I understand.

393
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,720
 - Goodbye. - Goodbye.

394
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,220
 Sam, you didn't hang up, did you?

395
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:58,120
 Oh, I'm sorry, Wilk.

396
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,820
 Oh, that's all right. There wasn't anything more. I could tell Homer anyway.

397
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:03,320
 Just the same, Miss Thompson. Call our house again.

398
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:06,820
 - Right now. - Right now. Let's see whether Henry's still hanging around that phone.

 Henry, did not tell you not to touch that phone again.

 Mr. Odysh, he's not touching,

 Well, I'll take it up with a supervisor and explain the circumstance.

520
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:14,620
 And thank you very much. Goodbye.

521
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:16,420
 What'd he say, Henry? What'd she say?

522
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:19,420
 Look out, Homer. We gotta beat over your house before Kathleen's call gets there.

523
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:20,420
 Hi, Henry!

524
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:21,920
 Oh, she was at you, Nelly.

525
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,920
 We're getting some things for the picnic here,

526
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,020
 and you won't even have to furnish lettuce

527
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:27,820
 if you'd like to change your mind, Henry.

528
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:29,120
 Gee, any other time, Nelly, but--

529
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,920
 but right now, I'm in an awful hurry.

530
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,820
 Come on, Homer.

531
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:32,820
 Hello, Nelly.

532
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:33,720
 Hello, Homer.

533
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,520
 How are you?

534
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,020
 Homer, come on.

535
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:37,020
 Goodbye, Nelly.

536
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,020
 Goodbye.

537
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,020
 Oh, Nelly.

538
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:40,020
 What is it, Kathleen?

539
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:41,520
 Here's a nice, Nancy Cracker.

540
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,020
 Who's that that just went out the door?

541
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:43,820
 Henry Aldrin.

542
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:44,820
 Who's that, Henry?

543
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,820
 Yes, he was in such a hurry to go away.

544
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,020
 He'd hardly speak to him.

545
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:48,920
 Really?

546
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:49,420
 Oh.

547
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:53,260
 Well, you know, Nelly, on second thought I don't think I care anything about going on the picnic.

548
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:55,860
 - Why, Nelly? - No, I simply don't feel like it. What fun?

549
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:59,500
 I mean, Nelly, there's no use pleading with me. I've made up my mind.

550
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:02,660
 Excuse me, but was either of you girls using that phone booth there?

551
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:04,060
 - Uh? - No, sir.

552
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:06,980
 I wondered. I just found a can opener in it.

553
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:08,980
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

554
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:15,660
 Hello there, Mr. Brown.

555
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:16,860
 Boy, have I been running?

556
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,580
 Henry, is that you? Where's Homer?

557
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:19,780
 He's coming around.

558
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:21,380
 Boy, he couldn't keep up with me.

559
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:22,780
 But she was. Is that your telephone?

560
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:23,880
 I'm just in time.

561
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:24,880
 I guess that is the phone.

562
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,480
 Well, don't bother the answer. I know what it is.

563
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,680
 Henry, I'll take that call.

564
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,380
 But it's for me. It's for me.

565
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:31,280
 Hello? Hello?

566
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:34,380
 This is Mr. Gilchrist. I want to speak to Mr. Samuel Aldridge.

567
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:36,980
 Mr. Aldridge, he isn't here. You've got the wrong house.

568
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:38,380
 Oh, I beg your pardon. I'm sorry.

569
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,380
 That's all right.

570
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:40,480
 Henry, who was that?

571
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,480
 Nobody, Mr. Brown. Just Mr. Gilchrist.

572
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,780
 He wanted to speak to my father.

573
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:45,980
 See, your father, where is Gilchrist? Where is he?

574
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:47,280
 We've been looking all over for him.

575
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,200
 Oh, right. He didn't say it. He just turned off.

576
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,200
 And may I ask who gave you permission to come in here and answer our telephone?

577
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,760
 The telephone call me. I asked him to.

578
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,640
 Oh, you did, did you? And do you see that for a dog?

579
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,120
 - Yes, sir. - March.

580
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,440
 - You mean you want me to go? - March.

581
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,640
 Yes, Mr. Brown.

582
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,120
 Gee, Henry, can you run?

583
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,520
 Oh, I get out of here.

584
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,200
 - Pull me farther. - March!

585
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:16,960
 Ben, will you answer the phone, please?

586
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,160
 I'll answer, Alice. Hello?

587
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,760
 May I speak to Mr. Brown, please?

588
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,440
 Well, I'm sorry, but Mr. Brown isn't here.

589
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,600
 You must have the wrong number.

590
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,640
 I can't keep getting wrong numbers forever.

591
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,800
 Whose residence is this?

592
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,120
 This is Mr. Orich's residence.

593
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,760
 Well, this is Mr. Gilchrist, Mr. Orich.

594
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,960
 Oh, how is it when I call your house?

595
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:35,360
 I get Mr. Brown, and when I call Mr. Brown's house, I get you?

596
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,080
 Could you say that again, please?

597
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,560
 I'm down at the station, and I just wanted to tell you

598
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:42,280
 that in less than one minute, I'm stepping on board my train.

599
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,040
 You're leaving?

600
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,320
 Right now, goodbye.

601
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,360
 But Mr. Gilchrist, Mr. Gilchrist!

602
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,560
 - Sam, that wasn't a call for Henry, was it? - It was not.

603
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:51,520
 Alice, will you please try to tell me what has happened to this telephone system?

604
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:55,160
 Well, I've been wondering about that myself, because Henry is just terribly upset.

605
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,320
 Henry is, Henry is.

606
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,840
 I think you ought to call the company, dear, and complain to them

607
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:02,400
 that Henry's been sitting here by this phone most all morning, and nothing has happened.

608
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,880
 What do you mean nothing has happened?

609
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,280
 Now, Sam, this isn't anywhere for you than for Henry.

610
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:10,000
 Just remember the poor boys in the living room completely sunk.

611
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:10,800
 What's the matter with him?

612
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,000
 He's so depressed, Sam.

613
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,440
 He wouldn't eat his fried-out meal even if I warmed it over for him.

614
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,940
 Oh my goodness, there's the phone again.

615
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:18,340
 Mother, do I have the phone ring?

616
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:20,440
 You do, and if you want to answer it, you may.

617
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,140
 Well, thank you, Father. Thank you very much.

618
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:24,640
 As soon as you're through answering it, I want to have a talk with you.

619
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,440
 Yes, Father.

620
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,440
 Nothing?

621
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,440
 Hello?

622
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,440
 Hello?

623
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,440
 This isn't Kathleen, but listen.

624
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:34,140
 If I were you, I wouldn't come anywhere near my house.

625
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:34,940
 Why not?

626
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:37,740
 The telephone company was just there and they took out our phone.

627
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:39,240
 What did they do that for?

628
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,940
 What do you say you told them to?

629
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:41,940
 For me?

630
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:43,240
 Oh my, I give you my word.

631
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,240
 I'm coming from the Haven Drug Store.

632
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,200
 And you better keep away from my father.

633
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:47,880
 Goodbye.

634
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,480
 - But Homer! - Homer!

635
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,720
 Henry, where did your mother go?

636
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,680
 I don't know, Father.

637
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,840
 What do you think just happened?

638
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,480
 I know what just happened, Alice.

639
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,760
 What is it, Sam? What is it?

640
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,360
 Alice, they just delivered some groceries.

641
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,040
 And may I ask just what it was you ordered?

642
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,080
 Why, a lot of things.

643
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,800
 Did you order a hundred pounds of potatoes?

644
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:03,280
 No.

645
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,560
 Did you order any lentils?

646
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,600
 No, we've got all that down in the basement.

647
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,600
 It's what we're giving to the emergency aid.

648
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,520
 Well, the store just delivered them to you with a note

649
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:13,120
 pinned on the potatoes, saying they're all out of Gingham aprons.

650
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,200
 Sam Aldrich, how could they have done a thing like this?

651
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,700
 That's Henry know anything about that.

652
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,200
 Henry! Henry!

653
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,200
 He probably went upstairs.

654
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,200
 I'll answer it.

655
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,200
 Hello.

656
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,200
 Hello, Mrs. Aldrich. Is that you?

657
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,200
 Yes?

658
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,200
 Well, this is Kathleen Anderson.

659
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:29,200
 Oh, hello, Kathleen. I guess I know who you want to speak to.

660
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,200
 Oh, no, I'm calling you Mrs. Aldrich.

661
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,200
 Me, dear.

662
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:35,200
 Yes, my mother just looked over the list of things you promised to donate to the emergency age.

663
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,200
 But she wanted me to phone and thank her right away.

664
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,200
 Well, it wasn't that nice of her. I hope you'll need potatoes.

665
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:43,200
 Potatoes? You mean you're going to get potatoes, too?

666
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,960
 Hard potatoes and laddles on the list?

667
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,360
 No, I don't think so. I had your list right here.

668
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:52,440
 Two pounds of butter, one pound of cheese, two pounds of bacon, five lamb chops,

669
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,440
 dozen and a half of eggs, two cans of plain apples.

670
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,880
 Kathleen, where did you get that list?

671
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:00,160
 My Mr. Olridge left it at the emergency aid on his way to his office.

672
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:03,080
 He took that and s-- Well, isn't that nice?

673
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,240
 Yes, it certainly is.

674
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,040
 Yes, it is, isn't it?

675
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:09,160
 Kathleen, could you hold the phone just a second while I speak to Mr. Olridge?

676
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,800
 So you weren't asking about the potatoes?

677
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:14,040
 Yes, that's exactly what I want to ask him about. Just hold the line.

678
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:17,200
 Sam! Sam! Oldie, where are you?

679
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,200
 I think he went upstairs, Mother.

680
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,800
 She wins.

681
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:24,200
 Mother, did you know someone left the receiver off the telephone?

682
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,800
 Mother?

683
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,600
 Whoa, she wears.

684
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,600
 Flo?

685
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,400
 Flo?

686
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,400
 Whoa, she wears.

687
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,400
 Flo?

688
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,400
 Hello?

689
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,400
 Hello?

690
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,400
 Is that you, Henry?

691
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,400
 Listen, Kathleen.

692
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,400
 What, Henry?

693
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,400
