00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.340
 [Music]

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.000
 And now the Jell-O family presents...

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.740
 Henry... Henry O'Rish!

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:18.940
 Coming, Mother!

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:23.340
 [Applause]

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.420
 Yes, it's the Aldrich family based on characters originated by Clifford Goldsmith

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.900
 and starring Ezra Stone as Henry with Jackie Kelka's horror.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:37.240
 And yes, it's the Jell-O family with its three famous desserts.

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.880
 Jell-O in those six delicious flavors,

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.400
 Jell-O puddings with that old-fashioned homemade flavor,

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.520
 and Jell-O tapioca puddings,

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.720
 a miracle of goodness, a marvel of speed.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:55.120
 ♪ Everyone's a Jell-O good fellow ♪

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.680
 ♪ A very good Jell-O good fellow ♪

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.680
 So rich, so tempting, and mellow!

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.180
 J-E-L-L-O!

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.080
 And now for the Aldridge family.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:25.680
 All the happenings in a typical day of a teenage boy can never be diagram.

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.180
 There aren't enough zigzag lines for that.

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.180
 You simply start a day with a boy like Henry Aldrich,

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.180
 cross your fingers, and hope for the best.

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.680
 The scene opens in the school cafeteria.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.680
 It is noon, partner.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.180
 Why don't you like Charlie Clark, Henry?

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.680
 Well, I like him, Nancy. I like him.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.180
 But she was... I thought we were going to have lunch alone.

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.680
 Well, I didn't invite him.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.180
 He just happened to ask who I was eating with, and I said, "Just Henry,

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.360
 And my goodness, I couldn't be rude and tell me wasn't welcome.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:57.420
 I know, but...

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.060
 Gee, was he ruins my appetite.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.860
 Henry, you've already had three sandwiches.

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.900
 Sure, but I'm forcing myself.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.620
 Here you are, Nancy. Here's your milk.

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:07.940
 Oh, thank you, Charlie.

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.100
 Say, Hank, would you mind moving your chair a little?

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.860
 What for?

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.300
 Well, so I can slip mine in next to Nancy's.

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.940
 Now listen, Charlie Clark.

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.140
 But I just wanted her to take a bite of this sandwich.

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.780
 It's made from a can of Patty de Foygras, my Uncle Harris, Senes.

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:21.900
 Patty what?

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.300
 Foy gras, Foy gras, G-Wiz.

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.400
 French chopped liver, Henry.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.000
 Oh, Foy gras!

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.700
 Boy, Charlie, do you speak a broken French?

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.400
 Is that your Uncle Horace Clark who's in Congress?

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.800
 Sure, and the mayor of a French village gave him six cans of this stuff

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.900
 as a token of how his whole country felt toward my uncle.

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.700
 Jean Nancy, did you ever hear a story like that near a life story?

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.100
 Listen, Henry, have you ever heard of Lewis and Clark?

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.600
 Who?

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.160
 Lewis and Clark who practically discovered the rest of America.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.860
 Listen Charlie, you trying to make us believe that that Clark was your relative to?

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.460
 Figure it out for yourself Henry.

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:00.900
 Figure it out for yourself.

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:01.720
 Hey Henry!

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.280
 Oh gee whiz it's Willie.

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.940
 Henry you have to get me out of a spot.

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.260
 Willie, can't you see I'm having lunch with Nancy?

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.040
 But all you have to do is tell Mr. Bradley I'm the wrong one to speak in assembly.

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.520
 Willie, you're speaking in a family?

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.860
 Nancy, I'm just as shocked as you are.

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.320
 How did it happen?

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:19.420
 I volunteered.

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.420
 What? What?

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.020
 How did I know they only paid outside speakers?

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:25.820
 You expected to get paid?

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:30.220
 Sure, and if you ask me, they've got no right to discriminate just because I'm a minor.

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:36.220
 So Henry, wouldn't you be willing to point out to Mr. Bradley that every time I open my mouth, I make a fool of myself?

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.920
 What makes you think he doesn't know already?

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.820
 Well, I can't possibly talk to Mr. Bradley now.

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:46.320
 But Henry, if you really have to help, well, I don't mind finishing up with Charlie.

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:46.820
 What?

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:48.520
 Sure, run along.

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.220
 Oh no, how rude do you think I am?

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.020
 But Henry, I can't memorize!

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:54.520
 I'm sorry, Willie.

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.220
 Say isn't Cynthia Harris related to Mr. Bradley?

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:58.220
 I think so!

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:59.220
 Hey, Cynthia!

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.920
 Willie, I thought you hated the way she popped her gum.

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.720
 I do, but right now I'm desperate.

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.520
 Hi, Cynthia!

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.020
 My goodness, poor Willie!

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:12.520
 Speaking of memorizing, did I ever tell you about my uncle who had a photographic memory?

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:14.620
 Listen, Charlie, who are you kidding?

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:15.520
 Kidding?

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.320
 Henry, did you ever hear of Socrates?

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.520
 I suppose he was a Clark too.

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:22.920
 No, but my uncle memorized his complete works at one sitting.

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:25.020
 Ha! Gee Nancy, did you hear that?

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.320
 Can we, if Charlie said he did, the least we can do is believe it.

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.320
 That's okay, Nancy. He's just jealous.

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:34.880
 Jealous? Listen, Charlie, it might interest you to know that there were just as many famous

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.120
 aldridges in history as there were Clark.

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.720
 Oh, yeah?

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:38.720
 If not, famous-er.

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:39.720
 Name one.

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:40.720
 One?

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.320
 Well, that's okay. That's okay.

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:43.320
 They're there.

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:44.320
 You want a bet?

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:45.320
 Bet?

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.820
 Afraid?

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:46.820
 How much, Charlie?

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:47.660
 How much?

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:48.660
 $50.

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:49.320
 $50?

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:50.700
 You want to make it a million?

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:51.300
 OK.

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:52.020
 OK, why?

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:52.500
 A million.

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:53.580
 It's a deal, Che.

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:54.080
 Che.

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.580
 Che.

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:55.500
 You're a witness, Nancy.

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.980
 And I'll match my Uncle Horace against any old rich you

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:58.580
 can dig up.

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:59.860
 You're Uncle Horace.

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:01.380
 You're Uncle Horace.

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:02.660
 My Uncle Horace.

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:04.500
 Did you know he delivered one of the longest

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:05.860
 filibusters on record?

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:07.380
 My goodness, he did.

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:11.300
 Well, all I can say is it certainly runs in the family.

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.300
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:22.620
 Oh, this was Henry.

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:25.260
 Why, he went out right after dinner, Sam.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:26.260
 Yes.

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.900
 He said there was something in the library he wanted to look up before they closed.

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:31.060
 He went to the library?

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:32.060
 Yes, dear.

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:33.060
 Henry?

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:34.060
 Yes.

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:35.060
 My son.

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:36.060
 Yes, Sam.

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:40.420
 And incidentally, did I tell you I got a letter from your cousin Alan's boy Lionel?

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:41.420
 Really?

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:44.580
 Fine, and doing very well in his job.

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.580
 And he asked for some pictures of us.

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:47.860
 - Father!

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.740
 - My goodness, Henry's back from the library fair.

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:52.980
 - Probably getting used to it in small doses.

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:54.020
 (audience laughing)

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:55.020
 - And here, Henry.

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.180
 - Boy, father, boy, you'd think they'd certainly

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:59.220
 have a book that's more complete.

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:00.060
 - Who, dear?

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:00.900
 - The library mother.

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:02.620
 Of famous people, the book they had

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:04.620
 didn't mention a single Aldridge.

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:07.500
 - Dear, we Aldridge has lived very quietly.

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:10.740
 - Excuse me, Sam, I'm gonna drop a line to live.

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:12.740
 Henry, what's this about famous orchards?

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:13.900
 Well, he was.

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:16.780
 Charlie Clark's been bragging about his darn family.

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:19.420
 And father, I have to find a famous orchard,

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:21.100
 or I'll lose my bet.

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:23.220
 Henry, what have I told you about betting?

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:24.060
 He was.

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:25.340
 I couldn't admit in front of Nancy

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:28.620
 that our entire family was nondescript, could I?

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:31.180
 Henry, our family's hardly that.

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:33.180
 Did you tell Charlie about your uncle John?

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:34.380
 He did something?

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:36.620
 Your uncle John won the milking championship

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:37.860
 of the entire state.

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:38.700
 He did.

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:40.180
 Hands down.

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:45.180
 But, gee, Father, Charlie's Uncle Horace is in Congress.

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:50.240
 Weren't there any altages who were more outstanding?

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:51.920
 - Why, of course, there were many.

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:53.980
 - There were, oh boy, who, Father.

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:56.720
 - Well, there was, there was,

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:58.880
 - Yeah.

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:01.280
 - Henry, it isn't important who your ancestors were,

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:02.500
 it's who you are.

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:04.040
 - Well, that's just it.

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:05.180
 Who are we?

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:06.960
 (audience laughs)

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:07.800
 - Well, gee, there was,

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:10.040
 there wasn't one of us worth talking about.

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:12.400
 Let me tell you something, Henry. I don't know Nancy.

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:14.880
 For all I know, she may be a very nice girl.

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:17.920
 But if she's only interested in you because of your ancestors,

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:19.320
 then I've looked at her again.

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:20.680
 I have, Father.

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:21.480
 Legafarden.

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:24.680
 And she's one of the prettiest girls in the whole school.

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:26.160
 And Father, would you mind moving your feet

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:28.120
 so I could get at the encyclopedia?

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:28.960
 Hey, Henry!

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:31.920
 Boy, this is a fine time for Willie to show up.

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:34.880
 Henry, if he's back selling second-hand Christmas cards,

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:36.280
 I'm not interested.

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:37.080
 You know what, Henry?

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:39.600
 You know what, Cynthia Harris hasn't got a bit of influence

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:40.860
 with Mr. Bradley.

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:42.300
 - Willie, what's that on your tie?

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:43.940
 - Bubble gum, Mr. Rawlidge.

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:46.620
 I just stood too close to Cynthia when she popped.

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:47.660
 (audience laughing)

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:50.060
 So now I'm stuck with a charge of the light brigade.

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:51.380
 - The charge of a light brigade?

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:53.420
 - That's what I have to recite and assembly.

00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:54.940
 Here, Henry, hold the book while I see

00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:56.940
 how much of the first stands I've memorized.

00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:59.220
 - Willie, I can't, I'm going through Abba-to-Azo.

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:00.040
 - What?

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:03.300
 Abba-to-Azo, Abba-to-Azo, in the encyclopedia.

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:04.740
 - Willie, don't you think you'd be happy

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:06.500
 or if you memorized at home?

00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:07.340
 - I was doing that,

00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:11.340
 But my father decided the acoustics were better over here.

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:12.340
 You don't say it.

00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:13.940
 Mr. Roberts, would you hold the book?

00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:16.900
 Oh, Willie, I'd be willing to pay it for it, Mr. Alberts.

00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:19.180
 I don't need money that badly.

00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:22.300
 I don't just take a second here.

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:25.860
 The charge of the light brigade by Alfred Ward Tennyson.

00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:29.700
 Carefully, carefully, carefully onward.

00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:32.460
 How's that so far, Mr. Alberts?

00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:33.300
 It's perfect.

00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:34.460
 It is?

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:35.700
 What comes next?

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:37.500
 Boy, the Valley of--

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:39.740
 Oh, boy, Father, I found one.

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:43.100
 Cyrus, Aldridge, 1810 to 1875.

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:45.580
 A well-known general in the Civil War.

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:46.540
 In the Civil War?

00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:47.060
 Well.

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:49.140
 Oh, boy, excuse me.

00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:50.220
 Where are you going, Henry?

00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:51.460
 To phone somebody.

00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:52.780
 Oh, in the Valley of-- what did you

00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:53.860
 say was the role of this?

00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:55.260
 Dead.

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:56.220
 Number three.

00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:57.660
 Elm, 424.

00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:00.140
 Hey, Willie, could you bring that encyclopedia in here,

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:00.660
 please?

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:02.380
 But I'm tied up with your father.

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:04.380
 I can spare you.

00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:05.220
 Hello?

00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:06.980
 Hello Nancy, this is Henry.

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:09.100
 - Who? I can hardly hear you.

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:11.100
 - Henry, Henry, who ordered?

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:13.460
 - Oh, Henry, hold on a second while I see

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:15.300
 what I can do about all the noise.

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:17.060
 - Henry, here's your encyclopedia, thanks.

00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:19.300
 Well, what else does it say about Cyrus Aldrich?

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:24.300
 - Cyrus Aldrich, 1810 to 1875, a well-known general

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:27.420
 in the Civil War who gained notoriety

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:29.060
 at the Battle of Crookers Creek

00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:31.420
 when he fell off his horse and missed the ferry.

00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:32.260
 - What?

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:33.340
 (audience laughing)

00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:38.340
 From then on, he was laughingly referred to as the general who missed the boat.

00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:40.340
 [Laughter]

00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:42.340
 Henry, you really want to tell Nancy about that?

00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:43.340
 Hello.

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:44.340
 Why?

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:45.340
 Hello, Nancy.

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:46.340
 I'd better go back.

00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:48.340
 I left your father right in the middle of the valley of death.

00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:49.340
 I couldn't hear you.

00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:52.340
 Charlie was playing the piano so loud.

00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:53.340
 Charlie was playing?

00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:54.340
 Yes.

00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:55.340
 A lovely song.

00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:56.340
 His aunt wrote.

00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:58.340
 Why did you want to tell me, Henry?

00:09:58.340 --> 00:09:59.340
 Right.

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:00.340
 Well, Gee was, Nancy.

00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:02.340
 When you come right down to it, it's not a person's...

00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:05.740
 Well, it's not who a person's ancestors were.

00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:07.040
 It's who he is.

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:07.880
 - What?

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:09.980
 - Well, that is, I mean, well,

00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:12.220
 if you can take a person for a person,

00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:14.380
 we certainly ought to look at each other again.

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:16.020
 - Well, my goodness, Henry Orridge,

00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:18.020
 I didn't make any bets about who the Orridge is.

00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:18.860
 Where are you there?

00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:19.700
 - Sure.

00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:22.360
 - And I'm certainly sorry you consider me that show.

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:23.860
 - But, but Nancy.

00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:24.860
 - But Nancy.

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:26.940
 She was.

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:29.400
 - Henry dear, may I have that snapshot of you

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:30.300
 on your dresser?

00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:31.540
 - My snapshot?

00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:34.040
 My mother, that's the one with my dog, Smoothing.

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:36.240
 There, Smoothing ran away three years ago.

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:39.040
 Sure, but suppose he comes back.

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:43.540
 Well, how he feel he finds out I gave away my only picture of him.

00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:46.040
 Suppose I ask Lionel to send it back.

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:47.540
 Send it back?

00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:50.040
 Is this Lionel reliable?

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:53.040
 Henry, he's your own father's cousin's boy.

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:56.540
 Mother, I've somehow lost confidence in our whole family.

00:10:56.540 --> 00:11:01.540
 Well, I think you can trust a man who works for the Royal Canadian Mounted.

00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:04.540
 The Royal Canadian Mounted?

00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:05.540
 Yes, for you.

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:09.540
 Those guys and the red coats always bring back their man even if they die first.

00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:11.540
 And there's one in our family?

00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:12.540
 Yes.

00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:16.540
 Oh boy, will I get my hands on Charlie Clark?

00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:17.540
 What for?

00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:21.540
 What for mother? What for? Gee whiz, he owes me a million dollars.

00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:31.540
 [Music]

00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:32.540
 Agnes, wait!

00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:33.540
 Hi, Nancy, going in England.

00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:34.540
 Agnes, did you hear?

00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:35.540
 Did you hear?

00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:38.540
 Henry's cousin, Lion, Noah's coming to town.

00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:39.540
 Hey, yes.

00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:41.540
 The Aldrich has got a telegram that his vacation says

00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:43.540
 "We can be stopping by for a visit."

00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:44.540
 Oh, boy.

00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:45.540
 When's it coming?

00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:46.540
 Today!

00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:48.540
 Henry's meeting his train right after school.

00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:49.540
 Oh, boy.

00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:56.420
 I imagine having a guy in center bill who practically captured nearly six criminals dead or alive all by himself

00:11:56.420 --> 00:12:01.900
 He did I heard it from at least three different kids in school. Oh my goodness. Oh boy

00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:08.520
 I can't wait to see it hard. He's bringing it with him. They never go anywhere without their horses. Really?

00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:11.260
 They practically sleep together

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:18.400
 I wonder how my big sister always will feel about that. She's even baking your cake with red and blue icing

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:19.400
 What for?

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:23.400
 To go with Lionel's uniform when he comes to dinner at our house tomorrow night.

00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:24.400
 He's coming to dinner.

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:26.840
 My sister Eloise has been dying to meet him.

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:30.040
 She hasn't had a date with a man in uniform since the war.

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:31.400
 Invite me, Nancy.

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:32.400
 Invite me.

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:34.400
 Oh, I'd love to, Agnes.

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:38.720
 But frankly, if I invited all the kids who wanted to meet Lionel, I'd have to hire a

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:39.720
 banquet hall.

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:40.720
 Hey, Agnes.

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:41.720
 I have to go into class, Agnes.

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:46.160
 Nancy, are you sure you couldn't squeeze me in providing I bring my own phone?

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:47.160
 I'm sorry.

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:48.000
 - I'm sorry.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.040
 - Agnes, would you hold this book for me?

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:50.880
 - What for?

00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:52.120
 - Well, don't you realize the assemblies

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:53.120
 that they have to tomorrow?

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:55.960
 And I haven't memorized a single line except half-a-lee,

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:56.800
 half-a-lee?

00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:58.400
 - Well, you know what they say, kid.

00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:00.280
 Half-a-lee, better than none.

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:01.120
 (groans)

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:02.920
 - Oh, boy.

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:04.760
 - Agnes, this is no time for jokes.

00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:07.240
 - Look, Willie, you're a friend of Henry.

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:09.120
 Can you fix it for me to meet his cousin?

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:10.880
 - Agnes, I've got problems in my own.

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:12.560
 - Oh boy, if that tobe Smith down there,

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:14.120
 maybe he'll speak to Henry.

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:16.680
 Hey, Toby, wait for me!

00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:19.680
 Oh boy, yes Mr. Bradley.

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:21.180
 Were you calling someone?

00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:22.180
 What?

00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:23.180
 Yes sir, Toby Smith.

00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:25.180
 I see, and where is he?

00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:26.180
 At home?

00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:29.180
 You mean I was raising my voice.

00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:32.680
 Raising it is hardly an adequate description.

00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:34.680
 Please remember, this is the school.

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:37.680
 Yes sir, I'll try not to lose my head in the future.

00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:39.180
 No, who you do?

00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:40.180
 And I'll run along.

00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:43.180
 Yes sir, it's been nice talking with you Mr. Brad.

00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:44.680
 The pleasure is all mine.

00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:46.580
 Mr. Brad, could I have a word with you?

00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:47.660
 Certainly, Willie, what about?

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:49.700
 Well, I'm reciting an assembly, Friday.

00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:51.260
 See, you are?

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:52.100
 Yes, sir.

00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:53.000
 Reciting?

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:53.780
 Yes, sir.

00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:55.860
 Well, that's fine, Willie.

00:13:55.860 --> 00:14:00.300
 I'm sure it'll be an assembly we'll remember for a long time.

00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:01.660
 That's just it, Mr. Bradley.

00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:02.820
 I'd like to be excused.

00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:03.660
 Excused?

00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:04.820
 Well, isn't that what I don't want to,

00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:09.140
 but gee, was I have a head that nothing seems to stick into?

00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:10.820
 Yeah.

00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:13.300
 So couldn't we get someone else to take my place?

00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:13.980
 Who?

00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:14.940
 Why--

00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:15.440
 Why?

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:18.940
 You know, other student is prepared and we don't have the money for outside speakers.

00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:20.340
 Oh boy!

00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:21.040
 I beg your pardon?

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:23.640
 Oh boy, why didn't I think of him before?

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:26.740
 Mr. Bradley, I've got just the person to take my place.

00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:39.740
 Henry, dear, please stand back from the track.

00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:40.440
 Yes, mother.

00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:42.840
 Father, are you sure this is Lionel's train?

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:43.840
 I believe it is.

00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:46.180
 Be on the lookout for a man in a red jacket.

00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:47.500
 Sam, there's a red jacket.

00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:48.500
 Where? Where?

00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:50.200
 Down at the end of the platform.

00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:51.600
 Alice, that's a porter.

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:52.600
 Oh.

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:53.600
 Oh, man.

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:54.600
 Who's calling?

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:56.400
 My little fat man, the Derby.

00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:57.600
 Is he waving at us?

00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:59.500
 You can't be. I never saw him before in my life.

00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:01.200
 You're Mr. and Mrs. Oldridge, aren't you?

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:02.440
 Why, yes.

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:04.080
 I recognize you from your pictures.

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:04.880
 Hello.

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:06.680
 Cousin Sam? Cousin Alice?

00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:07.280
 I...

00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:08.480
 I'm Lionel.

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:09.480
 You?

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:10.280
 You?

00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:11.040
 You...

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:11.880
 Are?

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:12.720
 Yes.

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:16.160
 I guess this is Henry. I didn't recognize you without your dog.

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:21.120
 Well, it's very nice to have you with us, Lionel.

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:24.820
 Yes, yes. When did you leave them out?

00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:26.720
 Oh, I haven't left them. No.

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:28.520
 Whatever gave you the idea I had.

00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:30.420
 But where's your uniform?

00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:31.320
 Henry.

00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:33.520
 I'm sorry, Henry, but I don't have one.

00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:35.520
 They only come up to size 38 and...

00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:37.520
 Well, I'm a 44.

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:39.920
 Oh, boy.

00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:42.120
 Besides, nobody in our office wears one.

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:43.260
 - Office.

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:45.020
 - You working in office?

00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:49.220
 - Well, well, shall we be getting home, Sam?

00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:51.420
 I imagine Lionel would like to wash up.

00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:52.900
 - Yes, thanks I would, cousin Alice.

00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:55.060
 - Are the cars parked over this way, Lionel?

00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:56.380
 - Henry, aren't you coming?

00:15:56.380 --> 00:15:58.580
 - Mother, I have to phone Nancy Adams first.

00:15:58.580 --> 00:15:59.420
 - What for?

00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:01.140
 - Can I call off that dinner date?

00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:02.300
 - Henry Aldry.

00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:04.120
 - Mother, if Lionel's seen in public,

00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:06.740
 I'll be the laughingstock of the whole school.

00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:10.660
 - Henry, Henry, I must say you're not behaving at all well.

00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:12.580
 Henry, I got wonderful news for you.

00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:14.420
 - Well, out of my way, I have to make a phone call.

00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:15.940
 - But guess who I taught Mr. Bradley

00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:18.060
 in the letting take my place in the assembly tomorrow?

00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:18.900
 - Well, I don't have time to--

00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:19.880
 - But it's Lionel!

00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:21.380
 - I don't care who?

00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:22.780
 - Lionel!

00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:25.900
 Mr. Bradley said it was the best idea I've--

00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:27.340
 - Henry?

00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:29.460
 Henry, why are you staring at me like that?

00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:31.580
 Henry?

00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:32.900
 Mrs. Allridge, come back!

00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:34.940
 I think Henry's had him attack!

00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:37.700
 (dramatic music)

00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:49.700
 [Music]

00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:57.700
 And now while Henry is speechless, it's time for a few words from Meredith Wilson and his talking people.

00:16:57.700 --> 00:17:00.700
 Are we the intermission, Meredith?

00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:06.700
 The intermission? Well, yes, you might say so. We are the intermission and the high lariest adventures of the Aldrich family

00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:09.100
 family brought to you by the jello family

00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:13.300
 in the theaters during the mission of all you do you have the island

00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:13.700
 yet here

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:17.100
 programs

00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:19.500
 yeah that's right

00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:22.980
 we like to do a little young too about the jello family of dessert i don't

00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:23.700
 blame you

00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:25.780
 you never tasted anything better

00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:26.980
 there's tell

00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:29.780
 the world's most famous shimmering dessert yes

00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:31.700
 and there's yellow pudding

00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:32.700
 like that means

00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:33.700
 move

00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:34.700
 That's right.

00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:36.700
 And it's jello tapioca pudding.

00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:39.700
 Full of personality and dimples and three wonderful flavors.

00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:44.700
 Yellow vanilla tapioca, jello chocolate, tapioca, yellow orange, coke, golden, that's it.

00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:47.700
 They taste all downright delicious.

00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:51.700
 You'll hurry to order Murray just to learn to dance with tapioca polka.

00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:58.700
 Yellow chocolate tapioca, yellow chocolate tapioca, yellow orange.

00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:04.700
 That means orange, coconut jello, the melodepioca,

00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:09.700
 jello chocolate, the pepioca, jello orange.

00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:11.700
 That means orange, coconut.

00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:15.700
 And now the jello family returns you to the Aldrich family.

00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:29.140
 [Music]

00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:33.040
 Yes, getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldridge.

00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:36.880
 Henry's second cousin Lionel of the Royal Canadian Mounted

00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:39.760
 has turned out to be a severe disappointment.

00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:41.600
 And to make matters worse,

00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:46.600
 Willie has volunteered Lionel's service as a speaker at Central High School.

00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:51.100
 It is the day of assembly. The scene opens outside the school's main office.

00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:56.100
 Willie, you'll just have to go into Mr. Bradley's office here and volunteer to recite your poem again.

00:18:56.100 --> 00:19:02.100
 But Henry told you, "Lionel steps on that stage, well, I'll be the laughing stock of the entire school."

00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:03.600
 Henry, things aren't that bad.

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:08.600
 But you should see him, Willie. He's short, he's fat, and he doesn't have a uniform.

00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:12.600
 And he can't stay on a horse any better than General Cyrus Aldridge could.

00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:13.600
 Well sure.

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:16.600
 And to top everything, do you know what he had for breakfast this morning?

00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:17.600
 What?

00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:18.600
 Cream pups?

00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:19.600
 No kidding.

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:20.600
 Three of them.

00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:23.600
 Well, Henry, things aren't completely hopeless.

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:25.600
 Maybe the assembly will be canceled.

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:26.600
 Cancel?

00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:27.600
 Sure.

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:29.600
 Remember the one that got called off last month?

00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:30.600
 What about it?

00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:33.600
 Wasn't it because the bell somehow didn't ring?

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:36.600
 Well, well...

00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:39.000
 - Well, earlier, you suggest-- - Well, naturally not,

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.280
 but you happen to be in the janitor's room,

00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:43.760
 and somehow your elbow happened to hit the switch

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:44.720
 that worked the bells,

00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:47.360
 and they didn't happen to ring for assembly when--

00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:48.920
 - Will he for the last time,

00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:52.000
 will you recite the charge of the light brigade?

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.280
 - You wanna definite answer?

00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:55.120
 - Yes, no.

00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:55.960
 (audience laughing)

00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:57.920
 - Once I get past the valley at death, where am I?

00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:00.040
 - Okay, okay.

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:03.200
 If that's your attitude, I'll volunteer myself

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:04.280
 in place of Lionel.

00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:05.480
 You to do what?

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:06.680
 Play my cello.

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:07.880
 Harry, you can.

00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:08.480
 Why not?

00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:09.880
 You're terrible.

00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:11.960
 Willie, I played it once before an assembly,

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:13.520
 and nothing happened.

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:15.800
 Step aside.

00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:16.400
 Oh, then.

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:19.320
 Well, good luck, Ken, old time.

00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:20.280
 Oh, it's you, Henry.

00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:20.920
 Come here.

00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:22.120
 Yes, sir.

00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:24.480
 Henry, I've never seen Mr. Dutenbody so excited

00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:25.880
 about any assembly before.

00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:26.720
 Well, about that.

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:29.280
 Are we your cousin, D, in his uniform?

00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:30.320
 No, sir.

00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:31.800
 He's a 44.

00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:33.400
 What?

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:34.660
 He doesn't have one.

00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:36.640
 - But it really doesn't matter.

00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:37.920
 How would he like me to introduce him?

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:41.240
 - Well, Mr. Bradley, about that, he's gonna be nervous.

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:44.640
 He is a member of my own family, you might say.

00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:45.640
 - Yeah.

00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:48.560
 - Well, how would you feel if I...

00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:54.000
 Mr. Bradley, wouldn't you care to sit down

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.960
 before I suggest this?

00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:58.040
 - Henry, it isn't necessary to explain.

00:20:58.040 --> 00:20:58.880
 - It isn't?

00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:00.640
 - No, if you think your cousin Lionel would feel more

00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:02.240
 comfortable if you were to introduce him.

00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:03.080
 - Introduce him.

00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:04.420
 Naturally I would mind.

00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:04.920
 Why?

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:07.080
 Just be up on the stage before assembly begins

00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:08.880
 and we'll make the necessary arrangements.

00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:09.880
 But you see, I...

00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:11.920
 You know, Henry, for a moment I was afraid

00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:13.560
 you were going to suggest that I allow you

00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:15.120
 to play your cello again.

00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:17.700
 (upbeat music)

00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:35.180
 [APPLAUSE]

00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:36.980
 Thank you.

00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:39.580
 Thank you very much.

00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:43.620
 That was our own orchestra playing William Tell,

00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:45.940
 a number which Miss Wheeler tells me they've

00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:48.460
 been working on for some time.

00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:53.020
 I'm sure we all found their performance quite spirited,

00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:55.180
 especially in the brass section.

00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:57.220
 [LAUGHTER]

00:21:57.220 --> 00:22:04.180
 Now, in connection with the assembly bell ringing 15 minutes earlier today,

00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:06.780
 I regret to say it was no accident.

00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:12.420
 I just learned that two boys were seen running from the janitor's room immediately after it happened.

00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:18.540
 And when we discover who they are, I can assure you they will be severely punished.

00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:26.440
 Oh, I see our principal speaker hasn't arrived yet, so I'm sure we'll all enjoy hearing

00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:29.400
 months again from the orchestra Miss Wheeler.

00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:33.400
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:43.400
 Boy, Willie, boy, you and your idea.

00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:44.080
 Me?

00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:46.840
 Was it my fault that the bells went on instead of off

00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:48.360
 when you pulled the lever down?

00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:49.720
 Why, Willie.

00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:52.280
 Step out here in the hall.

00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:54.280
 Henry!

00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:55.520
 Oh boy, it's Nancy.

00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:57.860
 I've been looking all over for you, Henry.

00:22:57.860 --> 00:22:59.560
 Do you know who's sitting in the background?

00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:00.400
 - We wish I was.

00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:02.560
 - My sister, Ella, we just couldn't wait

00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:04.280
 to see what Lionel looks like.

00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:05.120
 - Oh boy.

00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:06.480
 - And you know what, she bought an honor

00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:07.800
 of this coming to dinner tomorrow?

00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:10.200
 A pair of shoes with sex and cheer.

00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:13.040
 - Nancy, do you think she ought to get her hopes up that high?

00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:14.880
 (audience laughing)

00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:16.040
 - Oh boy.

00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:17.040
 - Who's that?

00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:18.160
 - I'm sorry I'm late.

00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:19.680
 I was all over town looking for some things

00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:21.040
 I need for my talk.

00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:24.360
 (upbeat music)

00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:26.440
 Henry, have you heard from him yet?

00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:28.800
 Why, yes, Mr. Bradley.

00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:30.640
 I've heard from him.

00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:34.040
 Mr. Bradley, this is my cousin Lionel.

00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:35.040
 (audience laughs)

00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:35.880
 What?

00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:37.320
 What?

00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:39.840
 Of the Royal Canadian Mountain.

00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:41.880
 Oh my goodness.

00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:43.120
 How do you do, sir?

00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:47.160
 Well, welcome to Central High.

00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:51.440
 Henry, suppose you go out and introduce Henry.

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:53.520
 Well, whether you're suppose he disappeared too.

00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:56.100
 (upbeat music)

00:23:56.100 --> 00:24:06.520
 - Patrick, is that you?

00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:08.960
 - Yes, Father, it's I or I.

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:10.760
 - Well, how did the assembly go?

00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:12.240
 - How did it go?

00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:13.520
 It went, Father.

00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:14.880
 (audience laughs)

00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:17.280
 As a matter of fact, I didn't even stay.

00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:18.120
 - Oh.

00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:21.600
 - And Father, Father, can I ask a big favor of you?

00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:22.440
 - Favorite?

00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:27.680
 I do. I want you to keep in mind that I intend to go to work and pay part of my tuition.

00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:28.680
 What tuition?

00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:30.640
 To Abbott City High.

00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:34.040
 Abbott City? What's wrong with Central High?

00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:37.640
 It's the kids, Father. I don't know.

00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:42.440
 Well, then, Gee, was it isn't who you are? It's who your ancestors were.

00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:43.640
 So you want to change?

00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:46.840
 Yes, I think it'd be better all the way around.

00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:51.640
 And, Ray. And don't you think you ought to be a little ashamed of yourself?

00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:52.640
 I followed.

00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:57.240
 You are feeling sorry for yourself because Lionel isn't something you pretended that

00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:58.240
 he was.

00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:02.880
 But tell me the truth Henry, have you ever met a nicer person than Lionel?

00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:03.880
 Why, no.

00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:04.880
 Of course you haven't.

00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:09.720
 He's just pleasant, well-mannered, and charming a person if you'd ever want to meet.

00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:13.320
 You should have every reason to be proud of him instead of feeling that you were betrayed.

00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:14.320
 Gee, Father.

00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:16.920
 Gee, I didn't look at it that way.

00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:18.520
 I didn't think you did.

00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:20.520
 Oh, please answer the phone, Henry.

00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:23.520
 And you know what about Abbott City High?

00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:24.520
 What?

00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:26.520
 I'm sorry I mentioned it.

00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:27.520
 Hello?

00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:29.520
 Hello Henry, this is Nancy.

00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:30.520
 Oh.

00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:33.520
 Before you start Nancy, let me tell you one thing.

00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:36.520
 If you're expecting an apology, you're wasting your time.

00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:38.520
 An apology for what?

00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:39.520
 You're right.

00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:42.520
 Boy, I've never met a more pleasant, a more...

00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:45.520
 She was who cares if he can't stay on a horse anyway.

00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:47.520
 Henry, I agree with you.

00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:48.520
 What?

00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:51.880
 I think Lionel is divine and so is my sister Eloise.

00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:53.080
 Whoa, Gee whiz.

00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:55.080
 She's even going down to buy a pair of flat heels.

00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:57.080
 That's how divine she thinks he is.

00:25:57.080 --> 00:25:58.080
 [LAUGHTER]

00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:01.000
 And you should have heard the hand the kids gave Lionel.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:01.960
 They gave him a hand?

00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:02.460
 Yes.

00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:05.080
 And Mr. Bradley said it was the most interesting assembly

00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:06.360
 talk he ever heard.

00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:08.200
 Nancy, what did Lionel talk about?

00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:10.280
 His work with the Rock and Hadeon Mountains

00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:12.760
 in the scientific crime detection bureau.

00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:13.260
 What?

00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:14.160
 Yes.

00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:16.680
 He showed us how he always gets his man without even

00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:17.840
 leaving his desk.

00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:19.840
 Will I be John?

00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:22.840
 And Charlie Clark certainly lost that bet.

00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:23.840
 Hey, hey, hey, hey.

00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:25.840
 Excuse me, Nancy. Will he just walked in?

00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:28.840
 All right. Don't forget dinner tomorrow night.

00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:30.840
 Yeah, I won't.

00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:34.840
 We're having saddle of lamb and Lionel's honor.

00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:36.840
 Goodbye.

00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:37.840
 Goodbye, Nancy.

00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:39.840
 Will he? I'm in here.

00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:42.840
 Boy, Henry, boy. Darn that Lionel anyhow.

00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:45.840
 Oh, you haven't heard. Lionel was a big success in assembly.

00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:50.660
 I know he was I know he was I was there you were sure and he was such a big success

00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:54.380
 You know what he offered to do what come back tomorrow and give a practical demonstration

00:26:54.380 --> 00:27:00.660
 He's gonna track down a criminal by scientific method. No kidding boy. I sure like to see that

00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:07.860
 That's what you think you know who he's tracking now. No, the two guys who rang the assembly back

00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:11.700
 You certainly have one fine family

 Hi, Henry.

00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:27.700

00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:29.200
 Henry, guess what?

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:31.300
 Your cousin line will come over to my house

00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:31.800
 Sunday night.

00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:32.800
 Bye.

00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:34.980
 For Agnes, what about our date for the B's you?

00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:36.900
 And next to well western, where the hero

00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:39.200
 chases the robbers over an entire mountain?

00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:41.300
 Set tires to most stuff.

00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:46.580
 From now on I'd like to see him copy easy way, like cousin Lionel does a sitting in a chair.

00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:48.100
 Bye!

00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:53.140
 Well ladies, you'll always catch him the easy way when you serve your family jello for dessert.

00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:56.600
 Yes, jello and any one of those six delicious flavors.

00:27:56.600 --> 00:28:00.100
 Strawberry, raspberry, cherry, orange, lemon or lime.

00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:04.100
 Every jello flavor is rich with that famous locked in goodness.

00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:10.300
 Flavor sealed right in by a special process, so it can't get out till your first delectable spoonful.

00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:14.500
 And that's why Jell-O is America's favorite gelatin dessert.

00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:16.980
 Look for those big red letters on the box.

00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:20.740
 They spell Jell-O and Jell-O spells a treat.
