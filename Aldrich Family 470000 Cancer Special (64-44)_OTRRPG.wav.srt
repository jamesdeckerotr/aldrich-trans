1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 Henry, Henry, all of it.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 Come in, mother, the old rich family.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 [applause]

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 Laurie and Ezra Tholg with Jackie Count,

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 Half of them up,

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 Ollie Davidson,

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 Mary Walt, and Norman Folta.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 [applause]

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 We all know that the authors made up of four walls

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,440
 and a roof, but add a family and you have a hook. Add a teenage boy like Henry

11
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:42,000
 Albridge and you have Bevelow, the scene opens and the Albridge living room. Mary, Mary, did you find your shoe?

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 Yes, Mother. I'm already, except for my makeup. Dear, I want you to help me look for my long hat pin.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 This hat just won't stay on without it. Henry? Yes, Mother. Have you seen my long hat pin? Your long hat, Mother?

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,900
 No, the one that looks like a barber pole Henry. He doesn't want the hat. She wants the pin

15
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:06,080
 I have a safety pin inside me mother. What the only thing is it's holding my trousers up and

16
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,340
 Mother don't you think a dollar is too much too much so far?

17
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:16,020
 Well, when they look at you we're all ready to leave and you haven't even combed your hair. I combed it

18
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:19,420
 I give you my word. I combed it. It's really Marshall mother

19
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:24,420
 He's trying to get a dollar out of me for my own radio that was fine until he fixed it

20
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:29,420
 Only he didn't fix it, see, and now all the lights in the house keep going out. Don't you agree, mother?

21
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:30,420
 Yes, dear.

22
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:33,420
 Mary, help me look behind the sofa cushion for my hat, Penny.

23
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,420
 Yes, mother. Only do you really have to have it.

24
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:39,420
 Now, Mary, I just won't feel safe without it.

25
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:43,420
 And I certainly can't go out to a place like this with my hat on my mind.

26
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:47,420
 Mother, how much do you think father would charge me to sue Willie Marshall?

27
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:48,420
 Henry!

28
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,420
 Lily, I've warned you for the last time!

29
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:54,420
 I'm giving you one last hand, so you pay me that dollar or aren't.

30
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:57,420
 Now listen, Lily, where do you think you're going with that radio?

31
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,420
 I'm freezing it.

32
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:01,420
 Lily, that radio belongs to Henry!

33
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:04,420
 I'm not my radio repair business for my health, Mary.

34
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:07,420
 Henry owes me a dollar and I can't afford to have friendship in the fear.

35
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:08,420
 I'm a business man.

36
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:09,420
 You're a crook.

37
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:10,420
 No.

38
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:12,420
 Now, Henry, I'm sure you're mistaken.

39
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:16,420
 Mother, do you realize that now, every time I turn on my radio or anything,

40
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:22,000
 my radio all the lights in my room go out they do not they do so and unless you

41
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,200
 tune in on a mystery program what good is that wait a minute what is that sticking

42
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:33,160
 up on top of the radio that's my area that's my hat pin well my goodness mother

43
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:38,120
 I'm gonna go put on my thing she was mother are you taking it out yes I am

44
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:42,440
 do realize we have to leave here in ten minutes and I almost had to go without a

45
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,140
 Hey Henry!

46
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,640
 Homer, where's your bin?

47
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,640
 I told you not to wet Willie near my radio.

48
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,740
 Okay Henry, I signed your baseball back.

49
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,640
 Now we can stick up so you're right.

50
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,640
 Oh yeah?

51
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,540
 Now listen, Willie, you see this baseball back?

52
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:58,240
 Yeah, and you see this radio?

53
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:58,940
 No, it was wait.

54
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:00,440
 Now just a minute.

55
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:05,140
 Homer and Willie, I'm sorry, but Henry is going out with us in just a few minutes.

56
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:06,440
 I know Mrs. Holdre.

57
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,040
 I'm coming too.

58
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,040
 What's that?

59
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,540
 Henry, didn't you say your mother invited me?

60
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:15,540
 I said she would, Homer, after I'd worked on her for a while.

61
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:18,540
 Oh, I'm coming, Sam.

62
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:22,540
 And, Henry, after I see what your father wants, I'd like to speak to you.

63
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:24,540
 But, Mother, Homer won't be any trouble.

64
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,540
 I mean, I can go with you.

65
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,540
 Sam, where are you?

66
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,540
 I'm in the kitchen, shining my shoes.

67
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:30,540
 Oh, my goodness.

68
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:35,540
 The times when I wish Henry was five years younger, so I could turn him over my knees.

69
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:36,540
 I can see your point, Alice.

70
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:40,540
 But do you think it would be worth going through the last five years again?

71
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:44,540
 Well, no, but do you know what he's done?

72
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:46,540
 He's invited Homer to come with us.

73
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:47,540
 Yes.

74
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:53,540
 Isn't that Homer doesn't have his good point, dear, but I'm always afraid somebody's going to think he's ours.

75
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:57,540
 Why isn't Homer going with his own parents?

76
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:00,540
 Well, didn't you know Sam? They aren't going.

77
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:01,540
 But, sir.

78
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:02,540
 Well, Elizabeth is...

79
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:08,540
 Well, I don't suppose he's afraid exactly, but just the word "cancer" makes her nervous.

80
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:12,540
 Well, she thought she had it, I suppose she'd do something.

81
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:16,540
 But she thinks it's silly to make the whole family down to Dr. Bennington for an examination

82
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:18,540
 and just get some frighten.

83
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:22,540
 And just how do the lidsable think people are going to know if they don't have an examination?

84
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:27,540
 Well, she keeps saying she's never had a sick day in her life and she feels perfectly fine.

85
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:32,540
 Look, Calit, get her on the phone and explain to her that we all feel sure we haven't got cancer.

86
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:37,540
 But the reason we're going to Dr. Bennington for an examination is that she's not going to be able to get her.

87
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:42,500
 an examination is purely for reassurance well alright and also not

88
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,540
 i will pick it up in ten minutes

89
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:45,860
 one of the following

90
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,700
 i don't think so

91
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:52,260
 father did you leave a dollar bill on the dining room table yes henry it for

92
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,820
 the paperboard well

93
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:57,260
 did you know willy march it was standing right over it

94
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,940
 looking at it what's that

95
00:04:58,940 --> 00:04:59,740
 or will it

96
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:02,100
 what are you and what are we going to do

97
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:06,220
 do you think he means a jury means at home or if will he says he's going to

98
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:11,220
 stick right with me until I pay him a dollar boy who will be going to bed with me tonight.

99
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:16,220
 And if he comes down in the doctors with us, think her embarrassing is going to be for

100
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:19,220
 your parents. Somebody may think he belongs to them.

101
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:24,220
 Oh, wait a minute. You see that broom closet right behind you?

102
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:28,220
 Yeah. Henry, are you thinking the same thing I'm thinking?

103
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:34,220
 I think so. Because if you are, I think Lily would just fit in there perfectly.

104
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:38,220
 Oh, willy! Oh, willy!

105
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:40,220
 Yeah? Well, Henry, are you ready to fix things up?

106
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:43,220
 Sure, Willy. You're gonna get fixed up.

107
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:47,220
 Well, that's well. I hate to do this to you, and I'm gonna...

108
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:50,220
 I'm a few like this, you gotta close it when you get the chance.

109
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,220
 You hear that, Homer? Good luck!

110
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:56,220
 Henry, wait! If you wanna get some money, Henry, you'll find it on your dining room table.

111
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,220
 Mother!

112
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:59,220
 Where in the front hole, Henry?

113
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,220
 What up? Is everybody ready?

114
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:01,220
 I am, Thomas!

115
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:02,220
 Oh, my.

116
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:04,820
 Hurry then because we have to pick up Elizabeth Brown.

117
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:07,420
 Well, if everybody ready or we leave them now, will we?

118
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:08,860
 Are you coming?

119
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:10,860
 Sure, did not I make myself queer, Henry?

120
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:13,020
 Well, did you see, where's Homer?

121
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:16,820
 Um, Homer decided he wouldn't be going any place for a while.

122
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,420
 Thanks, Harney.

123
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,420
 Well, then what are we waiting for?

124
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,420
 Let's go!

125
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:30,220
 [Music]

126
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:34,540
 Henry please come on it isn't going to do any good to just sit here in the

127
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:37,180
 waiting room come on Henry father's right

128
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:42,460
 you better come home with us but don't you own their stance I have to find out

129
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:46,380
 what's the matter with Willie there's probably nothing wrong with him dear

130
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:52,300
 but mother didn't you hear the nurse she said dr. Bennington sent my power

131
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:57,840
 willy over to a specialist gee now Henry I don't think for one minute that

132
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:02,080
 Willie has cancer, but if he has it's a good thing they found out about it.

133
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,120
 Father, can I just wait here until I hear something?

134
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,280
 But Henry, we should be getting home.

135
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,160
 Boy, here we are.

136
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:16,160
 Dr. Bennington says we're all fine and we can go home and there's Willie someplace.

137
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,160
 Where is he?

138
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,160
 Where is he?

139
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,160
 Homer!

140
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,160
 Where is Willie?

141
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,400
 I just broke out of that broom closet and boy!

142
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,960
 Homer, is that my broom you're waving around?

143
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,960
 Yes, Mrs. Ulrich, and little I find that willy.

144
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,960
 Homer, you know what's happened to our pal?

145
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,960
 Who? Willy.

146
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,960
 Boy, son pal.

147
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:34,960
 Come on, where is he?

148
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,960
 He isn't here, Homer.

149
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,960
 Dr. Bennington examined him and he sent him to another doctor.

150
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,960
 A specialist.

151
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,960
 You mean, he said?

152
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,960
 Our pal, Willy?

153
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:52,960
 Hey boy, I'm going to sit right here until I find out how he is.

154
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:58,960
 Mrs. Olrich, would you like to carry your broom home and remove over her?

155
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:09,960
 Alice! Yes, Sam! Where are you?

156
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,960
 In the living room, and Alice, I'd like you to take a look at something.

157
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,960
 Of course. What is it?

158
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,960
 That corner over there. Do you see anything in it?

159
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,960
 No, dear, nothing.

160
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:19,960
 Neither do I.

161
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,960
 Isn't that where we usually keep our radio?

162
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,960
 My goodness, it's gone!

163
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,960
 Mary, have you seen our radio?

164
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,960
 Did you say the kitchen radio was in here, Father?

165
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:29,960
 No, I didn't.

166
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:30,960
 Oh, it isn't in the kitchen.

167
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,960
 You mean it's gone too?

168
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,960
 San Sonopolis, they've been sued!

169
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:46,960
 Easy, Homer, just back up a few more steps.

170
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,460
 No, push me off the sidewalk.

171
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:51,960
 Boy, is this radio heavy.

172
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,460
 Okay Homer, lower it into the wagon.

173
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:55,460
 Easy now.

174
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:57,460
 Can it, can I let go?

175
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:58,460
 Yes, there.

176
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:03,960
 Okay, Homer, you wouldn't like to go back in your house would you and look around some

177
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,960
 more Henry?

178
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:08,960
 For the millions turn, this living room radio is the only one we've got.

179
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:12,460
 Unless Homer, does your father have a radio in his car?

180
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:16,460
 Oh no, I'm not gonna let Willie touch that one.

181
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:18,460
 Even if he is our best pal.

182
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:23,060
 Well, anyway, will these two from my house, we've got three for him to repair.

183
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:25,660
 Sure. That should make him happy.

184
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:28,560
 And we will tell him they don't really need repairing.

185
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,160
 Oh, of course not.

186
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,860
 Well, he won't know the difference.

187
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:34,160
 Come on, let's get these over to his house.

188
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,060
 Sure.

189
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,460
 We'll pull a wagon.

190
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:40,260
 Oh, but suppose you pull it over and I'll pull it back.

191
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,460
 Well, that's a good idea.

192
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:45,660
 Are you sure Dr. Bennington said they sent Willy home?

193
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:48,220
 Yeah, straight from the specialist.

194
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:51,460
 Boy, they probably sent him to bed for at least a month.

195
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:56,200
 Henry, how long you suppose it takes to cure cancer?

196
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,700
 I don't know.

197
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:01,180
 My father says it all depends on how early you discover it.

198
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:03,900
 My mother's got a friend, and you know what she says?

199
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:07,740
 If you drink rusty water out of a blacksmith's pail, you can cure it.

200
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:08,460
 Homer.

201
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:11,900
 Or if you get touched by a 7/7 son of a 7/4.

202
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:14,820
 Imagine anybody believing a thing like that.

203
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:19,820
 What do you think even a moron would see through a thing like that?

204
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:24,820
 Sure, I'll say. I tell us what the minute I heard it.

205
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:28,820
 And listen Homer, when we get over there, let's not bother Willie.

206
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:31,820
 Let's just give these radios to his mother.

207
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:35,820
 Sure, and tell her to tell him to go right to work and have a swell,

208
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,820
 to her in the sixth of loy war.

209
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:40,820
 Sure, provided she's got lots of fuses.

210
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:55,820
 Hello Officer Burns, this is Ham Orange again. I just called to see if you had any word on our radios. Oh, I see.

211
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:59,820
 Mother, you're on home. The large radio was stolen from the living room, Officer.

212
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,820
 Oh, do you win? And the small one from the kitchen.

213
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:04,820
 Father, Father, could I speak to you for a second?

214
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,820
 Would you hold on a minute, Officer? Henry, what is it?

215
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:11,320
 Father, I took those radios over to my pal Willie's house so he could fix them.

216
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:11,820
 What?

217
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,820
 But Henry, they didn't need to be fixed.

218
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:20,820
 I know, Father, but Willie's awfully sick and do you think two little radios are too much of a sacrifice?

219
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:25,820
 Hello, Hello, Officer. I'm sorry, George, I've troubled you. We just caught the party who took the radios.

220
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,820
 No, no, I don't wish to press charges.

221
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:32,820
 Oh, no, no, please don't, Father. Just let me handle him. Get my officer burned.

222
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,820
 Now, see you here, Henry.

223
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,820
 When do you like me to answer the door for obvious?

224
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:39,820
 Yes, please, and then will you come into the living room?

225
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,820
 Well, gee, what?

226
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:42,820
 Hi, Henry.

227
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:44,820
 What are you doing up?

228
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:45,820
 Did you gee, come on in.

229
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:48,820
 Oh, listen, Henry, you better come in and sit down.

230
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:50,820
 How are you feeling?

231
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:51,820
 I feel fine.

232
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,820
 Now, can you, my feet, all I want.

233
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:54,820
 You want?

234
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,820
 Didn't Dr. Bennington send you to a specialist?

235
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:59,820
 Sure, so, our office, I got four on our two.

236
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:00,820
 You want?

237
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,820
 Boy, that's some examination I give you for cancer.

238
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:06,820
 You know what else they discovered? I gotta have my tonsils out.

239
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,820
 Well, I'll be gone.

240
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:11,820
 That's okay. I'm gonna do a big business while I'm in the hospital.

241
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,820
 You know they have a radio in every room?

242
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,820
 Listen, Willy. Speaking of radios...

243
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,820
 Well, let's get down to business.

244
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:21,820
 I've got all your radios in running order, but it was a big job, so you owe me two dollars for each one.

245
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:24,820
 Willy, you're crazy. I don't know you were sent.

246
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,820
 Okay, then I'll seize the radio.

247
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,820
 Yeah? Yeah.

248
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:32,820
 Father, could you get that policeman back on the phone?

249
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:52,820
