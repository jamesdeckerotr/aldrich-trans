 [Music]

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 And now the Jell-O family presents...

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 Henry... Henry Oldridge!

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 Coming, mother!

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 [Applause]

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 Yes, it's the Oldridge family based on characters

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,520
 is originated by Flippard Goldsmith and starring Ezra Stone as Henry with Jackie

8
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:36,680
 Kelka's home. And yes, it's the Jell-O family with its three famous desserts.

9
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:42,060
 Jell-O in those six delicious flavors, Jell-O puddings with that old-fashioned

10
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:48,000
 homemade flavor and Jell-O tapioca puddings, a miracle of goodness, a marvel of

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 speed.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:59,240
 Everyone's a jello good fellow, a very good jello good fellow, so rich so tempting and

13
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:04,920
 mellow, J-E-L-L-O.

14
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:13,520
 And now for the Old Rich Family.

15
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:25,020
 It's difficult to imagine and even more difficult to remember either a neighborhood

16
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:29,300
 or a home without a typical teenage boy somewhere in it.

17
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:33,500
 Henry Aldrich for instance is always right in the center of everything.

18
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,300
 The scene opens in the Aldrich front hall.

19
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:39,100
 It is mid-morning.

20
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,940
 I'm coming.

21
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:42,580
 Well, Willie Marshall.

22
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:45,880
 Mr. Orr, did you know it's snowing cats and dogs outside?

23
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:49,360
 It's also snowing cats and dogs inside. Come in so I can shut the door.

24
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:54,820
 Sure. I've got special rates for shoveling the last snow of the year, Mr. Orr, which is dollar an hour.

25
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:55,820
 A dollar?

26
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:56,980
 That shocks you?

27
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:57,780
 It does.

28
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:01,080
 Well, did I mention I have an easy payment plan?

29
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,980
 Well, no plan could make paying a dollar an hour easy.

30
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:05,820
 But for snow, that's dirt cheap.

31
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:06,720
 No, thank you.

32
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:11,280
 Besides, it isn't necessary to hire anyone. Henry's already out there shoveling our driveway.

33
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:11,780
 He is?

34
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:13,540
 Yes, he started nearly an hour ago.

35
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:16,740
 Gee, I guess the snow's coming down so fast I couldn't see him.

36
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:18,060
 So thank you just the same.

37
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,980
 Well that's okay, would you like some firewood hole?

38
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:21,500
 No thanks.

39
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,620
 Lambs rewired?

40
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:23,420
 No thanks.

41
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:25,100
 How about having your house repainted?

42
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,300
 (audience laughs)

43
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,220
 But I have a tie in with an uncle.

44
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:30,180
 No thank you, Willie, and now if you'll excuse me

45
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,860
 I'm helping Mr. Brown make out his infant tax return.

46
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,540
 Okay, I'll move along.

47
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:35,380
 Here, Mr. Orrin.

48
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:36,220
 What's this?

49
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:37,780
 My card, so long.

50
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,380
 Goodbye.

51
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:40,220
 Say Sam.

52
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:41,220
 I'm coming, Will.

53
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:42,920
 I've been looking over these exemptions.

54
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,860
 There must be a typographical error.

55
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:45,700
 - That's impossible.

56
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,120
 - But Sam, according to this form,

57
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,380
 all I'm allowed to deduct for home are $600.

58
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:51,220
 - That's right.

59
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:54,700
 - After all, I go through Sam it isn't fair.

60
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:55,780
 - Yes, Alice.

61
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,860
 - Don't you think he's been out there long enough?

62
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:58,700
 - Who?

63
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,500
 - Henry, he'll be simply warned of nothing,

64
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,340
 shoveling all that heavy snow.

65
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,660
 - I'll get the ball, brother.

66
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:04,500
 - Thank you, Mary.

67
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,900
 - Alice, don't worry about Henry.

68
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,460
 Boys have been shoveling ever since the first snowfall.

69
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:10,300
 - But when we had his tonsils out,

70
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:14,060
 Dr. Bennington warned us not to let Henry over-exert.

71
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,660
 Henry was three years old then.

72
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:19,460
 There is the easiest thing in the world to have a relapse.

73
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:21,540
 Mr. Brown, that phone call for you.

74
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:22,040
 Me?

75
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,800
 And here's your part of Hot Chocolate, Mother.

76
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,940
 Thanks, Mary. Here's some.

77
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:25,740
 I'll be right back.

78
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,740
 You know I don't care for Hot Chocolate.

79
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,780
 Here, I want you to take it out to Henry.

80
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:30,340
 Alice.

81
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:32,140
 This man has energy food.

82
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:32,980
 Hello?

83
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,300
 Will, this is Elizabeth.

84
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,060
 Who?

85
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:37,260
 Elizabeth Brown, your wife.

86
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,580
 Oh, yes, Elizabeth.

87
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:43,580
 home over there the aldrices from course not he's shoveling snow off our driveway

88
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:47,260
 well I did see a dark object out there but I thought it was a trash can

89
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:50,580
 Elizabeth it's about time you began to recognize the difference between your

90
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:55,700
 own son and a trash can yes dear and will you know how the poor boy suffers

91
00:03:55,700 --> 00:04:00,700
 from sinus only when there's work to be done but there Elizabeth let's not coddle

92
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:05,540
 home well hold on a second Elizabeth tell her to come right home and to be

93
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:09,020
 quick about it is Henry in our house he's not here in our driveway hasn't been

94
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:12,700
 touched. Elizabeth, how many trash cans did you see outside?

95
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:17,100
 One. And excuse me, Will, I've got a pot of hot chocolate on the stove.

96
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:17,700
 What?

97
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:20,780
 Henry isn't at our house,

98
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:24,020
 that's a fine thing. Alice, where's Henry?

99
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:28,060
 Were you calling? I, Father. Henry, all rich. Where did you come from?

100
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:32,300
 The basement and father, did you know our aluminum snow shovel has disappeared?

101
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:35,740
 Henry, we gave that to the government in 1942.

102
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:38,540
 We did? She was. What for?

103
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,500
 We were fighting a war.

104
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,040
 With our snow shovel?

105
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,540
 [laughter]

106
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:44,140
 Henry.

107
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:46,540
 But father, the one I'm using weighs a ton.

108
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:47,640
 No alibi, Henry.

109
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,440
 If Homer's clearing away the brown snow,

110
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,040
 the least you can do is clear ours.

111
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:51,840
 Homer is?

112
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,240
 That's right, Henry.

113
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,240
 Homer?

114
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,740
 Did someone call me?

115
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:56,740
 Homer!

116
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:57,740
 Homer!

117
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:00,240
 So you were the trash can after all?

118
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:00,940
 Why?

119
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,540
 Why aren't you at home shoveling snow?

120
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:04,140
 Because I'm gonna help Henry,

121
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:06,240
 then he's coming over to help me.

122
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,640
 Oh, don't say.

123
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:11,560
 Sure, boy, if there's one thing two people can do faster, it's driveways.

124
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,240
 Very well then, suppose you start.

125
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,080
 Yeah, now?

126
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:14,680
 No.

127
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,800
 Before we find the lighter shovel.

128
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,320
 Homer start shoveling.

129
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,480
 Yes, Father.

130
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,800
 But she wish you'd never seen us know the way so much.

131
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,320
 Come on, well, let's get back to your income tag.

132
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:30,160
 Father, Father, did I mention the weather report I heard on the radio?

133
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,120
 What about it?

134
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,080
 They predicted we're practically sure to have sun tomorrow.

135
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:35,840
 Yes?

136
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,240
 or by Saturday at the latest.

137
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,000
 Good hot sun.

138
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,840
 - Well?

139
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:44,080
 - I don't think I just thought I'd mention it.

140
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,760
 (audience laughing)

141
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,560
 - You know what our trouble is, Sam?

142
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,200
 Our wives coddle those boys too much.

143
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,120
 - Not this time, Will.

144
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,080
 This time, Henry's going to finish that job.

145
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,560
 - Right, Sam, home or two.

146
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,040
 - Well, there, mother just put on her boots and shawl

147
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,320
 and your old Mackinac went out to the driveway.

148
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,160
 - What for?

149
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,120
 - That's what I was wondering.

150
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,920
 She was carrying the coal shovel.

151
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,760
 - What?

152
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,160
 Alice! Alice, come back in here!

153
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,160
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

154
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:20,400
 Listen, Henry, be careful.

155
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,560
 What do I do now?

156
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,440
 What do you do?

157
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,280
 What do you do?

158
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,800
 Look at the space I cleared in your driveway.

159
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,440
 What space?

160
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,320
 That's just it.

161
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,480
 You threw a shovel full of snow over here,

162
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,880
 and there goes 15 minutes of work.

163
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:35,920
 Homer, with this shovel that's as far as I can throw it.

164
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,160
 - I've been thinking, Henry.

165
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,360
 How much snow do we take up with each shovel for?

166
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,080
 Six inches at the most.

167
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,040
 - So what?

168
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,920
 - So if we take one shovel every 10 seconds,

169
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,440
 you know how long we'll be?

170
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,280
 - How long?

171
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,040
 - I don't know.

172
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,960
 But I have a date with Agnes tonight,

173
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,160
 and by the time we're through,

174
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,440
 I won't be in shape for anything.

175
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,800
 - Homer, what can we do?

176
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,040
 - Use our brain.

177
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,520
 - You think that's practical?

178
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,320
 I mean like Tom Sawyer.

179
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,160
 - Who?

180
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,720
 - Remember, he got this kid to think white washing

181
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,280
 was so much fun, he did the fence for him

182
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,880
 and gave Tom an apple besides.

183
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,080
 - Homer, those things only happen in books.

184
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:16,000
 Who'd be dumb enough to fall for a thing like that?

185
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,960
 - Hi, fellas.

186
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,760
 - Oh boy, here's somebody who's dumb enough.

187
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,440
 Charlie Clark, start enjoying yourself.

188
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,440
 Henry, start enjoying yourself.

189
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,680
 - Homer, it won't work.

190
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,720
 - We can at least try.

191
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:31,120
 Boy, Henry, did you ever have so much fun?

192
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,120
 We!

193
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,120
 Henry.

194
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:34,960
 - Why?

195
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,880
 - We.

196
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,720
 - Oh!

197
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,560
 (coughing)

198
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,400
 We!

199
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,120
 - We!

200
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,160
 - What's up, fellas?

201
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,720
 - Charlie, don't stop us.

202
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:46,440
 Boy, are we having fun.

203
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:49,200
 - Fun, Homer, have you got sunstroke or something?

204
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,200
 - She was no.

205
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,040
 We!

206
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,840
 We!

207
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,200
 We!

208
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,280
 Oh boy.

209
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,120
 Homer, what happened?

210
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,560
 - Oh boy.

211
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,240
 - Homer, why are you bent over?

212
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,920
 - It's nothing, Charlie.

213
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:06,280
 Didn't you ever laugh so hard you couldn't straighten up?

214
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,480
 - Henry, does he mean he's really enjoying

215
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,560
 shoveling snow?

216
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,480
 - Oh, sure.

217
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,520
 - You know what I think?

218
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,360
 - Why?

219
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,840
 - You guys sure have sunstroke, all right?

220
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,680
 So long.

221
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,520
 - Charlie, wait!

222
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,360
 - I imagine thinking a thing like shoveling snow is fun.

223
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,200
 - But it is, Charlie, look.

224
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,600
 Weee.

225
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,400
 - Homer, he's gone.

226
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,240
 - Weee.

227
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,200
 I told you it only worked in books Homer.

228
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:33,600
 Well, all I can say is that's a good example of our entire school system.

229
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,100
 What is?

230
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,400
 Tom Sawyer.

231
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:39,600
 They give you a book like that to read and when you put it to work what happens?

232
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,500
 No wonder I flunked French.

233
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,600
 Fringe?

234
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,600
 What's that got to do with Tom Sawyer?

235
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,400
 It's all tied together Henry, it's all tied together.

236
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:52,000
 Come on, we'd better get back to shoveling or we'll never get done.

237
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,600
 Okay.

238
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,200
 Ugh, glee.

239
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,200
 Homer never mind weying.

240
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,200
 Oh, I forgot.

241
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,200
 [Sigh]

242
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,200
 Boy, did you ever shovel heavier snow?

243
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,200
 Hiya fellas!

244
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,200
 Who's that?

245
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,200
 Willie Marshall, keep shoveling.

246
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,200
 Hiya fellas, whatcha doin'?

247
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,200
 [Sigh]

248
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,200
 Yes.

249
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,200
 Okay.

250
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,200
 Shovelin' snow?

251
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,200
 You win, Willie.

252
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,200
 Now whatcha like to do me a favor?

253
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,200
 What?

254
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,200
 Jumpin' the lake.

255
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,200
 I can't, it's frozen.

256
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,200
 Ohhh boy.

257
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,200
 I can crack a joke as well as a next guy.

258
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:28,760
 Willy for the last time beat it and let us finish.

259
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:32,040
 Say you guys wouldn't consider what?

260
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,240
 Gee, no, I guess you wouldn't.

261
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,440
 Wouldn't want.

262
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,720
 Well, you guys look like you're having so much fun.

263
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,520
 I was wondering if you'd let me try for a while.

264
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,040
 What?

265
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,840
 You mean you want a shovel?

266
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,720
 I guess you wouldn't consider it, huh?

267
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,840
 Sure we would.

268
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,640
 Or here, Willy, try mine.

269
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,880
 Well, Gee, thanks.

270
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,080
 You're holding this package.

271
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,560
 Weee!

272
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,060
 Henry, do you suppose he's got sunstroke?

273
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,760
 Weee!

274
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,260
 Well, well, thanks for letting me try fellas.

275
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,660
 Here, here's your shovel.

276
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:03,560
 You're quitting?

277
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:06,060
 When you just started to enjoy yourself?

278
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:08,360
 Gee, I really don't want to quit only.

279
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,360
 Only I have to deliver this package to my Aunt Mildred, see ya.

280
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:18,160
 Willie, you mean you're gonna let a little thing like your Aunt Mildred stand between you and the most fun you've ever had in your life?

281
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,560
 Gee, what can I do?

282
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:23,920
 Willie, look Willie, suppose Homer and I deliver the package for you.

283
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,120
 What fellas you'd really do that for me?

284
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:29,800
 She'd be a pleasure Willie. Here's your shovelback.

285
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,880
 Well gee, thanks her name's Mrs. Hopkins on Maple Street.

286
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,320
 Sure we know, come on Homer.

287
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,760
 Well thanks again, fellas.

288
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,200
 You're welcome Willie. Boy Henry.

289
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,920
 It just shows how you can misjudge people.

290
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,920
 Here I've been going through life thinking Willie was one of the smartest guys around.

291
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,040
 I'll say.

292
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,160
 And you know what I'm gonna do when I get home?

293
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,160
 What?

294
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,160
 Retarm Sawyer again.

295
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:54,160
 Maybe there's something in there that can help my French.

296
00:10:54,160 --> 00:11:04,160
 Hi Mrs. Hopkins.

297
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,160
 Hi Mrs. Hopkins.

298
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,160
 Well, come in boys.

299
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,160
 I thought you were my nephew Willie.

300
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,160
 I've been expecting him all morning.

301
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,160
 Well that's the whole thing Mrs. Hopkins.

302
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,160
 What is?

303
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:17,160
 Willie got sort of tied up in a little deal and sent us over instead.

304
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,160
 Instead, you're taking this place?

305
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,480
 Well, sure. Here's your package, Mrs. Hopkins.

306
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,760
 Package? Oh, that must be.

307
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,880
 But wait here. I'll be right back.

308
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,400
 Wait, Mrs. Hopkins?

309
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,640
 She was. Why does she want us to wait?

310
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,000
 She probably wants to give us a little something

311
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,480
 for delivering the package.

312
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,920
 Oh, boy. You mean we're getting paid to boot?

313
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:40,240
 Homer, if she gives us money naturally, we won't keep it.

314
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,080
 Why not?

315
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:44,480
 Because if anyone really deserves it, it's good old willing.

316
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,440
 With all the fun he's having.

317
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,440
 Here you are, boys.

318
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,440
 The brushes, they're here in the package.

319
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,440
 But Mrs. Hopkins, what's in this can?

320
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,440
 White wash.

321
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,440
 White wash?

322
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,440
 White wash.

323
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,440
 Didn't you say you were taking Willy's plate?

324
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,440
 Well, sure, only it was.

325
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:04,440
 Well, that's why he was coming over to White Wash my basement.

326
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,440
 What?

327
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,440
 Oh, boy.

328
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,440
 Henry, we've been swindled.

329
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:19,440
 [Music]

330
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,440
 Sam, what are you doing over there by the window?

331
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,440
 Just checking on the boys, Will.

332
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,440
 Homer doesn't look as always wheezing, does he?

333
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,440
 I can only see one of them from here.

334
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,440
 Which one?

335
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,440
 It's hard to tell, but he seems to be shoveling right along.

336
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:37,440
 You know, Sam, it sure makes you feel good, knowing your son has learned to really stick on the job.

337
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,440
 That's right, Will.

338
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:44,200
 Sarah just goes to show you Sam that a mother's a mother, but a father will Sam

339
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:48,880
 every boy really needs a father. After all, who else can teach him how to finish

340
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:53,120
 whatever he starts? Well, speaking of finishing what you start, let's get back

341
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:59,980
 to your tax return. My return. Where were we? On Schedule D, page 2. Have you got it?

342
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:04,200
 Yeah. Sam, why don't I just tell them how much money I've got left over and let

343
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,200
 the government take what it needs.

344
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,200
 Sam, can you answer the front door?

345
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,200
 Very well, Alice.

346
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,200
 We'll start totaling your deduct.

347
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,200
 Oh, but Sam, that's why I really go to pieces.

348
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,200
 Hi, Mr. Alberts.

349
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,200
 Willie, you have already asked me.

350
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,200
 We don't need our plumbing fix.

351
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,200
 Our furnace is fine.

352
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,200
 Well, she was Mr. Alberts.

353
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,200
 I'm not here for that.

354
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,200
 No.

355
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,200
 Come in.

356
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,200
 I've got a path cleared from the sidewalk to your back door, Mr. Alberts.

357
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,200
 What?

358
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,200
 Not naturally, that's for free.

359
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,860
 for free but if I make it wide enough to get your car out don't you think I'm

360
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:39,340
 entitled to a little something extra? Well it may I ask why you are doing our

361
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:44,760
 driveway? I made sort of a deal with Henry and Homer. You don't say? Yes sir

362
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:49,020
 you look upset Mr. Aldrich. Upset? If you aren't naturally considering the

363
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:52,820
 circumstances I wouldn't think of charging you full price. Well it won't be

364
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:56,260
 necessary for you to clear our driveway. But Mr. Aldrich I made a bargain with the

365
00:13:56,260 --> 00:14:00,540
 boys. The boys were in no position to make such a bargain. You may go home

366
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,540
 Well, Gee, if you say so, Mr. Alders.

367
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:03,540
 I say so.

368
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,540
 Well, if you say so, goodbye.

369
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:06,540
 Goodbye.

370
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:08,540
 If you ever need your pipe filling out or anything like that...

371
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:11,540
 Yes, Willie, I have your card.

372
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:13,540
 Goodbye.

373
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:14,540
 Sam.

374
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:16,540
 Yes, Will. I'm coming.

375
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:18,540
 I can't figure out what...

376
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:21,540
 Sam, you look awful. Did you fall down the front steps?

377
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,540
 That would have been a pleasure.

378
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:24,540
 What?

379
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:28,540
 Well, the night Henry was born and I found out he was a boy.

380
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:32,340
 I had to pinch myself to make sure it was true

381
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:37,580
 But I never realized I'd go through life pinching myself for the same reason watch Henry done now

382
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:41,880
 And it is known a Henry well you might as well sit down and start pinching yourself, too

383
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:02,060
 And now while Mr. Albridge and Mr. Brown are pinching themselves, let's listen to

384
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:04,860
 Meredith Wilson and his talking people.

385
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:08,060
 "All information, information.

386
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:11,660
 Meredith, we just love information."

387
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:12,660
 "All you do?

388
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:13,660
 Well, why may I ask?"

389
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:14,660
 "Because it's so short."

390
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:15,660
 "I see."

391
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:25,240
 "Unless the

392
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,240
 Jell-O-Vanilla tapioca.

393
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,240
 Jell-O-Vanilla tapioca.

394
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,240
 Jell-O-Vanilla tapioca.

395
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,240
 Jell-O-Vanilla tapioca.

396
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,240
 Jell-O-Vanilla tapioca.

397
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,240
 Rigg, two luscious vanilla.

398
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,240
 Jell-O-Chocolate tapioca.

399
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,240
 Candy, good chocolate.

400
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,240
 And Jell-O-Orange coconut tapioca.

401
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,240
 Tangy, refreshing orange combined with tropical coconut.

402
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,240
 But, uh, I don't think you'll like them.

403
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,240
 Oh, yes, we will.

404
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,240
 Oh, no, you won't.

405
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,240
 Oh, yes, we will.

406
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:59,520
 Okay, I guess you will. Everybody loves Jello Tabioca Pudding. Put them on tomorrow's shopping

407
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:04,800
 list today. And remember the Big Red Letter stand for the whole Jello family of desserts.

408
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:12,440
 J-D-L-L. Oh, the Big Red Letter stand for the Jello family. Oh, the Big Red Letter stand.

409
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:20,560
 Oh, the Jello family. That's Jello. Jello, putting. Jello, that's the Oka pudding. Yes,

410
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,560
 And now back to the Aldrich family.

411
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:38,560
 Yes, getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldrich.

412
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:45,560
 Sam Aldrich and Will Brown have been shocked to learn that their sons have passed their snow shoveling on to Willie.

413
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:50,560
 And Henry and Homer have been tricked into whitewashing a cellar for Willy's end.

414
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:54,560
 The scene opens in her cellar. It is that afternoon.

415
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,560
 Henry, quiz!

416
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,560
 What did you do again with the whitewash, Homer?

417
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,560
 Sure you did, Dorneo.

418
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,560
 My fourth brush splatters.

419
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:06,560
 But look at my sweater. It's practically polka dotted.

420
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:09,560
 Oh boy, it's even in my hair.

421
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:12,560
 Homer, gray hair is very becoming on you.

422
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,560
 Where do I lay my hands on Willy?

423
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:17,440
 - Well, come on, we're practically through.

424
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:21,440
 Just a couple more feet of this ceiling and we're free men.

425
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,400
 - Boys, how are you coming along?

426
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,200
 - Coming along, Mrs. Hopkins?

427
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,240
 Well, you might say we're there.

428
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,640
 - You don't say.

429
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,480
 - Homer, your is quite as a sheet, are you, you?

430
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:34,160
 - No, ma'am, just whitewashed.

431
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,000
 So if you don't mind, Mrs. Hopkins,

432
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,920
 now that we've finished the whitewashing--

433
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:40,000
 - Don't you think you ought to take a little rest first?

434
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,760
 - Rest first?

435
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,440
 - Yes, before you start removing these ashes.

436
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,040
 What? What ashes?

437
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,720
 There's a pile right over there.

438
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,160
 Just shovel them into those barrels.

439
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:49,720
 But, but, but,

440
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:52,600
 And remember, when you've done with that, come upstairs.

441
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,360
 I got something for ya.

442
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,600
 Henry, did she say ashes?

443
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,240
 Yeah.

444
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,680
 That whole pile?

445
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,240
 Yeah.

446
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,840
 Into those six barrels?

447
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:01,480
 Uh-huh.

448
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,520
 If I'm going home.

449
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,200
 Homer, wait.

450
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,880
 Henry, I'm not gonna kill myself at this stage in my life.

451
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:11,000
 But don't you realize Mrs. Hopkins might give us something?

452
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,520
 Henry, money isn't every.

453
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:15,560
 Besides, we made a bargain with Willie Hillsoula.

454
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:18,520
 Let him all sue him right back out of my way.

455
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,200
 Homer, look out for the white wash!

456
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,760
 Oh boy.

457
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:23,720
 Homer.

458
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,960
 She was looking my shoes.

459
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:28,440
 Now I've got one black one and one white one.

460
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:33,160
 Homer, why don't you put your other shoe in the bucket?

461
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,920
 You think I want to look ridiculous?

462
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:37,720
 Oh boy!

463
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,560
 What? Yes Mrs. Hopkins?

464
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,760
 I forgot to laugh.

465
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:43,400
 Can either of you change a $20 bill?

466
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,320
 Twenty? Twenty?

467
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,320
 Yes, I need $5.50.

468
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,000
 Oh boy.

469
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,360
 Gee, you was.

470
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,600
 No, we can't, Mrs. Hopkins.

471
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,200
 Oh, well I'll get it somewhere.

472
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,160
 Thanks anyway.

473
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,120
 Henry, did you hear that?

474
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,720
 She's giving us $5.50.

475
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,560
 Did it sound like that to you too?

476
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:02,040
 Oh boy, let me add those ashes.

477
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,480
 Then you're not quitting me.

478
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,440
 Are you crazy?

479
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,120
 Not a boy, Homer.

480
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,680
 Besides Henry, it's nice inside work.

481
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:18,680
 [MUSIC]

482
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:26,680
 You know, Sam, snow was never this heavy when I was a boy.

483
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:29,680
 Careful, Will, you're spilling it down my galoshes.

484
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:35,680
 Wouldn't it be better for their characters if we got into your car and tracked them down and put them back on the job?

485
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:39,680
 No, Will. This way we'll show them how easily the job could have been done.

486
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:44,680
 - It only applied themselves. - Yes, but naturally I don't propose to let them off Scott Free.

487
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:49,680
 We'll charge them for doing their work for them and take it out of their allowances.

488
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:52,680
 Say, that's a good idea, Sam. How much do we charge?

489
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:55,680
 Oh, I'd say about 30 cents an hour would be a sharp lesson to them.

490
00:19:55,680 --> 00:20:01,680
 30? I can't work for that kind of money. Let's make it 50 and really teach them a lesson.

491
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,680
 We'll start shoveling.

492
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,680
 Sam, now what?

493
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,680
 You think Henry's right.

494
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,680
 Right, what about?

495
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,680
 The sun coming out tomorrow.

496
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,680
 Now will.

497
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,680
 But the sun does such a nice clean job.

498
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,680
 Will you're as bad as the boys?

499
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,680
 Now keep shoveling.

500
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,680
 Oh, Sam.

501
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:26,680
 Will, stand back until I figure out how to straighten up.

502
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,640
 (

503
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,640
 Great enough.

504
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:32,220
 (lively music)

505
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:39,760
 Homer, keep working.

506
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,720
 - What can we, my back's breaking?

507
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:45,040
 - Listen, Mrs. Hopkins is gonna pay us $5.50, right?

508
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:45,880
 - Yeah.

509
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,840
 - Just as soon as we get these barrels of ashes

510
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,120
 out to the curb, right?

511
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:49,960
 - Yeah.

512
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,800
 - How else can we get them out there?

513
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,640
 - Henry, do you realize Mrs. Hopkins driveways

514
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,320
 twice as long as yours?

515
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:01,320
 Sure I realize it now. Start shoveling this snow or we'll never get done.

516
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:23,220
 Are we moving, Will?

517
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:26,120
 No you, Sam. Your car wheels just keep spinning.

518
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,200
 at the high peak.

519
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:31,480
 Here we are stuck in a ditch miles from nowhere.

520
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,120
 Well, you shouldn't have told me to take that short.

521
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,800
 Now, Sam, don't go blaming everything on me.

522
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,160
 Besides, things aren't hopeless.

523
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:41,280
 Once we get moving and get our hands on that flame forward,

524
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,920
 those driveways will be a sense.

525
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,200
 Hey, Will.

526
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,040
 Look.

527
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,520
 It's a snowplow, Sam.

528
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,600
 Hey.

529
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,240
 Hello there.

530
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,240
 Stop, stop.

531
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,720
 Hey, Miss Horridge.

532
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,180
 - Well, it's God. - A junk man?

533
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:59,400
 And, gosh, what are you doing on that plow?

534
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,720
 - Driving it? - In the junk business?

535
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,280
 - Not anymore.

536
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,440
 Sheila decided to retire.

537
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,000
 - Sheila? - Yeah, my heart.

538
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,980
 She's been pulling that junk wagon,

539
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:12,480
 man and boy, for 15 years.

540
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,240
 Then, one day last month, she told me she was going to up and retire.

541
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,140
 - She told you? - Yeah.

542
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:20,360
 Me and Sheila was pretty close, you know.

543
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,960
 After 15 years in the junk business,

544
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,480
 Yes, you just couldn't take it anymore.

545
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,640
 The bells was given a headache.

546
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,880
 (audience laughs)

547
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,720
 Look, Gus.

548
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,040
 - Had a might trouble here?

549
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:34,040
 - Yes, and could you haul us out of this ditch?

550
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,480
 - Oh, yeah.

551
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,720
 Well, I might be able to--

552
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,640
 - Fine.

553
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,920
 - Only thing is, I'm just a driver of this plow,

554
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,400
 not the proprietor.

555
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:46,080
 - Gus, we'd be very glad to pay you.

556
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:46,960
 - You're--

557
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,800
 - Yes, how much?

558
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,400
 - Well, now, first, I'd like to point out

559
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:54,040
 that this ain't no ordinary plow that you're hiring.

560
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:54,960
 Yes, I know.

561
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,880
 It's the widest one in the state.

562
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,120
 That's fine only.

563
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:02,480
 There's two lanes in one fell swoop, as you might say.

564
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,440
 Gus, how does $5 sound?

565
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,960
 $5 saying?

566
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:10,120
 Why, it has a nice ring.

567
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,480
 How does $10 sound to you?

568
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,200
 $10?

569
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,920
 Now just a minute, Gus.

 (upbeat music)

572
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:26,920
 Sam, is that you?

573
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:29,240
 - No, Mother, it's I, Henry.

574
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,040
 - Well, please march straight in here.

575
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,440
 I want a word with you.

576
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:35,680
 - Yes, Mother, and boy, am I worn out.

577
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,440
 - Henry, I had the least bit of sympathy for you.

578
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,960
 - Mary? - Yes, Mother?

579
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,600
 - Will you bring Henry a nice warm glass of milk?

580
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,680
 - Is he back?

581
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:46,240
 Mother, don't start on him until I get there.

582
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,500
 Mother? Mother, why didn't Willy do our driveway?

583
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,860
 Because dear your father sent him away.

584
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:58,420
 What? And Henry, why you couldn't do a simple, ordinary job that your father can do in 10 minutes is beyond me.

585
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:00,700
 Father's going to clean the driveway?

586
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:04,340
 Yes, dear, just as soon as he gets back from wherever he disappeared to.

587
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:05,640
 Oh, boy.

588
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:11,100
 And when he finds out that you were clearing Mrs. Hopkins' driveway, he's going to be simply furious.

589
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,340
 You heard about that?

590
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:14,540
 Yes, dear, your Aunt Harriet saw you.

591
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:16,620
 Mother, let me explain why I did it.

592
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,040
 Dear I know why.

593
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,760
 And someday you'll learn that money isn't everything.

594
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,160
 But that's just it, we didn't get any money.

595
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:23,880
 What?

596
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:27,760
 Mrs. Hopkins wanted the 550 for the laundry man.

597
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,960
 Henry, I don't understand a word of this.

598
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:32,300
 She was all we got out of it were two cokes

599
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,240
 and a glass of ginger ale.

600
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,040
 Black.

601
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,400
 Here's your mail, Kenry.

602
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,880
 Gee, I don't know whether I've even

603
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,680
 got enough strength to swallow.

604
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,840
 Mother, did you hear a crash outside a few minutes ago?

605
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,400
 A cray? No, dear.

606
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,120
 Well, I'm positive I heard something.

607
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,540
 Oh, dear, that must be your father.

608
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:51,540
 Sam?

609
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:52,840
 Yes, Alice.

610
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:55,040
 Henry, now are you gonna get it?

611
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:58,140
 Mary, your father sounds as though he could use a glass of hot milk, too.

612
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:00,840
 But, Mother, just when he's going to Mary, please get it.

613
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:04,740
 My goodness, I might as well be an outsider in this family.

614
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:06,140
 I see your home, Henry.

615
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:09,140
 Yes, Father, and Father, as soon as my mittens throw out,

616
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:11,240
 I'm gonna get started on the driveway.

617
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,040
 Don't bother.

618
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:14,740
 Sam, before you fly off the handle, why don't you?

619
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:17,480
 Sam, are you taking off your jacket?

620
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,880
 Father, if I don't make any happier,

621
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,640
 I won't even wait for my mittens to thaw.

622
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,920
 I'll start right now.

623
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:25,720
 Enray the driveway is cleared.

624
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,720
 It is?

625
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,640
 Sam, are you rolling up your sleeve?

626
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,480
 I am.

627
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,520
 Father, if you're worried that I haven't learned my lesson,

628
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,840
 she was I give you my work.

629
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,760
 Father, you're rolling up both your sleeves.

630
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:37,600
 I am.

631
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,440
 And now Sam?

632
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:41,820
 Would you please go up to our bathroom and get something for me?

633
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:43,820
 You mean your razor strap?

634
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:45,820
 I mean the Linamans.

635
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:46,820
 Sam.

636
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:50,420
 No, I never remembered snow being that heavy.

637
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:52,580
 Oh, gee, Father, then you're not...

638
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:54,860
 Henry, suppose you run upstairs and get the Linamans.

639
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:56,900
 Yes, Father, and I give you my word.

640
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:59,500
 From now on, I'm gonna pitch into everything.

641
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,740
 Yes, well, now let's not overdo it.

642
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:04,900
 Sam, I thought you controlled yourself beautifully.

643
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:07,620
 Alice, I couldn't very well blame Henry.

644
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:14,720
 when... Yes, son. Alice, suppose we just forget it. Yes, dear. Did you do the whole

645
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:21,560
 driveway yourself? I had it done, Alice, by Gus. Gus? At a slight additional cost.

646
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:27,460
 But how did he do it so quickly? He had the widest snowplow in the state. What?

647
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:33,600
 Ever mind, Alice. But you know that fence between our driveway and kilmers? Yes.

648
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:38,600
 What would you think if we removed it and widened our driveway three feet?

649
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:56,600
 Boy, Willy Boy, are you a swindler tricking us into doing all that work at your aunt, Mildred?

650
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,600
 I'll say, Willy Boy.

651
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,600
 Who's a swindler?

652
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,600
 Who's a swindler?

653
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,600
 I got that idea right out of a schoolbook.

654
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,200
 So that makes it perfectly legal.

655
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,200
 What?

656
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,800
 Sure, that one about a guy whitewashing a fence.

657
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:10,600
 Only, of course, I had a spruce up the idea, some.

 Well, ladies, when it comes to jello,

659
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:17,100
 whether you spruce it up with extra fixings or serve it just as is,

660
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:20,700
 that rich fruit-like jello is always tops and treats.

661
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:24,600
 Yes, those luscious shimmering jello desserts are lovely to look at

662
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:27,200
 and grand to eat in all six flavors.

663
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,600
 Strawberry, raspberry, cherry, orange, lemon, and lime.

664

 Every jello flavor has that famous locked-in goodness.

 Flavors sealed right in by a special process,

666
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:41,080
 so it can't get out till your first delectable spoonful.

667
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:45,240
 No wonder jello tastes so good it makes you think of the real ripe fruit.

668
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:49,320
 No wonder jello is America's favorite gelatin dessert.

669
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,800
 Look for those big red letters on the box.

670
