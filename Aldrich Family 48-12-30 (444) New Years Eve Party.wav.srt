00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,920
 The Aldrich family based on characters originated by Clifford Goldsmith and

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:12,560
 starring Ezra Stone as Henry with Jackie Kalk as Homer. Henry! Henry Aldrich!

3
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:15,560
 Coming, brother!

4
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:29,040
 For the Aldrich family.

00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:40,540
 [Music]

6
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:46,540
 Most of us remember our teenage as something that was always bright and shiny and rather wonderful.

7
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:50,040
 But to Henry Aldrich who was right in the middle of his teenage,

8
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,040
 life is not always that attractive.

9
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:55,540
 The scene opens in the Aldrich's living room.

10
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:58,540
 It is the afternoon of the last day of the year.

11
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:00,980
 You are father, you really are?

12
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:03,340
 Certainly Mary, may I ask what's so unusual

13
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:06,180
 about taking your mother to a masquerade on New Year's Eve?

14
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:09,140
 Good Father, did you know that people dance at masquerade?

15
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:10,380
 Certainly I know.

16
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:11,580
 Oh.

17
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:12,980
 What do you mean, oh?

18
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:13,820
 Nothing.

19
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:14,660
 Mary!

20
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:15,860
 I'll be right back, Father.

21
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:16,700
 All right, Mary.

22
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:17,540
 Take your time.

23
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:18,380
 Well, you're mother.

24
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:19,580
 In the dining room.

25
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:22,300
 And dear, I was just wondering how you and Kermit

26
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:23,500
 were going to spend this evening.

27
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,700
 Didn't I tell you, Mother?

28
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:26,300
 Oh, my goodness, I so frail.

29
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:27,060
 Really?

30
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:30,760
 I get Kermit just about the most thoughtful person in the whole world.

31
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,360
 My, where's he taking you?

32
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,860
 No place.

33
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:34,860
 No place.

34
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:38,660
 He's just coming over here where we can be all by ourselves with just each other.

35
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:39,660
 What?

36
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:40,860
 Isn't that thoughtful of him?

37
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:43,160
 Well, yes, dear, of course.

38
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:46,160
 Goodness when I think of all the poor girls with boyfriends,

39
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:49,160
 how think of anything better to do than throw their money around

40
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:52,060
 and never get a romantic book near lies.

41
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:54,160
 My, doesn't your heart bleed for them?

42
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,860
 It certainly does, Mary.

43
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,660
 And I know just how you feel.

44
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:00,860
 Your father was always very thoughtful that way too.

45
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:01,860
 (audience laughing)

46
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,620
 - Anyways, did you know he's planning

47
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:05,420
 on actually dancing tonight?

48
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:08,260
 - Do your father's been dancing for 25 years.

49
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:09,180
 - That's what I mean,

50
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:11,260
 won't you think he'd get tired?

51
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:13,660
 - My goodness, I never thought of that.

52
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:15,140
 - I wonder.

53
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:16,220
 Excuse me, Mary.

54
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:18,660
 Oh, Sam, how did you think I should make something

55
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:19,500
 for Kermit?

56
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,220
 - As long as you stick to macarons, Mary.

57
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:23,660
 - I'm trying to leave.

58
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:27,660
 I know, dear, but I just got to thinking about...

59
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:28,660
 About what?

60
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:31,660
 Sam, are you sure you want to go to that masquerade tonight?

61
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,660
 Course I'm sure. What do you ask?

62
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:34,660
 Well, it's just...

63
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:37,660
 Are you sure you aren't getting tired?

64
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:38,660
 Tired?

65
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:40,660
 After all these years?

66
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,660
 Tired, Alice. These years with you have been the happiest of my life.

67
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:44,660
 What?

68
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,660
 Dear, I'm talking about the masquerade.

69
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:52,660
 Oh, well, Alice, when you first mentioned the masquerade, I may not have been too enthusiastic, but now I'm really looking forward to it.

70
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:53,660
 You are, Dean.

71
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:55,660
 Not only that, I promise I'd take you and now this.

72
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:57,660
 When I give my word, I keep it.

73
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:58,660
 Oh, Father!

74
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:00,660
 Yes, Henry, I'm in the living room trying to read.

75
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,660
 You go right on with your readings.

76
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:04,660
 Sam, it's nice and restful for you.

77
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:05,660
 What, sir?

78
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:08,660
 Father, I've turned the whole house upside down and you're my last hope.

79
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:09,660
 I am.

80
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,660
 Gee, was, do you know where my shin pads are?

81
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:12,660
 Your shin pads? What do you want them for?

82
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:15,660
 I'm taking them to the hockey game tonight, Father, and have them autographed.

83
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:17,660
 I'm afraid I haven't seen them, son.

84
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:18,660
 You haven't?

85
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,660
 Mother, wait, Father. What are you planning on wearing tonight?

86
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:24,660
 I don't know yet, Henry. Mr. and Mrs. Brown are looking out for the costumes.

87
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:26,660
 You're wearing a costume?

88
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:27,660
 Certainly.

89
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:30,660
 You are, Father. You really are?

90
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:33,660
 Yes, I am, and I'm also going to dance.

91
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:34,660
 You are?

92
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:38,660
 I am. You're going to dance at a thing like a hockey game?

93
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:39,660
 What?

94
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:42,660
 Well, yeah. You know the game you promised you to do take me to tonight.

95
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:44,660
 When did I promise a thing like that?

96
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:49,660
 Just before Christmas, Father. When you couldn't take me to that basketball game, you promised.

97
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:55,360
 When you said the very next time there was a hockey game, no matter if the world came to an end, we'd go.

98
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,660
 Yeah. Well, Henry...

99
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:03,860
 Henry, I just want you to know that there's nothing I'd rather do than take you to that hockey game.

100
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,960
 Why, isn't it lucky I reminded you?

101
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,960
 Yes.

102
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:10,760
 Especially since I already turned down three different New Year's Eve parties.

103
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,860
 Oh, you did?

104
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:12,560
 Sure.

105
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,960
 And none of the kids would believe me when I told them how my father thought enough of me,

106
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:20,360
 to turn over the entire end of his old year to me.

107
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:24,960
 Henry, Henry, would you excuse me a minute?

108
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,460
 -Surefire. -Alice.

109
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:27,960
 -Yes, sir. -Alice.

110
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,460
 -The browns didn't phone, did they? -The browns.

111
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:32,460
 -They said they'd get all the costumes,

112
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,960
 and my goodness, it's the middle of the afternoon now.

113
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,960
 -Alice, Alice, I just got a wonderful idea.

114
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,960
 -You did, dear? -Why don't we put on our coats and hats,

115
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,460
 say, next Saturday night, and go down to the mansion house for dinner?

116
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,460
 -Why, thank you. -And go dancing afterwards.

117
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:51,940
 Afterward you know really make a night of it. Then you'd be like that like it by Sam

118
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:57,580
 I did don't read fine then Alice and dear I think you get more thoughtful every day

119
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:04,000
 Well my goodness how many husbands realize how tired we were getting our own cooking all the time

120
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,760
 Alice what I had in mind was that we would do that in place of going to the masquerade tonight

121
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,880
 But dear I've been looking forward to this masquerade

122
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,680
 Well, look, Alice, why don't we make a night of it?

123
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,680
 Not just next Saturday, but every Saturday night in the year.

124
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,680
 What?

125
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,280
 You know make a regular date of it.

126
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,280
 My goodness.

127
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,280
 Instead of going to the masquerade tonight.

128
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,880
 So naturally, Sam, if you're feeling your age, of course I won't drag you out.

129
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,880
 Alice, I am not feeling my age.

130
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,580
 Well, there...

131
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:34,580
 Suddenly you do look awfully haggis.

132
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:36,880
 Mother, I can't find the coconut!

133
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,580
 I'll look for it, Mary.

134
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:39,580
 But, Alice...

135
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:42,580
 Oh, Henry?

136
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:43,580
 Yes, Father.

137
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:49,580
 Henry, you know, Henry, when I wasn't able to take you to that basketball game, well,

138
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:53,580
 I was a very good example of the way things have been in 1948.

139
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:54,580
 But not next year.

140
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:55,580
 No.

141
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:56,580
 No, sir.

142
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,580
 Next year's son is going to be a big change.

143
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:00,580
 You and I are going to be closer.

144
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:01,580
 We are?

145
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:02,580
 We are.

146
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,580
 D, that's well, Father.

147
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:09,880
 Boy, what a swell way to start the new year off, going to a hockey game together.

148
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,900
 Well, this is still 1948, Henry.

149
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,680
 Why start a new regime tonight?

150
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:18,280
 Why not start it, say, any night next week that you name?

151
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,280
 Next.

152
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,280
 Well, sure, but...

153
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,340
 And we'll go out on the town and have the time of our lives.

154
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,340
 We will.

155
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,340
 Absolutely.

156
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:25,340
 Even if...

157
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:29,020
 Even if the world comes to an end?

158
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,520
 Uh, yes.

159
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:34,060
 Well, sure, that's okay, Father.

160
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,060
 Now you're sure, are you, son?

161
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,060
 Sure.

162
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:39,060
 Sure, that's what you'd rather do.

163
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:42,060
 I mean, I don't want to appear to be forcing you into anything.

164
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,060
 No, it's okay, father.

165
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:48,060
 After all, hockey is rather a strenuous form of amusement for a man of my age.

166
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,060
 Well, I mean...

167
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,060
 Sure, father, I understand.

168
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:52,060
 You really do?

169
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:55,060
 Well, I'll find somebody younger to go with.

170
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:55,560
 with.

 [MUSIC PLAYING]

172
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:07,740
 But Homer, Homer, are you still there?

173
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:08,240
 Sure.

174
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,500
 Oh, how about it?

175
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,940
 Nothing doing, Henry.

176
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:14,300
 But look, Homer, who really wants to go to Willy's party

177
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,380
 on New Year's Eve?

178
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:16,140
 I do.

179
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:18,620
 Do you sit around, play stupid games,

180
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:22,260
 wear your feet out dancing, and watch a lot of dumb girls

181
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:24,840
 watching you to see if you're watching them.

182
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:25,940
 (laughing)

183
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:28,340
 But boy, you go to a hockey game, see?

184
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:30,300
 And they're all these swell players

185
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,020
 and there's this little piece of rubber.

186
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:34,420
 - Sure, and all I do is chase it around.

187
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,460
 - Oh, or they do a lot more than that.

188
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:38,500
 Boy, they trip up each other with their sticks

189
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,580
 and push each other into the side.

190
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:42,940
 Sometimes a player even lands in your lap.

191
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:43,860
 - In my lap.

192
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:44,700
 - Sure.

193
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:45,540
 - No kidding.

194
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:46,380
 - Sure.

195
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:47,620
 - I'd rather go to the party.

196
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:48,620
 (laughing)

197
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:49,620
 - But a homer.

198
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:51,220
 - Then you can go to the hockey game.

199
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,220
 All by myself?

200
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:57,220
 Sure, I just think you'd have one seat to sit in and one seat for any player that might land there.

201
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:00,220
 See, that wouldn't be any fun.

202
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:03,220
 Well, I'd like to bum around with you, Han, only...

203
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,220
 ...she a hockey game.

204
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:08,220
 Isn't there anything you'd rather do than go to Willy's party?

205
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:11,220
 Well, what I'd really like is to go to that masquerade.

206
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:12,220
 The masquerade?

207
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:14,220
 Sure that our folks are going to.

208
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,220
 See, they're giving prizes and everything.

209
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:18,220
 Well, then why don't we both go?

210
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:20,220
 You need money to rent costumes.

211
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:25,460
 My father gave me an extra dollar and if I could sell my hockey tickets, I'd have enough money.

212
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:29,220
 How could you sell them at this late date? Everybody will have plans.

213
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:33,380
 For the sake of your new year, Homer, the least I can do is try.

214
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:44,620
 Hello?

215
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:45,420
 Hello, Sam.

216
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:48,220
 Oh, hello there, Will. Everything all set for the masquerades.

217
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:49,120
 You betcha, Sam.

218
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:49,720
 Fine.

219
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:53,220
 Just the thought of getting out on the dance floor makes me feel like a boy, I guess.

220
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:55,420
 Sam, I phone to tell you we have the costumes.

221
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:56,720
 Good. What are they?

222
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,220
 We're going as the four seasons of the year.

223
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:01,320
 Hey, that's a darn good idea, Will.

224
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,220
 Your winter.

225
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,220
 What?

226
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:05,020
 Your winter, Sam.

227
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:05,820
 Oh, I am.

228
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:09,420
 You wear a long white beard, seeing you even have a cane.

229
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:10,120
 A cane, huh?

230
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,620
 Yours, so you won't even have to dance, Sam.

231
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:15,620
 All you have to do is hobble around all evening.

232
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:18,420
 I see. Well, well, that's just great.

233
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:20,180
 I'm glad you like the idea, Sam.

234
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:22,420
 Oh, I do. I do indeed.

235
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:23,920
 What are you, Will?

236
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,120
 I'm Summer.

237
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,620
 Summer, I see.

238
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:29,920
 Well, so long we'll get together later and try the costumes on.

239
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,420
 Fine, goodbye, Will.

240
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:32,220
 Oh, Alice.

241
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:33,720
 Yes, Sam.

242
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,220
 Alice, how old is Will Brown?

243
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,820
 Why, I'm not sure, dear.

244
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,720
 Is me a couple of years older than I am.

245
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,520
 Yes, I believe he is.

246
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,420
 Why, what's the matter?

247
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:43,620
 Nothing, Alice.

248
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,420
 Nothing at all.

249
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:51,960
 [Music]

250
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,860
 But Homer, listen to reason.

251
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,260
 Can we stand aside?

252
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,060
 Where are you going?

253
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:59,260
 Oh, but Homer, it's the only costume he has left.

254
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:00,260
 It isn't my fault.

255
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:03,740
 It isn't my fault either, and I refuse to have anything to do with it.

256
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:06,100
 But I've already sold my hockey tickets, Homer,

257
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,940
 and you promised you'd go to the masquerade with me.

258
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,380
 Not in this costume.

259
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,980
 Why can't go in and alone?

260
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:15,980
 Listen Henry, I'm not being the back end of any horse in that sense.

261
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:19,980
 Is that all it's worth? Look, you can be the front end.

262
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:23,980
 No, I'm not starting the new year by being any part of a horse.

263
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:24,980
 But a home, I...

264
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:29,980
 Henry, I said no. Do you think I want to dance with you all evening back to front?

265
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:38,980
 Sam, what are you trying to say?

266
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:44,280
 Simply this, Alice, that some time ago I gave Henry my word I'd go to a hockey game within this evening.

267
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,780
 But Sam, what about the brown?

268
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:50,380
 That's unfortunate, Alice, but the more I think about it, the more I feel my first duty is to my son.

269
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:52,480
 But think of how disappointed they'll be.

270
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,980
 I know and I'm sorry, but they'll just have to find themselves another winner.

271
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,180
 Sam, what do you mean?

272
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:58,780
 Right. Nothing.

273
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:00,280
 And what about me, dear?

274
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:03,280
 Alice, I'm sorry about that, but I'll make it up to you next week.

275
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:06,480
 Did you mean I have to stay home tonight with Mary and Kermit?

276
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,380
 What do you do right here in this house?

277
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,380
 Yes, Mary.

278
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:10,940
 You mean, right in the living world?

279
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:12,380
 Excuse me, I'd better phone the bra.

280
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,380
 But mother!

281
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:14,380
 That's all right, Mary.

282
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:16,100
 I won't bother you and Kermit.

283
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:19,220
 I can fix myself up very comfortably in the kitchen.

284
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,220
 In the kitchen?

285
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,220
 I'll be fine, Mary.

286
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:23,820
 I'll take an armchair out there and dust nip.

287
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:27,420
 My goodness, we wouldn't think of letting you do a thing like that.

288
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:30,260
 Well, Mary, if you really don't object...

289
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:33,100
 Come and help bring the radio out in the kitchen for you.

290
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:38,100
 Mary, do you need to say you've really banished your own mother to the kitchen on New Year's

291
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,100
 - Mother! - Yes, Henry!

292
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,100
 - Has anyone phone for me while I was out?

293
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,100
 - No, dear.

294
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:46,100
 - No one at all. Not even Homer. No, Henry.

295
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,100
 - Oh. - Henry!

296
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,100
 - Yes, Father. - Come in here, please.

297
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,100
 I've been looking for you.

298
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,100
 - Mother, you don't understand. Yes, I do, Mary.

299
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,100
 I understand perfectly.

300
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,100
 - Henry, I have news for you.

301
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,100
 - You mean Homer changed his mind about going with me?

302
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,100
 - Henry, I am going with you.

303
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,100
 - You are?

304
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:04,100
 - Yes, sir. I managed to change my other plans, and, son, you can count me in.

305
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,100
 - I can. That's definite, Father.

306
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:11,100
 - It is. I may have been forced to go back on my word a few times in the past, but not anymore Henry.

307
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:14,100
 - Oh boy, then let's try it on. - Try what on?

308
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,100
 - The costume. - What?

309
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:20,100
 - I have it right down the hall, Father. And boy, it's the best darn-looking horse you ever saw.

310
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:23,100
 - Horse? Now wait a minute. I thought we were going to a hockey game.

311
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:26,100
 - Nothing more, Father. We're going to the masquerade instead, as of course.

312
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,100
 - Now wait. - You're in the back end.

313
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:31,100
 - Now wait. - You just promised, Father.

314
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:35,100
 - I know, but I thought, Henry, you don't expect me to walk around all over the place.

315
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,660
 me to walk around all evening, fed over double.

316
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:40,300
 But father, I'm not a young man, Henry.

317
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:42,620
 Probably you mean you're backing out again?

318
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:43,420
 No, but--

319
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:46,660
 After you said we were going to be closer this year?

320
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:47,860
 Not that close.

 [applause]

323
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:11,340
 Yes, getting back to the troubles of Henry Oldridge.

324
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:15,340
 Mr. and Mrs. Oldridge had made arrangements to attend a New Year's Eve

325
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:20,740
 with the Browns when Henry informed his father of a promise to take him to a hockey game tonight.

326
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:28,240
 Due to his efforts to keep his word to everyone, Mr. Aldrich has now wound up as the hind end of a horse.

327
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:33,040
 The scene opens in the Browns living room. It is late the same afternoon.

328
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,840
 Mother, would you phone William Marshall for me?

329
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:41,240
 What for, hold on. Tell him it looks as though I'm going to recover and I'll be able to go to his party tonight after all.

00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:47,980
 Because of the what my pneumonia my pneumonia what pneumonia my mother he thinks I'm staying home with pneumonia

331
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:51,740
 Instead of going to his new year's party. You're not going to go these party

332

 I told him I wasn't but she was I'll be during if I'll be a whore home

333
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:59,260
 But just because you're hoarse is no reason to think you're coming down with pneumonia

 But gargling isn't gonna straighten me out with Willie. Yeah, you just have to have faith

00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:20,620
 A tree.

342
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:21,620
 And it spoke to me.

343
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:24,620
 Oh, dear, that's no tree. That's your father.

00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:27,620

 You're why?

349
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:34,620
 I'm summer. Summer.

350
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,620
 Oh, boy.

351
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:39,620
 We'll stop fooling around with that costume

352
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:44,560
 You and help me find a spring and winter who spring and winter did they just back down. What's that?

353
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,100
 She was all going upstairs and I don't

354
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:52,620
 Elizabeth, what do you mean they back down? We'll be ordered. You said you decided they can't come to the masquerade tonight

355
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:56,140
 Well, I shall find that now we'll calm down. You're shedding your leaves

356
00:14:56,140 --> 00:15:02,580
 There's the phone but Elizabeth, what are we going to do? We can't go just this food season

357
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:06,980
 Well, I've been trying to think how we could convert our costumes. I'm afraid it's hopeless. Oh

358
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:13,020
 Hello, oh Elizabeth. This is Sam Orange. Oh, Sam, you'll never know how disappointed we are

359
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:18,980
 Well, that's what I called about it. Even if I can't make it do you think you could still fit Alice in a spring?

360
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:23,580
 Well, the only thing is Sam. Wouldn't the three of us look a little awkward without winter?

361
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:31,300
 Nonsense, Elizabeth. If there's one season you can dispense with it's certainly winter. Well, maybe we can work out something. Oh, I'd appreciate it, Elizabeth. Goodbye.

362
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:37,940
 Elizabeth, was that Sam on the phone? Yes. He wants to know we can fit Alice in his spring. You mean all by herself?

363
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:39,740
 But who will we get as winter?

364
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:42,140
 I have any idea. Unless...

365
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:43,140
 Yeah?

366
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,740
 Well, I've got this. What?

367
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:46,440
 He's not going anywhere tonight.

368
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,440
 Oh, Homer!

369
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,440
 Yes, you want to go?

370
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,440
 Come down here and try on this beard!

371
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:58,940
 [music]

372
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:02,440
 Father, could you hold the horses tail still a minute?

373
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,240
 Henry, what are you doing?

374
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,940
 Well, the trouble is when I put my head in first,

375
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:08,940
 My feet won't go in.

376
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,940
 Why putting your feet in first?

377
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:11,940
 Are your feet in, Father?

378
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:12,940
 Yes.

379
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:14,940
 Maybe I should sort of bend over.

380
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,940
 Father, what happened?

381
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:19,940
 The hind legs are sticking straight up in the air.

382
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:21,940
 Yes, and I'm on my back.

383
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,940
 Well, maybe that's the way to do it.

384
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:27,940
 We both lie on our back, see and stick all our four feet up in the air.

385
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:28,940
 Now, wait a minute.

386
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:31,940
 Gee, it's going to be fun, Father.

387
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,940
 Dad, will you see that to the phone?

388
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:34,940
 Well, I'll try.

389
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:35,940
 I'll get it, Father.

390
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:38,940
 - Henry, stop pulling my leg. - That's my leg, Father.

391
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:42,940
 - Hello. That's your leg over there. - It is?

392
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:45,940
 - Well, whose arm is this? - Uh, now wait. Now wait.

393
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:49,940
 - Isn't anybody going to ask it a call? - Now, Henry, let's take one leg at a time.

394
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:53,940
 - Hello. - Hello. Is that you, Mary?

395
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:56,940
 - Yes, is that you, Kermit? - Yes. Hello.

396
00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:01,940
 - Hello. My, it was nice of you to phone. - Mary, I have some news for you.

397
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:04,940
 - You have? I am used for you too, Kermit. - You have?

398
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,300
 You have? What is it?

399
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,580
 You tell me yours.

400
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:09,060
 No, you tell me yours.

401
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,380
 No, you do.

402
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,060
 Well...

403
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:13,900
 Well, first of all, I made something wonderful for you to eat tonight.

404
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:18,820
 You did? That's wonderful because, frankly, Mary, I am getting a little tired of macaroons.

405
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:20,820
 Oh. Oh, my goodness.

406
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:23,460
 And not that I'm not crazy about your macaroons, Mary.

407
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,940
 But that's all right, Kermitty, goodbye.

408
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:25,540
 You're leaving?

409
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:27,940
 Yes, I have to go, and that is... yes.

410
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:29,820
 But, Mary, I haven't told you my new.

411
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:31,060
 Well, could you tell me quickly?

412
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:33,940
 Sure. We're going to a hockey game tonight.

413
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,140
 For hockey games.

414
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:37,040
 Yeah, I'm get to, soldie the ticket.

415
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,140
 I'm at a hockey game on New Year's Eve.

416
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:41,140
 Yeah, isn't that swell?

417
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:42,640
 And Mary?

418
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,140
 Mary, are you there?

419
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:47,140
 Yes, but my goodness, I was looking forward to...

420
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:48,140
 To...

421
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:49,140
 To what?

422
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:52,140
 Kermit, if you don't know, I'm certain I'm going to tell you and goodbye.

423
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:54,140
 Mary, what's all the commotion on here?

424
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:56,140
 Either I think you better just hate both.

425
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:57,140
 What?

426
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:59,140
 You're all the same, every one of you.

427
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:01,140
 Mary, what did I do now?

428
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:03,140
 Well, then I think I've got that horse lick, Father.

429
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:04,800
 Henry, you can forget about that horse.

430
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,640
 Forget about it.

431
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,140
 I can see your heart isn't in it, son.

432
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:08,440
 Now, where are those hockey tickets?

433
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,340
 I haven't got them.

434
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:09,840
 Forget them.

435
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,740
 When I say I'm going to take you to a hockey game, Henry,

436
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:12,740
 then that's what I'm going to do.

437
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:13,540
 But, Bobby--

438
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:15,840
 I'm not going to palm off a masquerade on you instead.

439
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,040
 But, Father, I can't get the hockey tickets.

440
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,640
 I sold them to Kermit.

441
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,240
 What?

442
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,440
 I see.

443
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,840
 Excuse me, Henry.

444
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,940
 Father, you mean you're going to change your mind again?

445
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:27,740
 Alice?

446
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,140
 I'm in the kitchen, Sam.

447
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:30,140
 Well, look.

448
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:32,440
 Would you like one of Mary's macaroons, dear?

449
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:35,180
 No thank you. Alice I've been thinking it over.

450
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,200
 Thinking what over?

451
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,700
 And while I made a promise to Henry, I also made a promise to you.

452
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:40,560
 Yes but...

453
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,300
 Henry's young. He'll get over it.

454
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,540
 What as you? What as you?

455
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,340
 Whereas I fought.

456
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:50,580
 Alice would you explain to Henry that you insist I go to the masquerade with you?

457
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,000
 But dear I can't.

458
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:52,880
 You can't what?

459
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,480
 I can't insist now.

460
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,380
 What do you mean?

461
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:58,040
 Elizabeth just phoned me and I'm going with someone else.

462
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:02,020
 What? Alice do you mean to say you're going out tonight with some other man?

463
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:03,420
 Well, who is he?

464
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:05,320
 Frankly, dear, I don't know.

465
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,120
 Elizabeth said it would be a surprise.

466
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,520
 That's pretty unbelievable.

467
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,320
 My fan, you're jealous.

468
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,620
 Tell us, I am not.

469
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:14,120
 Now, dear, you haven't a thing to worry about.

470
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,020
 Alice, you're to call the whole thing off immediately.

471
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,620
 But, Sam, I've given my word.

472
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:18,120
 Alice?

473
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,520
 And dear, I'm sure that once I've made a promise,

474
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,020
 you wouldn't want me to break it off.

475
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:24,520
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

476
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:34,920
 Henry, everything's all settled. You and I are going to that masquerade as a horse.

477
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,820
 But, Father, I thought you didn't want to.

478
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:39,320
 Only I'm going as the front end, you understand.

479
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:43,820
 But I can keep an eye on what I can watch, what I can see, what's going on.

480
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:46,220
 But, Gee, whiz, Father, you're too late.

481
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:46,720
 What, sir?

482
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,220
 Look, I just got the hockey ticket back from Kermit.

483
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:51,020
 The hockey ticket?

484
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:53,420
 Sure. I traded him something for them.

485
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:55,520
 Kermit, Hannegan, you certainly have your nerves.

486
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,720
 But, Mary, you said you wanted us to be secluded.

487
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,620
 I never think so and so had no my life.

488
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:02,020
 But Mary, you can be the front end.

489
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:03,120
 Just a minute.

 What's going on here?

492
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:06,980
 I can tell you, Father.

493
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:09,820
 Mr. Aldrich, would you try to explain something to Mary for me?

494
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:10,740
 - Herman, I'm not dumb.

495
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:12,380
 I don't need anything explained to me.

496
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:13,220
 - Mr. Aldrich.

497
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:14,220
 - I think I'll just stay out of there.

498
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:16,380
 - But Mr. Aldrich, you're better at managing women

499
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:17,220
 than I am.

500
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,700
 - Who I?

 How do you like my costume?

 - Come on, I'll be very nice.

00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:16,980
 Frankly, terrible.

521
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,580
 Then you know how I feel.

522
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:22,780
 The only thing is there's only about ten minutes left in 1948.

523
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:23,780
 Yes.

524
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:28,180
 Wouldn't it be a better omen if you saw the new year in with a smile?

525
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:29,780
 Perhaps you're right.

526
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:30,980
 Father, you want to sit up?

527
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:32,580
 No, I'm going to try.

528
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:35,380
 Is a darn good hockey game, wasn't it, Father?

529
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:36,980
 Yes, son, it was.

530
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:38,980
 Until they carried me out.

531
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:42,580
 Gee, that player who got thrown into your lap.

532
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:44,380
 I think it did him good.

533
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:45,580
 Well, I'm glad to hear it.

534
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:51,180
 Sure, he just dusted himself off and jumped back on the ice and scored the winning goal.

535
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:54,980
 Good for him. Now please hand me that steak again.

536
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:58,980
 Sure. And how's your eye coming along, father?

537
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:02,980
 She was, there's the phone. You stay right where you are, father, old-timer.

538
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:04,580
 Aren't you in me?

539
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:05,580
 Hello?

540
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:07,380
 Hello, Henry. How was the hockey game?

541
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:11,580
 Boy, mother, it was the best one I ever went to. How's the masquerade?

542
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,980
 Just lovely, dear.

543
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:14,580
 Did you win the grand prize?

544
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:18,740
 No dear Homer upset the whole apple cart when he discovered his beard was made of

545
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:26,020
 spun sugar. What happened? He ate it. And Henry may at least speak to your father.

546
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:30,540
 Father, mother wants you on the phone. Mother, who did win the prize? Mary and

547
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:35,100
 permit everyone thought they made a wonderful horse. Is that your mother Henry?

548
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:40,260
 Sure father. You see who's at the door son. Sure father. Hello Alice. Sam I just

549
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:43,380
 wanted to be the first one to say happy new year to you.

550
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:45,980
 Well, I thank you, Alice, and the same to you.

551
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:47,540
 Are you having a good time?

552
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:50,460
 Frankly, they're not as good a time as if you were here.

553
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:52,060
 Alice, I'm going to make everything up to you.

554
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:54,500
 I haven't forgotten the promise, I made you.

555
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:57,780
 Do you really mean we'll go out someplace every Saturday

556
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,060
 night for the whole year?

557
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:00,460
 Absolutely.

558
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:04,980
 Well, my goodness, I'm certainly looking forward to 1949.

559
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:05,620
 Father!

560
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:06,380
 Father!

561
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:07,620
 Oh, just a minute, Alice.

562
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,180
 Father, guess who was at the door?

563
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:09,660
 Who?

564
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:13,460
 The man from the hockey rink and he wanted to know how your black eye was.

565
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:13,960
 Yes.

566
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:17,660
 And just to show there's no heart feelings, look what he gave us.

567
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:20,360
 A season pass to all the hockey games.

568
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:20,960
 What's that?

569
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,460
 Every Saturday night for the whole year.

570
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:24,360
 [laughter]

571
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,660
 Every Saturday.

572
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:27,260
 Sam, it's midnight.

573
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:27,860
 But...

574
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:29,460
 Happy New Year, Sam.

575
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:31,460
 Happy New Year, Father.

576
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:32,460
 Yes.

577
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:33,860
 Well...

578
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:35,860
 Happy New Year!

579
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:59,860
 [Music]

580
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:05,360
 Listen again next week, same time, same station, for another sparkling half hour with your favorite youngster.

581
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:11,360

582
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:18,360
