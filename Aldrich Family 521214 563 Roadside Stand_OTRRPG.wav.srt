1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,240
 Henry! Henry, all great!

2
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,000
 Coming, mother!

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,800
 [applause]

4
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:20,000
 Yes, it's the Orange Family, as transcribed, written by Clifford Goldsmith.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 [Music]

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 Adults think they have problems.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 But a teenager also has his share of them.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 And if he's a typical American boy like Henry Aldridge,

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 it seems there's no end of problems.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 One bumps right smack into another.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,600
 And the search for solutions is always a desperate one.

12
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,500
 The scene opens in the all-rich kitchen, and the time is afternoon.

13
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,500
 Now listen Homer, let me squeeze the next lemon.

14
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,500
 Why don't you be getting the sugar out Henry?

15
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:00,500
 I already got it.

16
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,500
 Come on, it's my turn to run to juicers.

17
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:03,500
 Okay.

18
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,500
 Henry!

19
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,500
 Yes Mother?

20
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,500
 Where are you?

21
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,500
 Um, well I hope and I are just sort of here in the kitchen.

22
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:13,500
 I thought you promised Homer's father you'd wash his dog.

23
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,500
 We are washing it Mother.

24
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,500
 In the kitchen?

25
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,200
 No, Mrs. Aldrich, smoothie stayed outside for the time being.

26
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,840
 Sure, we just came in for a drink of water.

27
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,840
 So you're making lemonade?

28
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,340
 Well, Mother, you know how warm you get chasing a dog.

29
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:29,180
 No, I'm afraid I don't.

30
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:32,940
 And you'd better finish that dog before Will Brown comes back.

31
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:36,520
 Oh, he's over fixing our furnace, Mrs. Aldrich, with Henry's father.

32
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,520
 We got all the time in the world.

33
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,520
 Well, Sam, I must say that I am a little warm.

34
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,920
 Oh, boy, Homer, is that your father already?

35
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,920
 We've got a hurry, Henry.

36
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,920
 Come on out in the kitchen, Will.

37
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,920
 Let's see what we can find.

38
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,920
 That sounds good to me.

39
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,920
 I sure am thirsty.

40
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:52,920
 Hello, Father.

41
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,920
 Hello, boys. You all finished?

42
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,920
 That's just what we were going to ask you.

43
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,920
 Well, I guess I owe you, boys.

44
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,920
 35 cents, huh?

45
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,920
 35 cents, Father?

46
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,920
 Yeah, we're washing the dog.

47
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,920
 Here you are.

48
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,920
 Well, um, well, you really don't have to pay us right now, Mr. Brown.

49
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,920
 Oh, here. Take it.

50
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,920
 How did Smoothie look?

51
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,920
 Boy, she certainly was a sight.

52
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:11,920
 Yeah, all say she was.

53
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,920
 Where is she?

54
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:13,920
 Hopping back.

55
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,920
 Hop 'n' back.

56
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:15,920
 Here, Smoothey!

57
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,280
 And Father, wouldn't you like some sweat lemonade first?

58
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,280
 Lemonade?

59
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,280
 Here, you can have my glass, Mr. Brown.

60
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,280
 And here, Father, you take Homer's glass.

61
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,800
 I don't want to deprive you, boys.

62
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,360
 Oh, gosh, Father, it's no deprivacy at all.

63
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,560
 Well, thank you.

64
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,760
 Ah.

65
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,760
 Yeah, that certainly hits the spot, boys.

66
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,560
 Thanks a lot.

67
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,680
 You're welcome, Father.

68
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,920
 Now I'll go out and back and take a look at Smoothey.

69
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,080
 Well, first, won't you have another glass of lemonade?

70
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,600
 Oh, I'd like to see Smoothey.

71
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,400
 Oh, come on, Will.

72
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,920
 That's going to the living room and relax.

73
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:42,480
 I'm tired.

74
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,520
 Well, maybe you're right, Sam.

75
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,520
 They come to think of it, I'm pretty tired myself.

76
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,120
 I'd oblige for the lemonade, boys.

77
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,320
 Oh, that's all right, father. That's the least we could have done for you.

78
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,520
 Henry, let's hurry up and finish up on smoothie.

79
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,120
 Sure.

80
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,120
 As soon as we make a little lemonade for ourselves.

81
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,320
 Hey, boy, this is some juicer.

82
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,720
 With this 35 cents, Henry, how much do we have?

83
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,920
 $12.

84
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,120
 Boy.

85
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,320
 All we need is $3 more and we'll have enough for a down payment on that car we saw.

86
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,320
 The only trouble is Homer, how are we going to get three more dollars?

87
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,320
 Well, why don't we go into business?

88
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,520
 What kind of business?

89
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,820
 Well, something we've had experience in.

90
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,720
 Like washing dogs.

91
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,920
 You mean for people?

92
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:19,720
 Sure.

93
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,520
 They're the only ones who have money.

94
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:24,120
 Well, we're making out something there.

95
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,620
 You're John Wright.

96
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:28,920
 It's taking a lot longer to do smoothie than I thought it would.

97
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,920
 I think we ought to charge 50 cents.

98
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,520
 Oh boy, we're all of Lemmon's homework.

99
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,320
 Oh man, I know what we do have any ice-box.

100
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:35,820
 What?

101
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,320
 And I'd like to try it on the squeezer too.

102
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,320
 It's a pineapple.

103
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:38,820
 She was--

104
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,320
 I sure like pineapple.

105
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,620
 It's already got the bottom cut off.

106
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,220
 Stand back now while I put it on here.

107
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:44,220
 Hang on, Henry.

108
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:49,020
 Look, Homer, look what it does to it.

109
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,620
 Boy, will we have some drink.

110
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:53,420
 Only thing is, Henry.

111
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:56,020
 Will we charge the same price to wash your great daines?

112
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,620
 We do a fox terrier?

113
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:00,820
 Naturally, we'll charge different prices for different sizes.

114
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:03,320
 Then for third-breads, we'll have to charge a lot extra.

115
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,520
 Oh, sure.

116
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,820
 They need a more delicate soap.

117
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:09,020
 Homer, do you know what else we ought to squeeze in here?

118
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:10,020
 What?

119
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:10,920
 Look, in the icebox.

120
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,720
 Here's half a can of love.

121
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,080
 Why didn't I think of that before?

122
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:14,920
 - Sure.

123
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,840
 - And step them out of them first though, Henry.

124
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:18,880
 Here we go, Homer.

125
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,400
 Henry, look at what you did.

126
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,440
 Why didn't you jump out of the way?

127
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,000
 The seeds are all over me.

128
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,240
 Though I don't worry about those, Homer.

129
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,640
 Hey, just take a taste of what we've made here.

130
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,200
 Well, how was it?

131
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,200
 Boy, I think we've got something.

132
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,160
 And Gee was, I'll say we have.

133
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,920
 How about patting it?

134
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,320
 Could we pat anything like this?

135
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,320
 Well sure, why not?

136
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,480
 It's our own personal formula.

137
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:50,600
 Every time anybody wants a glass, well they send us so much money.

138
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,920
 Whether they like it or not?

139
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,920
 Sure.

140
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,680
 How would they know where we live?

141
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,960
 We'll send them our address.

142
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,400
 Or maybe we could have our own roadside stand.

143
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,600
 Let's have a little more of that punch, Henry.

144
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,520
 Yeah, how about a roadside stand?

145
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,240
 In December, Henry?

146
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,800
 Come on, man.

147
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,560
 I thought you said you watched smoothie.

148
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,800
 Well, we did get her half-wiseed father.

149
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,800
 Well, what's she supposed to do? Finish the job herself?

150
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,800
 Well, we didn't think we ought to rush her into it, Mr. Brown.

151
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,800
 She was so warm by the time we caught her, we thought she ought to cool off first.

152
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,800
 Well, I'll just take back that 35 cents until she does cool off.

153
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,800
 Well...

154
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,800
 Homer? Yes, father.

155
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:31,800
 The real reason we haven't finished smoothie is because we had to work out this special drink.

156
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,800
 For smoothie?

157
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,800
 Gosh, no father, for our roadside stand.

158
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,800
 What roadside stand?

159
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,800
 Didn't you know so we can get enough money to make a down payment on our car?

160
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,800
 Well, you just forget your roadside stand until next summer.

161
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,800
 Yeah, but father, if we don't get a car, Henry and I will have to walk wherever we go.

162
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,800
 Good. Suppose you start walking toward that dog.

163
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,800
 Yes, father.

164
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,800
 Homer, what happened to your face?

165
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,800
 Cantaloupe seeds.

166
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,800
 I'll go with you, Homer and Holder. Why do you wash?

167
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,800
 I bet a holler, Henry. She's pretty ticklish.

168
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:03,800
 Well, what I'm going to do if the boys run a roadside stand?

169
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:08,900
 I don't know but instinct tells me no personally. I like that initiative. They ought to be encouraged

170
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:12,640
 Only I don't think the boys need a car and I'm the winner anyhow don't be absurd

171
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:18,520
 Well, they'll never actually earn enough to get a car. Oh, but why take a chance? Let's have some more of this lemonade here. Well

172
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:24,240
 Well, we'll both have a lot less trouble on our hands if we let them try their luck businessmen

173
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,960
 And we'll have still less if we don't here's to us

174
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,960
 It's to us.

175
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,960
 [Laughing]

176
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,960
 Ooh, this tree.

177
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,960
 It's okay, Sam.

178
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,960
 Let the boys have their roadside stand.

179
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,960
 They won't get any car.

180
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:52,960
 [Music]

181
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,960
 Refreshments, mister.

182
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,960
 Delicious punch.

183
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,960
 Ice cold, homemade punch.

184
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:02,960
 Boy, there were a lot of people in that car too.

185
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,960
 I mean, I'm getting colder by the minute.

186
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,960
 Well, here, have another glass of punch.

187
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,960
 Could we warm it up a little first?

188
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,960
 Hey, Homer, maybe that's the trouble.

189
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,960
 What is?

190
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,960
 Maybe we should be featuring our hot dogs.

191
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,960
 Sure, that's an idea.

192
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,960
 Boy, if everybody is as cold as I am,

193
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,960
 I'll try it.

194
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,960
 Get your hot dogs here, red hot hot dogs, hot dogs with mustard,

195
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,960
 Red Hot Mustard.

196
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:31,460
 Maybe they've got a heater in their car.

197
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:35,460
 Hey, here comes another one.

198
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,460
 Get your hot dog here!

199
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:39,460
 Red Hot Hot Dog here!

200
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,460
 Red Hot Dog here!

201
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:44,960
 She wouldn't even stop.

202
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,960
 What time do you think it is, Henry?

203
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,460
 Oh, it isn't so late.

204
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:50,960
 Seems like an awful long time since the sun went down.

205
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,460
 I'm cold.

206
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:55,760
 She was home where we can't quit after investing all our money in this stop.

207
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,960
 We got nearly $4 tied up here.

208
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,760
 Henry, it stands to reason.

209
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:03,360
 If we've only sold 25 cents worth since 3 this afternoon,

210
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,760
 we're never going to sell $4 worth this late.

211
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,960
 But we're paying rent to the guy that owns this stand.

212
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,760
 We've got to get full use out of it.

213
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,760
 Now I know why we got it so cheap.

214
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:14,260
 And here comes a car.

215
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:17,260
 Refreshments, mister, hot dogs.

216
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:19,260
 Peanut butter sandwiches.

217
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,880
 Henry, do you suppose our location has anything to do with it?

218
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,060
 Our location?

219
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:28,460
 Well, maybe it isn't good to be on a curve that's on the side of a hill.

220
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:32,460
 People get hungry on curves.

221
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:35,460
 Well, a fellow that owns this place couldn't even sell gas.

222
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:37,560
 Here comes another car.

223
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,560
 I'll stop it.

224
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:43,960
 Hey, Mr. Refreshments, sandwiches, hot dogs for a cold day.

225
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,460
 Henry, you stopping? You stopping?

226
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:46,960
 Hey, buddy.

227
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,960
 Yes, sir.

228
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,960
 It's all good.

229
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,960
 Oil?

230
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,840
 (audience laughing)

231
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,760
 And I'm sorry, but we don't carry oil.

232
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,360
 - What you got those signs up for?

233
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,400
 - Well, those are from another guy.

234
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,400
 He went throat.

235
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,240
 - Which is all you're gonna do all right too.

236
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,080
 - Thanks.

237
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:00,920
 (audience laughing)

238
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,520
 How about a delicious drink?

239
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,720
 - Yeah, that sounds good.

240
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,800
 Nice hot cup of coffee show would warm me up.

241
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,240
 - We haven't got coffee.

242
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,080
 - What did you got?

243
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,320
 - Ice cold punch.

244
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,600
 - Ice cold punch.

245
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,880
 - And a night like this.

246
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,360
 - He's got pineapple and cantaloupe and strawberries.

247
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,200
 And...

248
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,120
 - He was, he didn't even say goodbye.

249
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,820
 (audience laughing)

250
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:21,820
 Anyhow, we stopped.

251
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,100
 That's encouraging.

252
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,620
 Let's drink a little more punch.

253
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:25,980
 You drink it, I don't want any more.

254
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,420
 I'm all goose pimples.

255
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:30,060
 We gotta eat something, Homer, to keep up your strength.

256
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,700
 Henry, maybe we shouldn't have told our folks

257
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:34,120
 who wouldn't be home for dinner tonight.

258
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,300
 Homer, somebody stop.

259
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,020
 Hey, you got any hot dogs?

260
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,340
 Yes, sir.

261
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:39,980
 Let's have five to take out of the car.

262
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:40,800
 Yes, sir.

263
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,640
 Five.

264
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,540
 Homer, where'd you go?

265
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,380
 Homer?

266
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:44,220
 Yeah, what do you have, Henry?

267
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,060
 Make it five.

268
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:45,900
 Yes, sir.

269
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:46,740
 Coming up.

270
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:47,580
 Five what?

271
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,340
 Hot dogs!

272
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:52,140
 Didn't I tell you Homer? It was just a case of sticking to it.

273
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,820
 Uh, will it take very long, Mac?

274
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,580
 No, sir, you'll have 'em right away!

275
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:57,180
 Homer, which bag are they in?

276
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,620
 Haven't you got 'em on the fire?

277
00:09:58,620 --> 00:09:59,980
 We ate all we cook.

278
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:03,740
 If I didn't want to take any time at all, sir, all we have to do is build a fire.

279
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:04,940
 Build a fire?

280
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:06,620
 Come on, we'll go out and find some kindling.

281
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,220
 Never mind, Mac.

282
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,740
 Can't you wait?

283
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,660
 I've got to make the coast by Wednesday.

284
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:13,820
 I know, but wait!

285
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:16,700
 How about some peanut butter sandwiches?

286
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,700
 There are some delicious new pucks.

287
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:22,200
 We're farther away from getting our car than we ever were.

288
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,700
 Well, all I can say, Homer, is I don't like your talkies,

289
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,200
 though what we're doing is a mistake.

290
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,200
 Well, I can tell you, Henry, is how things look to me.

291
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,200
 All right, then, all right.

292
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,700
 Now, I suppose you want to quit.

293
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,200
 Just when people are beginning to stop.

294
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,200
 Sure.

295
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,200
 I'm going home.

296
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,200
 And I'm taking my share of the hot dogs, too.

297
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,200
 Okay, Homer, I expected it all the time.

298
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,700
 What's that?

299
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:42,200
 It's a car.

300
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,200
 Is the customer?

301
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,700
 Hello there.

302
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,200
 What can we do for you?

303
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,200
 How far is it to the next town?

304
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,200
 Center goes in back of you.

305
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:54,700
 Yeah, I know. We just came from there. Isn't a room left in town?

306
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:58,500
 Joseph, let's drive on. I don't want talking to strange men on the road.

307
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,700
 Oh, we're not men.

308
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:04,700
 Oh, my goodness. Joseph, he's drawing a gun.

309
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,700
 This isn't a gun, it's a hot dog.

310
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,700
 Billy, be yourself.

311
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:11,300
 You boys don't have any cabins here, do you?

312
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,100
 No, sir.

313
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,900
 Well, I'm not going any further tonight.

314
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,900
 Would you like to sleep here in our roadstand?

315
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:19,160
 Does it have heat and running water?

316
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,400
 Well, no, not exactly.

317
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,740
 Do you know of any place we could get a room?

318
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:25,440
 I'd pay anything in reason.

319
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,800
 Hey?

320
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,340
 You would have to be a hotel?

321
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:31,800
 Any place at all, just so long as it has some beds.

322
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:35,080
 Well, of course you could stay at my house.

323
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:35,960
 We could?

324
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,960
 They could, Henry?

325
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,880
 Are there just the two of you?

326
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,320
 Well, there's my husband here.

327
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:44,320
 And our two grandchildren are sleeping in the back seat.

328
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,320
 Well, how much do you charge a knife?

329
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,320
 Well...

330
00:11:49,320 --> 00:12:05,320
 Thomas, you were asleep yet.

331
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,320
 What is it, Sam?

332
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,320
 It's Henry, and...

333
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,320
 No, dear, I've been listening for him.

334
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,320
 Well, he'll be along.

335
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:17,700
 Dear, I'm worried to death. They're out there on that main highway all alone, and it's cold.

336
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,860
 They'll take care of themselves, all right?

337
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:22,260
 They didn't even come home for dinner.

338
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:25,860
 They probably ate their own hot dogs and enjoyed them.

339
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,060
 Listen, Sam.

340
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:31,300
 Isn't that a car stopping in front of the house?

341
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,700
 Probably somebody bringing Henry home.

342
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:42,140
 It may be my imagination, but it sounds as if there were five or six getting out of that car.

343
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:45,140
 Now, Alice, there aren't five or six getting out of it.

344
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:49,140
 Henry and Homer are probably unloading the dishes he borrowed.

345
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:52,140
 Was that the front door I just heard?

346
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:55,140
 I hope so. Either that or the furnace exploding.

347
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:57,140
 Henry!

348
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:59,140
 Henry!

349
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:00,140
 What is it, Father?

350
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:02,140
 Be sure to lock the door, dear.

351
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:03,140
 I have locked it.

352
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:05,140
 And Father, can I ask you something?

353
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:07,540
 Not tonight, Henry. It's time to go to bed.

354
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:09,140
 But it won't take more than a second.

355
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:10,640
 How was business, son?

356
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,240
 Well, not very good at the beginning,

357
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,740
 but let me tell you how we ended up.

358
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:16,140
 I'm glad you did so well, but not tonight.

359
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:17,540
 Hey, but, Mother, just let me tell you--

360
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:20,140
 Henry, your father and I both want to get to sleep.

361
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:22,140
 You don't think he'd be even slightly interested?

362
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:23,440
 Please close the door.

363
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,140
 Yes, Father, but I just want to say that business is very good.

364
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:28,440
 Don't get up too early, dear.

365
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,640
 No, Mother.

366
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,240
 Mr.

367
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,340
 Oh, Mr. Are you down there?

368
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:36,080
 How about these suitcases, young man?

369
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,040
 Just a minute, I'll be right down.

370
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,880
 My folks seem to have gone to bed.

371
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,540
 What time do you serve breakfast?

372
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:43,840
 Oh, gee whiz.

373
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,480
 Just come down any time you like.

374
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,980
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

375
00:13:47,980 --> 00:14:00,160
 Father.

376
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:00,960
 Father?

377
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,360
 I'm eating breakfast.

378
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,080
 Homer, what are you doing up so early?

379
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,040
 Father, I've been thinking about something all night.

380
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,040
 I've got an idea.

381
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,400
 Road science 10 business?

382
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,600
 Well, that's sort of what I want to talk to you Bob.

383
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,560
 Father, why don't we take in rumors?

384
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,920
 Rumors?

385
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,640
 Homer, what would we do with rumors?

386
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,800
 Let them sleep.

387
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,040
 There's big money in it.

388
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:18,880
 There it is?

389
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,720
 Sure.

390
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,680
 Henry Olives made $5 last night.

391
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,400
 He took home four guests.

392
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,240
 He did.

393
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,840
 And now he's going to charge them $0.25 each for breakfast.

394
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,280
 Do his folks know about it?

395
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,360
 Well, not yet, I don't think.

396
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:36,360
 The Homer you told me to say that Sam Aldridge is going to wake up this morning and find four strange people in his house.

397
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:40,360
 Sure! Won't he be surprised to get all that money?

398
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:43,860
 Oh, this is too good to miss.

399
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,860
 Hey, Homer! Where are you, Henry?

400
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:48,860
 On the front porch! Come on up the town with me!

401
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:49,860
 Four four!

402
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:53,860
 Well, before my folks get up, I've got to get some oranges, eggs, and pabble 'em!

403
00:14:53,860 --> 00:15:03,860
 [applause]

404
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:10,860
 [applause]

405
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:13,860
 Well now getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldrich.

406
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:18,860
 Henry and his friend Homer have gone into the roadside stand business.

407
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:22,860
 On their first night at work a party of four came along looking for rooms

408
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:28,860
 And Henry, the complete businessman, took them to his house, only to find his parents had retired.

409
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:32,860
 The scene opens in the all-rich dining room, the time, the next morning.

410
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:34,860
 Sam! Sam!

411
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,860
 I'm all ready for breakfast, Alice.

412
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:37,860
 Is Henry up?

413
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:39,860
 Well, I thought he was down here. He isn't in his room.

414
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:42,860
 I certainly hope he hasn't gone back to his road stand.

415
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:46,860
 Now, Alice, stop worrying. There's nothing wrong with Henry having spunk enough to go out and try to earn a little money.

416
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:47,860
 Well, I know.

417
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:50,860
 Break me, I like to see it, and we ought to do everything we can to encourage it.

418
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:52,780
 Perhaps you're right, Sam.

419
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:55,180
 What's that car doing out in front?

420
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:56,180
 What car?

421
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:58,380
 The one with the Illinois license on it.

422
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:01,860
 Oh, apparently the kiln is next door having guests.

423
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:04,860
 I love they park in front of their own house.

424
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:08,580
 When I sit down and drink your orange juice, I'll go out and get your eggs started.

425
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:09,580
 Where's my paper?

426
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:10,980
 Right there on the table.

427
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:11,980
 Oh, yes.

428
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:12,980
 Yes.

429
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:15,860
 Sam, listen, isn't that Henry walking around upstairs?

430
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:16,860
 It couldn't be.

431
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,700
 Well, it certainly can't be Mary.

432
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:19,700
 She's away, dear.

433
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:22,500
 Then you don't hear any footsteps your imagination.

434
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,740
 I heard Henry come down half an hour ago.

435
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:28,580
 And Sam, where do you suppose all those things on the kitchen table came from?

436
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:29,300
 What thing?

437
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:32,500
 A dozen oranges, two dozen eggs, and a box of pablum.

438
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,380
 Didn't you order them from the store?

439
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:36,900
 Pablum, of course I didn't.

440
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:39,380
 Well, the grocer probably made a mistake.

441
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:42,180
 Oh, well, yeah.

442
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:46,180
 There's an embarrassing situation some fellow walked into.

443
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:47,620
 Did you read about it in the paper?

444
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:48,900
 No, what is it?

445
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:52,900
 He lives in one of those real estate developments where all the houses look alike.

446
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:57,900
 He came home the other night and went to bed and when he got up the next morning he found he had slept in the wrong house.

447
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:01,900
 Imagine a thing like that.

448
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:05,900
 Not only that, he slept in the wrong pajamas.

449
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,900
 And not only that.

450
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:11,900
 Hear your eggs and coffee.

451
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,900
 Dear, do you want anything more? I'll be out in the kitchen.

452
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:14,900
 Thank you, dear.

453
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:20,900
 Ah, good morning. Is this the dining room in here?

454
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,900
 [Laughter]

455
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,900
 I beg your pardon?

456
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:25,900
 What state are you from?

457
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:26,900
 What state?

458
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,900
 No, I'm from Illinois.

459
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:29,900
 Name is Jackson.

460
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,900
 Say, how are the meals here?

461
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:32,900
 [Laughter]

462
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,900
 Well, I've never heard any complaints.

463
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:38,900
 I hope they're better than the beds, that's for sure.

464
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,900
 How did you sleep last night?

465
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:45,900
 Fairly well. You, uh, you, uh, know someone here at this house?

466
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,900
 No, not a soul. We're total strangers here.

467
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:51,900
 We, how many of you are there?

468
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:54,900
 I'm a wife and myself and two grandchildren.

469
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,900
 We were going to bring their aunt Molly too,

470
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,900
 but she got sick at the last minute.

471
00:17:58,900 --> 00:17:59,900
 It's her old trouble.

472
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:02,900
 The way that woman's ankles swell up.

473
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:03,900
 I'm sorry to hear it.

474
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,900
 Say, how do you get service around here?

475
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:09,900
 If there's one thing I don't like to do, it's weight.

476
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,900
 Sam, it is not necessary,

477
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,900
 but you could tap on a glass when you want something.

478
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:17,900
 something all you have to do with good morning ma'am

479
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:21,020
 morning one order of buckwheat cakes

480
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:26,420
 with syrup and send up two soft boiled eggs to my wife

481
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:29,140
 Sam unless this gentleman is familiar no I

482
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:33,980
 very nice I'm sure the children are coming down later

483
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:37,140
 dear if you'll excuse me I'll go back to the kitchen

484
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:40,500
 not a bad look at that's for sure

485
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,500
 Well thank you I think so too.

486
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:46,500
 Joseph are you downstairs?

487
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,500
 What do you want Millie?

488
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,500
 Come here a minute!

489
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,500
 Okay!

490
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:54,500
 If anybody tries to take my place here tell them it's took will you?

491
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,500
 Why don't you just tip your chair up?

492
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,500
 Good idea.

493
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,500
 When you're through with that newspaper save it for me will you?

494
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,500
 Yes I will.

495
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,500
 Alice!

496
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,500
 Alice!

497
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,500
 Yes dear.

498
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,500
 Alice are we in the right house?

499
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,500
 Sam who is that?

500
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,500
 Who is that man?

501
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,500
 Where did you meet him?

502
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,500
 I don't know any more about him than you do.

503
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,500
 Personally, I'd say the fellow was lost and doesn't know it.

504
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,500
 Where is he now?

505
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,500
 Upstairs.

506
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,500
 He thinks they're a grandchildren up there.

507
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,500
 My goodness.

508
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:25,500
 And you're sitting there letting an insane man wander around the house without doing anything.

509
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,500
 What would you suggest I do?

510
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,500
 Put him out there.

511
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,500
 Oh, that's all there is to it?

512
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,500
 Perhaps he's suffering from amnesia.

513
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,500
 You don't have to speak sharply to him.

514
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,500
 Just leave him gently to the door and tell him to go.

515
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,500
 Only thing you're supposing he resents it.

516
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,060
 Well, if you speak to him carefully, he won't.

517
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:42,760
 Shh, he's coming back downstairs.

518
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,200
 You better step into the kitchen.

519
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,300
 Yes, dear, only be careful, Sam.

520
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,300
 My griddle cakes here, yet?

521
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:50,100
 Well, no, they aren't.

522
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,700
 Frankly, this service here is very poor.

523
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:55,700
 If I were you, I'd take my family

524
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:58,500
 and try to mention house downtown the deep front door

525
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,700
 is right out that way.

526
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,400
 Where can we get a doctor?

527
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,300
 A doctor?

528
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,700
 Yeah, for the grandchildren.

529
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,300
 Oh, yes, the grandchildren.

530
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:08,300
 Hey, where in the heck are my griddle cakes?

531
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:10,060
 Now try to get them for you.

532
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:11,940
 (bell rings)

533
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:13,020
 - Yes?

534
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,340
 Are you calling me?

535
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:15,660
 - One order of griddle cakes,

536
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:18,260
 and when you have time, please call a doctor.

537
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:19,100
 - A doctor?

538
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:21,140
 - That's right, a doctor and griddle cakes.

539
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:23,100
 That's what Mr. Jackson wants,

540
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:25,060
 and we do want to keep him happy.

541
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:26,460
 That's for sure.

542
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:29,040
 (upbeat music)

543
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:39,040
 [Music]

544
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:43,040
 Sam, have you any idea where Henry might have gone when he left the house this morning?

545
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:46,040
 No, and if he knows what's good for him, he won't come home.

546
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,040
 [Laughter]

547
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,040
 Has the doctor come yet?

548
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:53,040
 He's upstairs now. And Mr. Jackson is out on the porch. Why don't you ask him what time he's leaving?

549
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:57,040
 I did. Some time before dinner. Until then, we'll simply have to bear with him.

550
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:01,080
 with them. Sam here comes another car it's stopping right in front of the house.

551
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:06,540
 If Henry has sent any more people here. Oh it's only Will Brown. If you ask for

552
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:10,120
 me I don't want to see him. We'll never hear the end of this. Good morning to the

553
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:13,680
 owners who live here. Yes sir only I don't know whether they have any more

554
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:22,640
 rooms or not. Open up Sam I know you're in there. Oh hello Sam. Alice. Just

555
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,320
 But I come over and see how business is.

556
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,760
 - Our business is fine, thank you.

557
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,480
 - Might a nice place you've got.

558
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,640
 It's all right for a visit,

559
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,520
 but I wouldn't care to live here.

560
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,640
 - Now look here, Will.

561
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,640
 - Where do I register?

562
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,840
 - Will, have you seen Henry or Homer?

563
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,440
 - Not for the last hour.

564
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,960
 - What were they doing when you did see them?

565
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,840
 - Talking about going down to railroad station

566
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,600
 and meeting the incoming trains.

567
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,240
 (audience laughing)

568
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,440
 - What's that?

569
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,520
 (phone ringing)

570
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,440
 - Who can that be?

571
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,760
 - Probably an inquiry about rates.

572
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,880
 - Hello?

573
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,160
 - Yeah?

574
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:56,560
 What? No! Absolutely no!

575
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:00,560
 Yes, that's right. And if Henry's there, please tell him to come home.

576
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:03,660
 Oh, he left some time ago? Very well, goodbye.

577
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:07,760
 Sam, you shouldn't turn any guests down like that.

578
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,260
 Isn't the way to build goodwill?

579
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:12,460
 That wasn't a guest, well, it was Mr. Sparrow. He called about a car.

580
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:15,360
 The boys are trying to buy on time payments.

581
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,060
 They still want to get that old jar?

582
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:18,260
 Oh, no, not anymore.

583
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:21,860
 Mr. Sparrow says that now they're interested in a station wagon.

584
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:23,580
 needed for their business.

585
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:25,500
 Well, why not let them get it, Sam?

586
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,700
 Didn't you say I liked their initiative?

587
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:28,700
 If they ought to be encouraged.

588
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,740
 Listen, well, I've taken quite enough from you.

589
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,420
 Sam, the doctor wants to see you.

590
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:33,260
 You want to see me?

591
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:34,100
 Yes, dear.

592
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:36,260
 Oh, you've got a doctor staying here, too.

593
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:37,900
 Yeah, don't even speak to him.

594
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,660
 You look upset, Al, it's what's the matter.

595
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:40,740
 I am, Sam.

596
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,660
 Do you know what the doctor thinks?

597
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:45,020
 The two grandchildren have the measles.

598
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:45,860
 The measles?

599
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:47,340
 Well, I guess I'll be running along.

600
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:49,100
 Well, do you know what that means?

601
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,940

00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:22,240
 Oh boy, at the regular rates.

609
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,040
 Hey, Henry, what is it you want?

610
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,440
 A credit reference from Mr. Sparrow.

611
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:26,940
 Yes, sir.

612
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:29,240
 Well, anybody's enterprise and you deserve one.

613
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,340
 You mean you'll help us, Mr. Bride?

614
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:31,240
 I'd be glad to.

615
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:31,940
 Well, proud.

616
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:32,740
 Oh boy.

617
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:34,340
 So long, Sam.

618
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:36,440
 What are I'm going to do if we help a boy?

619
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,740
 Wasn't that what you said, Sam?

620
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:42,740
 Sam, the doctor says that what the children have is one of two things.

621
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:44,040
 Something worse than the measles?

622
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:48,120
 No, he says it might just possibly be a strawberry rash.

623
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:50,440
 He's the only trouble is Mrs. Jackson doesn't remember

624
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:53,040
 giving the children any strawberries yesterday.

625
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:55,360
 - Sure, Mother, they had strawberries yesterday.

626
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,200
 - When?

627
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,160
 - In the punch.

628
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,800
 - Well, my goodness, Henry.

629
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:03,440
 - Is there anything you and Homer didn't put in that punch?

630
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,080
 - Well, not like a think of offhand.

631
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,640
 - Oh, then it is a rash,

632
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,040
 and Sam just think we won't be quarantined.

633
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,200
 Oh, the house is our own again.

634
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,480
 - Oh, Mr. Audrey!

635
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,680
 Yes, Mr. Jackson?

636
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:18,880
 I just wanted to say that if we find it is due to strawberries,

637
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,980
 we'll be leaving the first thing in the morning.

638
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:22,480
 You mean you're staying another?

639
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,480
 Yes, mother?

640
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,580
 Come out in the kitchen right this minute.

641
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:27,080
 Y'all be right there.

642
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,280
 Will it take long?

643
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:30,680
 Homer and I are supposed to meet the bus from Chicago.

644
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,580
 Wait a minute.

645
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:37,480
 Mr. Allrich, I want you to know that we're going to tell everybody about your lovely roadhouse.

646
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:40,980
 Well, Mr. Jackson, I'm afraid that all of our rooms for tonight are taken.

647
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,180
 You mean you're all filled up?

648
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,180
 I can't stay.

649
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:46,880
 I can't tell you how disappointed I am, but there's another place in town that I can recommend.

650
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,480
 The rooms are even more comfortable than ours.

651
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,380
 Oh, very easy.

652
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:51,580
 And as soon as you're packed, I'll show you the way over there.

653
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:52,380
 Now if you'll excuse me...

654
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:54,680
 Well, that's very nice of you.

655
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,780
 Operator, get me sent a bill 631.

656
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:57,280
 Yes, please.

657
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,980
 I'll go right up and get packed.

658
00:24:58,980 --> 00:24:59,380
 Glend it.

659
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:00,980
 Henry, I'm gonna have a talk with you.

660
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:04,380
 Hey, are you really going to let Henry buy a station wagon on credit?

661
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:05,780
 Over my dead body.

662
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:08,380
 Hello, is this the Artcraft Sign Company?

663
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:10,680
 I'd like to order a small sign.

664
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,280
 Rush.

665
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:15,880
 It's to read "Rums for Rent, Tourists, Welcome."

666
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,520
 Got that? Fine.

667
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:21,320
 And take it over and stick it on the front lawn of Will Brown's house.

668

 Where?

675
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,480
 Out in the yard.

676
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,840
 Henry, you may not build any cabins in our yard.

677
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,320
 She whiz father with all my ideas for making money,

678
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,520

679
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,480
 On the contrary, Henry, I'm going to let you make some money.

680
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,680
 How, Father?

681
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:02,280
 From now on, for every idea you get,

682
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,800
