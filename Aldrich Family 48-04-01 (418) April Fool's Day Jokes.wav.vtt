 [Music]

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.240
 The month of April may bring its showers, but a little rain has never yet

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.240
 dampened the spirits of a teenage boy.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.240
 And that's the reason it's fun to know a youngster like Henry

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:37.240
 Aldrich, or you can't stay down when a real American boy is bouncing around.

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:41.240
 Now the scene opens at the Aldrich breakfast table.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:45.240
 Oh boy, mother, oh boy, wouldn't you say unlucky mother?

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.240
 Yes, dear, but will you please eat your cereal?

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.240
 Sure, but a G and a war with girls in this town.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.240
 I'm the one she's chosen.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.240
 Henry, may I have the cream, please?

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.520
 - McReeem. - Mother, wouldn't you say I'm sitting pretty?

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.880
 - What's that? - What, I just got more read.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.520
 It's an invitation for dinner at her house tonight.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.480
 - That's fine. Pass the cream. - Henry, you haven't even started your cereal.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.960
 Mother, I don't want to get this letter, must stop.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.760
 She would take a look at the stationery she used.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.200
 - Yes, dear. - Mother, would you like to take a look at it?

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.440
 - I would like to have you pass me the cream. - She was having a...

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.640
 - Oh, boy. - Oh, boy.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:23.480
 What's the matter?

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.480
 I haven't smelled it before.

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:26.980
 (audience laughing)

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:29.020
 Oh, Sam, where are you going?

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.720
 I'm going to take a walk down here and get the cream.

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.620
 Father, why don't you let me pass it to you?

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.200
 You just sit there and keep on smelling that letter.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.860
 Now, Sam, don't tell him to smell when I've asked him to eat.

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:41.800
 Hey, Henry, where are you?

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:42.860
 (audience laughing)

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.400
 Oh, where did you come from?

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.460
 My house, where do you think?

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.740
 She whizzing me how to get that smudge on your face.

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:50.580
 What smudge?

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:51.740
 April Fool.

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.140
 (laughing)

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.040
 - First, if this April's for all stay,

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.940
 how many of the things would have happened?

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:57.940
 - Why so it is?

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:59.140
 - Hey, Mr. Oldrich.

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.940
 - Did you know you had a flat tire out in front?

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.420
 - That's fine.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.220
 - Don't you believe me?

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:06.220
 - Homer, come here a second.

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:07.460
 Do you want to smell something?

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:08.300
 - No.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.140
 - Go ahead, smell it.

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.260
 - Henry, it can't fool me with a thing like that.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.340
 I know it's got pepper on it.

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:14.260
 - On this?

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.380
 Look, it's a letter from Loretta Darlington.

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:17.860
 - Yeah, April Fool.

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:18.860
 - You're crazy.

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.620
 - Henry, I'm sorry, but you will have to use one hand

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.000
 eat with regardless of how wonderful that letter is yes mother

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.540
 what surprised me more than anything why well

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.740
 for three weeks now I've been trying to get up enough cards to ask her to go to

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.180
 the dance Saturday night

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.080

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.660

 Please pass the redder. I never mind just skipping.

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.760
 Oh, here Homer, pass my father to the shelter.

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:56.960
 I don't want the sugar.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.360
 You want the cream, Mr. Olver?

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:59.760
 I've had the cream.

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.560
 Could it be the butter father?

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.160
 It could not. I've forgotten what it is.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.360
 Henry, could I have that piece of toast there?

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.760
 Sure. Homer, give that to me.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.760
 Oh, sure, Mr. Olver, it's here.

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.760
 Oh, Murph, you and Henry are both wanted on the telephone.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.360
 Yes, somebody wants us.

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.760
 Oh, for this? Who was it?

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.360
 Oh, I know is. It's the main office at the school.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.000
 Miss Shea wants to speak with one of you.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.600
 - Miss Shea.

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:24.840
 - Oh boy, Homer.

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:25.840
 - Oh boy.

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.720
 - Henry, hurry, right back.

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.240
 - What could a meteor suppose?

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.960
 - Well frankly, it could be one of two things.

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:33.720
 Here, Henry, you take the receiver.

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.120
 - Oh, here, I can't, I've got my mouth full.

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.880
 - Yeah, I've not, you haven't got a thing in there.

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.360
 - I have two.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.200
 Hello.

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.000
 - Hello, is this Henry Aldrich?

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.600
 - Well, no, not exactly.

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.120
 This is, this is Homer Brown.

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.540
 - Oh, well you do just as well.

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:50.140
 I will.

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:57.140
 Oh.

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:58.940
 You mean we're expelled.

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:59.740
 What's that?

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:03.540
 You want you to help decorate the auditorium for the spring play.

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.340
 Oh boy, he does.

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:06.340
 Does want to.

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.140
 He also wanted me to ask you whether you have all your homework.

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:11.740
 Oh, yes, I've got it right here in my pocket.

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:14.640
 In fact, I've got it right here in my hand now.

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.340
 Well, you might just as well tear it up.

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.340
 tear it up okay

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:20.820
 for a photo look at me

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.820

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.860

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.580

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.580

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.420

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:46.420
 I wonder where Rudd is invitation at dinner tonight.

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:48.420
 She wish you can still go, can't you?

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:50.420
 Sure, naturally, but...

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:52.420
 Homer, we've got to get even with her.

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:53.420
 That's what I say.

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:56.420
 I'm going to call her up and tell her Mr. Bradley.

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:58.420
 Homer, that won't be any good.

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:01.420
 I've got a better idea. I can see the whole thing just as clear as that.

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:03.420
 Well, what is it? What is it?

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:05.420
 You know all those contest Agnes is always entering.

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:06.420
 Yeah.

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:09.420
 When we get to school, we'll tell one of the fellas that tells her she won $100.

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:12.420
 Sure, Henry. Sure. Only let's make it $500.

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:14.420
 Sure, and where we started the rush?

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:16.420
 We'll tell everybody.

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:18.420
 We'll tell everybody in this school.

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:29.420
 Have you heard? Have you heard about Admuth's love?

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:31.420
 Really? You mean to say she won all that money?

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:33.420
 Sure, let's go ask her about it.

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:36.420
 - Have you heard about Admuth's love? - Yeah, and can you beat it? I sit next to her in English.

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:37.420
 Hey, what's this? I hear about Admuth's.

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:39.420
 - Did she really want to contest? - Sure, she sure did.

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:41.420
 A little bit more than that crowd. Let's go tell her.

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:43.820
 I could throw someone all that money or crazy.

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:44.520
 I am not.

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.620
 I know somebody that says she knows somebody that heard it on the radio last night.

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:48.520
 Did you hear it?

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.220
 No, but it's all over the school, though.

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:51.820
 I know where there she is over there.

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:53.520
 Agnes, oh Agnes.

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:54.520
 There you are.

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.320
 We want to tell you something.

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:59.520
 Agnes, did you know you won $1,000 in a contest?

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:00.420
 You're crazy.

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:03.020
 You did too ask anybody in school, Agnes.

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:03.620
 You're crazy.

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:05.620
 I won 2,500.

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:06.920
 You did.

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:07.820
 You did?

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:08.720
 Sure I did.

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:09.920
 Imagine.

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:11.600
 Who are you? What do you know about that?

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.160
 I can hardly believe it.

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:16.640
 Well, I did, Homer Brown, and don't try to make out it couldn't be possible.

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:20.600
 I know, Agnes, but $2,500?

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:22.240
 That much never occurred to me.

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:23.400
 Well, I did.

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:26.240
 And if you don't believe me, you can ask anybody here on the campus.

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:29.400
 Oh, Agnes, we're not trying to make you out of a liar only.

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:30.800
 What kind test was it?

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.040
 How should I know?

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:34.720
 I enter one every time I pick up a new magazine.

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:38.440
 Hello, Agnes. I came over to tell you how proud I am to know you.

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:40.440
 Yes, Agnes, you're really smart.

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:42.440
 You know what I think I'll do, fellas?

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:45.440
 I think I'll take the whole gang over to the soda fountain

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:46.440
 and treat them after school.

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:48.440
 You're really well?

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:49.440
 Sure.

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:50.440
 Homer, could you let me borrow a dollar

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:51.440
 until I get my prize?

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:52.440
 What's that?

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:54.440
 I'll tell you, Agnes, I've got to go,

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:56.440
 or I'll be late to class.

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:57.440
 Yes.

00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:58.440
 Same here as the buy-edge.

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:01.440
 Agnes, are you sure the whole thing isn't an April fool joke?

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:04.440
 Listen, I don't think I know one of those when I see one.

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:06.440
 Didn't I tell you what I did to Henry?

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:07.440
 No.

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:11.040
 I wrote him a note masking to come to Loretta Darlingsons for dinner tonight.

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:13.840
 Really? Sure, I even signed Loretta's name to it.

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:16.440
 Boy, do I love April fool jokes!

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:29.240
 [MUSIC]

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:30.920
 You have some more potatoes, Sam?

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:32.160
 No, thank you, Alice.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.840
 Henry, can I give you anything?

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:37.120
 Mmm, oh, thank you. I'll just sit here and watch you week.

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:41.840
 I'm sorry dear that we're having such a good dinner on the evening you're invited over to Loretta.

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:45.360
 Well that's alright mother, we'll probably have a swelled dinner over there too.

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:49.760
 Oh we did, I did horror and I played the darndest April Fool joke today.

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:51.600
 Oh yes, may I have the biscuits please?

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:52.400
 Here you are.

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:54.800
 It's the best April Fool joke ever for her.

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:58.240
 Henry are you quite sure you shouldn't be starting for Loretta?

00:07:58.240 --> 00:07:59.840
 Mother I've got loads of time.

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:02.880
 Look here's part of her invitation right here she says,

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:05.360
 we won't be eating tonight until 830.

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:06.960
 Be sure to come good and hungry.

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:08.200
 Well.

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:09.960
 Henry, will you please answer that?

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:11.560
 They will you are Henry, all answered.

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:12.720
 I'm expecting a call.

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:15.480
 Mother, what are you and father having for the dirt?

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:17.320
 Hello, this is Sam Otter speaking.

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:19.240
 Mr. Otter, just Mr. Lawson.

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:19.800
 Who?

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:21.520
 I think it's Lawson's father.

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:22.240
 Oh, yes, yes.

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:22.920
 Hello.

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:25.480
 Say, yes, Sam, I don't know if you heard about her or not,

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:28.480
 but the Lawson family seems to have struck oil.

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:29.120
 What's that?

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:30.320
 You mean you haven't heard about it?

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:31.600
 No, not a word.

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:33.800
 Well, don't you listen to the radio?

00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:35.200
 No, not if I can help it.

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:38.800
 Well, Sam, I don't know why we weren't listening last night or so.

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:41.700
 The wind is dead, Agnes won the grand prize.

00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:45.700
 - You don't say so. - Now, Sam won't ask your advice about something.

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:51.700
 Agnes says she's been reading the rules and she's under the impression that the winner must appear in New York for the check.

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:53.700
 Yes, that sounds reasonable.

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:55.500
 - That's exactly what I was thinking.

00:08:55.500 --> 00:09:01.500
 Only Agnes can't possibly make a trip to New York by herself, and Mrs. Wilson, I can't get away.

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:03.300
 And what I was wondering was,

00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:06.800
 uh, can you glupland represent us with a power of attorney?

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:08.900
 Why, when would I have to leave?

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:09.900
 Tomorrow.

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:11.900
 We've set a telegram for instructions,

00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:15.100
 and I imagine they'll say they want us to come right onto the door.

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:17.100
 Tomorrow, the only thing is...

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:18.900
 You're glad to pay your expenses, Sam,

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:21.200
 and make it right with you and the burgundy?

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:24.100
 Why, you pay my expenses, and that's all I ask for.

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:26.700
 Any young lady that's smart enough to go out and win a contest

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:28.300
 deserves everything she can get out of it.

00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:29.000
 Can you move?

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.400
 I think I gotta arrange things.

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:32.600
 As a matter of fact, I'd like a trip to New York.

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:35.680
 That's fine. Fine. Now I won't have to worry.

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:37.520
 No, don't you worry about a thing.

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:39.720
 No, just one more thing before you hang up.

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:45.600
 If you don't mind keeping this confidential because we heard it was 2,500.

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:48.320
 And practice feels it's 35.

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:52.080
 And then we've heard from another source that it might be even more.

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:53.480
 Oh, you don't say so.

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:59.520
 And naturally, until we know just how we really do stand, we don't want to go around talking too much.

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:00.520
 I see your poise.

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:02.920
 You're getting cold.

00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:05.120
 I've got something to tell her you won't believe.

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:07.120
 - What's the matter? - It's the loss that just fo' me.

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:09.520
 - Yeah. - And it looks as though I'll have to leave for New York tomorrow.

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:12.120
 - On this short notice, Sam. - I'm gonna arrange it, I think.

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:14.320
 - How do you want me to tell you what I was going to?

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:15.720
 - No, Henry, not now.

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:18.320
 But Mother was the best April Fool joke you ever heard of.

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:21.920
 - Henry, will you please go back into the dining room while I finish telling your mother something?

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:23.720
 - But Father, I'm not eating any dinner.

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:25.720
 - All right, go in there and look at mine.

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:28.320
 - And any rate, get out of here. - Yes, Father, I'll go.

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:31.320
 Only I thought you'd like to know about the joke over an eye.

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:34.020
 As though an ape of food joke were important at a time like this.

00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:36.320
 Alice, you won't believe it, but here's what happened.

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:54.020
 Well, sir, I may have seen bigger stakes than juicier stakes, but I don't remember where.

00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:56.020
 And we can all thank Agnes for having you.

00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:57.020
 Thank you, Mother.

00:10:57.020 --> 00:11:00.220
 Did you really use up all the operations coupons to get this dinner?

00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:01.260
 Yes, dear.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.740
 Ed, you aren't cutting those slices a little bit thick, are you?

00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:07.580
 Gertrude, are you forgetting what has happened to the Lawson family?

00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:10.060
 Why don't we have any bigger plates in these?

00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:11.740
 Oh, Ed, I'm glad you brought that up.

00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:14.620
 I'm going downtown to my own by a whole new dinner set.

00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:17.260
 Oh, Gertrude, we don't need to spend any money on dishes.

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.820
 Besides, I've got that money all planned out for Agnes.

00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:20.780
 You have, Father?

00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:24.540
 First thing I'm going to do is see whether I can get a priority to get a new car.

00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:25.180
 For me?

00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:28.180
 I guess you aren't old enough to drive a car, you know, you're not.

00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:29.880
 Here, pass the stake to your mother.

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:32.280
 Yeah, but I don't care for any. I can't eat a thing.

00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:34.380
 - What's the matter with you? - Not a thing.

00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:37.180
 Only if I can't get a new dinner set out of this, why?

00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:39.980
 All right, go ahead and get a dinner set.

00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:41.980
 And Father, do you know what I want to get?

00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:44.580
 First of all, a new evening dress.

00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:48.080
 - I know what? - Without any shoulders, boy.

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:51.180
 Agnes, do you realize that I haven't finished telling your father

00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:52.480
 but I'm going to do more?

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:54.680
 Well, folks, I've got that all attended too.

00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:55.880
 You're interrupting your mother.

00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:59.240
 Oh, excuse me, but I just wanted to tell you I resigned my job.

00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:00.360
 You resigned, Ralph?

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:03.440
 Sure, I gave up my job Saturday night at the Havens drugstore.

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:04.640
 And my money?

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:06.520
 Well, you're my sister, aren't you?

00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:08.560
 I'm gonna ask somebody to go to the dance Saturday night.

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:10.360
 How are you gonna pay for the tickets?

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:12.920
 Listen, Agnes, don't be so selfish.

00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:21.880
 - Hey, Ren. - Yes, Bob?

00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:23.000
 I thought you were coming down here

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.200
 so I could have a talk with you.

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:25.840
 Just one more minute, Father.

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:27.280
 What's the matter with the boy?

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:29.280
 Sammy's upstairs changing his tie.

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:31.880
 Again? That's the third time he's changed it this evening.

00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:35.200
 Dear, he's going over to Loretta Dallington in just a few minutes.

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:37.360
 Yes, Father, is there something you want us?

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:37.960
 There is.

00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:41.920
 Henry, your father's just been talking with me and he has a grand idea.

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:45.520
 He has? Yes, dear, and I'm going to let him tell you about it.

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:46.440
 Yes, Father.

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:50.440
 Henry, it's been a long time since you and I have done anything together, hasn't it?

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:53.440
 Well, we had a milkshake together last week.

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:58.440
 Yes, but Henry, how would you like to make a trip to New York with me?

00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:00.440
 To New York, Father?

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:04.440
 Yes, you and I get on the train tomorrow and we'll go on a real binge for the weekend.

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:05.440
 To New York?

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:08.440
 But how about my school tomorrow afternoon?

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:09.440
 I can get you out of it, I think.

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:12.440
 Oh boy, oh boy, and you're asking me whether I want to go?

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:13.440
 I thought you'd like it.

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:16.440
 Oh, wait, how about the rent? I asked her to go to the desk.

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:17.440
 How do you know?

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:20.440
 I don't think she'd want to stand in the way of your going to New York, would she?

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:25.440
 She was after all. She's having me for dinner tonight. So that will make it as though I weren't going to see her at all.

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:26.440
 Yes, Mother.

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:27.440
 Home is on the phone.

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:28.440
 He is?

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:33.440
 Father, will you excuse me while I speak to him, please? And thank you very much for telling me.

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:34.440
 Hello?

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:36.440
 Hey, Henry, when do you hear what happened to me?

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:38.440
 Do you or when do you hear about me?

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:41.440
 Henry, I got a job at the Havens Drugstore for Saturday night.

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:42.440
 You did?

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:45.440
 Sure, the guy that was working there just quit on the moon.

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:46.440
 What?

00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:48.440
 Or where do you hear what happened to me?

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:49.440
 Why?

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:52.440
 I tell you my father and I are going in the yard.

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:53.440
 You are?

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:55.440
 Yeah, we're going on a blowout.

00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:57.440
 Do you know how high the Empire State Building is?

00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:59.440
 Sure, 75 stories.

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:02.440
 You're crazy, more 75 stories.

00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:04.440
 It's around 250.

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:06.440
 And I'm going all the way to the top.

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:09.440
 Sure, you may not couple of guys at the bank of the top.

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:12.440
 But, but, are you ever eating an automatic restaurant?

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:16.440
 All you do is put in a nickel and boy things come right out at you.

00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:21.500
 Your father wants to speak to you. He does mother poor goodbye and I send you post call

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:27.940
 Yes, father

00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:30.340
 Henry I've got to make the Pullman reservations right away

00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:34.280
 Are you quite sure it'll be all right for you to break your date with this Loretta of what's her name?

00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:39.600
 Sure father. She won't mind standing staying home. She's a very good sport. You're quite sure sure

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:42.280

 Boy poor kid back here in center real whether

 Didn't you recognize my voice this is angry?

00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:06.500
 Yes, I'm sorry to bother you right this minute Loretta, but my father just asked me to go up in the Empire State Building with them

00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:09.060
 We're going in the York

00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:15.380
 Yes tomorrow and and I was just wondering whether it would be alright if I couldn't take it in a dance out of me now

00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:21.420
 Well Henry is a matter of fact it works out fine because somebody just told me a few minutes ago and asked me to go with him

00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:23.420
 Oh somebody did

00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:29.140
 A friend of mine is just coming into a lot of money. Oh, I hope you have a nice time in New York Henry

00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:32.080
 Thanks Loretta, and I'll be over in just a couple of minutes

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:32.900
 What's that?

00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:34.900
 Boy in a my star. Goodbye

00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:59.900
 [Music]

00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:04.400
 Agnes Lawson, the son of April Fool, led her to Henry, inviting him to dinner tonight

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:06.320
 at Loretta Darlington's.

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:09.320
 Henry and Homer, in order to keep April Fool's Day

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:11.800
 from being a total loss, have led Agnes

00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:15.400
 to believe that she's the winner of a radio contest.

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:18.360
 The scene opens in Loretta Darlington's home.

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:21.360
 The time is around 9.15.

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:22.200
 - Mark.

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:26.200
 - Oh, Mrs. Darlington, yes, Henry.

00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:27.040
 Nothing.

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:29.600
 I'm sorry Loretta isn't here right this minute, Henry.

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:31.080
 She said she was going to step out,

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:32.960
 and she told me where she was going,

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:34.360
 but I didn't pay any attention.

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:36.460
 Well, that's alright, Mr. Tarleton, that's alright.

00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:38.060
 I've just just so set here.

00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:42.400
 If you have any work to do in the kitchen,

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:44.000
 you go right ahead with it.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.780
 You're not keeping me from one thing, Henry.

00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:47.680
 I'm not.

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:49.140
 Won't you have another piece of candy?

00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:50.600
 I don't mind if I do.

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:53.240
 Just a moment while I take this next layer of paper out,

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:55.480
 I didn't realize we'd eaten practically half a buck.

00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:56.880
 It's very good candy.

00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:58.120
 Is it your favorite kind?

00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:02.080
 I like any kind and you don't have to worry it.

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:04.000
 Never spoil my appetite.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.800
 Good. Tell me, did you have any April Fool jokes played on you today?

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:12.740
 No, I got by this year of what you might call a clean slate.

00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:16.180
 My goodness. Did I tell you what Agnes did to Loretta?

00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:21.240
 No ma'am. Mrs. Darlington, Loretta went out that she say about how long she'd be gone.

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:22.920
 No, I don't think she did.

00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:26.560
 Well, where's Mr. Darlington? I haven't seen him since I got here.

00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:27.980
 He went to a lodge meeting.

00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:30.720
 Oh, he did? Is he having dinner there?

00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:33.160
 Oh, my. No, he grabbed a bite before he left.

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:34.160
 Oh.

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:37.160
 Too bad he couldn't wait.

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:42.160
 Well, as I started to tell you, Henry, Agnes Lawson has played more jokes today.

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:43.160
 Do you know what she did this morning?

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:44.160
 What?

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:51.160
 She didn't say one word to Loretta about it, but she wrote a note to Loretta's father and asked him whether she could have a dollar and sign Loretta's name.

00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:54.160
 And Mr. Darlington never knew the difference and gave Loretta a dollar.

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:55.160
 He did.

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:56.160
 Yes.

00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:59.160
 And Agnes not only made her handwriting look exactly like Loretta's,

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:03.500
 But where she ever got Loretta's scented stationary, I never will know.

00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:04.500
 Oh.

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:05.500
 Oh.

00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:07.500
 Agnes did that?

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:08.500
 Yes.

00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:11.100
 Wasn't that a good one?

00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:12.100
 Oh.

00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:15.100
 Mrs. Darlington, would you tell me something frankly?

00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:16.100
 Yes.

00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:19.180
 About how many meals have you had here so far today?

00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:20.180
 Why three?

00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:22.180
 Why do you ask?

00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:23.180
 Oh.

00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:24.180
 Oh.

00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:25.180
 Well, oh.

00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:29.180
 Oh, so Agnes did a thing like that to Loretta.

00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:30.180
 My there.

00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:31.180
 Loretta, come in here.

00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:34.180
 Mother, who's had it out there in the hall?

00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:36.180
 Oh, hello, Henry.

00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:40.180
 Oh, my goodness, I've been over to the Lawson's and more things have happened to them.

00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:41.180
 What, for instance?

00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:44.180
 They're so rich, Mother, they're practically rolling in money.

00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:50.180
 Mrs. Lawson put in a long distance call all the way to San Francisco just to tell all Mrs. Lawson about it.

00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:52.180
 About what? The $3,500 they want.

00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:53.180
 Haven't you heard, Henry?

00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:54.020
 - You heard Henry?

00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:54.900
 - I read her, Agniston,

00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:55.780
 - She didn't want any money.

00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:57.340
 - Why Henry, she did too.

00:18:57.340 --> 00:18:58.740
 - She was, she couldn't have the whole thing

00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:00.140
 with an April 4th show.

00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:01.660
 - Why Henry, it couldn't have been.

00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:03.380
 - What I'm telling you, home of mine,

00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:04.740
 we made the whole thing up.

00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:06.020
 - If you ask me, Henry,

00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:08.020
 all of which I don't like your attitude.

00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:09.900
 - Well, I know right, I'll show you.

00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:10.940
 - As a matter of fact,

00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:12.860
 Henry, if you're going to contradict me like that,

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:14.900
 I'm glad I'm not going to the dance with you.

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:16.060
 - And as a matter of fact,

00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:18.380
 I'm glad I'm going to San Francisco.

00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:19.220
 - In New York.

00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:20.060
 - Good bye.

00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:22.260
 - Henry, all of which I think you're insane.

00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:24.260
 What do you mean by a statement like that?

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:29.260
 When Mr. Lawson told me himself that your own father is going to New York to collect the money for Agnes.

00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:32.260
 My father? Yes, your father.

00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:34.260
 That's why he's going there.

00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:38.260
 And I...that was some more, Rhett. She whiz.

00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:53.160
 But Agnes, you didn't, you couldn't possibly have.

00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:56.620
 Henry, I suppose you think I don't know an April Fool's joke when I see one.

00:19:56.620 --> 00:19:58.820
 But I'm not kidding you, you didn't want it.

00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:01.260
 Wait a second, Henry. Let me explain it to her.

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:04.600
 Agnes, Henry and I just made the whole thing up.

00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:08.800
 By Homer Brown, and I suppose you made up the fact that I entered that contest.

00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:10.700
 You may have entered it, but you didn't want it.

00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:13.900
 Now, Henry, for the last time, I'm not going to be April Fool.

00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:17.040
 You're just trying to get back at me for writing that letter to you from Loretta.

00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:17.940
 What letter, Henry?

00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:20.940
 Never mind Homer, let's just take one thing at a time.

00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:21.940
 (audience laughs)

00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:22.940
 Now listen Agnes.

00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:25.940
 I'm not gonna listen to one thing you say of all of Just Peep.

00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:26.940
 What Agnes?

00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:28.940
 What's all this known as in here?

00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:30.940
 Oh, she was who almost did what was in here?

00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:31.940
 That's the trouble.

00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:34.940
 Mr. Lawson, there's something we feel we ought to tell you.

00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:35.940
 Well...

00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:37.940
 Agnes thinks she won a lot of money, see?

00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:38.940
 Yes.

00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:40.940
 And she won't believe she didn't.

00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:42.940
 Oh, why shouldn't she believe it?

00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:44.940
 Mr. Lawson, I guess you didn't understand.

00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:46.940
 Mrs. April, follow us, eh, see?

00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:50.940
 I know, but I don't think you boys ought to try to pull a joke like this one.

00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:51.940
 What's that?

00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:59.940
 Pretty serious thing boys, when you deliberately tell somebody they didn't win a prize like $3,500 when it's common knowledge that they did.

00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:01.940
 But she couldn't have an empty microphone.

00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:04.940
 I won't tell your father about this, Henry, but you better be running along.

00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:09.940
 Agnes has had a pretty big day, and for that matter, this whole family has. We're in no mood for jokes.

00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:11.940
 You mean you don't believe us either?

00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:15.940
 You boys, just forget it's April Fool's Day, and go home and get your schoolwork done.

00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:16.940
 Mr. Lawson!

00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:18.140
 I'll run along.

00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:19.540
 Good night.

00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:21.740
 She was at the fine thing.

00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:24.840
 Henry, did we make this whole thing up?

00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:26.940
 What did Agnes really win that prize?

00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:29.640
 Listen, Horr, we've got to do something about this.

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:30.640
 May I...

00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:32.640
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:44.340
 Hello?

00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:45.940
 Mr. Lawson speaking.

00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:48.100
 Oh, this is a telegram office.

00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:48.900
 Yes?

00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:50.580
 I got a telegram here for you.

00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:53.260
 Oh, yes, yes. Is it from New York?

00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:55.980
 Well, it has New York written at the top.

00:21:55.980 --> 00:21:58.060
 There's something about it I want to explain to you,

00:21:58.060 --> 00:21:59.980
 but I think I better read it to you first.

00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:00.940
 All right.

00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:07.460
 It says this is to inform you that Agnes Lawson did not win $3,500

00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:08.940
 because she couldn't have.

00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:11.660
 You want the victim of an April Fool joke.

00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:13.300
 Oh.

00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:16.500
 Oh, uh, they say anything else?

00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:17.500
 Nope, that's all.

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:18.700
 Oh.

00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:23.100
 And I think out of Tilly, Mr. Lawson, that telegram didn't really come over the wires.

00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:28.700
 Henry Aldrich and Homer Brown dropped in here a few minutes ago and told me to phone it to you.

00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:31.300
 Oh, you don't say so!

00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:34.800
 Henry Aldrich and Homer Brown, eh?

00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:46.600
 Henry, do you realize what a serious thing this is that you and Homer have done?

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:48.600
 Sending a telegram that wasn't even real.

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:52.600
 But Father, don't you boys like Agnes? I always suppose she was a pretty nice girl.

00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:55.600
 She is, Mr. Aldrich, but she has in any sense of humor.

00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:57.600
 That's the point. You think a thing like this is funny?

00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:59.600
 No, Father, not me more. We don't.

00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:05.600
 Do you think any family and their right mind would go ahead and make all the plans they have if they hadn't won the money?

00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:07.600
 I'd have a good mind not to take you to New York.

00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:09.600
 But Father, that's the point, don't you understand?

00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:11.600
 Henry, for the last time, that's not full about this anymore.

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:13.600
 I've changed our plans and we're going tonight.

00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:15.600
 My bag is right here and it's all packed.

00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:16.600
 - What's wrong? - If you want to go with me,

00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:18.600
 you have 10 minutes and wish to pack your thing.

00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:21.600
 - You mean you're going now? - I ought to be on the way to the station right this minute.

00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:23.600
 What's funny, you can't take that train.

00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:28.600
 Even if you cut off my allowance for the next six months, you've got to listen to me.

00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:43.040
 Well, you have another hamburger, Homer.

00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:44.040
 Thanks.

00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:46.040
 I don't mind if I do.

00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:48.640
 Boy, am I hungry.

00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:50.480
 Could I have the cats, please?

00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:51.480
 Here.

00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:54.120
 These hamburgers are best at rating my life, Henry.

00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:56.920
 I'm glad you like the magnet.

00:23:56.920 --> 00:23:59.320
 Would you like to have me put another nickel on the jukebox?

00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:01.320
 Yes, I'd be swamped.

00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:06.160
 Agnes, is your brother Ralph going back to work in the Havens drug store this Saturday

00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:07.160
 night?

00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:08.160
 Or is he gonna wait a week?

00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:09.160
 No, he's going right back.

00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:11.160
 Boy, is he mad at me?

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:13.160
 Why is he mad at you?

00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:16.160
 I don't know. Nobody in my family speaking to me.

00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:18.160
 It's the way it is in my family.

00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:21.160
 Well, it doesn't matter if I...

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:24.160
 And you know, maybe it's just as well I didn't get it.

00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:26.160
 Didn't get what?

00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:28.160
 My evening dress without shoulders.

00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:30.160
 I guess I'm just not the type.

00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:33.160
 Boy, has this been a day?

00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:34.160
 I'll say it has.

00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:35.160
 Same here.

00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:37.160
 Henry, you spilled some ketchup on your tie.

00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:39.160
 - He was weird. - April Fool.

00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:43.160
 Now it's an magnet. It's 12 o'clock, Henry, and you can't get back at me.
