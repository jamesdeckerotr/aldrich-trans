00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
 Henry! Henry Aldrich!

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
 Coming, mother!

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
 The Aldrich family. A special rebroadcast for you soldiers, sailors and Marines of the United Nations.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 American boys always grow up. They can't stop themselves.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 But no matter how important or how old they become,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 they always like to grow down to boyhood again

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 and recapture their youth in the adventures of Henry Olridge.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 The scene opens in the Olridge kitchen on a Saturday morning.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
 -Bye, Mother. So long. -Henry Olridge, where are you going?

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 No place, Mother. No place. Just skating.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 Skating, dear. You're leaving without doing what I asked you to do.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 -Who, I, Mother? -Henry, I told you I wanted you to take a package over to old Mrs. Proctor's before you did one thing today.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 On the first day of skating, and the whole gang's going to be down on the lake, Mother?

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
 I'm sorry, Henry, but you got to take this fruitcake over to Mrs. Proctor.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.700
 Even when Homer's waiting for me out on the front porch with a skates and everything.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.700
 Here's the cake, dear. It's in a tin and keep this side up.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.000
 She, weren't you listening, Mother?

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.500
 Yes, dear. Now, please start.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.700
 Well, where are you going, Henry? Skating?

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:31.700
 Skating, Father?

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:32.700
 Wonderful day for it.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.000
 Now, Sam, I've just gotten through explaining to Henry it's going to be exactly as nice later on.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.700
 Father, you... Oh, you aren't finding a chance going to drive over by Mrs. Plochner's today, are you?

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.500
 Oh, I know, sir. I have a very busy day scheduled.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.100
 Sam, you haven't forgotten you're going to that reception with me this afternoon, have you?

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.860
 You know what reception Alice.

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.360
 Sam I don't believe you ever hear one thing I say.

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.760
 I've mentioned it at every meal for the last week.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:55.960
 To me?

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.060
 Oh Henry.

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.600
 Yes Homer I'm coming.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.240
 Henry you're tipping the fruit cake just as I knew you would.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.400
 Not very much Mother.

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.040
 I just wanted to have it at the right angle as I went off the door.

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.600
 Alice what reception are you talking about?

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.440
 At the women's club at four o'clock.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:10.480
 At the women's club?

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:12.580
 Yes dear and please go answer the telephone.

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.280
 At four o'clock I can't possibly make it.

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.280
 But Sam.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.080
 Hello?

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.920
 Hello Sam this is Will Brown.

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.340
 Oh yes, good morning Will.

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.180
 Say Sam, is everything all fixed?

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.020
 You mean for...

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.300
 This afternoon?

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:24.460
 That's right, Sam.

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.020
 Well I'll tell you Will, I'm in sort of a jam here, I'm afraid.

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:28.120
 Yeah, what's the trouble?

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.260
 Could you call me again in just a few minutes and when Alice answers the phone,

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.320
 you tell her how important our engagement is.

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:34.120
 Why, Sam?

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.100
 Well frankly, I forgot there was a reception at the Women's Club.

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:38.760
 And she's going to make you go?

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.740
 Not if you handle it right Will.

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.660
 Oh, I see what you mean.

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.300
 Yeah, I'll tell her it's a case of life and death that we get together for a conference.

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.300
 That's right, Will, that'll do it.

00:02:49.300 --> 00:03:05.300
 Look Henry, look, the lake's just like glass.

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.300
 Oh boy.

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.800
 Well, be Henry, wait a second, where are you going?

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.300
 I told you ten times, Homer, I've got to deliver this fruitcake.

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.800
 But she was, I thought you were going out on the lake with me.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.160
 Oh no Homer, I walked a block out of my way so we could see how the ice looked.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.860
 And now I've got a gorbite Mrs. Proctor.

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.760
 Henry, we're right here, aren't we?

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.060
 Why don't we put on our skates and go down the lake once before the crowd gets here?

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.420
 And now Homer, don't tempt me.

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.100
 When I tell my mother, I'll...

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:30.100
 I'll...

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.300
 Although I'll admit I might step out here just one step to see how smooth it is.

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:35.300
 She or Henry?

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.060
 And why don't you put your skates on?

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:38.900
 And no Homer, I'm just going to walk out of ways.

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.300
 In the first place Mrs. Proctor is waiting for this fruitcake.

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.100
 Gee, it isn't bad out here, is it?

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.500
 No, Henry, and boy, watch me slide.

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:47.600
 Look out Homer, stand back.

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:48.400
 What are you gonna do?

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.300
 I'm gonna take just one long running slide

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:51.500
 and then beat it over to Mrs. Prok.

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.000
 Wait a second, I'll slide with you.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.500
 Homer, I can't wait. Here I go.

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.900
 Wheee!

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:58.900
 Hey, hey Homer!

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.900
 Oh boy, Henry, look out!

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.900
 Hey Henry!

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:04.400
 What?

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.160
 (dramatic music)

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:17.680
 - Dallas!

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:18.680
 Dallas, where are you?

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:19.960
 - Come on, off the kitchen, Sam.

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:21.240
 - The telephone's ringing.

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:22.600
 - Yeah, you'll have to answer it.

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.040
 - I can't, I've got to go downstairs

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.960
 and look at the furnace.

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.320
 - Sam, how do you know it isn't someone

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.440
 who wants to speak to you?

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:29.280
 Hello?

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.480
 - Hello, is this M303?

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:32.320
 - Yes?

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:33.440
 - Oh, hello there, Alison.

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:39.540
 How are you just fine is this wheel brown? Yes. Well, this is a pleasant surprise just a minute

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:43.420
 Will and I'll call say I know Alice wait you don't have to call him you don't want to speak with him

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:48.620
 I just want you to give him a message all right. I tell him something pretty important has come up and no matter

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:53.420
 What he plans to do I've got to see him this afternoon really and what time well

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:58.900
 For oh, but we hope he hasn't planned to do anything at four. There are some figures

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.940
 I have to go over with him and and well, it's that important by naturally

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:06.520
 that was my any chance. Well, problem. Yes, Sammy. Still on here. Don't you want to

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:10.320
 speak to him? Oh, what? Oh, what's your calling for? He says you can't go to that

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:14.780
 reception. No, he did take the phone. I've got to go back to the kitchen. Hello,

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:20.260
 Will. Hello, Sam. I fixed it for you. You don't say well, Will, that's too bad.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:25.940
 Now listen, Sam. It's your turn to phone me. What do you mean? Call me back and do

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:30.100
 the same thing with my wife. It's that reception, Sam. She hooked me.

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:34.100
 All right, Will. You can depend on me. I'll give that by immediate attention.

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:34.780
 Goodbye.

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:38.020
 Goodbye, Will. And thanks for calling. Alice.

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:39.180
 Yes, Sam.

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:43.220
 Alice, I'm certainly sorry about Will insisting I be with him this afternoon.

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:45.700
 Just what kind of figure is it that you have to go over?

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:50.180
 Why, they're rather intricate figures, Alice. In fact, they're...

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:51.380
 Well, I've got to be going to the office.

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:54.220
 Dear, you won't forget to stop off and leave those things at the tailor's, will you?

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:56.220
 I won't. I've already got them out in the car.

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:59.220
 Eh, is somebody in our back door there?

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:00.220
 Hello Mrs. Aldrich.

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:02.220
 Why, hello there, Homer.

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:03.220
 I thought you were with Henry.

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:04.220
 Who me?

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:07.220
 Well, tell ya, I was with him and...

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:09.220
 and then he asked me...

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:11.220
 I decided to come over here for something.

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:13.220
 Dear Henry, hasn't gone skating, has he?

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:14.220
 Skating?

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:15.220
 No.

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:17.220
 No, Henry didn't even put his skates on.

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:21.220
 Could I just step up to Henry's room for a second...

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:25.220
 and sort of look around for something that I'd like to see whether I can find.

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:26.720
 You want to go up to his room?

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:30.220
 It's okay, boy. I want to call somebody at the back door here.

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:31.220
 Oh, Charlie!

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:33.220
 What did she say, Homer? Did you talk her into it?

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:38.220
 Charlie! Say hello to Mrs. Aldrich. She's right here behind the door.

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:40.220
 Oh, hello Mrs. Aldrich.

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:42.220
 Good morning, Charlie. What did you want?

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:45.220
 Why, well, I just... Well, you see, here's what happened.

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:49.220
 I'm not mine, Charlie. Mrs. Aldrich is very busy baking, and we don't want to bother her.

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:51.220
 Okay. Now don't make a mess up there boys.

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:52.220
 Oh no.

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:54.720
 Alice, exactly what is it I'm supposed to tell the tailor.

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:56.720
 The same, everything in mind is to be dry clean.

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:57.220
 Yes.

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:00.220
 And Henry's soup and his two pairs of trousers are to be sponged and pressed.

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:01.220
 Fine.

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:05.720
 And tell him Henry would like at least his soup back by Monday because he hasn't a thing up in his closet except what he's wearing.

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:06.220
 Very well.

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:07.220
 Are you leaving now?

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:11.220
 No, not just yet. I've got to put in one more phone call.

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:12.220
 Mrs. Allbridge.

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:13.220
 Yes, Homer.

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:15.220
 Mrs. Allbridge, does Henry...

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:18.220
 Does Henry still have the same room he's always had?

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:20.220
 Why, yes, Homer, of course.

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:21.220
 Is that right?

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:22.220
 Why do you have?

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:23.220
 No reason.

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:24.220
 The closet.

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:26.220
 The whole thing seemed a little empty.

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:28.220
 Well, what is it you're looking for, dear?

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:30.220
 Nothing, Mrs. Aldrich.

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:31.220
 Oh, Charlie.

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:33.220
 Homer, was Henry gonna meet you here?

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:34.220
 Well, no, not exactly.

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:36.220
 We were gonna come here and...

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:37.220
 and then...

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:39.220
 he'll probably be at the lake when I get back.

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:41.220
 Hey, Homer, what's keeping you?

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:42.220
 Listen, Charlie, did you find anything?

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:43.220
 I found a sweater.

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:44.220
 What could a sweater do?

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:46.220
 What Henry needs is a pair of trousers.

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:47.220
 Well, where are his trousers?

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:52.020
 That's what I don't understand and listen Charlie you gotta let me take your pants over to him

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:57.660
 Oh no Homer, but Charlie don't you realize Henry's over at the lake and only spent to keep him warm as a fire?

00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:01.340
 Come on now. Let me have no no Homer. Oh no. I'll take your pants

00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:07.620
 But Charlie don't you realize your pants are brown. They're the same color as Henry's all he's gotta do is put them on and nobody

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:09.620
 11. No, we fell in well

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:14.220
 But why don't you go over to your house and get in your brown pants because my mother's looking for me

00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:16.420
 And if I go anywhere near my house, I'm sunk.

00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:17.820
 Well, you can't have mine.

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:19.720
 What, Charlie? You look tired.

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:22.020
 You can get into Henry's bed and read a good book.

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:23.020
 Oh, no.

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:24.420

 Hey, Agnes!

 Oh, Henry!

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:41.820
 Hi!

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:43.920
 Why do you know you were down here at the light, Henry?

00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:45.340
 Come on out here and skate with me.

00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:48.480
 Wait, I tell you Agnes, I can't write this minute.

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:50.640
 Why not? What are you doing behind that bush?

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:52.880
 Why nothing? Have you seen Homer?

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:54.400
 No, is he down here tonight?

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:57.920
 Well, he was. Then he left to go on sort of an errand.

00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:59.760
 She was, have you seen Charlie Clark?

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:00.500
 No.

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:01.500
 Boy.

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:04.700
 Oh my goodness, look at the hole in the eye.

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:05.200
 What?

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:06.560
 That's how I'm fishing here?

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:08.100
 Fishing. Fishing.

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:10.100
 Say, Henry, have you got a fire there?

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:12.400
 Listen, Agnes, just stay away from here. Just stay away.

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:15.360
 Why? Because, well, this is my fight.

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:16.280
 Oh my goodness.

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:18.640
 Oh, listen, do you see that house down at the end of the lake?

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:19.140
 Yeah.

00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:21.560
 Well, could you run down there and ask to borrow a blanket?

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:22.880
 Why can't you go?

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:25.600
 Well, that's why I'm behind this board.

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:26.320
 What?

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:29.760
 An Agnes, while you're down there, ask if you could get anything I could fish with.

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:30.320
 What's that?

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:31.840
 Tell him I want to hook a fruitcake.

 Thanks a lot, Charlie.

 And remember this, don't worry.

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:48.920
 Now listen, Homer, how long are you gonna leave me here?

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:51.080
 I'll be back with Henry before you know it.

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:53.000
 Just stay in bed and enjoy that book.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:53.560
 Okay.

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:54.840
 And don't call anybody.

 Okay.

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:59.720
 And listen, Charlie, do you want me to pull down the shade in case you want to take a nap?

 No, I don't.

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:03.400
 Just stay away from that shade and bring my pants back.

 Okay.

 Oh, Mom!

 Are you still up at Henry's room?

 Wait, I was Mrs. Aldrich, but I'm not now.

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:12.520
 I'm coming downstairs.

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:14.480
 Should I pick you out of the kitchen, please?

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:15.520
 Now...

00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:17.800
 I'll be there just as soon as I...

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:21.240
 All I have to do is put something down here in the living room a second.

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:22.680
 Very well, but please, Harry.

 Here I am, Mrs. Aldrich.

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:29.480
 Here, I'm terribly sorry, but I'm gonna have to ask you to run down to the store for me.

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:32.040
 Now, Mrs. Aldrich, yes, dear.

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:33.440
 The only thing is, I...

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:37.440
 All you have to do is run in and ask for a can of baking powder and run right back here.

 Yes, Mrs. Aldrich.

 Only first I think I'll step in the living room in a minute.

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:43.940
 Now, dear, please, I need the baking powder at once.

00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:46.640
 Right away, yes. Here, I'll open the back door for you.

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:48.840
 Okay, Mrs. Aldrich, and I'll be right back.

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:50.040
 Thank you, dear.

 Homer, you don't have to run that fast.

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:54.040
 - Aldrich. - Yes, Sam.

00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:57.240
 Are these brown trousers that Henry's supposed to go to the tailors, too?

00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:00.240
 - Where did you find those? - On a chair in the living room.

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:03.240
 My goodness, I thought Henry was wearing his brown trousers.

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:06.320
 Well, as long as you have them, you might as well tell the tailor to dry clean them.

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:08.240
 They've been needing it for a long time.

 Henry, are you?

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:27.240
 Get away, I would stand back from this hole.

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:29.240
 What's your fishing for, Henry?

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:31.240
 Henry, can't you answer me?

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:33.240
 Listen, now, would you want to fall through this ice?

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:34.740
 You're too young to be around here.

00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:37.240
 I am not. I want to see what you're fishing for.

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:39.240
 Oh, gee, we'll see that, Elwood.

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:41.240
 If you hadn't been bowing, I would have had it.

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:41.740
 Oh.

00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:43.240
 Now, just keep quiet.

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:44.240
 Oh.

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:46.240
 You would have had Watt Henry.

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:48.240
 What you got a blanket around you for?

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:52.240
 There you go, Elwood. That's twice my darn fruitcake's gotten away from me.

 Listen, Elwood. Go on over the other side of the latency where the home of Brown's coming.

 I can see from here, isn't it?

00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:01.240
 Henry, you gotta fly, you gotta fly!

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:02.240
 I know, what do you think I'm blind?

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:03.240
 Want me to help you Henry?

 Oh, hello, Sam, where are you?

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:30.940
 I'm at my office, Will, and I just phoned your house, see?

00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:32.440
 Yes? Did you fix everything?

00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:34.640
 Well, that's why I'm calling you. Your wife, Walt.

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:35.440
 She bought?

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:39.740
 She says it's Saturday afternoon, and you need to get away from your work, and she's taking you to that reception.

00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:41.240
 But, Sam, I've been calling on--

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:43.340
 I know how you feel, Will. I don't blame you a bit.

00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:46.740
 Sam, you couldn't arrange to serve me a summons, could you?

00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:48.240
 A summons?

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:50.740
 No, the courthouse is closed.

00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:52.240
 But I could send you a wire.

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:55.240
 Say, that's an idea, and make it strong.

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:56.340
 I know what I can say.

00:12:56.340 --> 00:13:00.580
 Good. And Sam, when you send it, don't send it here to my office. Send it to my home.

00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:02.740
 Then Elizabeth will be sure to open it.

00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:04.500
 I understand and don't worry well.

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:05.540
 I won't. Goodbye.

00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:06.340
 Goodbye.

00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:09.740
 Hello.

00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:12.340
 Hello. Can I speak with Mr. Sam who will Aldrich-

00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:13.540
 Mrs. Mr. Aldrich?

00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:14.540
 Oh.

00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:15.540
 Who is this speaking?

00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:17.540
 Why? This is Homer.

00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:18.540
 Oh?

00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:22.540
 Homer, don't turn them to Homer. I had breakfast at your house this morning.

00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:24.940
 Oh yes. Homer.

00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:30.940
 Mr. Aldrich, Mrs. Aldrich happened to mention that you took some clothes to the tailor when you left the house a little while ago.

00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:31.940
 Yes, what about them?

00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:33.940
 Well, why not pay there?

00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:34.940
 What's that?

00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:36.940
 I've just been over to the tailor, isn't he? Doesn't he know anything about?

00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:42.940
 Of course he doesn't. If Mrs. Aldrich is worried about them, tell her they're in my car and I'm going to take them in a few minutes.

00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:44.940
 Oh, well do you know where your car is?

00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:45.940
 You mean it's been stolen?

00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:48.940
 It has. With Charlie. With Charlie's?

00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:52.940
 Homer, I can see my car from my window here. It's parked right there on Main Street.

00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:54.280
 It is on Main Street.

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:56.440
 Yes, of course. Right in front of the barbershop.

00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:58.480
 Oh, then I guess it is in stone.

00:13:58.480 --> 00:13:59.480
 Goodbye.

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:13.160
 Oh, Gee whiz.

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:17.100
 Now, wait a second, Terry Young fella.

00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:18.900
 Oh, boy. Are you speaking to me?

00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:19.640
 Is this your car?

00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:22.100
 Oh, yes, sir. No, sir. I'm just looking through it.

00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:23.860
 That's what I thought. What's your name?

00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:24.600
 My name?

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:27.140
 You think I haven't been watching you? You even tried to get into the trunk?

00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:28.640
 Yes, sir. I'm looking for something.

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:29.140
 Yeah?

00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:31.700
 Look, a friend of mine dropped a fruitcake, see?

00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:34.680
 I mean, first I borrowed another guy's pants, see?

00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:35.740
 And this is his car?

00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:38.140
 Yes, sir. No, sir. It's Mr. Olwich's car.

00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:38.840
 Good for Olwich's?

00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:40.880
 Yes, sir. It was his wife who baked the fruitcake.

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:42.980
 Oh, so it's a fruitcake you're looking for?

00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:43.600
 Yes, sir.

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:44.480
 No, sir.

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:46.620
 He's taking it to the cleaners, see?

00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:48.620
 Now, wait a minute. What's your name?

00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:50.920
 Don't you understand? Charlie's pants.

00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:52.920
 They're holding everything up.

00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:21.280
 Now getting back to the troubles of Henry Olridge.

00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:24.980
 Henry, while supposedly delivering a fruitcake for his mother,

00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:27.180
 has fallen through the ice on the lake.

00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:31.180
 Now, while he's waiting for someone to bring him a pair of dry trousers,

00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:33.980
 the scene opens with Homer returning to Charlie,

00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:35.780
 whose trousers he had borrowed.

00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:37.980
 Charlie?

00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:39.380
 Hey, Charlie, wake up.

00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:41.480
 Now listen, Homer, where are my pants?

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:43.980
 That's so loud, Charlie. Do you want Mrs. Olridge to hear you?

00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:45.280
 Mrs. Olridge isn't here.

00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:46.280
 I heard her go out.

00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:47.080
 Who is here?

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:48.080
 Nobody's here.

00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:49.700
 I've been alone here all day.

00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:52.020
 What do you mean all day? It's hardly three o'clock.

00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:53.340
 Well, I haven't had any lunch.

00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:54.780
 And I want my pants.

00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:57.540
 Oh, that's what I came over to tell you about, Charlie.

00:15:57.540 --> 00:15:58.540
 Where are they?

00:15:58.540 --> 00:15:59.940
 They're being cleaned.

00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:01.220
 They think.

00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:01.860
 They're what?

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:04.780
 Well, the cleaning promised me definitely it had been back on Monday.

00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:07.460
 I've got to stay here until then without anything to eat.

00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:08.180
 Oh no!

00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:09.620
 Charlie, take your hands off me.

00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:11.180
 No, I won't. I'm going to get out of here.

00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:11.620
 How?

00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:12.860
 I'm going to take your pants.

00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:13.580
 Now watch out!

00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:14.660
 Quick, Charlie.

00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:16.060
 Hey, Charlie, get off me.

00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:18.060
 No I won't! Don't let go of my ears!

00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:19.060
 Let go of my pants!

00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:20.060
 Well hold your foot up!

00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:21.060
 You make me!

00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:23.060
 Now listen Charlie, stop dragging me across the floor!

00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:24.060
 Let go!

00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:25.060
 Let go of yourself!

00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:27.060
 Oh boy!

00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:28.060
 Oh boy!

00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:31.060
 Now look what you've done! You tore my pants right in two!

00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:33.060
 Why didn't you let go of them?

00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:36.060
 Well this is a swell thing to do, a guy! Look at me!

00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:37.060
 Can't we solve them back together?

00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:40.060
 Sure, sure! How are we gonna sew them together?

00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:42.060
 I've got one leg on and you've got the other in your hands!

00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:57.860
 Sam, I certainly want to thank you for fixing everything up with Elizabeth.

00:16:57.860 --> 00:16:59.060
 No trouble at all, Will.

00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:01.060
 Well, she got that telegraph.

00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:02.660
 Now, wait a minute, Sam.

00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:03.460
 I've struggled.

00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:04.460
 Let's go this way instead.

00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:05.460
 Let's hurry too.

00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:06.460
 Only you see, Will.

00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:07.660
 I think that was your wipe up the street.

00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:08.660
 Alice?

00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:10.660
 You must be on the way to that reception.

00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:12.660
 Nothing to worry about, Sam, she didn't see us.

00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:13.660
 Hello there, Mr. O.

00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:14.660
 What's that?

00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:15.660
 It's Agnes Lawton.

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:16.660
 Hello.

00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:17.660
 Oh yes, hello there.

00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:18.660
 Where are you going?

00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:19.660
 It's not your ride.

00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:20.660
 I'm going home to get something for...

00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:21.660
 for...

00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:22.660
 boy, am I in a hurry?

00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:31.660
 [Music]

00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:32.660
 Boy.

00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:34.660
 Boy of all...

00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:36.660
 Listen Homer, get off that bed.

00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:38.660
 It's my turn to lie down for a while.

00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:40.580
 What's wrong with that chair you're sitting on?

00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:42.380
 It's hard, but I'm tired.

00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:43.980
 Well, I'll tell you one thing.

00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:46.700
 The next time I do something to try to help you out, Charlie,

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:49.300
 don't think you know more than anybody else that ever lived.

00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:50.780
 Hey, is anybody in there?

00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:52.100
 She whiz, who's that?

00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:54.100
 So much, fellas, is it all right to come in?

00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:55.220
 Oh, hello, Elwood.

00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:56.180
 Where'd you come from?

00:17:56.180 --> 00:17:58.020
 Listen, Henry wants to know where you are.

00:17:58.020 --> 00:17:59.220
 Does Henry want to see me?

00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:00.740
 Sure, Homer.

00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:01.940
 What's your line now, Cory?

00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:02.620
 You're sick?

00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:04.260
 I'm getting up.

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:05.460
 Say.

00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:07.500
 Come here a minute, Elwood.

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:08.540
 Come here a minute.

00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:10.640
 What for? I just want to see something.

00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:12.840
 Listen Homer, you've got to need pants on.

00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:14.240
 Well they're better than nothing.

00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:15.540
 What do you mean by that home?

00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:18.540
 And nothing else with nothing. Just come here to Homer.

00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:19.640
 What for?

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:21.540
 Elwood, I'm not gonna hit you.

00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:23.540
 Come here. Come here.

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:37.840
 Henry!

00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:39.540
 I'll be there in just a second, Agnes.

00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:40.940
 Do they fit you, Henry?

00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:42.540
 Well, they cover me.

00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:44.140
 But don't come near this bush again.

00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:45.340
 I'm not coming near it.

00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:46.340
 They fit me.

00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:48.540
 But just how big is your father?

00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:50.940
 Well, he has to be centered on the air football team.

00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:51.640
 He did?

00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:53.640
 Yes, but he's put on a little waist since then.

00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:54.340
 There.

00:18:54.340 --> 00:18:55.840
 Now I guess I have them on all right.

00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:56.840
 My goodness!

00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:57.540
 What's the matter?

00:18:57.540 --> 00:18:58.740
 You're just a sight!

00:18:58.740 --> 00:18:59.240
 Boy!

00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:00.240
 Hey, Henry!

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:01.140
 She was-- who's that?

00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:01.840
 Here they are, Henry.

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:02.540
 Here they are.

00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:03.940
 Listen, Homer, where have you been?

00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:06.440
 I've been trying to get to these pants, and boy.

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:07.440
 Here, put them on.

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:09.140
 Homer, I've got a pair of pants on.

00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:11.240
 You have? Are those pants?

00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:13.240
 Sure, they're Agnes's fathers.

00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:14.240
 Agnes's who?

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:15.040
 My father.

00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:17.240
 Oh, well, Henry, don't you want Elwood's?

00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:19.040
 Elwood? How'd you get Elwood?

00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:20.340
 I just borrowed them.

00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:22.540
 And then went over to Charlie's and got a pair for myself.

00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:23.340
 And here are yours.

00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:26.040
 Homer, I certainly hope you don't think I want to wear neat pants, do you?

00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:27.340
 Well, why shouldn't you?

00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:30.040
 I would, I'm right out in public, all the way over to Charlie's house.

00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:32.640
 Henry, isn't that your father over there?

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:33.940
 Where, Agnes? Where's my father?

00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:35.840
 Right out there on the lake. Look at him, scaring.

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:37.600
 Oh boy, stand in front of me.

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:39.280
 She was, is that my father, with him?

00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:40.080
 Yes, sure.

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:42.200
 They certainly are doing some fancy figure skating.

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:43.760
 Homer, won't you please stand in front of me?

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:44.260
 No!

00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:45.320
 Agnes, what's the matter?

00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:47.000
 No, Mr. Overt, you just fell in.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:47.800
 He did?

00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:48.840
 My father fell in.

00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:50.400
 Oh boy, him, you old boy.

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:51.000
 Look out.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.080
 Homer, where you going?

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:53.480
 Where do you think to your father I'm

00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:55.040
 going to take a Melwood's pants?

00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:57.520
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:19:57.520 --> 00:20:00.280
 (dramatic music)

00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:12.060
 - Can you see through the window, Will?

00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:13.520
 - Yes, I'm looking.

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:16.160
 - It's all right to go in, is the coast clear?

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:18.440
 - Come on, Sam, your wife isn't in the front of the house

00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:20.000
 anyway.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.600
 - Are you sure?

00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:23.880
 - Alice, Alice Aldrich!

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:25.640
 - Will, don't do that!

00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:31.640
 It's alright. If you don't look so bad in those pants, Sam, they just look like a skating costume.

00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:36.640
 Just the same, well, I don't want her to see me. Look, I'm going upstairs to take a hot bath.

00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:39.640
 Okay, and as a matter of fact, I think I'll be pulling out.

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:40.640
 Sam!

00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:41.640
 Will, is that Alice?

00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:42.640
 Goodbye, Sam!

00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:43.640
 Yes, Alice?

00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:45.640
 Was that you that just came in the front door?

00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:48.640
 Well, yes. Yes, that was I.

00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:50.640
 Well, come on out here to the kitchen a minute.

00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:52.640
 Well, I can't right now, Alice.

00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:54.640
 Sam, I want you to come out here and help me with something.

00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:56.140
 I'm coming with something.

00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:58.340
 Very well. I'm coming.

00:20:58.340 --> 00:21:00.140
 Did you see Harry?

00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:02.640
 Yes, Alice. I'm right here on the other side of the door.

00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:04.640
 Why don't you come all the way in?

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:07.640
 Well, I would, Alice. Only I was afraid I'd bother you.

00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:09.640
 Sam, I'm peeling these onions and I can't see a thing.

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:13.140
 Step over to the range. Will you please and see whether I turn that back burner off?

00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:14.140
 Now, Alice?

00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:17.640
 Yes, dear, of course now. Did you get all your figuring done?

00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:20.640
 Why, we went over a few figures.

00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:24.140
 And then something else came up. But that is, yes, you might say we got them done.

00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:26.740
 Goodness, but these onions make my eyes water.

00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:29.940
 You mean you can't see anything Alice? Not anything at all?

00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:31.340
 No dear, where are you?

00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:33.540
 I'm sort of around here behind you.

00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:36.940
 Well, I suppose I'll have to keep on peeling these or I'll never get them done.

00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:39.140
 And incidentally Henry is upstairs.

00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:40.140
 He's upstairs?

00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:42.740
 Yes, he came in just a few minutes ago and he's taking a hot bath.

00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:43.940
 Well, that's fine.

00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:46.340
 And after dinner Sam, I want you to have a talk with him.

00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:46.940
 Yeah?

00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:49.140
 He started off this morning to deliver a fruitcake

00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:51.940
 and he distinctly disobeyed me and went skating and fell in the lake.

00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:53.940
 Er... yeah?

00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:55.940
 Sam, you don't seem a bit concerned.

00:21:55.940 --> 00:21:57.940
 Oh, I am too concerned, Alice.

00:21:57.940 --> 00:21:59.940
 I was just going to say "falling" in the lake.

00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:01.940
 I also wish you'd have a talk with Henry about Homer.

00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:02.940
 About Homer?

00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:03.940
 Yes, Sam.

00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:07.940
 Elwood Hazard's mother phoned a little while ago and said that Homer had knocked Elwood down today.

00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:10.940
 Stolen his trousers from him and locked him up in some room someplace.

00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:12.940
 What did he do that for?

00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:13.940
 I don't know.

00:22:13.940 --> 00:22:17.940
 And now Mrs. Hazard is going out all around town trying to find the poor boy's pants.

00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:19.940
 Elwood Hazard?

00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:22.540
 Sam and he's only a little fellow in knee pants.

00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:23.540
 Hmm.

00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:26.540
 Well, that's how I think I'll be going upstairs and get dressed.

00:22:26.540 --> 00:22:28.040
 Don't be like Virginia Sam.

00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:29.340
 You will stick to Henry, won't you?

00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:30.340
 Yes, Alice.

00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:33.540
 And if this is hazard bones again about Elwood's pants, tell her not to worry.

00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:35.340
 I'll try to get to the bottom of them.

00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:53.840
 Henry, did you take part of this morning's paper?

00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:58.340
 - Why, Mother? - Yes, dear. There was a picture in it of some man who fell into the lake yesterday.

00:22:58.340 --> 00:23:00.840
 And it was the funniest thing it looked exactly like your father.

00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:03.840
 - It's our ride! - Yes, dear, and I wanted to show it to him.

00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:05.040
 You know where it is?

00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:12.040
 Well, to tell the truth, Mother, Father and I were lighting a fire in the living room a little while ago and I guess we must have burned it!

00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:31.040
 This rebroadcast of the Aldrich family is a presentation of the Armed Forces radio service.

00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:36.200
 (upbeat music)

00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:38.780
 (upbeat music)

00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:41.360
 (upbeat music)

00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:43.940
