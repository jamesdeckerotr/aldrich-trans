00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 [Music]

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,500
 And now, Jell-O Puddings present...

3
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:15,000
 Henry Henry O'Rourke!

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 Coming, mother!

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 [Applause]

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 The Aldrich family, based on characters written into my triple gold medal,

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 and starring Ed Sreston as Henry with Jackie Countess Homer.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 And here they are!

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:39,680
 Just a taste of jello puddings and believe me you will know they are made by famous J E L L

10
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:46,760
 Oh yes that was Henry and Homer in their own particular cheer song for jello puddings

11
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:52,240
 because you never tasted anything better jello chocolate butter scotch and vanilla puddings

12
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:57,120
 chock full of old fashioned homemade goodness try them compare them see if you don't say

13
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,400
 that jello puddings are richer, creamier, more all-round delicious, and they cook to perfection

14
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:07,560
 in just about five minutes. Above all, when it comes to jello puddings, you never taste

15
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:21,320
 in anything better.

16
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,520
 Now for the Aldrich family.

17
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,120
 Happy times are sometimes pretty difficult to recall,

18
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:30,520
 but to many of us the happiest days of our life were those of our youth.

19
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:37,520
 An assured far way to relive them is to make the acquaintance of a typical teenage boy like Henry Aldrich.

20
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,120
 It's evening, and the scene opens at the Aldrich dinner table.

21
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,320
 Sam, will you have some more potatoes?

22
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,920
 Yes, please, Alice.

23
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,920
 Thank you.

24
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,920
 Will you have some Mary?

25
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,120
 No, thank you, Mother.

26
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,120
 How about you, Henry?

27
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,120
 More potatoes?

28
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:51,960
 Henry?

29
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:52,800
 Henry?

30
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,620
 Henry.

31
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:55,040
 Henry.

32
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:55,960
 Mother?

33
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,040
 Yes?

34
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,520
 Well, please have some more potatoes.

35
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,600
 What?

36
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,000
 Henry, do you feel well?

37
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,920
 Sure, I never felt better in my life.

38
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,720
 Oh, my goodness.

39
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,400
 You look as if you're half dead.

40
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,240
 Is that the phone?

41
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,240
 That's the phone.

42
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,560
 Henry, pick up that chair.

43
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,560
 But the phone's ringing.

44
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,720
 Henry, don't run.

45
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,720
 Turn that running.

46
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,040
 You'll stick on the whole rug.

47
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,040
 No, I won't.

48
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,800
 Oh, oh.

49
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,800
 What happened?

50
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,200
 I just slipped on the rug.

51
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:31,200
 Hello Henry. Hello Cynthia. What are you doing?

52
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:40,200
 Having my supper. Really and truly.

53
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,200
 What are you having?

54
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,200
 Lancha.

55
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,200
 Aww.

56
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,200
 What are you?

57
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:52,200
 Well, to tell you the truth, I can't remember.

58
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,200
 Well.

59
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,200
 Well.

60
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,200
 Well.

61
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,200
 Goodbye, Henry.

62
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,200
 Goodbye, Cynthia.

63
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,200
 Henry, where are you?

64
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,200
 Here in the living room, Father.

65
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,200
 What are you doing?

66
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,200
 I thought I'd listen to the radio a while.

67
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,500
 But Henry, what about your supper?

68
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,200
 Supper? Oh, oh gee, I forgot.

69
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,700
 You forgot. You forgot you were right in the middle of supper?

70
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:20,500
 Okay, Mary. If you're so interested in eating, why don't you go on and eat?

71
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,500
 Henry, there's no need to snap at your system.

72
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,900
 But father, she snapped at me first.

73
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:28,900
 I did not. My goodness, a person can't even ask you a civil question these days.

74
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,900
 All right, Mary, that's enough.

75
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:35,100
 Well, I wonder how Kathleen is enjoying her little vacation.

76
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,100
 Oh, is Kathleen away?

77
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:40,340
 My goodness Father, don't you remember how Henry soaked around here for days after she left?

78
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:41,820
 All right Mary.

79
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:45,020
 Have you written to Kathleen recently Henry?

80
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,020
 Henry?

81
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,020
 No one?

82
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:49,660
 Oh, no thanks Mother, I don't care for any.

83
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:52,660
 You don't care for any of what?

84
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:53,660
 Whatever Mother was offering me.

85
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:56,220
 Fear I wasn't offering you anything.

86
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:58,580
 I merely asked if you've written to Kathleen.

87
00:03:58,580 --> 00:03:59,580
 Kathleen?

88
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:00,580
 Yes dear.

89
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:01,580
 Kathleen Anderson.

90
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:02,580
 Oh her?

91
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,180
 No, she hasn't.

92
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,180
 She hasn't what?

93
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,180
 He hasn't what?

94
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,180
 Written to me.

95
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,740
 Dear, that isn't what I asked you.

96
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:11,220
 I mean, she hasn't phoned.

97
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:13,020
 Oh, that reminds me.

98
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,020
 Where are you going?

99
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,980
 Now it's my turn to phoned Cynthia.

100
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:17,380
 Henry, you're dinner.

101
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,380
 Henry!

102
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,380
 Henry!

103
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,380
 Henry!

104
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,380
 Well, my goodness.

105
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:23,820
 Sam, what are we going to do?

106
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,500
 There's anything to worry about, Alice.

107
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,820
 They all go through it.

108
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,300
 Not like this.

109
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:32,140
 Ever since he met that Cynthia, he seems to have completely lost his mind.

110
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:33,140
 That's what I say, Mother.

111
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:35,340
 How far is he's just lost his part?

112
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,280
 It's a perfectly normal reaction.

113
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,280
 Reaction to what?

114
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,500
 Spring, Alice, spring.

115
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,100
 It's just a little late catching up with Henry, that's all.

116
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,780
 Well, if Summer doesn't get here soon,

117
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:44,980
 he's going to starve to death.

118
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,580
 Just look at his plate.

119
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:48,860
 And Sam, I'm sure he's not studying.

120
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:50,360
 That's not abnormal.

121
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,220
 And now Sam.

122
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:52,500
 All right, if it's going to worry,

123
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,780
 you just forbid him to see the girl for a few weeks.

124
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,620
 Oh, no, Sam, I couldn't do that.

125
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:57,460
 Why not?

126
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:59,780
 Well, Henry's extremely sensitive.

127
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:02,020
 We might give him a complex he'd never get over.

128
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:08,420
 nonsense Alice. The thing to do is diverting. If I could just keep him from going over to Cynthia's for one evening.

129
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:11,020
 My goodness, look at the time. I'll have to hurry.

130
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:16,020
 Where are you going there? No, down to the church. I promised Helen Forbes I'd vendor something blue.

131
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:18,020
 Something blue? What is it?

132
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:21,020
 But just something, Father. Oh. Oh.

133
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:23,020
 When is she getting married there?

134
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:26,020
 On Saturday. They're having the rehearsal down at the church tonight.

135
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:30,020
 Helen Forbes. Is she that pretty girl who's been over here a few times?

136
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,820
 Yes, Father, she's a friend of mine.

137
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:35,620
 Well, a friend of yours, and she's getting married.

138
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:37,020
 Wow.

139
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:39,020
 Sam, how are you looking at Mary like that?

140
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:41,620
 Father, she's three years older than I am.

141
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:46,420
 My won't hella make a beautiful bride with that lovely blonde hair.

142
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:47,220
 Mother?

143
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,620
 Well, hello there, Henry.

144
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:50,020
 Nice to have you with us.

145
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:51,220
 Yes, sir. Well, goodbye.

146
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,420
 Yeah, where are you going?

147
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:54,420
 No place, Mother. Just over to Cynthia.

148
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,020
 Again?

149
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:57,420
 She was, Mary. I haven't been there since last night.

150
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:59,420
 Hey, Henry.

151
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:02,300
 Well, here's Homer. Isn't that nice?

152
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,660
 Huh? What does he want?

153
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:04,620
 Hi everybody.

154
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:05,020
 Hi, Henry.

155
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:28,220
 Hey, Henry, I'm afraid you won't be able to see Cynthia tonight after all.

156
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:28,700
 I won't.

157
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,700
 I want you to run an errand for me.

158
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,700
 Mother, Mary, please run and get that puzzle.

159
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:33,700
 Let's go to the chair.

160
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:37,700
 Oh, but Mother, now Mary, I think Henry is definitely the one to deliver it.

161
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,700
 Oh, oh, I understand.

162
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,700
 You understand what, Mary?

163
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,700
 Mary, are you doing anything to learn?

164
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:46,700
 Mother, look, I've already promised Cynthia.

165
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:51,700
 Now, dear, I'm sure you think more of your own mother than you do with Cynthia.

166
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:54,700
 Even though she's a very nice girl in her own way.

167
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:55,700
 Oh, sure, but...

168
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:56,700
 Well, sure.

169
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:57,700
 Now, please go and get your coat on.

170
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:58,700
 Well, sure, but...

171
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,900
 Henry, do what your mother said.

172
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:00,700
 Good fun!

173
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:01,700
 Yes, Father, I'm doing it.

174
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,700
 Oh, dear.

175
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:04,700
 What's the matter?

176
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,700
 Just occurred to me, Sam, a wedding rehearsal.

177
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:08,700
 What about it?

178
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:13,700
 I wonder if I should expose Henry to an atmosphere like that in his present frame of mind.

179
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,700
 On the contrary, Alice, I think it should do him good.

180
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:16,700
 You do?

181
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:17,700
 Yes.

182
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:20,700
 Might make him realize the finality of it all.

183
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,700
 Sam, what do you mean by that?

184
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:33,700
 [Music]

185
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:40,700
 Now then we'll begin the rehearsal at beginning. The room stands here. Here Mr. Carson, that's right Tom, and the best man here.

186
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:45,700
 That's right. Now the ushers leave the procession. The bridesmaid is next door.

187
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:46,700
 Yes Mr. Carson.

188
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,460
 And of course, the bride.

189
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:50,140
 And may I take this opportunity, Helen,

190
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:52,980
 to say that a prettier bride has never graced this church.

191
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:54,300
 Thank you, Mr. Carson.

192
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,140
 Now then, we'll start with the procession.

193
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:58,660
 You don't want me to walk down the aisle now, do you, Mr. Carson?

194
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:00,300
 Oh, no, Helen, it's bad love.

195
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,180
 Of course.

196
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,140
 Doreen will take your place.

197
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:02,800
 All right.

198
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,700
 Would you mind if I stepped out to the vestibule

199
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,340
 for a little air until you're ready for me?

200
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:07,620
 Go right ahead, Helen.

201
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,340
 We'll let you know when we're ready to rehearse this,

202
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:10,020
 everybody.

203
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:10,860
 Thank you.

204
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,980
 Now, are we all ready?

205
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:15,460
 You ready at the organ, Mrs. McLean?

206
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:16,960
 - Yes, we can talk.

207
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,160
 - Let's go, let's go round the head and start.

208
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,160
 - Oh, hello.

209
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,200
 Are you looking for somebody?

210
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,040
 - Yes, I am.

211
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,300
 I'm looking for some girl, co-op.

212
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,140
 Co-op.

213
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:28,140
 Jean, what is?

214
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,140
 - What's the matter?

215
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:29,980
 - What's the matter?

216
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:30,820
 - What's the matter?

217
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:31,660
 - Hello.

218
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:32,500
 - Hello.

219
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,420
 - See, I didn't expect to see anybody as pretty as you.

220
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:38,860
 I mean, you know what a wedding everybody

221
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:40,700
 is usually pretty old.

222
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,260
 - Oh, yes, I guess they are.

223
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,060
 Who did you say you were looking for?

224
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:45,340
 - I...

225
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:46,840
 I can't remember.

226
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,840
 You can't.

227
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,100
 Well, what's your name?

228
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,100
 Why?

229
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,100
 Henry?

230
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,100
 Henry!

231
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,100
 My name's Helen.

232
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,100
 Helen Ford.

233
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,100
 Well, you're the one.

234
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,740
 You're the one I have to give this to.

235
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:57,740
 Well, very much.

236
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:58,740
 What is it?

237
00:08:58,740 --> 00:08:59,740
 My sister, Mary, wouldn't tell me.

238
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:00,740
 Oh, I understand.

239
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,220
 This is from Mary Oldridge.

240
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,380
 You're her brother.

241
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:04,380
 Yeah.

242
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:05,380
 She's my sister.

243
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,380
 [LAUGHTER]

244
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:09,020
 She's getting married anyway.

245
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:11,020
 Oh, there she is.

246
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:13,020
 Walking down the aisle.

247
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:25,020
 The Eleanor who the poor guy is. Oh, you don't believe in marriage? Well, I don't know. See you get married and all the romance goes right out of life, except in certain cases that is.

248
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:38,020
 Well, how do you mean it? Well, you take... you take... are you married? Not yet. Me either. I mean... well, she was, I guess I'd better be running along. Goodbye, Miss.

249
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,020
 Miss...

250
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:40,020
 Goodbye, Anna.

251
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,020
 Goodbye.

252
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:42,020
 Ellen.

253
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:44,020
 Hi, Hannah, old timer.

254
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:47,020
 Homer, what are you doing here?

255
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,020
 I just...

256
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:50,020
 I just happen to be passing.

257
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:52,020
 See, what a coincidence.

258
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:54,020
 Say, "Hend me."

259
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:55,020
 And...

260
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:57,020
 Say, "Listen, do you know what's on at the B-Shoe tonight?"

261
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:58,020
 What?

262
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:00,020
 The best cowboy movie you ever saw.

263
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:03,020
 I've seen it three times and it gets better every time.

264
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,020
 Excuse me, Homer.

265
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,020
 Will you stop jumping in front of me?

266
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:07,020
 Oh, boy.

267
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:13,020
 When you're still going over to see Cynthia? Cynthia? Yeah. Cynthia who?

268
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:28,020
 Good morning, mother. Good morning, father. Good morning. Sit right down, Harry. Your breakfast is all ready.

269
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:31,020
 My goodness, I'm starved. She isn't there for a lovely morning.

270
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:34,020
 My, I can't remember when I've seen her nice, so day.

271
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:36,420
 Yes, looks just like an ordinary day to me.

272
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:39,020
 Well, perhaps it's because I feel so happy.

273
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:41,520
 Sam, did you know my little plan worked?

274
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,320
 What did it land?

275
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,220
 D'youverting Henry last night by sending him over to the church.

276
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:47,820
 He's completely lost interest in Cynthia.

277
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:50,820
 Now Alice, a reversal like that could hardly take place in a few hours.

278
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,020
 Well, it has.

279
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:56,420
 Cynthia phoned here this morning and Henry asked me to tell her he was out of town.

280
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:57,220
 Really, Mother?

281
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,420
 Is that so?

282
00:10:58,420 --> 00:10:59,820
 You mean he's back to normal?

283
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,320
 Absolutely, dear.

284
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:01,820
 Well...

285
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,620
 Good evening, everybody.

286
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:08,820
 What? I mean good afternoon. I mean what time is it? It's morning.

287
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:19,060
 Oh. May 1948. Friday. Friday? Oh then I have to go to school. Well goodbye everybody.

288
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:25,620
 Henry you haven't eaten your breakfast. Oh I haven't. Okay. He's out of town all right.

289
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:31,540
 He's out of the world. He's saying you're mistaken about the whole thing. Yeah. Henry.

290
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:32,540
 Yes, Father?

291
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:34,540
 Done your Christmas shopping, Dad?

292
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:37,540
 And not yet, I'll get around to it sometime this week.

293
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:39,540
 Mom, my goodness!

294
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:42,540
 Hey Henry, are you going to school?

295
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:43,540
 I'm coming, Homer.

296
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:45,540
 Henry, haven't you forgotten something?

297
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:48,540
 Oh, sure. Merry Christmas.

298
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:49,540
 Hey, Mommy, how are you?

299
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:51,540
 My head old pal.

300
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,540
 Hi.

301
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:53,540
 We are so dreaming.

302
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:55,540
 I know, hold my books a second, Mommy.

303
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,540
 Sure, old Tyler.

304
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:58,540
 Hello?

305
00:11:58,540 --> 00:11:59,540
 Hello, is that Henry?

306
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:00,540
 Yeah, who's this?

307
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:04,540
 Oh boy, oh boy, Homer beat it.

308
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:06,540
 Well, she was.

309
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:07,540
 Hello, Helen.

310
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:08,540
 Hello.

311
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:09,540
 How are you?

312
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:11,540
 Imagine you phoning.

313
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:13,540
 I mean, how are you?

314
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:14,540
 I'm just fine, thank you.

315
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:16,540
 Could I speak to Mary, please?

316
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:17,540
 Mary?

317
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:18,540
 Wouldn't I do?

318
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:19,540
 But you could give her the message.

319
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:23,540
 I just wanted to thank her for that package she sent over last night.

320
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:24,540
 Well, gee, I'll tell her.

321
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:25,540
 All right, thank you, Henry.

322
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:26,540
 Goodbye.

323
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:27,540
 Wait a minute.

324
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:28,540
 Yes.

325
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:33,540
 I mean, while you're on the phone, boy, isn't this a nice day?

326
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:37,540
 Yes, it's lovely. I only hope it's a nice tomorrow.

327
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:40,540
 Tomorrow? Is anything special happening tomorrow?

328
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,540
 Right. In a way, yes.

329
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:45,540
 Oh, I guess you have to go to that darn wedding, huh?

330
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:47,540
 Yes, I think I should.

331
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:50,540
 Well, Gee, do you really have to? Couldn't they get along without you?

332
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:54,540
 Henry, do you happen to know who's getting married tomorrow?

333
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:57,540
 Who cares? And listen, Helen, you can take it from me.

334
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:02,940
 whole things pretty boring. Sure, she was all the same. You've been to one, you've

335
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:03,940
 been to them all.

336
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:07,940
 Henry, why don't you come along tomorrow? I don't think you'll find it boring.

337
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:08,940
 You're inviting me?

338
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:09,940
 Yes, will you come?

339
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:14,740
 Well, I come, well, I come. I'll say. And look, what are you doing afterwards?

340
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:17,540
 Well, I'll see you afterwards, Henry.

341
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,540
 You will? You will?

342
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:20,540
 Goodbye now.

343
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:24,540
 Oh boy, goodbye. Oh boy, Homer.

344
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:27,040
 Hey, Henry, we're going to be late.

345
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,700
 Homer, guess who that was that just phoned me?

346
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:30,880
 Helen Forbes.

347
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,200
 Helen Forbes?

348
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,160
 The Helen Forbes, it's a friend of Mary's?

349
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,320
 Yeah.

350
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,040
 Henry, why are you looking like that?

351
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,760
 She's old enough to be your grandmother.

352
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,600
 Oh yeah?

353
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,440
 Well, I'll tell you how old she is, Homer.

354
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,600
 She just made a date with me for tomorrow.

355
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,440
 Tomorrow.

356
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,280
 Yeah, for a wedding.

357
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,360
 And then we're going out someplace afterwards.

358
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,000
 Well, Henry, tomorrow is a perfectly good Saturday.

359
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,560
 I plan on us going someplace swelled them on.

360
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,920
 Let's see, where could I take her?

361
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,640
 I thought we might go on a swelled picnic.

362
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,640
 Say, a picnic.

363
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,640
 What do we have to do?

364
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,320
 Oh, that's a wonderful idea.

365
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,440
 We'll go to a ball game.

366
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:01,940
 We will.

367
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:05,560
 I got a hell of love ball games.

368
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,320
 We only have to take Helen.

369
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:10,440
 Homer, I'm sorry, but there won't be room for you.

370
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,640
 The room?

371
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,560
 Could Henry want to be come of me?

372
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:16,560
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

373
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:31,780
 For something very special in grand desserts, try those exciting new members of the famous

374
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:33,700
 Jello pudding family.

375
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:38,140
 Jello tapioca puddings, a miracle of goodness, a marvel of speed.

376
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:44,220
 Get that luscious-like jello vanilla tapioca, or that rich candy-good jello chocolate tapioca.

377
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:48,180
 And now newest of all comes Jello Orange Coconut Tapioca.

378
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:53,260
 Man, that tempting orange flavor with coconut added is the most glamorous dessert yet.

379
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:55,700
 It's cramp full of fresh, tangy goodness.

380
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,780
 It's wonderfully rich and creamy.

381
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:02,260
 All three Jello Tapioca Puddings are ready prepared, quick as a flash to fix, and nothing

382
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:03,340
 to go wrong.

383
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:07,940
 All you do is add the milk, then cook in an ordinary saucepan, and Jello Tapioca Puddings

384
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:11,300
 cook to rich perfection in just about five minutes.

385
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:17,940
 Vanilla tapioca, jello chocolate tapioca, and newest of all, jello orange coconut tapioca.

386
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:29,380
 Ask for jello tapioca puddings, a miracle of goodness, a marvel of speed.

387
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:38,180
 And now getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldrich.

388
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:41,940
 In the spring a young man's fancy, well you know the rest of it.

389
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:46,340
 This particular spring, Henry's fancy, has turned to a young lady who happens to be getting

390
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:47,340
 married.

391
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:50,260
 But Henry thinks she's planning on spending the day with him.

392
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:54,140
 The scene opens in a center of ill, florist's job.

393
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:56,500
 Now set that basket of lilies over here where it's cool.

394
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,500
 Careful of the roses.

395
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:00,140
 Oh Mr. and the bride's bouquet, I'll do that myself.

396
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:02,060
 Yes, sir, may I help you?

397
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:03,060
 Yes, sir.

398
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:06,780
 Please, I'd like to order a corsage and I'm in a hurry.

399
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:07,780
 A corsage?

400
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:09,380
 Please, a flower?

401
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:10,580
 What kind of flowers?

402
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:13,780
 Well, I'll tell you, it's for a girl to wear to a wedding scene.

403
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:16,980
 I've spent most of my money for tickets to the baseball game.

404
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:19,180
 How about a nice spring corsage of daisies?

405
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:21,380
 Well, gee, I don't know.

406
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:22,580
 You take daisies.

407
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:23,780
 They're the cheapest we've got.

408
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:24,780
 They are?

409
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,380
 Well, yes.

410
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:28,580
 Yes, I think daisies would be just about perfect.

411
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:29,080
 Sure.

412
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,780
 I'll make up a corsage right away.

413
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:32,580
 I hope you don't mind if I rush you a little.

414
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:34,580
 We're very busy getting ready for the wedding this afternoon.

415
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:35,280
 The wedding?

416
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,980
 Yeah, I'm getting ready for that too.

417
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:39,660
 You have to get a haircut and get my shoes shined.

418
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:42,320
 I sure am be the lucky guy that wins Helen Forbes today.

419
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,380
 Helen Forbes?

420
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:45,380
 Well, she wins, that's me.

421
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:45,880
 You?

422
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:46,580
 Sure.

423
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:47,480
 Go on.

424
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,880
 Yeah, boy, I can hardly believe it myself.

425
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,200
 But I thought you'd be--

426
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,960
 well, aren't you a little--

427
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,720
 well, congratulations.

428
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,280
 Thank you.

429
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,320
 I certainly wish you all the best of luck.

430
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,080
 And may all your troubles be little ones.

431
00:16:59,080 --> 00:16:59,480
 Yes.

432
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,400
 What, sir?

433
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,520
 But say, what do you want these daisies for?

434
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,960
 Why, they're for Helen.

435
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,040
 Miss Forbes?

436
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,680
 But her flowers have already been ordered.

437
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,680
 Van? What kind did she order?

438
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,680
 White roses.

439
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,680
 White roses?

440
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,680
 How much is that going to cost me?

441
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,680
 Oh, they're all paid for.

442
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,680
 They are? They're paid for?

443
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,680
 Well, gee whiz, that's considerate of her.

444
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,680
 Hey Henry!

445
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,680
 Oh, Homer.

446
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:24,680
 Gee, old timer, what a coincidence.

447
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:28,680
 I just happened to be passing in just by coincidence. I saw you in here.

448
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,680
 Yeah, well, it's been nice seeing you, Homer.

449
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,680
 Isn't this a swell day, Hen?

450
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:35,680
 Yeah. Just forget about those daisies, mister.

451
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:39,040
 Okay. Isn't it a perfect day for a picnic?

452
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:45,040
 Hand? Boy, you see out of his mind, he doesn't know what he's doing.

453
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,760
 He does seem pretty young to be taking a step like this.

454
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,980
 Well he does the same thing every spring.

455
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:55,520
 Every spring? Sure. One thing though, it doesn't last long.

456
00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:01,040
 How long? About a week. Now wait a minute, do you mean to say he only stays married for a week?

457
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:03,360
 Mary. Mary.

458
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,360
 - We're sure. Didn't you know he's getting married today?

459
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,080
 - Who told you? Who told you?

460
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:07,740
 - He did.

461
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:12,720
 - Oh boy, I knew I would come to this. Oh boy.

462
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,300
 (upbeat music)

463
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:22,840
 - Halle!

464
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,480
 - I'm in the living room, Sam.

465
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,320
 - Where's Mary?

466
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:28,560
 - She's upstairs getting ready for Henry Ford's wedding.

467
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:31,400
 - Oh, is that today? Well, I'm glad we don't have to go.

468
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,400
 Don't you like weddings there?

469
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,400
 One's enough in any man's life.

470
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,400
 Mother! Mother!

471
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,400
 Yes, Henry?

472
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,400
 Where's my blue shirt suit?

473
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,400
 It's in your closet, dear.

474
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,400
 Well, I think maybe I'll go out to the golf course.

475
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,400
 Mother! Mother!

476
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,400
 What is it, Henry?

477
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,400
 Who hid my polka dot tie?

478
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,400
 Then nobody hid it. It's in your top drawer.

479
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:57,400
 No, it is, and I dumped out every one of my drawers, and it is.

480
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,400
 Oh

481
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:07,920
 That's where's he going this afternoon. I think to a baseball game. He's wearing his blue-seared suit to a baseball game

482
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,200
 What's he going to do umpire?

483
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:17,040
 I haven't wanted to worry you, but frankly the whole thing has me puzzled to how do you mean well first thing this morning?

484
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:20,920
 He borrowed a dollar for a cosage. He said his life depended on it of course I

485
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:25,160
 Sam I asked him who it was for and do you know what he said?

486
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:25,660
 What?

487
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:26,660
 Sam he heads.

488
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:28,660
 Well, he's probably taking some girl.

489
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:33,160
 But dear, if he's just taking a girl to a baseball game, why wouldn't he come out and say so?

490
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:36,160
 And do you know he hasn't eaten a bite of food since yesterday?

491
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,160
 Hey Mrs. Aldrich!

492
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,160
 Ah, this can't we keep that front door locked?

493
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:44,160
 Every time I try it, Sam he comes in the dining room window.

494
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,160
 Oh, there he is, why?

495
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:52,000
 I just want to say Mrs. Aldrich and Mr. Aldrich that you can count on me.

496
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,760
 Wait, such as the can.

497
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,560
 You'll miss Henry at first, sure.

498
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:59,280
 But I'll try to be a real son to you.

499
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,640
 I beg your pardon.

500
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,480
 Only boy, after all these years, wouldn't you think he would at least have told me?

501
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,480
 Tell you what?

502
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,880
 Well, I'm not holding it against him, Mr. Aldrich.

503
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:12,440
 Gee, if he wants somebody else to be best man, Gee, I understand.

504
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,440
 Now, wait a minute.

505
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,440
 Homer, what are you talking about?

506
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,920
 Well, you know when Henry gets married.

507
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:20,920
 Oh, well, I'm sure you'll be best man, dear.

508
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:23,920
 But Henry won't be getting married for some time.

509
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,920
 She was, don't you think this afternoon's pretty close?

510
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:27,920
 This afternoon!

511
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:28,920
 -Sant!

512
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:41,920
 Who is it?

513
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,920
 Oh, Father!

514
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:44,920
 May I come in, son?

515
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,920
 Sure, Father.

516
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:49,720
 Come on in. I hope you don't mind if I go on getting ready.

517
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:54,480
 You go right ahead. You are getting ready for something pretty important.

518
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,560
 I'll say. Boy, this is the biggest day of my life.

519
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:01,360
 I see. Going to the baseball game, I saw?

520
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,280
 Yes, sir. That's one of the things.

521
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:07,760
 I see. Well, now, I hope you won't think I'm trying, but

522
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,520
 would you feel like telling me what the other things are?

523
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:14,480
 Just something I'm doing first, Father. I don't think you'd be interested.

524
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,480
 I might be.

525
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,400
 Well, you don't leave laugh at me.

526
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,400
 Oh, why should I laugh?

527
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,760
 I think I was too young.

528
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:24,840
 I mean, just because a girl happens to be a couple years one way or the other.

529
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:27,360
 I suppose I give you my word, I won't laugh.

530
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,880
 Well, I'm just stopping off at the church for a little while.

531
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:31,880
 [LAUGHTER]

532
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,880
 That church.

533
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,880
 I see.

534
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,920
 Deep father, it's the funniest thing.

535
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,840
 I never even thought she was interested in.

536
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:42,520
 Boy, right out of a clear blue sky, she asks me point blank.

537
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,520
 She asks you?

538
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,440
 Sure, that's the wonderful part.

539
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,340
 Boy, I never could have gotten around,

540
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,560
 get up enough nerve to ask her.

541
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:52,160
 She even paid for her own flowers.

542
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:55,920
 Henry, did it occur to you that your mother and I

543
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,360
 might have liked to meet her?

544
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,520
 You have met her father.

545
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,280
 Her name's Helen Forbes.

546
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,600
 Helen Forbes?

547
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,840
 But she's going to-- Helen Forbes?

548
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:04,880
 What's the matter for him?

549
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,040
 Excuse me.

550
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,640
 Gee, he was.

551
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,480
 Alice.

552
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,240
 Sam, what did he say?

553
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,040
 Did you find out?

554
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,360
 Alice has nothing to worry about.

555
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,640
 I don't know where he got the idea,

556
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,720
 but he thinks he's marrying Helen Ford.

557
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,560
 - Huh?

558
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,400
 Oh my, Henry.

559
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,200
 - So all we have to do is to tell him point, Blake,

560
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,560
 that she's marrying somebody else.

561
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,120
 - Sam, we can't possibly do that.

562
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:21,960
 - Why not?

563
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,840
 - A sensitive boy like Henry?

564
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,520
 Sam, we'll have to find a way to soften the blow.

565
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:29,320
 A shop like that could turn him against women for life.

566
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,900
 (upbeat music)

567
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:36,320
 - Hello, mother.

568
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,560
 I'm phoning from the Haven's drugstore.

569
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:41,500
 And look, do we have any rice at home?

570
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,500
 We don't.

571
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:45,000
 But mother, I have to have some.

572
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,900
 And listen, if your best friend was getting married, what would you think of a pair of

573
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,900
 stuffed rattlesnakes for a present?

574
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:53,100
 One for each of them.

575
00:22:53,100 --> 00:23:04,500
 Well, Miss Forbes, Miss Forbes, the minister is waiting.

576
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,500
 Everyone's ready to stop.

577
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,500
 Everyone will just have to wait, Mr. Burgess.

578
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,500
 Please hold everything up for a few minutes.

579
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,000
 Now then, Mrs. Aldrich, where were we?

580
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,600
 Well, first of all, Helen, I'd better be the one to tell him.

581
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,400
 Yes, I think so.

582
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,800
 And then I'll give him his new wristwatch.

583
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:16,500
 Yes, Mary.

584
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:19,900
 And then I'll tell him that he's going on a nice trip to visit his Uncle John.

585
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,700
 And I'll tell him about doubling his allowance.

586
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,500
 And then Helen, you step forward.

587
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:26,800
 Yes, and I'll say, "Henry, we want to be good friends of yours, Tom and I."

588
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,300
 That's good.

589
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:30,900
 "We want you to know that our house is open to you and we hope to see you there often."

590
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,500
 Why, that's lovely.

591
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,600
 And Helen, I'll promise to keep him away.

592
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,400
 No.

593
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,000
 Has anyone know where...

594
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:37,800
 ...where Henry is?

595
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,500
 I think he's out in the vestibule.

596
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:42,500
 Come along, everyone. Oh, not you, Helen. You wait a minute.

597
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:52,500
 - Henry. - Father.

598
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:55,500
 - And mother. She wins. What are you doing here?

599
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:58,500
 - Well, dear. - Hello, Henry.

600
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:01,500
 - Henry. - Yes, mother.

601
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,500
 - Henry. - Excuse me.

602
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:06,500
 But does anybody happen to know why the wedding is being held?

603
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,500
 - Yes, Doreen. - Margie.

604
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:14,500
 Hello. Hello. And my name is Doreen. I'm a bridesmaid.

605
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:20,500
 Yes, you are. See, you're about the prettiest bridesmaid I ever...

606
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:24,500
 See, hello. What's your name again?

607
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,500
 Doreen. What's yours?

608
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,500
 Doreen. I mean Henry.

609
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,500
 Henry.

610
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:34,500
 Look. Look. Would you like to go for a little walk out on the lawn?

611
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,500
 Why, that would be lovely.

612
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:45,060
 Henry we did have something to tell you but uh Henry Henry we can go out this way

616
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:03,100
 - Happy wedding day.

617
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:03,940
 - Homer.

618
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:06,820
 - Congratulations, and many of them.

619
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:08,700
 Long life and happiness.

620
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:09,940
 Happy wedding day.

621
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:11,380
 - Hey, cut it out!

622
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:12,980
 What are you throwing at us?

623
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:15,180
 - Macaroni, I couldn't get any money.

624
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,020
 (audience laughing)

625
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,540
 - No, listen, Homer.

626
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:20,540
 (audience laughing)

627
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:23,720
 (audience applauding)

628
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:26,300
 (upbeat music)

629
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:36,780
 Boy, Homer, after what we've been through, do I need a pick up?

630
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:38,300
 Come on, let's go down to dehaven.

631
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,300
 Sure, him.

632
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:42,980
 Only thing is, gee, we've only got a nickel between us.

633
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:45,300
 Come on, think fast, Homer, think fast.

634
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:48,540
 Well, Henry, when I came through your kitchen.

635
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:49,540
 Yeah.

636
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:52,980
 Just by coincidence, the refrigerated door sort of opened.

637
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:57,660
 And just by coincidence, there was a bowl of yellow butterscotch pudding.

638
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:59,160
 marshmallows on top.

639
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:02,020
 Boy, Homer, what are we waiting for?

640
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:04,220
 That's a swell idea.

641
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:07,780
 Why, of course, jello puddings always are a swell idea,

642
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:10,620
 because you never tasted anything better.

643
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:13,460
 Jello chocolate, butter, scotch, and vanilla puddings,

644
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:14,940
 a trio of treats.

645
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:17,180
 And that's why folks enjoy them so much.

646
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:19,020
 Sure, jello puddings are nourishing.

647
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:20,980
 Sure, they look tempting and luscious,

648
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:22,740
 and sure, they're easy to fix.

649
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:24,380
 But the main thing about jello puddings

650
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:30,260
 It is they taste so grand, smooth as cream, chock full of old-fashioned homemade goodness.

651
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:31,820
 They're made with milk and nourishing.

652
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:34,380
 They cook to perfection in just about five minutes.

653
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:52,140
 But first and foremost, when it comes to jello puddings, you never tasted anything better.

654
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:56,600
 hoping you'll be in your living room and ours next week at this same time tonight

655
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:03,600
 folks

656
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:12,100
 the old rich family starring Ezra Stone is Henry with Jackie Kelker's Homer is

657
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:16,140
 written by Patricia Jaudrey and Dell Dinsdale with music by Jack Miller

658
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:19,380
 Mr. and Mrs. Aldrich our house Jameson and Katherine Rott

659
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:24,180
 Ezra Stone is currently appearing in The Alchemist at the New York City Center Theatre.

660
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:26,820
 And this is Dwight Weast in New York saying,

661
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:30,180
 "The Aldrich Family was brought to you by Jell-O Pudding."

662
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:49,300
 [

663
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:56,300
 The follows immediately are the most of these same stations.

664
00:27:56,300 --> 00:28:07,100
 This is NDC, the National Broadcasting Company.

665
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:09,600
