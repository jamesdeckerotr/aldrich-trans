 [Music]

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 And we have milk!

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 Come on, mother!

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 [Applause]

00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 [Music]

00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:41,840
 The Old Witch family starring as the stone written by Clifford Goldsmith brought to you

7
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,600
 by the puddings that are tops in taste.

8
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,600
 Yellow pudding.

9
00:00:45,600 --> 00:01:11,400
 They say the happiest years of your life are the teens.

10
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,400
 But I know one person who has his doubts about that.

11
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,740
 Henry Aldrich.

12
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:19,080
 Henry has all the troubles and growing pains

13
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,000
 that most boys go through under high school days.

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,160
 For Henry is a typical American boy.

15
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,000
 Tonight out in Centerville, the Aldrichs

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,080
 are just having dinner and are seen

17
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,000
 open from the dining room of the Aldrich Hope.

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,320
 Have another lamb chop, are they?

19
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,960
 No, thank you.

20
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,320
 You want anything?

21
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,440
 Sam, I'm so tired of planning meals

22
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,600
 and cooking meals I don't know what to do.

23
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,400
 - Chop their off, they're good, mother.

24
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,300
 - Yes, Mary.

25
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:49,240
 - Say, say, who do you think I was just talking to on the phone?

26
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,080
 - Who, Henry?

27
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,080
 - Kathleen.

28
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,580
 - The folks want me to come over for dinner Saturday night.

29
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:54,580
 - Tomorrow night?

30
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:56,440
 - Sure, ain't that a break for you, mother?

31
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,440
 - Why for me?

32
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:00,120
 - Well, if I'm not here, you can just have any old things for dinner.

33
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,600
 (dinner whirring)

34
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,880
 - What do you mean, she can?

35
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,240
 - I've got to go out in the kitchen and whip some cream.

36
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,960
 - I'll be playing the table, mother.

37
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,600
 - Boy, can you imagine?

38
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,360
 - We're not here the rest of us invited, Henry.

39
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,700
 He didn't mention any of you.

40
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:16,360
 Goodness knows the Anderson's have been here, often enough.

41
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,880
 Mary, is that very kind?

42
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,760
 Well, Father, get them by and Henry,

43
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,000
 hardly any way to put off a social debt.

44
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,240
 Henry, would you be disappointed if you didn't go to Kathleen?

45
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,280
 Not go.

46
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,440
 Have you forgotten what they've done to you?

47
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,280
 Sunday?

48
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,440
 Sunday.

49
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,140
 It's Mother's Day.

50
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:37,520
 Oh, but Father, I'm just going for dinner Saturday night.

51
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:40,320
 Well, I'd plan to take your mother and you and Mary

52
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:43,120
 out to dinner Saturday as a Mother's Day celebration.

53
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,020
 You had, Father?

54
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:46,560
 No, it's up to you as to where you'd rather go.

55
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,120
 Oh, see, I don't want to offend Mother, but I--

56
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,520
 You'd rather go to Kathleen?

57
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,720
 Well, I don't know.

58
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,720
 So hard thing to decide.

59
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,640
 It isn't every day that mothers have a day.

60
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:03,360
 Hey, you're coming this way when you bring your place?

61
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,640
 I'm not coming that way, Mary.

62
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,880
 What would you like to do?

63
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,600
 Well, I'll phone Kathleen.

64
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,680
 Yeah, sure, I'd love to go with you.

65
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,840
 Well, I guess I ought to get mother something nice, don't you think?

66
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,160
 Lend it.

67
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,960
 Would you care to contribute anything toward it?

68
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,200
 [LAUGHTER]

69
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,480
 I'd like to contribute.

70
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,600
 I'll tell you what.

71
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,920
 Let it be a present from the entire family.

72
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,240
 It seems to me, son, you should have saved up for this occasion.

73
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,160
 I have, Father.

74
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,360
 I have.

75
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,040
 I've earned nearly $5.

76
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,760
 Only I hate to see it all go at once.

77
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,280
 [INAUDIBLE]

78
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,320
 I'm not through with my plate, Mary.

79
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,080
 I'm not through with that either.

80
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,580
 You may take my plate, Mary.

81
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:43,820
 Thank you, Father.

82
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,680
 You're glad somebody in this house cooperates.

83
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,020
 Father, Father, how do you think Mother would like to have me get her a new dress?

84
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,020
 A dress?

85
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:52,020
 Sure.

86
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:53,920
 I don't see what would be so difficult about it.

87
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,240
 All I have to do is get Mother down to the store and just happen to take her by the dress

88
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,240
 department.

89
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,240
 And what?

90
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,260
 And as we go by, I say, "See, Mother, look."

91
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:05,360
 And she'll say, "Oh, isn't that one swell?"

92
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,200
 And I've got it all picked out.

93
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,800
 But supposing she picks one of the more expensive dresses.

94
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,800
 Well, I wouldn't mind this sacrifice.

95
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,000
 I just assumed spend the whole $5.

96
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,800
 [GUNSHOT]

97
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,600
 I think I ought to do something for Mother.

98
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,200
 She-- she-- she puts up with a-- with an awful lot from us.

99
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,200
 Hey, honey.

100
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,000
 Mother wants to know what you drank in milk this afternoon.

101
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,200
 Just one glass, Mary.

102
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,200
 Well, what you drank was cream.

103
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,700
 Cream?

104
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,200
 Cream?

105
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,200
 I thought that was awful rich when I drank it.

106
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,200
 Now, isn't one stock out there to whip?

107
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:41,720
 She was well what color on Sunday. I'll make up for everything. Give me while I

108
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:48,160
 pick this. I'm not through with that plate. I've got my chop in my hand.

109
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,680
 I have your bread and butter plate. But you're not to come any closer than that.

110
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:57,360
 And Henry will you please eat your choppers you should. But Father I waste

111
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:02,680
 so much when I eat it politely. Mary you wouldn't like to go in on something

112
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:07,000
 real nice for Mother's Day would you? I'd plan to get Mother something alone Henry.

113
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,200
 What? A blouse. A blouse Mary? A blouse? Mm-hmm. No skirt.

114
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:20,520
 My goodness I'm gonna pay nearly 395 for it as it is. 395? Just for that and nothing below it?

115
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:29,480
 You lost the bias skirt? Well how much would one come to? The very cheapest would be 295. What?

116
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,480
 Yes.

117
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,480
 I wonder whether Mother wouldn't like to go to the movies instead.

118
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,480
 I'm coming Mother.

119
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,480
 Father, there's an awfully good movie this week.

120
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,480
 Oh, what is it?

121
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,480
 The cowboy returns.

122
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,480
 Yes.

123
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,480
 I didn't even be willing to blow the whole family to her.

124
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:48,480
 Well first don't you think you'd better make sure the cowboy returns is what your mother wants to see?

125
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,480
 Well I would have her choice.

126
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:55,480
 You know Father, if we didn't go to an expensive place, I could almost take the whole family to dinner too.

127
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,480
 I think the movies will be sufficient.

128
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:00,480
 Oh no, Father, I know of a place where it's very reasonable.

129
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,480
 I'd be glad to take all of you. How about it?

130
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,480
 How did you make room for this dessert?

131
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,480
 Mary, Mother can't hear me out there, can't she?

132
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,480
 Mother, is she even speaking to you?

133
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:11,480
 She isn't, Mary? She will.

134
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:14,480
 How would you like to go to the movies Mother's Day Eve?

135
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,480
 What's that, Henry?

136
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:18,480
 Saturday night. I mean it. We're all going to the movies and to dinner.

137
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,480
 - As my guest. - Really?

138
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,480
 - As Father. - Is right, Mary.

139
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:26,480
 That's wonderful. Because I was going to take Mother down to get that blouse.

140
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,480
 Now we can meet you right afterwards.

141
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,080
 Boy, there isn't anything Mother likes more than a party.

142
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,680
 Here's your dessert, Santa.

143
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,880
 You want any cream as Henry saw it.

144
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,880
 When Mother that cream I drank was in a picture.

145
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,680
 Look, of course it was in a picture.

146
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,880
 What, do you mind if I change the subject of cream just a second?

147
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,280
 Mm, to what?

148
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,280
 What are you doing Saturday night?

149
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,280
 Dear, I'm probably cooking dinner.

150
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,280
 D'yaar?

151
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,680
 We're all going to meet downtown for something.

152
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,680
 For what?

153
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,680
 Don't tell her, Mary.

154
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,120
 Where should we meet?

155
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,360
 At the employee and department store at 4.45.

156
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,120
 It's all set, 4.45.

157
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,320
 That's going to make it terribly late for me to get home and cook dinner.

158
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,320
 Don't worry about cooking dinner, mother.

159
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,680
 But what are we going to do?

160
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,520
 She wears you wet. You're going to have one of the smallest times you ever had in your life.

161
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:31,520
 [Music]

162
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,520
 Oh, pardon me, sir.

163
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,520
 What is it, lady?

164
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,520
 Have you seen anyone waiting here at the entrance to the Emporium?

165
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,520
 No ma'am, not recently.

166
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,520
 Oh, thank you very much.

167
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,960
 Here it is, 12 minutes after five.

168
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,480
 I don't mind waiting so much.

169
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,840
 I just keep wondering if they haven't been in an accident.

170
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,680
 - Yes, ma'am.

171
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,520
 - It's a perfect way it is.

172
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,920
 - My fucking powers, lady.

173
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,760
 - No, thank you.

174
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:53,160
 - Wouldn't you like to buy some carnations for mother's day?

175
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,640
 - No, thank you.

176
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,400
 Well, you ought to remember your mother

177
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,560
 that telling anyone can do.

178
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,400
 - Yeah.

179
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,560
 - And we've been waiting for a family

180
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,760
 one time, where she has to go see

181
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,080
 and say a family in action.

182
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,520
 - Boy, boy, can I have a piece of please?

183
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,360
 Here you are.

184
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,880
 One foot street is the family live.

185
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,600
 It's nobody in this town.

186
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,040
 Then I swivel need the paper.

187
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:15,880
 Excellent.

188
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,160
 Great place for our entrance.

189
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,000
 Alice.

190
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,280
 Alice, why have you been waiting here at this entrance?

191
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,000
 Sam, where on earth do you think I'd wait?

192
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,760
 Well, I've been standing around the corner.

193
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,520
 That's not the main entrance, Sam.

194
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,920
 Well, Alice, that is certainly the main entrance on that street.

195
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,240
 Well, at least you'll say that's something.

196
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,120
 The thing for us to worry about is my car.

197
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,080
 What's happened to that?

198
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:36,400
 I left it 30 minutes ago in a 15 minute parking phase.

199
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,040
 But that still isn't as important as Henry and Mary.

200
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:41,680
 They're probably at the entrance all the way around on market.

201
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,480
 Well go around and look.

202
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,240
 Where will you be?

203
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,240
 I'll wait right here.

204
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,720
 I won't move one foot.

205
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,440
 Ready.

206
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,160
 I can buy a box can if I'm other than.

207
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:49,960
 No thank you.

208
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,760
 The hand dips and carry film.

209
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,760
 No thank you.

210
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,760
 I can pay for my.

211
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,240
 No thank you.

212
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,960
 Thanks Carc Red for his carry.

213
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,960
 For your mother.

214
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,560
 He wished you were the will of your bin.

215
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,640
 Right here where I was supposed to be Henry.

216
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,600
 Imagine that.

217
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,440
 Where have you been?

218
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,840
 Just inside the door.

219
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,880
 Why dear did you wait in there?

220
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:12,120
 But mother, I think the inside of a door would be the only logical place to wait for someone.

221
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,120
 Couldn't you have at least looked outside?

222
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,880
 I finally didn't, Mary, you were.

223
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,800
 Where's Mary?

224
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,080
 I had no idea where.

225
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,360
 Where's her father?

226
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,720
 Your father's gone down to the market, street entrance, to see where you are.

227
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,360
 I?

228
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,640
 Why would he look for me there?

229
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,560
 Well, dear, you take me right here, were you?

230
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,920
 From where I was here.

231
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:34,680
 Oh, I don't mean to argue with you, but all that's been separating us is that door.

232
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,480
 Yes, Henry.

233
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:41,080
 Now, supposing you take this nickel and go inside and telephone and see where the Mary has left the house here.

234
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:41,720
 Yes, Mother.

235
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,960
 Tell her the store closes at five-thirty.

236
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,460
 Yes.

237
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:47,800
 Extra space for a young child, this is a fear.

238
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,360
 Boy, boy!

239
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,720
 What am I currently like?

240
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,320
 Where have you been, Mary?

241
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,400
 You're going and dropping this as I was reading.

242
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,800
 I thought he never would die.

243
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,840
 What's he?

244
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,040
 He'll go in and do our shopping.

245
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,360
 Well, not until Henry and your father get back.

246
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,280
 Where are they?

247
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,520
 Henry's phoning you.

248
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,760
 And your father's waiting for you around the market.

249
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,960
 Isn't that ridiculous mother?

250
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,360
 It's completely easy.

251
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,560
 What have we got to do now?

252
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,260
 Wait for them until I get back.

253
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:13,060
 I'm afraid we have, dear.

254
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:14,760
 Now at least one of us better.

255
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:18,360
 You stay right here while I go around and get your father.

256
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,760
 - What's in your father? - Of course I can find him.

257
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,560
 Now don't move until I get back.

258
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,060
 No mother.

259
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:26,460
 - Pardon me, sir. - What do you have, lady?

260
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,460
 On what floor are the blouses?

261
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:31,460
 Are they going inside of the elevator to get off on the third floor?

262
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:32,460
 Thank you.

263
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:36,380
 You suppose it would take me more than three minutes to run any that one?

264
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:37,900
 After that I couldn't say.

265
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,820
 Dear, I wonder where...

266
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,660
 Mary, Mary, where is your mother?

267
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:43,580
 Mother, where did you come from?

268
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:44,780
 What do you think I came from?

269
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:46,860
 Mother, guess I went around after you!

270
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:48,140
 Now, what did you do that for?

271
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:49,980
 So we wouldn't have to wait so long.

272
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:50,700
 Where's Henry?

273
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,300
 She gets our phone in me!

274
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,300
 What's that?

275
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,540
 Don't you think I ought to go in and tell him I'm here?

276
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:58,140
 You wait where you are, I'll go in.

277
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,140
 Yes, Father.

278
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,140
 Flowers.

279
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:01,140
 Flowers.

280
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,140
 Some mother's day.

281
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:03,140
 Press, Connie.

282
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,140
 Um...

283
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:06,140
 Mother, I'm going to need another nickel.

284
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:07,140
 She whizzed, Mary.

285
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,140
 Where's mother?

286
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:10,140
 She's gone after father.

287
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,140
 Where's father?

288
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:13,140
 She thought you were phony.

289
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,140
 Yeah, but Mary, I couldn't get you.

290
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:16,140
 Of course you couldn't.

291
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,140
 I'll go get father.

292
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:18,140
 How long will he be gone?

293
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:19,140
 Two minutes.

294
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:21,140
 And, oh, can't we?

295
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:22,140
 So you're at the house.

296
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,140
 What did she want?

297
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:26,140
 Henry, did you tell her you couldn't come to dinner?

298
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:27,140
 Sure I did.

299
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:28,140
 the message with the maid.

300
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:30,140
 So, Kathleen, it's nothing new.

301
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:31,140
 Well, she wished she couldn't be.

302
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,140
 She's Perry Bell Candid for Mother's Day.

303
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:36,140
 Listen, Mr. are you going to be here for a few minutes?

304
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:37,140
 Uh, yeah.

305
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:39,140
 Well, could you deliver a message for me?

306
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:45,140
 If you see a lady or a man or my sister looking for a phone, a brown suit like this,

307
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:48,140
 could you tell him I just stopped in to phone a second?

308
00:11:48,140 --> 00:12:05,140
 [Music]

309
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:08,140
 Well now friends, while Henry is reflecting on his latest predicament,

310
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:11,140
 I'd like to bring you a news item about something that happened the other night

311
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:14,140
 in one of Centerville's finest families.

312
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:19,140
 The headline reads, "Terminants Local Man Trapped in Raid."

313
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:21,140
 And the article goes on to read,

314
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:28,140
 "Last night, about 1130, one of Centerville's leading citizens was surprised by his wife,

315
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:32,140
 just as he had tiptoeed to the kitchen, raided the refrigerator,

316
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:35,140
 and finished eating a dish of pudding.

317
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:38,140
 Jello butterscotch pudding that had been left over from dinner.

318
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:43,140
 His wife was desolated, as she had been planning to eat the Jello butterscotch pudding today for lunch.

319
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:48,420
 lunch but the culprit showed no remorse when questioned he merely kept repeating

320
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:53,780
 I'm glad I did it yes and I do it again I simply can't resist yellow butter

321
00:12:53,780 --> 00:13:01,620
 but it's not putting well friends seriously that is just another way of saying

322
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:06,580
 the jello butter scotch pudding is the dish that people won't be denied probably

323
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:10,180
 it has something to do with the grand buttery brown sugar flavor of its well

324
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:14,260
 dessert and the fact that Jello butterscotch pudding is as smooth as rich

325
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:19,360
 golden cream undoubtedly plays a big part in its appeal at any rate this

326
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,020
 mellow treat is a mealtime favorite in thousands of homes the country over and

327
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:28,780
 I'm sure you'll find it's your favorite too so try some real soon you've honestly

328
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:34,540
 never tasted the more luscious desserts than Jello butterscotch pudding

 [Music]

330
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:48,540
 Well now getting back to Henry Open.

331
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:54,540
 Henry has just learned that although he's going out with his family, Kathleen is expecting him for dinner.

332
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:57,540
 This scene opens in Kathleen Madison's home.

334
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:00,540
 Hello?

335
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,540
 Hello?

336
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:03,940
 Is that you, Kathleen?

337
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:04,940
 No, tell me.

338
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:08,140
 Did Mary tell you we were having dinner at seven instead of six thirty?

339
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:08,640
 Yes.

340
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,040
 Didn't your maid tell you?

341
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,040
 I'm going out for dinner with my mother.

342
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:26,540
 -

343
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:26,540

 -

345
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,640
 What's the latest I could get there and still eat?

346
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,040
 Well, well...

347
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:38,340
 Well, I guess when you stop the thing of a Catholic, maybe that would be trying to do too much.

348
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:39,340
 Sadly?

349
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:40,540
 Who are you talking?

350
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:44,040
 Mother, can we all rely on Mother?

351
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,240
 Henry can't come next Saturday night.

352
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,040
 Oh, well, no.

353
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,540

 I look here when the oldies come next Saturday.

533
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,880
 Let's have everything just as nice as we know how.

534
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,880
 Mm-hmm, yeah.

535
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:20,880
 Do it up proud.

 [MUSIC PLAYING]

537
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,880
 Isn't it nice to have one being at home?

538
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,280
 Mm-hmm.

539
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,280
 Mm-hmm.

540
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,280
 See, the dog is one today.

 [LAUGHTER]

542
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:37,080
 Did I hear the doorbell rings?

543
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,480
 Now, who in the world is to pose that is?

544
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,880
 Well, it's probably Daniel.

545
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,560
 Well, I'm not going to answer the door.

546
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:45,160
 I'm going to run up there now listen to our day.

547
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,360
 Daniel is going to notice those curlers.

548
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,760
 All right.

549
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,960
 I'll go to the door.

550
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,560
 Well now we're where where's my other

 Oh, come in.

00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:00,160
 Come in the door.

554
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:00,660
 Come on.

555
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:01,660
 Let him in and find you.

 Flip a letter.

 Oh, look at the ashes all over my face.

 Hello.

00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,060
 Hello Bob.

 Well, well.

 Hello.

565
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,760
 Is this a terrible way for us to drop in?

566
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,760
 No, no, no, not at all.

567
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,760
 Where is it?

568
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,760
 At the auditor.

569
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:25,760
 Oh, well, why don't you ask them to come in?

570
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,760
 They are in.

571
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,760
 I know they're dollarty.

572
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:33,760
 Well, Alice, some sad everywhere.

573
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,760
 How do you do, Mr. Anderson?

574
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,760
 Well, you might as well put your things down,

575
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,760
 and let's all go into the living room.

576
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,760
 - Living room? - Oh, my goodness, Alice.

577
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,960
 I was just going upstairs to take these curlers.

578
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,760
 - Dorothy, you look lovely. - Well, here we are.

579
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:51,760
 - Aren't you glad now, Mother? We didn't go to the movie?

 - Yes, indeed. - [chuckles]

 - Sit down, everyone. - [chuckles]

 - I know, mind if I do. - Yeah. Well, love.

 - Love, love, love. - How...

584
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,760
 - The Howhouse business, um...

585
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,760
 - Oh, pretty good.

586
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,760
 - How's yours?

587
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,760
 Well, I'm sorry.

588
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,760
 Did I interrupt you, Sam?

589
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,760
 No, no, no. I interrupted you.

590
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,760
 Oh, no, you didn't.

591
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,760
 What were you going to say?

592
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,760
 Well, the fact is that I don't remember what I was going to say.

593
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:24,760
 Well, I was going to ask Alice what movie she was going to see.

594
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:27,760
 "Dog for Love." Oh.

595
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,760
 Oh, my dear, they tell me that's the most beautiful picture.

596
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,760
 Is that? Yes.

 Mr. James, is Kathleen out in the kitchen sort of helping you?

600
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:47,160
 No, no, she's upstairs, studying.

601
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,160
 - Oh, is that right? - Yes.

00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:52,060
 Uh, have a cigar, Sam?

603
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:54,360
 Oh, no, no, thank you.

 Not just before...

00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:57,960
 - Mother!

606
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,660
 - Mother, how's that in here?

607
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:00,960
 - No, dear.

608
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,660
 It's eye-capped, Wayne.

609
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:04,360
 - Oh, is that right?

610
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,620
 I'll be right there.

611
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:08,760
 Robert, would you mind opening the window just linked to?

612
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,760
 You see, we had fake and onions for dinner,

613
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:14,060
 and I'm fed the whole family to be the same.

614
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:17,160
 Fake and onion?

615
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,960
 Do you like some, Henry?

616
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,760
 Oh boy, do I.

617
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,460
 Mother's very fond of them, too.

618
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:25,760
 Alice, I want to show you something.

619
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,360
 This box, Kathleen gave me for Mother's Day.

620
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,560
 Isn't that lovely?

621
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,860
 Why is it, Mrs. Andy's?

622
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:32,960
 I have no idea, Mary.

623
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,480
 Looks like candy to me.

624
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:38,960
 Well, if it is, I should never promise Kathleen I wouldn't open it till tomorrow.

625
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,720
 You did, promising.

626
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,840
 Well, Robert, did you come up there and help me in the air?

627
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,240
 Alex, would you excuse me?

628
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:46,760
 Of course.

629
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:53,560
 Well, if you pardon me, I'll go out to the kitchen and see whether we have any ginger ale on the ice bar.

630
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:56,520
 Oh, Bob, don't bother. We just had dinner.

631
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,680
 Bob, I'm angry. Supposing he could hear you.

632
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:01,760
 Well, Henry, so we invited you up for dinner.

633
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:05,200
 Some places been a very serious mistake.

634
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,200
 I'll be putting it mildly.

635
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:11,000
 And this is the most embarrassing moment I've ever had.

636
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,600
 The thing for us to do is to get out of here.

637
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,000
 Well, I think we should stay long enough to be polite.

638
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,200
 Say, mother is hungry as I am.

639
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,800
 You're not any hungrier than the rest of us, Enray.

640
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,800
 Oh, I had valence with a cup of cheese.

641
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,600
 And I didn't have anything.

642
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,800
 Supposing Alice, we run on before they discover the mistake we've made.

643
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:27,800
 Oh, Father.

644
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,400
 Father, do you mind if I make a suggestion?

645
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,200
 I do.

646
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:37,300
 Alice will tell him it's holly, but we're going to run on to the movies, and as soon as we get away, we'll go get some dinner.

647
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:41,200
 I have a sort of apology to make you folks, I'm afraid.

648
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,300
 Oh, I'm a trouble, Bob.

649
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:45,700
 Well, it's the ginger ale, but we don't have any ice.

650
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:46,700
 [LAUGHTER]

651
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:49,200
 No, no, listen, Bob, I give you my word.

652
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,500
 Not one of us could drink a thing.

653
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,700
 And besides, we're going to have to run along.

654
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,700
 No, no, that's your same channel.

655
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:57,200
 We're sorry, Dorothy.

656
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,000
 It's so important that the leaves are not as great as it is, dear.

657
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,160
 - Well, yes, yes, Dr. C.

658
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:05,200
 Tomorrow, being Mother's Day, we told Alice

659
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,360
 we were coming here, but we're really taking her

660
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,200
 to the movie.

661
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,200
 - Well, well, isn't that love?

662
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,360
 - Yes.

663
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,000
 - Bob, why don't you and I get on, I think.

664
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,200
 Go on with him, huh?

665
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,360
 (audience laughs)

666
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,200
 - Good idea.

667
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,000
 - And then they get a new thing together.

668
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,600
 - But, Mrs. Anderson, let me explain something.

669
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,440
 - Henry?

670
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,920
 - But, Mother, Henry.

671
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,560
 - Yes, Mother.

672
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:27,680
 Mrs. Anderson, we'd be very glad to have you come along.

 [Music]

674
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:47,600
 Oh, wasn't that the best Pixar episode of "The Only Life?"

675
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:52,160
 Yes, Dorothy, and it's been the best Mother's Day party I ever had in my life.

676
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:54,080
 Would you like another hamburger, Mother?

677
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,200
 No, thank you.

678
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,800
 three is all I could possibly eat.

679
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:58,800
 Father.

680
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,640
 Oh, yes, I'm just too warm.

681
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,240
 My honey, this is the smartest idea of yours

682
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:06,000
 that we drop into this little hamburger stand.

683
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,240
 Thank you, Mr. Anderson.

684
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:09,040
 I had been in one of these places in years.

685
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,080
 I loved them.

686
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,120
 Sam and I used to drop in all the time.

687
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,320
 Oh, Mr. May, I have the check, please.

688
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:17,160
 Oh, now Henry, I don't pay the check.

689
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,440
 The movies were on you.

690
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:22,360
 But Mr. Anderson, this whole evening has been on me.

691
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:24,480
 Yes, Henry, it certainly has.

692
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:40,480
 [Music]

693
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,480
 Henry Aldrich will be back in just a moment.

694
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:47,480
 It ends the next time that you want to give a party, there's no need to send out invitations.

695
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:52,480
 You just drop the word here and there that you're planning to make some jello pudding whipped.

696
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:56,640
 Before you can say come in, you'll have a house full of smiling guests.

697
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:00,640
 Yes, this well-used is certainly become a big favorite, and there's every reason why it's

698
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:07,000
 huge, because jello pudding whip is wonderfully good and downright easy to make.

699
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:12,160
 You just take one package of jello, any flavor, and one package of jello vanilla pudding, and

700
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,280
 make them up as you usually do.

701
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:18,000
 Then chill the jello and flip it as directed on the box.

702
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,480
 Next, you chill the jello vanilla pudding and add it to the fifth jello, beating constantly

703
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,120
 until it's blended.

704
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,400
 Then mold.

705
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:31,120
 And there you have a grand, inexpensive treat, serving 10 to 12 people and simply ideal for

706
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,680
