00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:57,100
 In the comfortable home at 117 Elm Street, Centerville, USA,

8
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:00,100
 live friends and neighbors of yours, the Aldrich family.

9
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:04,100
 You know Sam and Alice Aldrich and their daughter Mary,

10
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:09,700
 And if you'd rather come in contact with a teenage boy, you'd certainly know Henry Aldrich.

11
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:14,300
 Now that it's Saturday morning, the scene opens in the Aldrich living room.

12
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:15,900
 Is it father, is it?

13
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:20,200
 - Hey, is it water, Henry? - Oh, I want to know with what a youth think it is.

14
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,600
 - So that I think what water is? - Peanut butter, father, is it ration?

15
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,800
 Henry, do you realize I put aside this whole day to work on my income tax?

16
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,700
 And you begin by mixing me up with a thing like peanut butter?

17
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:34,060
 Oh, excuse me. Only are they both under the government now.

18
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:36,300
 Is there any reason why you can't ask your mother?

19
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:38,980
 Well, she's up on the third floor and I thought if I yelled or weren't,

20
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:40,140
 what only disturbed you?

21
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,620
 Henry, I have no idea

22
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:44,140
 if the what the government is going to do about peanut butter.

23
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:46,540
 But I do know what they do if I don't get my tax in.

24
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:49,060
 Yes, sir. And I'm very sorry to have bothered you.

25
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:50,500
 Mother!

26
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,620
 Mother!

27
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:52,860
 Mother!

28
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,020
 Henry!

29
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:57,180
 Father, do you realize the terrible things you've gotten me into?

30
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:57,820
 What's that, Mary?

31
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:00,620
 My goodness, I'll never be able to face your gram again for as long as

32
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:03,120
 Mary, I'm trying to do my income tax.

33
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,420
 Now, please get away.

34
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:06,320
 But, Father, you told me we were going to have a snowstorm

35
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,920
 and it would last two or three days.

36
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,620
 All right, if I told you, then we'll probably eventually have it.

37
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:11,620
 Now, get away.

38
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:12,620
 What are the days again?

39
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:14,820
 I took the word and called everybody up and told them,

40
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:17,220
 "Joe Graham and I were giving a sleigh ride party tonight."

41
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,220
 Everything's all arranged in no love.

42
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:20,220
 What?

43
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:22,620
 The sun's shining, isn't it terrible? It's just like a spring day.

44
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:26,220
 Mary, for the last time, I am not interested in the weather or in peanut butter.

45
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,620
 What, sir? Mary, you're not the daughter you're for.

46
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:31,220
 Father, all I'm doing is telling him how upset I am.

47
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:33,160
 No, the urge is about your slay right party.

48
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,060
 It isn't your father's fault. It turned warm.

49
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:37,220
 My goodness, even the crocuses are coming out.

50
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:39,820
 What father said we rent for a terrible three-day splitter?

51
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:42,160
 Mary, anybody can make a mistake like that.

52
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,620
 But not that much of a mistake.

53
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,960
 I'm sorry, I agree with your father, Mary.

54
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:49,400
 It isn't important. Now, please run along and let him get his income tax done.

55
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,660
 Yes, mother, I'll go.

56
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:52,100
 Only I've got the phone practically.

57
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,740
 Everybody in this town and apologize for father.

58
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:55,820
 Thank you, Alice.

59
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:58,580
 Sam, do you want any of the things that in this box thrown out?

60
00:02:58,580 --> 00:02:59,820
 I'd love for you talking about.

61
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,380
 I just wrote it down from the attic.

62
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:03,660
 Alice, how do I know whether I want any of those things?

63
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:04,420
 Look at them all.

64
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,260
 All right, dear.

65
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:07,260
 Can't you go through it if I'm willing to wait for you?

66
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,260
 Just put the box under the table for now.

67
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:11,020
 Dear, I'm trying to clean this house up,

68
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:13,500
 not make it look worse in my goodness.

69
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:17,100
 So, here I don't see how you needn't begin to figure your tax.

70
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,300
 Alice, what are you doing?

71
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,860
 I'm opening the window.

72
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,060
 Time we ate out the house.

73
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,420
 Alice, my papers.

74
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:23,620
 Put a book on them.

75
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,340
 Just a nice little breeze.

76
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:27,420
 Anyhow, I want you to go up to the attic with me

77
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:28,740
 and bring down all the blankets.

78
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:29,580
 - What for?

79
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,380
 - I wanna hang them on the line, dear.

80
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:33,500
 This is too nice a day not to take advantage of it.

81
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,340
 - No, Alan.

82
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,880
 - I'll be back and help you just as soon

83
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,460
 as I've taken care of something.

84
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:38,300
 - Henry!

85
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,100
 - Yes, mother, I'm out in the kitchen.

86
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,460
 - Henry, where in the world did you get

87
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:42,900
 that caramel layer cake?

88
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,140
 - I got some cake, mother.

89
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:44,980
 - What is it?

90
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:46,980
 - That's a triple deck of peanut butter sandwich.

91
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,900
 - And exactly how are you gonna get your mouth

92
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,140
 around anything that big?

93
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:51,740
 - That's for me, Mrs. Aldrich.

94
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,180
 I can handle it all right.

95
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:54,100
 (audience laughing)

96
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,340
 We're going in a picnic.

97
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:56,180
 - A picnic?

98
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:57,020
 - Sure.

99
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,820
 They're going half a month late.

100
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,420
 But the peanut butter isn't racist.

101
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,720
 It isn't old boy.

102
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,020
 Hand me that knife, Henry.

103
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:04,320
 Now wait a minute, Homer.

104
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,720
 Henry, all I want to do is make one for Wilbur.

105
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,920
 For Wilbur?

106
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,020
 You're going to laugh here?

107
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:09,720
 Sure.

108
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,520
 Is he visiting you this weekend, Homer?

109
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,620
 Yes, Mrs. Aldrich.

110
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,620
 His folks seem to like to leave him with us.

111
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,920
 If you boys don't mind taking a famous butter,

112
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,520
 I'll make some hot soup for you.

113
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,720
 Hot soup, mother.

114
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,720
 I'm a hot morse.

115
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,720
 Stay like this.

116
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,020
 Mrs. Aldrich, we're taking some ice cold milk.

117
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:25,520
 And how are you going to keep it cold?

118
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,520
 We'll put it in the same spot and caulk it up real quick.

119
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:33,520
 Now listen, Homer, do you mean to say you're pointing to what little Wilbur will ruin our party?

120
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,520
 Henry, I can't help it if I have to take care of him.

121
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,520
 I know, but listen, I'm his uncle, aren't I?

122
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,520
 Sure, but I'm not.

123
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,520
 Henry, if I don't take him along my allowance, gets cut off.

124
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,520
 Now that's all there is to it. Okay, Homer.

125
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:49,520
 If you want to spoil the first 12th Spring Day we've had this winter, you can count me out.

126
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,520
 You're not going?

127
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,520
 No.

128
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,520
 And you can also stop spreading our peanut butter around as though we're free as well.

129
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,920
 I'm the soloist for you, sir.

130
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,120
 Now, wait, Henry.

131
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,420
 Give me one good sound reason why we'll be shouldn't go.

132
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:03,120
 I mean, outside of the fact that you just don't like them.

133
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,120
 We're going on our bicycles, aren't we?

134
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,520
 And how could Wilma possibly run along beside us and keep up with us?

135
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,520
 He was, he always has, hasn't he?

136
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:14,920
 You mean he can talk for 11 miles? That little kid?

137
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,620
 Sure, that's why I want to give him a peanut butter sandwich.

138
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:21,120
 And besides, it isn't 11 miles to Kenlow Point. It's only eight.

139
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,520
 It's a lot, it's eight.

140
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,920
 And if he gets tired, he can ride our handlebars.

141
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,520
 Hold on, I'm telling you, it's a webinar!

142
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,620
 Okay, where's your father? Where's your father?

143
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,920
 He'll know how far it is.

144
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,820
 Surely, well, I know how far it'll stay.

145
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:32,520
 Father!

146
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,920
 Mr. Aldrich, we want you to settle something.

147
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,520
 What's that?

148
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,020
 Father, how far would you say it is over to Kendall for?

149
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:40,520
 How far? 13 miles.

150
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,920
 13? 13. Not eight.

151
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,520
 Are you sure it is no webinar, Ray?

152
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,520
 13. Now, please get away from all these papers.

153
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,320
 But, Father, don't you think it's entirely too far

154
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:55,600
 a little kid that's only 12 during 13 miles all the way out there and 13 miles all the way back

155
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,840
 just so Homer can take care of him now listen Henry part of the way would be on handlebar

156
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:05,040
 Homer will you please stop waving that knife with a big gob of peanut butter on it

157
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:11,000
 oh she was I didn't even know I had it in my hand I'll just stand back better yet get out of the room

158
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,140
 boy what are you making your sound because in here for we aren't mother fathers just trying to show

159
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:17,740
 What a big mistake he's making.

160
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:21,820
 Mrs. Aldrich, wouldn't you say Kendall point is about eight miles from here?

161
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,260
 At the far end of the lake?

162
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:25,380
 Well, that must be about 50 miles.

163
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,140
 15 miles?

164
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:31,420
 Homer, will you look at that garb of peanut butter right in the middle of my income tax?

165
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:32,860
 Oh, he was.

166
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,100
 That my peanut butter.

167
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:34,860
 Homer Brown.

168
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:35,860
 I can scrape it up.

169
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,620
 The government will never know what it was.

170
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,180
 [LAUGHTER]

171
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:43,420
 Alice, is there any reason why I can't put Homer's name down as one of my dependents?

172
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:45,340
 [LAUGHTER]

173
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:47,840
 I don't know why you shouldn't, Mr. Holley.

174
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,640
 My father does, and my uncle does.

175
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,940
 Your uncle does, Homer.

176
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:54,840
 Sure. He sends me $25 every Christmas

177
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,840
 and puts me down every March 15.

178
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,040
 Homer, do you mean your uncle Wilbur?

179
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,840
 Oh, no. Wilbur's my nephew.

180
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,040
 He depends on me.

181
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,240
 Homer, stop waving that peanut butter.

182
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,440
 I know why I'll do, will it?

183
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,940
 Well, now you're safe.

184
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:10,040
 Homer, did you put all that in your mouth at once?

185
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,040
 Uh, fine.

186
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,640
 - Oh, oh, oh, oh. - Oh, are you all right?

187
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,640
 - Right. - Oh, oh, oh.

188
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:18,240
 - Henry, take him out and force the water down.

189
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,640
 - Oh, come on, Homer. I'm gonna try to look for you.

190
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,440
 Going out, you'll plead you.

191
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,940
 (loud music)

192
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:26,840
 - Come on, let's go, let's go.

193
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,440
 (loud music)

194
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,440
 - Father!

195
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,440
 - Mary, I'm out here in the backyard.

196
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,040
 - Oh, Father is on the phone and wants to know

197
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:39,040
 whether it's legal to the desperate, broken fishing tackle.

198
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,840
 The limit's not unless he was fishing for business reasons.

199
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,760
 He also wanted to explain about the surf tax or something.

200
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,880
 Jerry Marv call him just as soon as I get this wash hung up.

201
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,880
 Now Sam, all we're hanging up is blankets.

202
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,600
 Blankets and bathing suits.

203
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,640
 I haven't been near my income tax for an hour and a half.

204
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:58,080
 The idea of hanging bathing suits out in broad daylight at this time of year.

205
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,760
 Sam, I found them screwed all over the attic floor.

206
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,520
 And incidentally, have you any ideas

207
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,360
 to what could have become of Henry's suit?

208
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,520
 Isn't it here?

209
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,240
 Mother, Mother, what do you think has happened?

210
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:07,840
 What, Mary?

211
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,640
 I was just talking with Jimi Anderson and you know how his father's editor of the paper, don't you?

212
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,140
 Yes.

213
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:17,440
 Well, Jimmy says he thinks it's the funniest thing he's ever heard and he's going to have his father put a whole story about it.

214
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,240
 About why?

215
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,340
 Why am I inviting everybody to a sleigh ride party on the hottest day of the year?

216
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:23,640
 Just because father said we were going to have a blessing.

217
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:27,440
 Mary, it isn't the hottest day of the year. Look at me. I've still got my coat on.

218
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:32,440
 What father? I've been trying to phone the livery stable all morning to cancel my order for the sleigh and they don't answer.

219
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:32,840
 So what?

220
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:36,540
 Mary, no one in his right mind is going to deliver a sleigh on a day like this.

221
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:38,540
 or they couldn't even move a sleigh without any snow.

222
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:40,100
 But, Martha said there would be snow.

223
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:43,420
 All right, Mary, but I can't go out and buy some for you.

224
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:45,620
 Incidentally, Sam, do you see what I see?

225
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:46,380
 Where?

226
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,140
 Off there in the sky, right over there.

227
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:50,340
 What do you mean, that little cloud off to a candle point?

228
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:51,820
 Yes, Sam, what a boy's went.

229
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,620
 Doesn't that look as though it might rain over there?

230
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:55,780
 Now, Alice, there isn't a drop of water in that cloud.

231
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:57,380
 It looks like rain to me, Martha.

232
00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:00,500
 Mary, it isn't as large as one of these blankets.

233
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,220
 Alice, Alice.

234
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,020
 Sam, where are you?

235
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,180
 - Get out of the clothesline, bro.

236
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:05,620
 He's under all those blankets.

237
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:06,620
 - Alice!

238
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:08,620
 - Then get up before you get some dirty.

239
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:11,360
 (dramatic music)

240
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:17,940
 (dramatic music)

241
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:24,540
 - Henry, did you see me dive off that rock?

242
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:27,220
 - Yeah, boy, cold, isn't it?

243
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:29,180
 - Cold? It's wonderful.

244
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:30,700
 - Oh, I didn't mean cold.

245
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,180
 I mean, it's just a little cooler

246
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:33,180
 I thought it would be.

247
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:36,180
 Well, this is the first time we've been in this year.

248
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,180
 Naturally, we've got to get used to it.

249
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:42,180
 Listen, the light gets still warmer than if we've gone all the way up to Kenlow Point.

250
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,180
 I think sure it is.

251
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:46,180
 Talk me that towel, Homer, here.

252
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:50,180
 When you get through, they've hung it on that bush that our clothes are under.

253
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:51,180
 Okay.

254
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:53,180
 Well, I'm glad we didn't bring Wilbur.

255
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:54,180
 Same here.

256
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:57,180
 Even if it did cost me the price of a movie to get rid of him.

257
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,180
 Sure.

258
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,180
 And the beautiful part of it is, Homer.

259
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:04,560
 He won into that movie before I was ever in a clock and he hoped he out before a phrase.

260
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,560
 Sure.

261
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,560
 Do you want him to take a sandwich and with him?

262
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,400
 Sure.

263
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,720
 The big triple deck of peanut butter.

264
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,360
 Wasn't that being fair with him?

265
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,840
 Sure, she was.

266
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,840
 I thought it was more than generous.

267
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,680
 Henry, what are you shaking for?

268
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,040
 Oh, I'm not shaking.

269
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:19,600
 Oh, come on.

270
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,040
 Let's give him for the water again.

271
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,200
 Henry, could you see that island out there?

272
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:23,700
 Yeah.

273
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,400
 And do you see that cabin on it?

274
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,160
 Let's warm out and explore it.

275
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,000
 Oh boy, why not?

276
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,680
 By the time we get there the sun will be out again.

277
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,480
 OK, come on.

278
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,280
 Come on yourself.

279
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:39,040
 Oh boy, oh boy.

280
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,040
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

281
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:51,360
 Hello, Sam, all you speaking.

282
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,520
 Sam, this is Alice.

283
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,440
 Hello, where are you?

284
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,800
 I'm downtown shopping, dear.

285
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,480
 Did you take the blankets in?

286
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,080
 Take them in.

287
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,280
 I didn't know I was supposed to.

288
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,000
 I thought you wanted them to air all day.

289
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,280
 But, Sandra, did you realize it's raining?

290
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,760
 Raining when it began to rain.

291
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,480
 At least a quarter of an hour ago,

292
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,360
 and Sam, you said it wasn't going to.

293
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,000
 I did?

294
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,720
 Yes, of course.

295
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,120
 And I took your word and wore my brand-new spring coat

296
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,120
 and hat down here.

297
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,000
 Overline a second.

298
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 I want to look out the window.

299
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,600
 What for?

300
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,720
 Yes, Alice, it's raining.

301
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,200
 It's raining quite hard.

302
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:18,920
 But that's the side.

303
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,760
 It's going to stop as quickly as it begins.

304
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,200
 Sam, it's even turning cold.

305
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,680
 Now, please bring the blankets in right this minute here.

306
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,800
 But Alice, my income tax.

307
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,080
 And they're all wet anyhow.

308
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,080
 Yes, Alice, I'll get them in.

309
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,080
 Goodbye.

310
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,080
 Goodbye.

311
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,080
 Is that you, Mary?

312
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,080
 Yes, my goodness.

313
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,080
 It's Mrs. Nivet Johnson, phone.

314
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,080
 Mary, you're just the person I want to see.

315
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,080
 Go out, please, and bring in the bedding.

316
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,080
 But, Father, I guess I'm told to get an umbrella

317
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,080
 because you were wrong about it.

318
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,080
 It's not raining, and I simply have to run back

319
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,080
 over to the town then.

320
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,080
 What for?

321
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,080
 Because I haven't been able to get worded

322
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,080
 and then I'm not having a sleigh ride.

323
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:51,080
 But Mary, well, that's a fine thing.

324
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,080
 Hello.

325
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,080
 Hello.

326
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,080
 Is this, Sam?

327
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,080
 Yes.

328
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,080
 This is Elizabeth Brown.

329
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,080
 Who?

330
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,080
 Oh, yes, yes, hello.

331
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:02,080
 Sam, I'm sorry to bother you, but his little billboard over there.

332
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:06,080
 Wilbur, no, he went along with the boys out to Kendall Point.

333
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,080
 Oh, my goodness. They took the billboard all the way?

334
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,080
 Yes, they're going to spend the day on a picnic.

335
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:13,080
 And you let them? Sam, I don't want to criticize.

336
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,080
 But didn't you realize it was going to rain?

337
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,080
 Elizabeth is probably going to stop any minute.

338
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,080
 Just to say, but it's time global probably ringing with.

339
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,080
 There isn't anything to worry about, Elizabeth.

340
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:24,080
 I know some people that live down there on Kendall Point the year round

341
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,080
 and I'll give them a call right away.

342
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,080
 What good will that do?

343
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:30,640
 I'll tell them to take an umbrella and go out and look for the boys and make them come into the house.

344
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,840
 Now don't you worry.

345
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:49,120
 Hey, there's no use looking out the door every 10 minutes when

346
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,300
 Stop writing!

347
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:54,160
 I wonder why they built this cabin without any window.

348
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,460
 That's what I was thinking.

349
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:57,160
 You closed the door, Henry.

350
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,320
 Hold on. You getting cold?

351
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,360
 No.

352
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,960
 What makes you think I'm cold?

353
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,080
 I can't remember if you were shivering.

354
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,320
 Oh, no.

355
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,400
 Ever since I squeezed my bathing suit out,

356
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,800
 I feel a lot more comfortable.

357
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,320
 You know, Homer, I sort of wish we had gone

358
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,840
 of that movie with Wilbur.

359
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,800
 Same here, even if I have seen it once.

360
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,560
 Did you say it was pretty good?

361
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,260
 Boy, it's one of the most exciting movies I ever saw.

362
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,860
 Here's the daylights out of you for about two days.

363
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,060
 Hey, God?

364
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:27,660
 She will below the like it.

365
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,160
 And the best part of it is Henry,

366
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,960
 his folks don't like him to go to the movie.

367
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,260
 No, why not?

368
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:33,360
 I don't know.

369
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,860
 You've only let him see about two in his life.

370
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:39,060
 It's what it be a special treat for him.

371
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:41,060
 It's in a lumber camp, see?

372
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:43,660
 And there were two men fighting by a river.

373
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:45,160
 And a tree starts to fall on,

374
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,160
 and then they jump in the river to get out of the way.

375
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,460
 Boy, the time carries a mite down to the dam.

376
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:51,460
 Yeah?

377
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:52,460
 So the dam?

378
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,460
 Yeah.

379
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:57,260
 Boy, when I saw that tree fall, I yelled right out loud.

380
00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:01,860
 And then boy when the dam broke, did I make a fool of myself.

381
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,660
 Oh, I think it stopped raining.

382
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:04,660
 I don't hear anything.

383
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:06,860
 Oh boy, didn't I tell you it was clear?

384
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:07,860
 Oh, come back.

385
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,360
 You were gonna warm this up.

386
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,560
 Open the door.

387
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,060
 [crying]

388
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,060
 Oh boy!

389
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:17,060
 Henry, what did you trip on?

390
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:21,060
 I didn't trip, I slept on the ice on what ice.

391
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:24,060
 Oh boy, forget all of me.

392
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:27,060
 You went with all this ice come from.

393
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:29,060
 You can't even see the ground.

394
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:33,060
 Imagine if I was at home, I'd be supposed to water a little bit.

395
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:37,060
 Why worry about that, Henry? How are we going to get to the water?

396
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:38,060
 Oh, come on.

397
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:41,060
 Oh, well, you might be cold on my ice.

398
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:43,060
 Henry, let go of me. Do you want me to slip again?

399
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:45,560
 How about you let it go, a mejo boy?

400
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,760
 You have no comers in the beginning of the snow?

401
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,760
 He was imagined to know at a time like this.

402
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:53,260
 Homer, do I see a cross on the lake?

403
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:55,360
 No, I don't think so.

404
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,960
 But you dive in first.

405
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,960
 [ [Laughter]

406
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,360
 Homer, hello, who's that over there?

407
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:01,860
 Where?

408
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:04,360
 That's almost standing on the shore, he's watching us.

409
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,760
 Oh, it looks like an admit cap.

410
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,660
 Oh, yeah.

411
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:09,260
 Fuck, he's going on.

412
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:12,360
 Oh, well, it has to be done, it's got to be done.

413
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,360
 You mean you're going in?

414
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,360
 How is it?

415
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,360
 Oh boy, come on in!

416
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,360
 Oh boy!

417
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,360
 Hello!

418
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,360
 I can't open my eyes!

419
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,360
 I can't even breathe!

420
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,360
 Oh boy!

421
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,360
 Oh boy!

422
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:28,360
 You know, I'm sort of glad that camp's off to win.

423
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,360
 Why?

424
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,360
 I think we've gone to school all the morning.

425
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,360
 I'm trying to tell them we've been swimming in the snowstorm.

426
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,360
 They wouldn't have believed it.

427
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,360
 I'll say, they would have just said we were crazy.

428
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:41,120
 (dramatic music)

429
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:49,240
 - But look, Father, it's a regular blizzard out.

430
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:52,200
 - Of course it is, Mary, didn't I tell you all the time?

431
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,280
 - And what am I going to do?

432
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,640
 - You shouldn't believe me in the first place.

433
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,960
 Never canceled your party.

434
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,400
 - There's at least four inches out there

435
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,560
 on the ground already.

436
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,280
 - I've never been able to account for it,

437
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,440
 but whenever there's a three or four day blizzard

438
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:05,000
 on the way, I just feel it in my left knee.

439
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,040
 - Well, my goodness, there isn't any reason

440
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,720
 We couldn't have the sleigh ride party.

441
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,400
 Of course not.

442
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,520
 You better go right to that phone and start calling people up.

443
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,240
 Yes, I will.

444
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,000
 I wonder what Joe Graham's going to say.

445
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 Sam.

446
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,160
 Yes, Alice, are you back?

447
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,160
 I certainly haven't.

448
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,120
 Frankly, I was never thought said in my life.

449
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,720
 Mother, just look at your hat and coat.

450
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,160
 Yes, Steve.

451
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,280
 Now, Alice, calm down.

452
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,320
 When your things dry up, there'll be as good as new.

453
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,640
 You told me, Sam, it wasn't going to rain.

454
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,760
 I said it wasn't going to rain very long,

455
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,440
 and it didn't.

456
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,320
 It turned to snow.

457
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,040
 But Sam, if you forgot the hen rain.

458
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:32,600
 Hen rain.

459
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,440
 Don't you realize what's happened?

460
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,000
 I just saw Ned met Cap down.

461
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,500
 How many said he'd seen Henry in Homer in swimming?

462
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,800
 Where in the YMCA?

463
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,600
 No, dear, in a blizzard at the lake.

464
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,100
 Now, Alice, don't be ridiculous.

465
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,900
 That's where we went, send this morning.

466
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,400
 Alice, that'd be sensible about this.

467
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,500
 Henry and Homer are all warm and comfortable.

468
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,300
 How do you know they are?

469
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,700
 Because I call down to Kendall Point and told her family

470
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:53,000
 that I'd go out and get them.

471
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 Oh, who part into filming?

472
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,300
 And, Mother, I'm sure there isn't anything to worry about.

473
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:00,000
 You know, you can't believe has the things, Ned Metcalf says.

474
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 You can't believe?

475
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,200
 That's right, Alice. You know his father.

476
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,600
 All right, Sam.

477
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:08,000
 If you say there's nothing to worry about, then there's nothing to worry about.

478
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 [Music]

479
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 Now getting back to the troubles of Henry Olgrich.

480
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 Henry and Homer have gotten rid of Homer's young nephew Wilbur by sending him to a movie

481
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 in order that they might go on a picnic.

482
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 But what started off to be a pleasant spring day has become a mid-winter blizzard.

483
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 The scene opens with the two boys standing near the edge of the lake in their bathing suit.

484
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 Oh, the brothers will go on a thing I don't know.

485
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 Have you found him yet?

486
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 No, of course I have him.

487
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 We have them.

488
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 Now, let's wait a second, Henry.

489
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 Let's try to remember exactly which bush we left our things under.

490
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 Well, I thought it was this bush here, but everything looks so different.

491
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 Call me Snow.

492
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 I know one thing.

493
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 I'm not going all the way back to town in the snowstorm on a bicycle wearing the star and bathing suit.

494
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 Oh, pig in the snow.

495
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 Oh, no, a cause must be here full-class.

496
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 Which treated we hang the tower on.

497
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 How would I know?

498
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 Oh, well all we have to do is look for a white towel, Henry.

499
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 Sure, that's covered with white snow.

500
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 Homer!

501
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 Homer, I found something! I found something!

502
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 Oh, where? Come on, help me dig!

503
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 But he was where.

504
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 Something hard, it must be my shoe!

505
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 Oh, boy!

506
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 Look at it, Henry.

507
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 Homer, is that my shoe?

508
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 We'll hit it against that tree and not some of the snow.

509
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 Okay.

510
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 She was not a poor my shoe, but the peanut butter sandwich.

511
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 It is. Give me a bite.

512
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 You know, Hor, I should think both of peanut butter would be very good.

513
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 Sure. It ought to taste like peanut brittle.

514
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 Hor, Hor, look, I found my pants.

515
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 Oh, she's looking for the frozen sift.

516
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 Wait a second, I'll help you un-bend them.

517
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 Go easy, Hor, go easy, you want to pray?

518
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 Oh.

519
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 You said we can't put them on until we un-fold the legs, can't you?

520
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 Good boy, even if I get them straightened out, how can I get into them?

521
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,500
 Hit me, hit me, take a look away, just step turned.

522
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,000
 What is it?

523
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 It's a famous bottle. Didn't you let a point hot soup in it?

524
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 No, we put ice cold milk in it.

525
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 What did we do that for?

526
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 What color look like you picked up? What is it?

527
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 Oh, you're blind, it's my sock.

528
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 Stand back, why not the snow?

529
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 Hit me, are you sure that's a sock?

530
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 Well, oh boy.

531
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,600
 He was I'm not for he or I know.

532
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:10,300
 I said Joe, you made me look ridiculous.

533
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:13,000
 And you owe my father an apology for doubting his word.

534
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,880
 He said it was going to snow all the time.

535
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,280
 And Mary did do say he thought you ought to give the pardon?

536
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,560
 Yes, Mother, of course.

537
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:21,000
 And I'd call the stable and hired to spray and everything.

538
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,400
 I'll let you find it.

539
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,440
 Look out the window, Mother.

540
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,400
 Did you ever see the snow come down nice and?

541
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,760
 It is pretty, isn't it?

542
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:29,240
 What are those boards fathers carrying into the basement?

543
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,680
 Those are not boards.

544
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,040
 Those are our blankets.

545
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,360
 Oh, my goodness.

546
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,720
 They can hardly get them through the cellar door.

547
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,760
 How do you suppose that is?

548
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,200
 I'll answer it.

549
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:38,760
 Hello.

550
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:39,400
 Hello.

551
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,120
 Is this Alice?

552
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:40,680
 Yes.

553
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,720
 This is Elizabeth Brown.

554
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,520
 Oh, hello.

555
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,440
 Oh, Alice, I have something terrible to tell you.

556
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:44,920
 What's that?

557
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,120
 We found Wilbur.

558
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:46,680
 Who?

559
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,040
 Wilbur, we found him.

560
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,000
 What are we going to do?

561
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,040
 What do you mean, dear?

562
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,720
 He saw his way back to the snowstorm,

563
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,040
 and he came running into the house just frightened of this.

564
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:54,540
 Really?

565
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:56,640
 And Alice, I've never seen anyone so white.

566
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,640
 He was so upsetting and hardly talk.

567
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,040
 But where are Henry and Homer?

568
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,140
 That's the terrible part.

569
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:01,840
 What's that?

570
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,140
 All I could get out of Wilbur was an enormous tree,

571
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:05,140
 almost fell on them.

572
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:06,140
 Oh, my goodness.

573
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:08,940
 In the police, jumping in the water, and then Wilbur says,

574
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:11,340
 the current started carrying them down to the dam.

575
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:12,640
 Oh, my goodness, and then what?

576
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,140
 Wilbur said he was so frightened he just got up and ran home.

577
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,040
 Oh, my goodness.

578
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:16,840
 It's Wilbur.

579
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:17,340
 Yes.

580
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:18,540
 Well, Elizabeth, hold the line.

581
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:19,540
 Sam!

582
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:20,240
 Sam!

583
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,540
 You called your father.

584
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:22,440
 I'm right here, Alice.

585
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:22,940
 What happened?

586
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:25,380
 - And the blizzard blew a tree down. - Where? After the thought.

587
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:28,380
 No out on Kendall Point where the boys are, and I'll send him into the lake.

588
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:31,980
 - What's that? How do you know? - Wilbur ran back 15 miles through the blizzard.

589
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:34,940
 Just to get home with me. They've got a line right now.

590
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:39,060
 Well, Alice, tell her to tell Will to get some warm clothes on, and we'll start in 15 minutes.

591
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:41,180
 Yes, Sam. Do you want to take along some hot soup?

592
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:43,580
 No, get in to get an axe with a length of chain if you have it.

593
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:45,580
 But, Sam, I don't think you can get the car, too.

594
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:47,260
 I'm not going to take the car. Mary.

595
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:47,860
 Yes, Father?

596
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:52,740
 As soon as your mother hangs up, call the livery stable and tell them you want that play you wanted right away with a team of two horses.

597
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:54,540
 - Really, Father? - Yes, Alice.

598
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:57,340
 Elizabeth, Santa has to tell Willy's coming over to pick him up.

599
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:58,820
 Alice, I forgot to tell you.

600
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:01,420
 Willy said it was a tree, sir. It broke the dam.

601
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,340
 Oh, my goodness.

602
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:04,260
 Sam, the dam is a lake in broken.

603
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:06,100
 He said it was going to be flooded.

604
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:16,100
 - Well, how do your boys feel now? - See, we feel fine, Mr. McDowell.

605
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,940
 - You good and warm? - Oh, sure.

606
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,700
 We never felt better in our lives.

607
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:22,380
 And, gee, this is good hot soup you're life-six for.

608
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:24,980
 And so one of you boys didn't get pneumonia out there.

609
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:28,080
 Oh, gee, pushing our bicycles up the road kept us warm.

610
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:28,880
 Sure.

611
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,980
 And for where were we up?

612
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:33,480
 He was probably three minutes from where we found our clothes until we got here.

613
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,980
 So where's Mrs. Macau?

614
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:37,280
 She's out in the kitchen getting your clothes dried out.

615
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,780
 She says they're almost ready.

616
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:40,380
 Look, look, it stops knowing.

617
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:41,980
 Yes, stop the half an hour ago.

618
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:43,780
 It's cleared up real nice.

619
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:45,280
 Say, what's that I see out there?

620
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,180
 Where are Bob?

621
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:47,780
 Up on the hillside.

622
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:50,020
 That's a team of horses pulling a sleigh.

623
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:52,820
 Oh, gee, that's a squall idea. I wish I were on it.

624
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:53,460
 Me too.

625
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:54,740
 I wonder where those two fellows in

626
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,020
 think they're going.

627
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:57,500
 Boy, they're traveling fast.

628
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,660
 Oh, I guess what they're trying to do

629
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:01,060
 is take a shortcut over the Kendall point.

630
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:03,260
 But I wish they keep off my wheat.

631
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:05,780
 Just a second while I answer this phone.

632
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:06,380
 Hello?

633
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:06,700
 Hello.

634
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:09,700
 This is an emergency call lining up all a bill-bodied man.

635
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:10,500
 Yeah, with the trouble.

636
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,860
 The dam is in the lake, it's been blown up.

637
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:12,340
 What's that?

638
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:12,780
 Who did it?

639
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:13,780
 Nobody knows.

640
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:16,280
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

641
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:19,040
 (dramatic music)

642
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:25,280
 - Mother, Mother, what do you think?

643
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,120
 - What happened there?

644
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,480
 - Hey, look, it's coming up the front wall.

645
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,160
 - There is, it's your father with Henry and Homer.

646
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:32,320
 - It's Henry and Homer, all right, the father is no more.

647
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,440
 - Henry, you poor thing, come here.

648
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,400
 - Oh, Mother, I was just going around and back

649
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,800
 and hanging my bathing suit up.

650
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,840
 - See, you're coming here, are you all right?

651
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:40,680
 - Yes, you are.

652
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,280
 - Why do you ask that, Mrs. Aldrich?

653
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,000
 We never felt better in our life.

654
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,600
 - Oh, I don't see how you can, Homer.

655
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,940
 I happen to know exactly what happened.

656
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:49,300
 What happened, Mother, what do you mean?

657
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,680
 - Wilbur is home, dear.

658
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,520
 - Oh, is he?

659
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,800
 - Yes, Homer.

660
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,100
 - Who told my folk?

661
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:57,000
 - Yes, and the poor boy was never so frightened in his life.

662
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:57,840
 - You are?

663
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:58,680
 - Oh boy.

664
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,640
 - Oh, his mother said he was simply hysterical.

665
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,800
 He still can't talk.

666
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,880
 - Didn't I tell you he'd be scared, Henry?

667
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,960
 - See, I can't blame him.

668
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:05,960
 I was myself.

669
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,560
 - And I should think you would be.

670
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,720
 - She, when that tree started coming down,

671
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:12,040
 I thought, boy, I can't stand this.

672
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,240
 - You poor boy.

673
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,520
 - And then when I saw the water pouring over the dam,

674
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,820
 and I thought, "She'll close my eyes and it'll be alright."

675
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:21,920
 And Henry, do you remember the whole thing with horror too?

676
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,520
 Why, Mother, I don't remember any of them.

677
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,520
 Why, Mother, why don't you suddenly take a look out the window?

678
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,520
 What's happened?

679
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,520
 There was no other person.

680
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,520
 There was an address on the ground.

681
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,520
 Of course not, Mary.

682
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,020
 They haven't been any for the last hour.

683
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:34,520
 What am I going to do about my sunrise party?

684
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,520
 My goodness, the sun's just raining down.

685
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,520
 I think I'll open the window.

686
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,520
 I feel like some fresh air.

687
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,520
 Sure, Henry.

688
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,520
 Mother, I'll never be able to face anybody again.

689
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:47,720
 You know, Homer, if you look out of here, it probably seems possible that this was the

690
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,020
 day we had that blizzard.

691
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:51,020
 Henry, I'm worried about Wilbur.

692
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:53,520
 No, there is one thing for you to worry about.

693
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,320
 Just look out there on the lawn.

694
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,020
 There's another croak coming up.

695
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:59,120
 Oh, she was--look what's coming down the street.

696
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,420
 Oh, boy.

697
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:01,920
 Two men on horseback.

698
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:02,920
 Really?

699
