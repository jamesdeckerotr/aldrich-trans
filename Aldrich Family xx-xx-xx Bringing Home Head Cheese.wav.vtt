00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.520
 Tonight we offer as a curtain raiser that most nostalgic form of entertainment

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.120
 From the good old days.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.320
 The barber shop quartet.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.420
 Are you ready, man?

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:09.220
 He is more to be pretty than special.

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:17.520
 When he ought to like me, clear up on right, far and high.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.120
 I play in just one of those lagging.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.820
 Far home, half-decast isn't right.

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.820
 No, not right

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.820
 Do not spawn in this world's path for my need

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.820
 Do not laugh at this world, be gone fake

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.820
 Mmm, ooh, fake

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.820
 What you need is some helpful instructions

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.820
 On the facts that apply to this case

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.820
 Those facts, friends, are big

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.820
 Even can drink coffee without any facts

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.820
 There are many others who spend the wakeful night every time they touch coffee.

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:03.820
 Now, there is a mealtime drink which is capping pretty, stimulant drink.

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.820
 It cannot keep anybody awake, and it has a perfectly grand flavor.

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.820
 So to those of you who are affected by coffee, we say...

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:16.820
 You're not dally, but stop making possums.

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.820
 In our rich hands, I must see this drink.

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.820
 The sweet drink, drink

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:30.820
 She has to knock a trick into some time

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:35.820

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:06.820
 Epidol's teenage boys have an explosive but genuine point of view on their own,

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.820
 which grown-ups can appreciate but rarely understand.

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.820
 Every old rich knows that.

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.820
 But she opens on a business trade in front of a busy store.

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:18.820
 Henry's sister is she.

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:20.820
 But Henry, mother is working for it.

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.820
 That doesn't make any difference, Mary.

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.820
 I'm not gonna go down mainstream doing anything of foolish about it.

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:28.820
 Alright then, Henry, if you know I take mother her cheese, alright.

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.820
 But if she asked me why she didn't get it, I'll dress power.

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.820
 But, Mary, it isn't a cheese, I mind.

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.820
 Why do I have to carry your darn obelor in your pocketbook, too?

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.820
 Henry, I told you exactly 12 times I'm going over to play tennis with me.

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:41.820
 You know, we play tennis with the Anderson.

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.820
 Put the Mary in the first place, that's a green and yellow umbrella.

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.820
 And you're drawing pocketbooks practically as big as a suitcase.

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:51.820
 Oh, I can. Oh, you're all mothers waiting for cheese to put on a dish

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.820
 and fixing for your own dinner. And there she's wasting the kitchen

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:57.820
 wondering where the cheese is and who's then collecting a crowd.

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.820
 She's waiting for her and your candy.

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.820
 How about Father Garnish so when he comes home and finds those shoes on anything?

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:03.820
 How are you going to play Tim?

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:05.820
 Don't marry not too loud. I'll take it.

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:06.820
 And you're a dimmett.

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:08.820
 Well, thanks, Kevin. You're coming to your senses.

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.320
 Here's the tea. You can hear the pocketbook in the umbrella.

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:12.320
 But now, wait a minute, Mary.

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.320
 I haven't got time, Henry. Just take it home.

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.320
 But, Mary, why can't at least take your own grow-up?

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:18.820
 Listen, Agnes.

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.320
 How many ways you guys just deal with her?

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:22.320
 None of your business.

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:23.820
 She was cut out of my way.

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.820
 Oh, isn't he neat? Oh, isn't he neat?

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.320
 See, I'm mentally down in this wind.

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.320
 Listen, everybody. This business is funny.

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.820
 You realize my mother's waiting for a tea?

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.320
 Oh, is that the way your mother sent you shopping, Henry?

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:36.320
 I never mind.

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.320
 Now listen, Charlie, stop trying to twist my sister's umbrella.

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:40.320
 See, hear me?

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.320
 Bear, Darnie, you made me bite against the lamp post.

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:44.320
 Who did?

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:45.320
 Henry, he didn't hurt it any.

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:46.320
 He didn't too act.

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:47.320
 He won't even open now.

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:48.320
 I bet it will too.

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:49.320
 Go ahead, open it up.

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:50.320
 Yeah.

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:51.320
 I'll show you.

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:52.320
 Well, it opened.

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.320
 Oh, look at the tower, Henry.

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:56.320
 Holy whiz.

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.320
 Hey, Henry, you're petty post-jose.

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.320
 I was telling you, broken.

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:01.320
 I did not.

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.320
 You got it opened, didn't you?

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:04.320
 Yeah, Darnie.

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.320

 [MUSIC]

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.320
 Well, don't you think that's interesting, Alice? That book I was telling you about?

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.320
 Yes, Harriet. That's what I want to know is, what's become of Mary?

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.320
 Mary, are you expecting her?

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:29.320
 Yes, of course. She said she'd bring the cheese right home, and I can't put this macaroni in the oven until it gets here.

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.320
 But don't you think that's revealing, Alice?

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.480
 I mean what I was telling you about that book.

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:36.000
 What book about people having complexes?

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.400
 Now you take the barseg or your wrong maple string.

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.720
 You spoke for just finding out why he's always been afraid of water.

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:42.600
 Why has he?

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:47.320
 Well, once when Jimmy was just a baby, his mother left him alone in a bathtub and he got scared.

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:50.760
 And so today naturally, he's afraid of all water in general.

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:53.240
 - Nancy, sir. - I love there are lots of young people

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:56.560
 who have complexes about something or a shame or a sensitive.

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:57.880
 And nobody knows why.

00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:59.320
 Don't you think that's increasing?

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:02.620
 Yes Harriet, but all I want to know is where is my cheese?

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:05.120

 Let's see what the umbrella is for.

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:21.820
 Would you like to have me let you carry it for me?

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:24.020
 That is, would you-- here take it.

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:24.520

 "Do you see that yellow sign in two blocks up the street?"

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:37.540
 What about it?

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:39.540
 That's as far as I go for a dime.

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:41.540
 From there on, to another nickel, high in rate.

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:43.540
 Or who, what are you doing down here?

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:45.540
 Don't let me against this telephone pole.

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:47.540
 Wait a second, I'll walk along with you.

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:50.540
 Well, listen, I hope I won't be kicking you out of your white home.

00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:55.940
 You're right, homie. I'm not going anyplace. Hey look at me. Look at that kitten back of it. Where?

00:07:55.940 --> 00:08:03.040
 Haring the lady's pocketbook and the umbrella over his head. Oh, yes, I wonder where he came from. Boy, Henry. If he doesn't look crazy.

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:12.540
 In the first a while, where were you? Here you go, Henry. Boy, you see, we got back and hid the pants off. Oh, no, homie. Oh, no. Okay, Henry. Let's cross the street before the light changes.

00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:14.540
 Wait a minute stop pulling me

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:18.380
 No, but why do we have to run

00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:27.400
 We just gotta cross and turn let's go down this way well

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:33.240
 First could you wait a second for why I just want to wait here on the corner until

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:40.500
 Isn't that strange? I wanted to kill looking for nothing. I just wanted you on the corner until oh

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:42.460
 Oh boy.

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:47.960
 Now Sam don't be upset, it isn't my fault.

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:50.960
 I'm not upset, don't you were having dinner early tonight, so I came to...

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:53.960
 You can't hold my cheese, and I've been holding everything until she gets here.

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:55.460
 Alice, I'm not complaining.

00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:58.960
 And that saying seems to me that in a family this time you ought to have some distance.

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:02.960
 And Sam I tried to, but I certainly didn't know you'd get home before the cheese.

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:04.160
 Alice, in your area?

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:05.460
 It's Sam's still upset.

00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:08.960
 Well, I'm too thinking you are letting sit down at the table, even if dinner isn't entirely ready.

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:11.320
 Harry, why would we do a thing like that?

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:13.520
 Listen, didn't I just hear Mary come in with a cheese?

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:15.220
 Mary! Mary!

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:16.220
 Henry!

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:17.820
 Mother, are you calling I?

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:18.820
 Henry, is that you?

00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:20.060
 Will you come here to here?

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:21.660
 Mother, has anybody been here?

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:23.160
 Has anyone been here? No.

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:24.160
 Not anyone?

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:25.660
 Has anyone asked for a dime?

00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:26.360
 What's that?

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:27.760
 Well, he might have asked for 15 cents,

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:29.060
 but I hope he didn't give a choice.

00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:30.560
 Henry, what are you talking about?

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:32.460
 Well, I'll tell you, Aunt Harriet.

00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:33.760
 Has anyone seen Mary?

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:36.460
 No, Henry, I'm just gonna ask you whether you've seen her.

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:37.960
 So why is she here?

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:41.660
 Why, uh, I didn't see her. You saw her handling where?

00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:44.760
 Why, I think it was downtown in front of the Emporium.

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:46.360
 -How are you? -What's him?

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:50.260
 I don't want to appear to be rushing you, but I'm all washed in a time you're done and ready.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.160
 Then Mary disappears with the cheese.

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:53.360
 -She's what? -She's telling.

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:57.760
 I mean, look, mother, why don't you advance me part of week after next allowance?

00:09:57.760 --> 00:09:59.260
 Let me run out and get yourself.

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.760
 Now dear, I can think of no reason why you should pay for it.

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:06.960
 Why not? After all, you pay for the first fee, and this fee's handling is going to come right out of Mary's pocket.

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:07.960
 You mean over here?

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:10.560
 Yeah, Henry, take this money and get some cheese and bring back the cheese.

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:11.560
 Yes, Father.

00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:13.560
 You found the ration points out in the kitchen.

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:14.560
 Mother!

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:15.560
 Oh, boom.

00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:16.560
 Mary, is that you?

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:18.560
 I'll go out the kitchen door and come to the back way to the store.

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:19.560
 Henry, come back!

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:20.560
 Mary, here!

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:21.760
 It's too late, I will see you gone.

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:25.160
 Mother, I'm sorry, I'm a couple of minutes late, but I'll do all the dishes for you.

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:26.160
 Thank you, dear.

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:27.160
 That's very kind of.

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:28.160
 You, I'm sure.

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:29.160
 What's that?

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:30.160
 Never mind apologizing, Mary.

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:31.160
 Why did you take your cheese to play tennis?

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:32.160
 What's that, Father?

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:33.160
 Where's the cheese?

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:34.160
 Where's the cheese?

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:35.160
 Father, didn't Henry bring it home?

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:36.160
 Who?

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:38.880
 Mary, I didn't send Henry for it. I said you for it.

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:41.920
 Yes, Mother, I meant to make sure it got here. I sent Henry home with it.

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:44.160
 Oh, that's how worried I was about it.

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:47.600
 Where's my pocketbook? Your thoughts? My pocketbook and my umbrella?

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:51.440
 You mean you left them someplace? Mother, what did he do with them? What did he do with them?

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:58.440
 [MUSIC]

00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:02.960
 Excuse me, but could you give me some ideas for some of the things you carry in the store?

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:04.460
 Stationary writing papers.

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:05.260
 Pencils?

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:06.660
 Well, do you carry cheese?

00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:07.760
 Cheese!

00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:10.460
 Boy, every store I've been to is closed in my farm.

00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:13.460
 Have you seen a boy about this tall with a green and yellow umbrella?

00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:14.660
 A green and yellow farm?

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:17.860
 He was just a little kid about so high as when the traffic lights changed.

00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:20.960
 Do you know of any way of cooking macaroni without cheese?

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:22.360
 Macaroni without pork?

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:24.060
 Sure, it's my father's favorite dish.

00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:24.560
 Hm.

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:27.160
 Well, do you have a triflex with tomato sauce or bread crumbs?

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:28.660
 Tomato sauce or clums?

00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:29.960
 Not an idea.

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:32.760
 Look, would you mind foaming my mother and telling her how I fix it, please?

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:35.360
 No, but if she asks for me, don't tell her you're seen me.

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:46.600
 Mrs. Org, you mean to say he didn't even come home for dinner?

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:47.580
 No, Homer.

00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:50.520
 Oh boy, he promised to go to the movies with me tonight.

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:53.040
 And boy, if he doesn't get here soon, we're gonna be late.

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:57.720
 Oh boy, do you mean to say Henry doesn't even know the name of the boy he gave in their his pocketbook and umbrella too?

00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:58.880
 No, Mrs. Org.

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:00.880
 He came up to a bar here on me.

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:06.680
 And he had pants in the sweater on, and he came out of a clear sky and disappeared into a clear sky.

00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:07.680
 Ahh!

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:08.680
 Yes, Sam!

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:12.180
 May I have to pray you ever got the idea of putting crumbs on my corona?

00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:15.680
 The year someone phoned me just before dinner and told me about it, men hung up.

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:17.680
 And I'm so surprised I just went ahead and did it!

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:19.180
 [laughter]

00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:19.680
 Eh?

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:21.180
 Well, don't ever do it again!

00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:25.180
 Boy, if Henry's much lighter, look and I have to sit right in the front row.

00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:27.180
 And will I have a stiff necked mark?

00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:28.180
 Mother!

00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:29.380
 Henry is actually...

00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:31.380
 He was Henry where have you been?

00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:35.380
 Well, Mother Henry, where is Mary's pocketbook and umbrella and your father's keys?

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:37.380
 That's what I want to try to tell you.

00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:39.380
 First, Henry, may I ask something?

00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:41.380
 Homer, would you please wait out in the halls?

00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:42.380
 Yes, Mrs. Orridge.

00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:44.380
 Only when do you think we can start for the movie?

00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:47.380
 Not my sister's ministry and now please leave the room.

00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:48.380
 Yes, Mrs. Orridge.

00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:52.380
 Only the last time I had a stiff neck it lasted a couple of days.

00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:55.380
 Homer, don't you realize my mother's trying to give me a...

00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:56.380
 Not Mary.

00:12:56.380 --> 00:12:58.380
 I'm making up a list of all the things that ran my pocketbook.

00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:01.740
 in my pocketbook, and I'm very much afraid I'm gonna have to hold you responsible for

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:02.740
 nothing.

00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:03.740
 Well, I happen to know there wasn't any money in it.

00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:06.380
 He means it's not I suppose your little son went through it too.

00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:08.220
 Mary, he was not my little friend.

00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:09.220
 Then who was he?

00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:11.060
 He was just someone that was carrying it for me.

00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:14.060
 Then I phone half a dozen different people to find out whether any of them knew who the

00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:15.060
 kid was.

00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:17.620
 Well, I certainly couldn't get all out during the next two years.

00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:18.620
 Mary, if it was...

00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:19.620
 Well, cheer y'all, Penny.

00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:20.620
 It's all a promise.

00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:23.620
 We'd increase the 20 cents a week beginning next October.

00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:24.620
 Me and me.

00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:25.620
 They're telling us not to.

00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:30.040
 Homer Henry appreciate your wanting to take him, but I'm afraid you'd better go with Alvin

00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:34.440
 Okay Henry, I'll keep my eyes open around the theater for any kid with an umbrella

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:35.440
 Goodbye!

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:36.440
 Where are you?

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:37.440
 Where are you?

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:38.440
 Where are you?

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:39.440
 Hello, Henry!

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:40.440
 You mind that, Harriet?

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:41.440
 Good night!

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:42.440
 Where are you going to bed this early?

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:43.440
 Right, yes I feel a little tired.

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:45.920
 Harriet, I've never been so completely confused in my life.

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:47.920
 I don't know what's confusing about it.

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:50.120
 He's got a complex just the way everyone else has.

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:51.120
 He has pot?

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:52.120
 Alex?

00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:54.520
 This has problems, but I've been building up in him for years.

00:13:54.520 --> 00:14:00.280
 Didn't he tell Homer the reason he gave that boy Mary's umbrella and pocketbook and cheese was because he just couldn't carry it himself?

00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:03.920
 Yeah, and there you are. But Harry had a complex about what?

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:10.400
 He's Alice. He's never like it. He's always for it. And today it's just got the best of him. That one little piece of cheese.

00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:15.520
 Now Harry, Alice, I'm going to send that book over to you. It awaits you up to a lot of things.

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:17.840
 No, the way you think it's happening. Mary, what do you sound like saying?

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:22.360
 You know, Mother, I was sitting in the other room trying to think who that boy was and Harry doesn't seem to know anything about.

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:27.360
 And finally I went to the phone and called Mrs. Johnson and, oh my goodness, mother, she jumped right down my throat.

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:28.360
 She walked Mary.

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:29.360
 And Harry, I didn't know my word.

00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:33.360
 All I said was, Mrs. Johnson could have been your boy that took my pocketbook.

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:34.360
 What's wrong with that?

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:35.360
 And she was rude to you?

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:38.360
 Well, of course she was. Mary, you stepped right on her complex.

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:42.360
 I did what? Mary isn't that the telephone idiot? Oh my goodness, mother.

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:43.360
 I'll go answer it.

00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:47.360
 Mother, if it's Mrs. Johnson calling back, tell her I'm very sorry, I didn't realize she was sick.

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:48.360
 Hello?

00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:49.360
 Hello.

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:51.360
 Mrs. Allitt, Mrs. Miller.

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:56.660
 I don't want to seem to be trying to talk him into letting Henry go to the movies, but I think you wanna know something.

00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:57.460
 What about?

00:14:57.460 --> 00:15:02.460
 It's raining, cats and dogs, Mrs. Aldrich, and everybody in terms out with their own balance.

00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:04.860
 And the Henry's missing a great opportunity.

00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:20.440
 [

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:22.440
 I'm sorry to say that you're saying your question did.

00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:23.440
 Here, take the phone.

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:25.440
 Well, thank you.

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:26.440
 Flow?

00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:27.440
 Can I have that, you?

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:28.440
 Yeah.

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:29.440
 Well, this is Homer.

00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:31.440
 I'm talking to you from a booth in the theater, Henry.

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:32.440
 But where?

00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:34.440
 You been a guy on your clothes and come right down here.

00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:35.440
 Why?

00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:37.440
 Well, they just put on a couple of hats, see?

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:40.440
 And there's a guy that walks a tightrope with an umbrella.

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:42.440
 She lives with a dog, kid?

00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:44.440
 No, but it's umbrella, yellow, and green, Henry.

00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:46.440
 And it might be the kid's father.

00:15:46.440 --> 00:16:03.440
 [Music]

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:06.440
 Now getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldrich.

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:10.440
 Rather than carry his sister's pocketbook and umbrella right out on the main street,

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:13.440
 Henry hired a small boy to carry it for him.

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:18.740
 In trying to cross out a busy intersection, Henry's slave disappeared.

00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:22.440
 The scene opens the next morning in the oldish dining room.

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:23.440
 Alice!

00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:24.740
 Sir, am I such a good city's friend?

00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:25.540
 Who's long ago?

00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:28.740
 I have, I have, but before I leave the office, I'm gonna have a talk with Henry.

00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:30.940
 If you ask me, it might be time he came down to breakfast.

00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:31.640
 And Mary!

00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:32.440
 Yes, Mother!

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:35.040
 I guess we're falling to jail, Mr. Two-Bother, it could have been their little girl,

00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:36.840
 but Henry might have mistaken for a boy.

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:39.540
 Here, you didn't insinuate that their daughter stole anything, did you?

00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:42.540
 No, but my goodness, people are certainly getting touchy in this town.

00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:45.540
 Well, go upstairs and tell Henry he used to be down here in two minutes.

00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:46.040
 Alright.

00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:49.940
 As telling just because I said he must have been bed last night doesn't mean he can't ever come down.

00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:50.740
 Yes, mother!

00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:53.040
 Mother, what's the next step?

00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:54.340
 What do you mean, Sam?

00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:56.940
 I've called everyone I can think of that might have a small son.

00:16:56.940 --> 00:16:58.040
 Is his own the bin?

00:16:58.040 --> 00:16:58.740
 Yes, darling.

00:16:58.740 --> 00:17:02.240
 Great, last.

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:04.040
 He's suffering with something that's pretty bad.

00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:04.840
 She said what?

00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:05.940
 And that's what she said.

00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:07.740
 And you're having an awful time here on straight.

 That's just how it's imagination.

 There's nothing wrong with Henry.

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:11.440
 He's upstairs down the street.

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:12.040
 Mother!

00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:14.440
 Yes, Mary! What did you think? Now what are you saying?

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:15.840
 Mary, does Henry refuse to come down?

00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:18.560
 No, neither he isn't even up, Mary. He's apparently dressed in lots of homes.

00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:19.040
 What's that?

00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:20.340
 Say, I'm hearing you going.

00:17:20.340 --> 00:17:21.140
 I'm gonna look for it.

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:22.340
 Well, there I go along with you.

00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:24.440
 Why goodness, Mother, do you think he's hiding in the attic?

00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:25.840
 Mary, tell me something.

00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:27.940
 Confidentially, what is it, Henry's got?

00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:30.340
 What is he got? He hasn't got anything. That's the trouble.

00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:31.840
 What's that? Look at this, Link.

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:36.040
 This Homer happened to be all the articles that happened to be in my pocketbook when he happened to lose it.

00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:38.740
 Let's see. There it is. Homer, I'm practically ruined.

00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:41.040
 She did you have all that in one pocket book?

00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:42.240
 I certainly do.

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:44.540
 Some of those things have to be irreplaceable.

00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:45.940
 What's this word here?

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:46.940
 Hecticus.

00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:47.940
 That was the late Hecticus,

00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:49.540
 how about the long July I carry it?

00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:51.640
 And if you even had a hand and brought an initial on it?

00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:53.640
 Yeah, my goodness, I got that to the phone.

 To whom?

00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:09.340

 Yes I have.

 No, Harry, there isn't anything wrong with Henry.

00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:15.940
 He's just as well as you and I are.

 Well, what's the old run mean street for driving young children?

00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:24.940
 He grabs them from a backstab and twists them around and looks at them and then runs on grabs another.

 You want some of them?

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:28.340

 Oh, this is a pretty windy corner, Henry.

00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:54.640
 Have you thought about that? It might have just lifted him right away.

 Look, Homer, look! Who's that boy across the street?

00:18:56.640 --> 00:19:00.640
