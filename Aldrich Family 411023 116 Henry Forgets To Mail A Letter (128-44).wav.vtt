 The Aldrich family written by Clifford Goldsmith and starring Ezra Stone.

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.420
 Entertainment for All the Family brought to you by Postam,

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.060
 attempting wholesome drink for All the Family. Postam.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.380
 Yes, folks, it's time again to drop in on the Aldrich family.

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:02.280
 Time to enjoy the relaxation that comes from a visit with this typical American family.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.380
 Relaxation, of course, is something we all need.

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:09.280
 And sometimes, if a tense, nervous condition prevents you from getting it,

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.380
 it's well to ask this question.

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.680
 Is coffee making you nervous?

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.080
 Would you be better off drinking Postam instead of coffee?

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:22.580
 Well, now far be it for me to imply that there aren't many folks on whom coffee has no ill effects, whatever.

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.880
 That's obvious when you consider how popular coffee is.

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.580
 But I do know that coffee does make many people nervous.

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.580
 So if you think it sets your nerves on edge, switch to postem.

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.580
 Postem contains no stimulants, nothing that could possibly affect your nerves.

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.080
 Drink postem with all its flavor and fragrance instead of coffee,

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.580
 and see if that nervous feeling doesn't go away.

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:49.580
 See if you don't feel really relaxed again, once you give postem a fair trial.

 And now Henry Aldrich joins the ranks of America's favorite youngsters.

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.580
 A boy from your own block, or even perhaps from your own home.

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.580
 We join Henry Aldrich and his friend Homer in the Aldrich living room.

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.580
 The time is just before dinner.

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.580
 G-Homer, if that isn't a nice thing to do to my best coat.

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.580
 Now listen, Henry, you talked just as though I turned it into the lake on purpose.

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.580
 I didn't know my girl was going to jump.

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.580
 When? When the bee attacked her. Out in the canoe.

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.580
 Well, gee whiz, Homer, look at my coat soaking wet.

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.580
 And I'm supposed to wear it to the lecture next week.

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.580
 Alright, Henry, if that's the way you feel about it,

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.580
 watch and see if I ever borrow your coat again.

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.580
 And look at the things in the pockets.

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.580
 Look at my girl's picture. She's all warped.

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:02.580
 [laughter]

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.580
 Part of that's natural. It is not.

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.580
 I wonder when Worth is one of the best?

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.580
 Oh boy. What's the matter?

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.580
 Oh boy. What have I done now?

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.580
 Look at this letter, it's ringing wet.

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:15.580
 Who's it from?

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.580
 I don't know who it's from.

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.580
 Only somebody in my family gave it to me the mail last week.

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:21.580
 They did?

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:24.580
 Yes, Homer, and I never thought you'd do a thing like this to it.

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:25.580
 Who's it addressed to?

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:29.580
 Well, that's the trouble. Can't you see the water's washed or the ink off the envelope?

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:30.580
 Whose name is on the bag?

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.580
 Not so loud, Homer. Do you want my mother to hear you?

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.580
 Henry, are you almost ready for dinner?

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:38.580
 Why, uh, yes I am, Mary.

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.580
 Here, Homer, take this coat and this letter up to my room.

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:41.580
 to my room now.

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.980
 Sure, and put them on the radiator and turn on the heat.

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:44.980
 Okay.

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.540
 Oh, Mary, your mother found for you to come home a long time ago.

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:48.540
 Oh, she did.

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:49.540
 Thank you.

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.460
 Mary, I've been intending to ask you.

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.260
 Is Joe Graham still out of town?

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:56.260
 Yes.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.860
 That's what I thought.

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:03.300
 If I remember correctly, you gave me a letter to mail to him, didn't you?

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:04.300
 Yes.

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:05.300
 That's what I...

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:07.940
 Did you ever get an answer?

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:08.940
 Yes.

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:09.940
 Oh.

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:11.940
 Well, that's fine.

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:12.940
 Why do you ask?

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:13.940
 Why was just wondering?

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:14.940
 Mary!

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:15.940
 Yes, Father!

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:16.940
 Your mother wants you to help her in the kitchen.

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:18.940
 Oh, my goodness, I'll go right out.

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:19.940
 Hello, Henry.

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:20.940
 Oh, hello, Father.

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:21.940
 Oh, my gone home?

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:22.940
 No, sir.

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:23.940
 He's upstairs, drying...

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:24.940
 He'll...

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:26.940
 He's upstairs, sort of...

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:27.940
 He's upstairs.

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.940
 You say he's upstairs?

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:31.940
 Yes, sir.

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:32.940
 Just temporarily.

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:34.940
 How did everything go with you today?

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:35.940
 Fine.

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:36.940
 How's...

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:46.820
 business. Fine. How are the males coming through? The males. What males? Just the

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:51.020
 males. Well they're coming through. Fine. Why do you ask that? Well I was just...

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.340
 Henry! Yes mother. Didn't go on the table. We'll be right there.

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:00.500
 Then come in and stock up. Yes, Alice. Look mother. Is there anything just

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:05.260
 all pan that you can think of that I haven't done that you told me to in the

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:09.820
 ask few weeks. What do you mean by that? Well, I don't know. I was just asking.

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:12.660
 Now, that's how the ticket's going with the lecture at the women's club.

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:16.640
 Sam, I'm worried sick. What's the trouble? Well, dear, I haven't had any word from the

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:19.660
 man that's coming to give the lecture, and here it is less than a week old.

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:24.500
 Mother, aren't you chairman of the lecture committee? Yes, dear. Why, yeah. Why don't you

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:29.860
 hear from him? Well, Henry, I wish I knew why. Oh, when did you write to him?

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:34.600
 Last week. I gave you the letter to mail. You gave it to me? Sam, I'm almost

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:39.940
 positive I did. Didn't you mail it? If you gave it to me I mailed it. Henry did

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:44.440
 mother can I have the bread please? Here you are. And father shall I pass this

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:48.680
 who's it to mother? Yes please. Goodbye Henry. I think everything's gonna be all

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:53.760
 right. What's that Homer? What's going to be all right? Well I don't think he

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:57.360
 meant anything special father. Sam how much time do you think I'd need to get

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:01.320
 an answer to my letter? Well three or four days should be more than enough.

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:03.320
 Actually, it only takes two.

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.320
 Mother, what city does the lecturer live in?

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:09.320
 He doesn't live anyplace. He travels all over.

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:11.320
 Oh, that's too bad.

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:14.320
 Maybe that's why he didn't get your letter, Mother.

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:16.320
 He's spending all of this month in Chicago, Mary.

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:17.320
 In Chicago?

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:18.320
 Yes, Henry.

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:19.320
 On what street?

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:21.320
 What difference does it make?

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:24.320
 Alice, are you sure you addressed the envelope correctly?

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:27.320
 I'm almost positive. I sent it to 721 St. Eagleston Drive.

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:28.320
 721?

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:29.320
 Yes, dear.

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:30.320
 What's his name?

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:31.320
 What's his name?

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:32.320
 Henry!

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:34.920
 Well, Mary, can't you take an interest in this lecture, too?

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:36.320
 I'm not going to us!

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:37.620
 Oh, yes, you are, dear.

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:38.620
 We're all going.

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:39.620
 Am I going?

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:40.620
 Now, Sam, you've got the day.

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:41.620
 And Roy, an entire evening?

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:44.620
 Dear, I don't care for John Williams-Steber any more than you do.

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:47.820
 But after all, I'm Chairman, and the least you can do is go in here, Steber.

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:48.820
 Steber?

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:49.820
 Steber?

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:51.020
 How would you spell a name like that?

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:52.720
 Henry, what difference does it make?

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:58.180
 Well, after all, suppose somebody came up to me and said, "Did you ever hear of John Williams-Steber

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:02.980
 721 St. Agleston Drive Chicago. I wouldn't even know how to spell it.

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:13.180
 Sam, have you been able to get them?

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:17.180
 No, Alice. The long distance operator will call us the minute she does.

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:19.180
 Well, I'm afraid we're making a mistake.

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:21.780
 People who bought tickets to hear John William Stieber,

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:26.180
 lecturing all of the beautiful, are not going to care for a lecturer on child behaviour.

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:30.180
 How about getting old Uncle Jim Murphy over here on the edge of town?

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:31.180
 What for?

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:35.180
 Only used to put on a magic act for the children at the hospital every Christmas.

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:36.180
 Deal, let's not be ridiculous.

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:40.180
 It's better than nothing. You've got to have something when the crowd gets there to you tonight.

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:42.180
 Let me see that letter once more.

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:43.180
 What letter?

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:46.180
 The one that came this morning from John Williams Steber.

00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:50.180
 I'm here. And for as long as I live I'll never understand how a mistake like this happens.

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:54.180
 He says, "Dear Mrs. Ulrich, I regret very much that I must change my plans

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:57.620
 plans and decline your offer to address the Centerville Women's Club went a

00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:02.180
 forum. I enclose a letter which was apparently sent to me by mistake. Yours

00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:03.620
 truly J.W. Steber.

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:08.180
 "Then how did I ever do a thing like that? This letter he returned was to Antsou."

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:10.420
 "Looks as though he dragged it out of some lake."

00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:16.180
 "Dear Sue, don't for heaven's sake come all the way to Centerville just to hear

00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:21.220
 John William Steber next Tuesday night. Why the club ever voted to have him I'll

00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:27.020
 never know he's a terrible bore yes very well put them I don't think he had any

00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:29.740
 right to turn down an important engagement just because of the petty

00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:34.180
 opinion of one individual you mean this opinion but he had no right to read it

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:38.460
 after all he could see it wasn't for him Alice you're lucky the man isn't suing

00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:40.660
 you

00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:44.700
 this week please you're allowance Henry oh gee was did mother get a letter from

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:47.660
 from did mother get a letter yes dear from mr.

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:49.660
 - The seabed. - Oh.

00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:51.660
 - Then that's not on our minds anymore.

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:53.660
 - What do you mean, our minds?

00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:55.660
 - Well, isn't it an answer to...

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:57.660
 - Can he come? - No, dear.

00:08:57.660 --> 00:08:59.660
 He's very much upset over something.

00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:01.660
 In fact, I did a very absent-minded thing.

00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:04.660
 - What? - Well, I wrote a letter to your aunt Sue, dear,

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:06.660
 and addressed it to Mr. Seabed.

00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:08.660
 - And he was just a little hurt.

00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:11.660
 - Oh. Oh.

00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:13.660
 Is that the letter that you...

00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:15.660
 - I mean that letter?

00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:16.660
 - That's too bad.

00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:18.660
 Yes, Henry, it is.

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:20.660
 Oh, oh yes.

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:23.660
 Well, look, is there anything I can do?

00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:25.660
 No, dear, what could you possibly do?

00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:27.660
 Oh, I feel like you ought to do something.

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:28.660
 And I wish you could.

00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:30.660
 Oh, here's your allowance, son.

00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:33.660
 Well, on second thought, Father, I don't think I need any this week.

00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:35.660
 Where are you going that you don't want any?

00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:37.660
 Well, just over to see Eleanor Wentworth.

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:38.660
 Well, don't come home too late.

00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:39.660
 No, Mother.

00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:40.660
 Goodbye, Henry.

00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:43.660
 Goodbye, and I'm certainly sorry this happened.

00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:53.660
 [Music]

00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:57.660
 Henry, don't you want to sit here on the sofa and look at these pictures with me?

00:09:57.660 --> 00:09:58.660
 Pictures?

00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:00.660
 These pictures. Henry, tell me.

00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:02.660
 What? Are you worried about something?

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:03.660
 Only?

00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:06.660
 You've been sort of so preoccupied ever since you got here.

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:09.660
 I'm not preoccupied. Have you any writing paper?

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:10.660
 Any wa-

00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:12.660
 Writing paper. I've decided to write a letter to Chicago.

00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:13.660
 to Chicago.

00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:14.660
 No.

00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:16.260
 Yeah, I think it's something I've got to attend to.

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.460
 Well, I have a little, but it's pink.

00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:19.460
 Well, that's all right.

00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:22.220
 Gina, in a case like this, I don't think I ought to take the time to worry about the

00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:23.220
 color.

00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:24.220
 All right.

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:25.620
 What are you crying for?

00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:26.620
 I'm not crying.

00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:27.620
 What have I done?

00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:29.420
 I'll tell you what you've done, Henry.

00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:30.420
 I'll tell you.

00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:32.820
 You asked me to say this Saturday evening for you.

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:35.300
 And ever since you've gotten here, you've hardly said ten words.

00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:36.300
 I have.

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:37.300
 Yes, you have it.

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:39.300
 And now you want to write to somebody else.

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:40.300
 It's not a joke.

00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:41.460
 Do you want me to speak in?

00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:43.060
 It's only me Mrs. Lintwell.

00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:46.360
 Wait, Henry Eldridge, and see whether I ever save you another Saturday night.

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:50.060
 But I can't help it if the women's club is expecting Guatemala and I...

00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:51.060
 And I...

00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:52.260
 And he won't come.

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:53.260
 Henry.

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.060
 Mother, has Henry gone crazy?

00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:56.060
 No, I haven't.

00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:57.860
 Aren't you going to the lecture Tuesday night?

00:10:57.860 --> 00:10:58.860
 Yes.

00:10:58.860 --> 00:10:59.860
 Well, I chose how much you know about it.

00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:00.860
 He isn't even coming.

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:01.860
 Who isn't?

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:02.860
 Nobody.

00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:05.460
 That's why my mother's got to get someone and it's all on account of...

00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:06.460
 On account of...

00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:08.060
 Gee, whiz Mrs. Lintwell.

00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:10.660
 I feel I ought to do something about it.

00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:14.660
 Well, my gracious, why didn't you say what was on your mind, Henry?

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:18.660
 Mother, you want to know someone you knew lots of musical people in Chicago.

00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:21.660
 Well, I don't know. Anyone there we could get on this short notice.

00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:23.660
 Do you know some musical people, Mrs. Wentworth?

00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:26.660
 Well, you see, Henry, I studied music right up until I was married.

00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:31.660
 In fact, Henry, mother was going to have a career in music only Father asked her not to.

00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:33.660
 What did she play?

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:34.660
 I sang.

00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:39.660
 Well, Gee, Wiz, are you the one I always hear in church sort of louder than everybody else?

00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:44.660
 Well, my... my voice always was noted for its body.

00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:45.660
 Oh, yes.

00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:49.160
 Mother, why couldn't you help the women's club out and sing?

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:50.660
 Instead of Guatemala?

00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:51.660
 Oh, I don't think I should, Henry.

00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:54.660
 Sure, why not? She whiz my mother's desperate.

00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:56.660
 Oh, no, please, mother. I'd love to hear you sing.

00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:59.660
 Eleanor, your father never speaks to me again.

00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:02.660
 All righty, he doesn't have to go. I know my father won't.

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:08.660
 Well, thank you just the same, Henry, but you know how people turn up their noses in this town at home, talent?

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:11.960
 a home talent has to come from Chicago or does not

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:16.200
 a good but after all mother you study in Chicago for years right on Michigan

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:20.640
 after you cost the haul of the women's club it's just ideally suited for my

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:23.540
 voice it is of course it isn't and mother mr.

00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:27.320
 dies new place the organ of the church can accompany you yes dear if I can just

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:31.440
 keep him from playing too loud you always think he's the soloist well gee

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:34.820
 I'll have my mother have a talk with him she's chairman she can tell him how

00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:37.940
 allowed to play no deal no i'll take care of that

00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:40.900
 you just ask your mother whether there's anything in particular she'd like to

00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:44.500
 have me sing okay um here um let me see now

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:48.340
 what is it you're writing mrs. Wentworth here are two suggestions for us

00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:52.660
 one is french dear and one's Italian that's fine and is there any song you

00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:56.660
 could sing from guatamala

00:12:56.660 --> 00:13:15.860
 Well, as usual, the tune Henry's playing seems to be just slightly off-key, and it remains

00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:18.940
 to be seen whether he'll strike any more sour notes.

00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:23.540
 In the meantime, if I may, I'd like to suggest a sweet note, something that should strike

00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:28.300
 a cord of harmony with all of you who enjoy having a good hot drink with your meals.

00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:33.860
 Folks, try a steaming, fragrant cup of delicious postum, sugar and cream it to suit your taste,

00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:36.700
 and see if you don't agree that it stops for goodness.

00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:40.780
 I'm sure you will because gold and brown postum gives you just what you want in a meal time

00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:41.780
 drink.

00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:46.260
 Cheering warmth to give you that glowing feeling, tempting fragrance that says "drink

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:50.620
 hearty" and best of all, postums really grand flavor.

00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:54.500
 don't expect post-em to taste like coffee anymore than you'd expect coffee to taste

00:13:54.500 --> 00:14:00.420
 like tea. For post-em naturally is different. Its flavor is distinctive and believe me when

00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:06.420
 you taste it you'll say this shouldn't be called post-em, it should be called post-em.

00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:11.540
 So tomorrow make post-em for everyone in your family. Serve it to youngsters as well as grown-ups

00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:16.020
 and see if you don't agree that there's no hot meal time drink quite so good as post-em

00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:23.020
 for all the family.

00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:28.980
 Now getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldrich

00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:32.940
 Henry feeling just a bit guilty because his mother is unable to get a lecture for

00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:35.300
 the women's club for next Tuesday night

00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:38.380
 has found that his girl's mother won't study music

00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:42.180
 and that she is more than eager to arise to the occasion

00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:46.180
 Well, as he starts for home, he carries with him a list of songs he would be willing to sing.

00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:49.380
 The scene opens late that night, and the all-rich front hall.

00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:52.880
 But Sam, I couldn't have concentrated on a game of bridge tonight if I'd had to.

00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:56.020
 Well, worrying about Tuesday night's lecture isn't going to help, any.

00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:56.980
 Let's go off to bed.

00:14:56.980 --> 00:14:59.080
 - Does he lock the door, dear? - Yes, dear Henry, and...

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:01.080
 Yes, dear, he's caught right here in the closet.

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:02.680
 After all, things could be worse.

00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:05.080
 Why don't you simply announce that there won't be any program?

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:08.680
 Because I was asked to get someone. If we cancel it, I've utterly seen.

00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:11.280
 - Wait a minute. What's this? - What's what?

00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:13.680
 a snowboard telephone and no

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:15.080
 it's from henry

00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:19.360
 mother you will be relieved to hear that missus went worth i think has the

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:21.360
 solution to your program

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:24.600
 she would like when you can to talk to her about it

00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:27.640
 but what i don't know how this i haven't finished

00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:32.280
 she said along the letter that is with this which she says you will understand

00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:34.720
 glad you won't have to worry anymore henry

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:36.600
 is this the letter she said

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:39.680
 dear missus oldrich no doubt by the time you read this henry will have

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:41.120
 explained everything

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:44.320
 Here are a few suggestions for you to choose from.

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:49.120
 Don Fatale, Beth-A-Bathie, Casta, Divers.

00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:49.960
 Sam, what on earth?

00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:51.840
 - Yeah, let me see that.

00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:54.800
 Don Fatale, who's Don Fatale?

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:57.040
 - And Beth-A-Bathie.

00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:59.240
 Sam, did you ever hear that name before?

00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:00.720
 - Sounds like some opera star.

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:01.640
 - Sam, I know.

00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:02.960
 Those are some of Kitty's friends.

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:05.120
 She's always boasting about the people she knows.

00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:05.960
 - What about it?

00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:07.880
 - She's suggesting one of them for our program.

00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:10.360
 She says right here at the top, we can have our choice.

00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:11.720
 Sam, Sam, where's the phone book?

00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:12.720
 Who are you gonna call?

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:13.560
 Kitty, of course.

00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:14.560
 At this time of night?

00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:17.360
 Sam, you don't think I could sleep when I'm this excited, do you?

00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:18.360
 Here.

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:19.860
 Here it is.

00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:21.360
 Hello, operator.

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:24.160
 Alice, the Wentworth's a probably in bed and a sleeve.

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:25.360
 Number, please.

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:26.860
 L2621.

00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:28.760
 I thought you didn't like Kitty Wentworth.

00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:30.060
 Sam, I never said that.

00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:33.560
 There are a great many things about her I haven't really cared for, but dear, I think

00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:36.160
 she has a lot more to her than people give her credit for.

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:38.860
 Your Wentworth always said it took time to get to know her.

00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:40.380
 I'm ringing your number.

00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:42.960
 Just keep right on, they're probably in bed.

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:46.680
 Sam, you know I think I'll give a dinner party for Kitty and Baddy Baddy Tuesday night.

00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:48.400
 That's the least I can do.

00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:49.440
 Good idea.

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:51.960
 It'd be quite an honor to have a concert star here for dinner.

00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:52.460
 Hello?

00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:53.520
 Is this Kitty?

00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:53.920
 Oh.

00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:55.280
 Kitty, this is Alice.

00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:55.780
 Oh.

00:16:55.780 --> 00:16:58.560
 Alice O'Gritte, I just found your note along with Henry.

00:16:58.560 --> 00:16:59.360
 Oh, yes!

00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:02.200
 And I just want to say I'm so thrilled to think that you can help us.

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:03.480
 Oh, really, Alice?

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:05.960
 I don't know what we would have done if you hadn't come to the rescue

00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:07.800
 because we did want to have something nice.

00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:12.260
 Oh no, mention it, dear. I thought afterwards perhaps I'd taken Henry too seriously.

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:15.060
 Oh no, you just can't realize how grateful I am.

00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:16.060
 Oh, well, it's...

00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:22.300
 There's just one thing, of course, today. And I hope you won't be offended, but naturally, it's the sea, of course.

00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:25.620
 The sea? Oh, how is the end? I won't be any.

00:17:25.620 --> 00:17:27.660
 You mean to say there won't be any charge at all?

00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:32.560
 Well, after all, I've always wanted to do something like this for the women's club.

00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:37.260
 Why don't you do this if you insist, Alice? Why not give the sea you were going to pay to the church?

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:40.940
 Of course, Kitty, we could divide it among all the churches in town.

00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:43.900
 Well, I won't keep you up any longer. They're a good guy.

00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:46.700
 Hi. He's only I don't have a call that night.

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:50.940
 What? I certainly hate to wait ten years to get a chance to sing at the women's club and then catch call.

00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:53.660
 What? But don't worry dear, I won't let you down. Good bye.

00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:57.660
 What? Sam! Sam! Sam!

00:17:57.660 --> 00:17:58.660
 I'm open!

00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:09.660
 Here's your orange juice mother.

00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:12.660
 Oh, thank you Mary. You want another pillow under your head?

00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:13.660
 No, thank you.

00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:16.660
 Now Mary, if I were you, I'd tip to back downstairs.

00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:17.660
 Sam, aren't you going to eat any breakfast?

00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:18.660
 I've eaten.

00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:22.660
 Mother, do you mind if I ask you just one question before I go?

00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:25.500
 What is it? Why aren't either of you speaking to Henry?

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:27.980
 That's just a little matter concerning us, Mary.

00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:32.780
 But Father, I'd like to know because maybe I shouldn't be speaking to a me either.

00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:34.860
 You shouldn't. Really?

00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:36.500
 I'll just go downstairs.

00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:37.580
 Yes, Father, I'll go.

00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:40.420
 Aren't you going to drink your orange juice, Alice?

00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:42.420
 Sam, you can look at this objectively.

00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:44.260
 You can look at it as a man would.

00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:45.260
 What shall I do?

00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:46.500
 I have no idea.

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:48.780
 Of course, there's a lot of influenza around.

00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:51.980
 I might get the Board of Health to forbid I're holding the concert.

00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:53.980
 Well, you can't get the Board of Health to do that.

00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:56.540
 In the first place, the Health Commissioner's kitty went worse cousin.

00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:57.940
 Well, I know what I'm going to do.

00:18:57.940 --> 00:18:58.440
 What?

00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:00.220
 Sam, I've been thinking things over.

00:19:00.220 --> 00:19:02.560
 I have entirely too much work to do around this house.

00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:03.980
 My family needs me, Sam.

00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:04.940
 I'm going to resign.

00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:05.440
 From what?

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:06.540
 From the Women's Club.

00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:08.020
 Alice, you can't do that.

00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:09.900
 But I've heard her sing.

00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:14.980
 Alice, Joe Wentworth has been one of my best friends for 20 years.

00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:15.980
 Father?

00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:18.940
 Henry, your mother would rather you did not come in.

00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:20.460
 I don't want to come in, Father.

00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:23.060
 I just want to ask if I may go to church.

00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:24.360
 The church?

00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:25.460
 Yes, sir.

00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:27.020
 I think it's a very good idea.

00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:28.180
 You may go with me.

00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:30.420
 The only trouble is my coke.

00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:33.060
 I mean, well, that's all right.

00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:35.420
 Henry, open the door a minute.

00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:37.340
 Are you sure it won't bother your mother?

00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:39.260
 Henry, what kind are you going to wear?

00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:40.220
 My black one.

00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:42.140
 Dear, I want you to wear your brown one.

00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:43.700
 Wouldn't black be more appropriate?

00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:45.500
 Not sand.

00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:47.580
 You don't mind if when church is over,

00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:49.820
 I stay for Sunday school, do you?

00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:53.220
 Not at all. Now please leave the room.

00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:59.020
 Yes, sir. And then I'll come home and help Mary get dinner and rest a little this afternoon

00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:01.420
 until I go back to evening service.

00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:14.820
 [Music]

00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:16.820
 Better step along, Henry. I will be late.

00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:20.320
 Gee, there are quite a few going to church this morning, aren't there?

00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:21.320
 Yes, sir.

00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:25.320
 Father, have you heard whether there's much influenza around?

00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:28.120
 Oh, I understand this, son. Nothing serious, however.

00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:33.820
 Oh, Father, how big is the fire escape at the woman's club?

00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:35.820
 I have no idea.

00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:39.820
 Gee, which house is all that singing coming from?

00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:42.320
 I believe that's coming from the Wentworths.

00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:44.320
 From the Wentworths?

00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:49.120
 mean she's warming up already? Yes, let's cross the street.

00:20:49.120 --> 00:21:06.480
 On Wednesday night, our regular Wednesday meeting will be held at this church as usual.

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:11.680
 Ms Eleanor Wentworth handed me this next announcement just before the service began.

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:19.560
 On Tuesday evening, the Senator Women's Club Winter Forum will contribute a part of its receipts to the town's churches.

00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:25.060
 The program, instead of being water model of beautiful, will be a vocal concert,

00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:28.060
 sung by our own Mrs. Joseph Wentworth.

00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:29.560
 Let us pray.

00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:40.060
 When would that telegram stand, Alice?

00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:41.560
 This morning, dear, the 20th.

00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:47.000
 Only speaker we can send you for your program tomorrow evening is Dr. Calvin Anderson Butler

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:53.000

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:58.440
 he will solve your problems. Please wire. Is that all? Sam I've made up my mind. I'm going to phone

00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:02.840
 Kitty Wentworth and tell her just as nicely as I know how that we do not want her to sing. But Alice

00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:07.480
 you can't tell her that. I don't care. We're going to have Dr. Calvin Anderson Butler.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:13.800
 Elin 2621 very well maybe it is for the best no I don't know why I didn't have

00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:17.200
 enough courage to do it in the first place I'll have a talk with Joe Wentworth

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:21.600
 he'll understand hello Eleanor may I speak with your mother please

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:29.120
 well Eleanor when do you expect her back tomorrow

00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:31.120
 where

00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:33.560
 she wanted to get no

00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:47.400

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:50.840
 take a look at this what is it the morning paper here it is the whole thing

00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:55.040
 Sam it's a picture of Kitty and look at the heading local thrush to replace

00:22:55.040 --> 00:23:01.680
 Guatemala now Alice this is no time in which to have hysterics again

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:04.260
 (upbeat music)

00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:10.780
 Homer, my mother wants to know

00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:12.860
 whether you'd like a little job for tonight.

00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:13.700
 - Doing what?

00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:14.540
 - Ushering.

00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:16.940
 - Well, I'll usher Henry, but I won't listen.

00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:18.660
 - Well, that's all right.

00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:21.140
 When it begins, we can sit out on the front steps.

00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:23.460
 That's what my father says he's going to do.

00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:26.220
 - She ought to see how sore my mother is about tonight.

00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:27.500
 - How did you remember the happen to ask

00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:28.980
 Mrs. Wentworth to sing?

00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:31.620
 - Well, we're very fond of the whole family.

00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:33.740
 Come on, let's go in the station, Homer.

00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:34.580
 What for?

00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:36.940
 I want to weigh myself on these scales.

00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:40.180
 Here, hold my Latin.

00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:42.180
 Boy, have you lost weight.

00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:44.540
 Well, G-Homer, I've had a bad week.

00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:46.660
 Henry, do you want me, Mr. Taylor?

00:23:46.660 --> 00:23:48.740
 You want to earn 10 cents, Henry?

00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:50.980
 I've got a telegram here for Mr. Wentworth,

00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:52.740
 and I haven't been able to get in touch with it.

00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:54.020
 You want me to take it up to him?

00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:54.700
 Sure.

00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:56.300
 Here's the message, and here's your dime.

00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:57.940
 Well, thank you very much.

00:23:57.940 --> 00:24:00.020
 And Henry, don't you fool around any.

00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:01.620
 I think that telegram's important.

00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:03.660
 Oh, you can depend on me, Mr. Taylor.

00:24:03.660 --> 00:24:06.260
 I'll hold it in my hand so I can't possibly forget.

00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:07.260
 Thank you very much.

00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:11.460
 Hello.

00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:12.620
 Senator Goel station.

00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:14.260
 This is Joe Wentworth speaking.

00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:16.660
 Is that 320 from Chicago a lot on time?

00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:18.420
 Say, I've been trying to get you.

00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:21.060
 I just sent a telegram up to you by Henry Aldrich.

00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:21.860
 A telegram?

00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:24.180
 I didn't take it when it came in, but I understand it.

00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:27.060
 It said your wife was stuck in Chicago without any money.

00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:27.980
 Oh, Kitty?

00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:29.340
 It's too bad she didn't get a round trip.

00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:30.380
 ticket when she bought it

00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:31.900
 what did you do with your purse?

00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:34.900
 no i understand she said she spent more money on clothes

00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:36.140
 than she figured she would

00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:38.060
 and the telegram henry's taking up to you

00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:40.540
 has the address where you're supposed to wire the money

00:24:40.540 --> 00:24:42.020
 i see

00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:49.020

00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:51.700
 sorry i can't get to your wife's concert tonight mister went worse

00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:55.940
 seems my wife uh... forgot we had a previous engagement too bad

00:24:55.940 --> 00:24:59.540
 By the way, do you see those two boys coming up Main Street?

00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:00.540
 Yes, sir.

00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:02.660
 One of them is in Henry Aldrich, is it?

00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:03.900
 I believe it is.

00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:06.140
 Oh, yes, yes, yes, so it is.

00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:09.140
 Well, I guess I'll be stepping down walnut for something.

00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:11.820
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:17.420
 Look, Homer, look, there he is in front of the filling station.

00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:17.820
 Where?

00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:19.700
 Right there, getting his tank filled in Homer.

00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:20.360
 He sees it.

00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:20.860
 Wave to him.

00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:23.380
 Oh, Mr. Wentworth, the Mr. Wentworth.

00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:24.580
 What's the matter with him, Henry?

00:25:24.580 --> 00:25:25.660
 He's driving right off.

00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:28.660
 Well gee whiz I could have sworn he looked straight at us.

00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:34.660
 Boy am I getting sick of this.

00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:36.660
 We haven't been looking for him for so long, Homer.

00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:38.660
 Only about two hours.

00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:40.660
 Sure. At the rate of five cents an hour.

00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:42.660
 From now on we work for nothing.

00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:45.660
 Well I don't understand why we didn't catch up with him this time.

00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:48.660
 He looked right at us again and then beat it into this drugstore.

00:25:48.660 --> 00:25:50.660
 Maybe he's getting blind, Henry.

00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:54.660
 Well look, just so he doesn't miss us again, I'll go in this door and you slip around the corner

00:25:54.660 --> 00:25:58.620
 and go in the side door. Okay, we've got him cornered Homer and we have an

00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:01.660
 anything more to worry about.

00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:08.660
 [Music]

00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:13.580
 Tickets please. Tickets please. The program started yet Henry. Yes Mrs. Thompson

00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:18.420
 it's been going on for some time. Very many in there. Oh, she practically every

00:26:18.420 --> 00:26:24.180
 seat's taken. In fact I'm afraid you'll have to stand. That's all. Just a second

00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:27.620
 If you don't mind going in real quietly, I'll open the door for you.

00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:28.940
 All right, Henry.

00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:31.540
 And so far, ladies and gentlemen,

00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:35.500
 I have given you only the basic fundamentals of our subject for this evening.

00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:36.940
 Child behavior.

00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:40.060
 During my first three years at the head of a reform room.

00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:42.500
 He's pretty good, isn't he, Henry?

00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:43.300
 Not bad.

00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:46.580
 I think everybody's timing is a good time, don't you, Homer?

00:26:46.580 --> 00:26:49.500
 My father even came when he heard what the subject was.

00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:50.740
 Program started, boys.

00:26:51.020 --> 00:26:54.160
 Well, Gee, was Mr. Wentworth. Where did you come from?

00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:55.740
 No, Aaron, particular.

00:26:55.740 --> 00:26:56.960
 Good to follow me to speak.

00:26:56.960 --> 00:26:58.620
 Yes, sir. And I've got a telegram here.

00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:01.560
 I've been trying to give you ever since 3 o'clock this afternoon.

00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:02.220
 A telegram?

00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:04.140
 Yes, sir. And they said it was very urgent.

00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:06.500
 Yes. All right to go in this door here.

00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:07.740
 But aren't you going to read it?

00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:09.600
 I'll read it later. I want to hear the lecture.

00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:12.000
 And I want to thank you for delivering it, Henry.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:13.740
 I thank you very much.

00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:16.640
 Oh, I don't know whether you can get a seat in there or not.

00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:19.140
 I think I can. Your father said he'd say one for me.

00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:20.180
 Oh, have you seen him?

00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:22.860
 had a little talk with him this afternoon

00:27:22.860 --> 00:27:26.660
 and you parent who has a taken giving your children responsibility

00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:30.300
 could realize that although there is a certain amount of risk involved

00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:34.220
 in the end uh... r_n_s_ to somehow manage to get things done

00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:36.500
 it may not be in a straight line

00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:38.340
 but i have yet to see it fail

00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:40.660
 when they did eventually get

00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:44.100
 you know and we that fell out of the door a lot of goodness town

00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:46.820
 what step out and get some fresh air

00:27:46.820 --> 00:27:48.340
 that's what i say

00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:52.220
 They say they took in enough money so that every church in town can get a new window.

00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:53.220
 Stained?

00:27:53.220 --> 00:27:54.220
 Sure.

00:27:54.220 --> 00:27:56.900
 See, that makes me feel pretty good.

00:27:56.900 --> 00:27:59.380
 You talk as though you've done the whole thing, Henry.

00:27:59.380 --> 00:28:04.940
 Well, of course I'm not entirely responsible Homer, but I've sort of contributed my share.

00:28:04.940 --> 00:28:25.660

 Henry Aldrich will be back in just a moment.

00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:32.700
 In the meantime friends remember your two best reasons for drinking postam are these.

00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:34.660
 Because if coffee makes you nervous,

00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:37.300
 Postam can't possibly affect your nerves.

00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:40.000
 And because Postam really does taste swell,

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:43.100
 it's a grand flavorful drink for all the family.

00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:46.700
 So get Postam from your grocer tomorrow.

00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:50.200
 Our program tonight has come to you from the Philadelphia Forum.

00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:54.000
 Listen again next week to the Aldrich family, same time, same station,

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:58.600
 for another sparkling half hour with your favorite youngster, his family, and his pals.

00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:02.300

00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:05.500
 Original music is composed and conducted by Jack Miller.

00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:09.800
 This is Harry Vonsell saying you will enjoy fragrant, flavorful postum.

00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:12.500
 And remember, postum contains no stimulants.

00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:14.300
 It cannot make you nervous.

00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:15.300
 Good night.
