00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000
 [Music]

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 Henry Henry Aldrich!

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 Coming, Mother!

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
 [Applause]

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
 The Aldrich family based on characters who inherited my Clifford Goldsmith

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 and starring as bestowments every Jackie Calcett former.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 And now for the Aldrich family.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.500
 Everyone knows that as we grow older, the years begin to travel more swiftly.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:01.400
 But when you're a teenage boy like Henry Aldrich, every year is a lifetime.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.900
 For each minute is packed full of fun and adventurous.

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.800
 The teen opens in the Aldrich living room.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.600
 Mary, I can hardly believe my ears.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.400
 My goodness, Henry, all I did was ask you a perfectly civil question.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.900
 I'm sure I don't know what you're so excited about.

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.000
 You don't.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.800
 Mary, I was sitting here mining my own business.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.800
 And you walked up to me and said a thing like that.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.340
 All I said was that Joe Graham is coming over for dinner tonight.

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:28.340
 Sure.

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.900
 And then you asked me what time I was getting out of the house.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.640
 Well, that's all I want to know, Henry. What time are you getting out?

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.240
 But, Mary, I've been looking forward to that roast duck all day.

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.540
 Henry, you can't do a thing like this to me.

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:42.640
 I can't do why.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.140
 You can't possibly intend to sit there at the table and have dinner with us.

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.740
 Gee whiz, why not?

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.980
 Joe and I get along swell.

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.780
 Henry, do you remember what happened the last time Joe was here for dinner?

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.280
 Have you said it once? You said it a hundred times.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.680
 Joe was the only boyfriend I had.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.680
 Mary, you just don't understand men.

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.680
 That makes a man feel good.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.080
 If he hasn't any competition, what's he got to worry about?

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.780
 Oh, what's the youth mother?

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.380
 Now listen, Mary, don't go dragging mother into this.

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.380
 Oh, right, then I'll give you one more chance.

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.180
 Are you going to get out of on to?

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.180
 Mary, where can I go?

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.040
 My own family doesn't want me who else would

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:26.360
 But I've been trying to tell you is that I found Homer a little while ago and asked if you could have dinner with him

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.680
 You mean you'd force me down Mrs. Brown's throat?

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:35.520
 Oh, it says he sure his mother would be delighted and he's working on a right now. Oh, no, Mary. Oh, no

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.800
 Oh, no, why I'm not going to impose myself on anybody that has to be

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:46.760
 Worked on very well Henry. You've had your chance mother. Okay, Mary. Go ahead. Go ahead and sour

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:52.100
 I know my right mother. Where are you? I'm in the kitchen. Mary based in the duck

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:58.160
 Sam a hold it take your hands off those olives, but I'm hungry Alice, but I have just one mother

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.160
 I could just die all right, Sam. You may have one, but that's all ah

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:08.600
 Sam what's the matter not the one on top of the salad? It took me 15 minutes to cut it to look like a rose

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.840
 Is that what it looks like

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.520
 He's one out of the deep mother. I don't mean to criticize

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:21.300
 But what's more important to you and all of that looks like a rose or my future happiness now now dear

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.680
 What's the matter? Do you know what Henry's gonna do to me? Do you know what he's going to do?

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.560
 Why he's going to have dinner with us tonight. Well, that seems natural he lives here

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:35.480
 Of course Mary and he's perfectly entitled I have dinner with us if he wants

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.760
 Tonight don't you remember what happened the last time Joe Graham was here for dinner

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.340
 You mean when you spilled the gravy in Joe's lab?

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:49.260
 Father that was because Henry had me so upset by the things he was saying. I was positively trembling

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:56.080
 In a way Sam I can see Mary's point of view after all Joe is practically the only boyfriend she has

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.840
 Mother

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.400
 Mary will you just tell me one thing. You mean you changed your mind. She was no

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.460
 But look what it fixed things up if I told Joe you had a different boyfriend here every night

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:13.240
 You see mother you see that sounds feasible to me sure Mary you just don't understand men

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:19.200
 They like to feel they have lots of competition father all I asked is that I be allowed to live my own life

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.300
 Well gee whiz Mary go ahead who's stopping you?

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:28.760
 Mother what am I to do Mary at the moment? I'm much more concerned with this duck than Joe Graham. I wash my hands with a hula

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:35.580
 Here we're out here in the kitchen Homer

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.580
 The kitchen's all boy.

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:39.580
 Sam, hide those olives.

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:40.580
 Right.

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.580
 Boy, does this house smell good.

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:43.580
 Hello, everybody.

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.580
 Hi, homerovel timer.

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.580
 Well, I'm here.

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:48.580
 So I see.

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:52.580
 Boy, are we having that duck for dinner?

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.580
 No, we are.

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:55.580
 We are?

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:56.580
 Oh boy.

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:57.580
 No, wait a minute, Homer.

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.580
 What exactly are you doing over here?

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.580
 Jean, Mrs. Aldrich, I was invited over for dinner.

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.580
 Bob, who invited you?

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:09.960
 I did. Don't you remember Mary? I said my mother would be delighted to have me come.

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:15.360
 Homer! Well, she was. You misunderstood me entirely. I didn't invite you over here.

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:19.200
 You didn't. Alice, if it would help matters any, I'd be glad to have dinner out.

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:25.520
 Now, family couldn't do that. Who called the duck? Homer, it isn't that we wouldn't love to have you.

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:30.960
 You would, boy. But not tonight, dear. And I'm afraid you'll just have to go home.

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.960
 But Mrs. Aldrich, I can.

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:33.960
 Why not?

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:37.500
 Well, when I told my mother I was going out, she said this was her chance to have some

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:38.500
 people in for dinner.

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:42.960
 Oh my goodness, and she doesn't want to see me again till 11 o'clock tonight.

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:56.960
 Boy, Homer, you know we should have done this more often.

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:57.960
 I'll say.

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:01.460
 Listen, are you sure you've still got all the money?

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:02.460
 Sure, I'm sure.

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:06.260
 It's all tied in my handkerchief, right where my mother put it.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.960
 Gee, there's nothing like two old friends going out to dinner together.

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:10.960
 Obviously.

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.960
 Oh, how much have we got again?

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:16.060
 We have a dollar and a quarter each, Homer.

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:18.060
 I've told you a million times.

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:20.560
 I know, but I still can't believe it.

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:24.960
 Whenever my mother kicks me out of the house, all I get is 35 cents.

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:27.460
 Homer, I hope you don't think my mother kicked us out.

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:28.860
 Oh, that's alright, Hannah.

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:30.460
 The old timer I understand.

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:32.460
 She can't hurt my feelings.

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:34.460
 Anyway, we wouldn't have enjoyed ourselves.

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:42.460
 Whenever Mary has a boyfriend up for dinner, all my mother talks about is what a good cook Mary is, and how she makes all her own clothes.

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:44.460
 She didn't marry cook that dinner?

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:47.460
 No, but she peeled the radishes, though.

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:50.460
 I didn't know you peeled radishes.

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:52.460
 Mary does.

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:55.460
 She doesn't know how to clean them.

00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:00.220
 Boy, and I know where let's go. Let's go to the candy kitchen.

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:03.260
 The candy kitchen at home or all you can get there is dessert.

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:06.860
 Sure. Think of all the desserts we could get for a dollar and a quarter.

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:09.660
 Now let's go to the mansion house.

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:13.260
 Hand me, they charge millions of dollars at the mansion house.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:17.060
 They do not. You can get a real swell dinner for a dollar and a quarter.

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:20.860
 Yeah, and you could put it all on a piece of bread and make a sandwich out of it.

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:24.060
 Listen, Homer, one of this has to be sensible.

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:28.060
 For anybody who'd eat a dollar and a quarter's worth of desserts.

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:29.560
 Okay.

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:31.060
 What do you mean by that?

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:32.860
 Okay, that's all.

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:34.760
 It's your money.

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:36.260
 I'm only the guest.

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.860
 Homer, I haven't hurt your feelings, have I?

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:43.160
 I'm gonna think of it. I wasn't even invited in the first place.

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:44.060
 Now Homer...

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:47.160
 That's all right, Henry. Don't bother trying to explain.

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:49.060
 We'll go to the mansion house.

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:51.060
 Well, gee whiz, if you're gonna SALK.

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:51.960
 Who's SALKING?

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:54.680
 If that's your attitude, let's go to the candy kitchen.

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:57.800
 Oh no, I wouldn't think of going to the candy kitchen.

00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:59.400
 We'll go to the mansion house.

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:00.680
 Oh no, we won't.

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:04.600
 Listen, you couldn't drag me into the candy kitchen with a team of wild horses.

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:07.480
 Well, I'm darned a boss that put in the mansion house.

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:08.680
 Now listen, Henry.

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:10.280
 Now listen, Homer.

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:21.720
 Mother, I just can't stand it.

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:23.720
 Now Mary, don't go all the pieces.

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:27.220
 Look, when Joe gets here, why don't I just take him out someplace for dinner?

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:28.820
 You'll do no such thing.

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:31.520
 Frankly, I'm getting a little tired of this whole business.

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:33.720
 Now, where are the boys?

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:37.620
 Henry's up in his room, eating jelly beans from last Easter.

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:38.720
 Jelly beans?

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:40.320
 My goodness, he'll make himself sick.

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:41.920
 He says he hopes he does.

00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:44.420
 And Homer's sitting in the whole closet.

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:45.420
 Where?

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:47.220
 The whole closet, mother.

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:51.220
 He says Henry gave him permission to sit there and soak if he wants to.

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:54.500
 Well, you go and tell them both to stop this foolishness at once.

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:57.060
 Tell them I'll expect to see them at dinner in 15 minutes.

00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:58.660
 You mean at our dinner table?

00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:00.100
 What mother, what about Joe?

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:03.620
 Mary, if you mention Joe just once more, I'll go out for dinner myself.

00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:04.660
 Now, do as your toes.

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:05.700
 My goodness.

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:08.100
 Sam, I'll just get away from those radishes.

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:09.540
 You mean these white things?

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:10.660
 I thought they were on you.

00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:11.860
 Homer!

00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:14.100
 Are you still in the closet?

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:14.980
 Who's that?

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:16.340
 It's Mary.

00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:18.180
 Okay, you can come in.

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:21.300
 How are you coming out of that closet, your mother to death?

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:22.580
 I hope I do.

00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:24.660
 My mother says you're to have dinner with her.

00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:25.860
 She does?

00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:26.860
 Oh.

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:28.580
 Is Henry gonna be there?

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:30.660
 Certainly is. He lives here, doesn't he?

00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:32.820
 Then I'll just stay right here.

00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:36.340
 Tell your mother thanks just the same, but I'd rather starve.

00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:37.460
 Well, my goodness.

00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:39.620
 And please close the door after you.

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:41.780
 All right then. All right.

00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:42.900
 Henry!

00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:44.820
 I'm here in my room.

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:46.900
 If anybody's interested.

00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:48.900
 Henry, old, did you listen to me?

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:50.900
 How do you do?

00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:53.400
 Mother sent me up here to invite you to dinner.

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:55.400
 And I hope you're satisfied.

00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:56.900
 Would you care for a jelly bean?

00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:58.400
 Henry, did you hear me?

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:04.400
 Mary, please convey my regrets and tell Mother I wouldn't think of imposing on my own family for a meal.

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:06.400
 Now, look, are you talking too?

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:08.400
 Of course I'm not sulking!

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:10.400
 I know what I'm not wanted.

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:12.400
 Well, my goodness, Mother!

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:41.400
 Oh my goodness. Hello, Mary. Joe, it's you. Aren't you expecting me? Yes, yes, of course, Joe. It's just that I'm so upset. Well, come on in. Thank you. Did you just come in? No, I'm going out. Just for a few minutes, Joe.

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:43.800
 I have to see somebody about my brother.

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:45.400
 - Oh, is he going to be here for dinner?

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:46.400
 - Not if I can help it.

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:49.400
 That is, I'll be back in a few minutes, Joe.

00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:50.400
 Goodbye.

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:51.400
 - But, Murray, is that you, Joe?

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:53.400
 - Yes, it is, Mr. Olridge.

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:55.400
 - Just hang your coat up in the hall closet

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:56.400
 and come on in the living room.

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:58.400
 - All right, sir.

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:01.400
 Oh, excuse me, I thought this was the closet.

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:02.400
 - It is.

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:05.400
 (audience laughing)

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:06.400
 - It is.

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:10.400
 Well, are you, uh, are you looking for something?

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:16.600
 for something? No. Oh. Here, give me your coat. I'll hang it up for you. But I don't

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:21.840
 want to. No, that's all right. I'd be glad of something to do. Oh, well thanks. And would

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:29.040
 you please close the door after you? Close it? Oh, sure. Sure. You coming in the living

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:33.380
 room, Joe? Yes, Mr. Aldrich. I'm going. I mean, I'm coming. I'm sorry. I couldn't

00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:37.120
 come to the door. I'm trying to get a little fire going here. Mr. Aldrich, I... What's

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:39.040
 What about a joke? You look pale.

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:40.560
 Have you been working pretty hard?

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:41.400
 Working?

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:43.400
 Yeah, yeah, that's probably it.

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:45.760
 I've just been working too hard.

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:47.160
 The only thing is...

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:48.040
 Yes, Joe.

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:50.640
 Mr. Aldrich, have you noticed anything unusual

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:52.480
 about your hall closet?

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:55.880
 Oh, you mean all that junk?

00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:58.720
 Junk? That's been accumulating for years.

00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:02.320
 Anytime this family wants to get rid of anything,

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:04.560
 they just stuff it in the hall closet.

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:12.360
 They do. Gee. Ever so often we clean it out and throw everything away, but it always manages to come back.

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:19.360
 Is that right? It's gotten to be a sort of family skeleton. Skeleton. Gee, I could have sworn it.

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:26.360
 What, Joe? Nothing. Oh, will you excuse me, Joe, when I answer the phone? Sure, Mr. Aldrich. I'll just lie down for a minute.

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:30.360
 Hello. Hello, what's that do with the roll?

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:31.360
 Yes?

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:32.360
 It's a pinebean.

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:33.360
 Who?

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:35.040
 string bean, string bean, kitten, juke.

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:36.240
 Oh, hello, string bean.

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:38.280
 Listen, I just met Mary on the street,

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:40.840
 and that's Henry and Homer got a dinner invitation here.

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:43.040
 Why, no, they haven't.

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:45.520
 Oh boy, then I'm not too late.

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:48.200
 Gee, I ran out of the first bubble that I came to.

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:50.520
 This is called a day to come to my house for dinner.

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:53.040
 Why, I should think they'd be delighted, string bean.

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:56.720
 Oh boy, imagine two men in both of them at once.

00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:57.680
 What's that?

00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:00.000
 Comes to come over and a half an hour in the storage.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.280
 Don't take me that long in the corner,

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:02.800
 the kinks out of my hands.

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:03.800
 Come on!

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:04.800
 You're marching, Bean.

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:05.800
 Well, it's...

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:07.800
 Sam, what's going wrong now?

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:08.800
 Nothing's gone wrong, dear.

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:11.800
 I've just fixed Henry and Homer up with a dinner invitation.

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:12.800
 Well, thank goodness.

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:15.800
 Was that Mrs. Anderson or Kathleen who called?

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:16.800
 The Anderson?

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:18.800
 Alice, the boys have been invited to the kitten juice.

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:19.800
 And you accepted?

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:20.800
 Certainly.

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:22.800
 If they won't eat at home, they have to eat some, please.

00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:26.800
 But Sam, Mary's gone to ask Mrs. Anderson if they can have dinner over there.

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:27.800
 What's that?

00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:29.800
 So do you have to get the car out and try to catch her?

00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:31.800
 But Alice, what about Joe?

00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:34.280
 - Please Sam oldrich, I don't care what...

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:36.800
 - Oh goodness, what's he doing?

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:40.120
 - Oh, dear, those olives are for dinner!

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:42.700
 (upbeat music)

00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:55.460
 (audience applauding)

00:13:55.460 --> 00:14:00.700
 (upbeat music)

00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:03.280
 (upbeat music)

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:05.860
 (upbeat music)

00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:08.440
 (upbeat music)

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:11.020
 (upbeat music)

00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:13.600
 (upbeat music)

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:16.180
 (upbeat music)

00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:18.760
 (upbeat music)

00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:21.340
 (upbeat music)

00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:23.920
 (upbeat music)

00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:26.500
 (upbeat music)

00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:29.080
 (upbeat music)

00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:31.660
 (lively music)

00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:34.240
 (lively music)

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:36.820
 (upbeat music)

00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:39.400
 (lively music)

00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:41.980
 (lively music)

00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:44.560
 (lively music)

00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:47.140
 (lively music)

00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:49.720
 (lively music)

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:52.300
 (lively music)

00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:54.880
 (lively music)

00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:57.460
 (lively music)

00:14:57.460 --> 00:15:00.220
 (dramatic music)

00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:02.800
 (lively music)

00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:05.380
 (upbeat music)

00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:32.380
 [Music]

00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:39.380
 [Applause]

00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:47.380
 [Music]

00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:51.380
 And now getting back to the troubles of Henry Orton.

00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:54.380
 When Marion invited Joe Graham up to the house for dinner,

00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:57.380
 she made the mistake of trying to get rid of Henry.

00:15:57.380 --> 00:16:00.380
 At the moment Joe is sitting in the living room reading travel magazines

00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:03.380
 The family is having a meeting in Henry's bedroom.

00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:05.380
 Alice, they've got to have dinner at the Kittenges.

00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:08.380
 Do you realize Frank Kittenger is one of my best clients?

00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:10.380
 I can't afford to offend him.

00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:13.380
 But then, how can I phone Mrs. Anderson and say they aren't coming?

00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:15.380
 You can have Maryponer.

00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:16.380
 What?

00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:19.380
 After deliberately sending her over to ask for the invitation.

00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:21.380
 Father, could I voice an opinion?

00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:23.380
 You may not. You've voiced too many already.

00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:25.380
 Henry, stop eating those jelly beans.

00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:27.380
 You'll need your appetite at the Anderson.

00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:33.920
 At the kitten's, but mother I'd rather just stay here in my room than have to go out any place with Homer

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:36.300
 You'll go out with Homer to like it. Yes, sir

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:41.080
 Sam, I don't understand why you weren't able to catch up with Mary before she got to the end

00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:43.840
 Uh, no Alice, uh, that's a long story

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:46.980
 Father, Father, Ghost Cora has been stolen

00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:49.000
 Mary, he says he left it in the drive line

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.040
 And just now when he looked out the window it was gone

00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:53.680
 Well, uh, tell him not to worry about it

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:55.040
 Not to worry.

00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:59.060
 Gee, whiz father, that car course show $150.

00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:03.860
 Well, anyway, he says that people get an awful surprise when he goes to push the cigarette lighter.

00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:05.260
 What are you supposed to happen?

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:05.760
 What?

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:07.460
 The whole roof falls on top of you.

00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:08.300
 [laughter]

00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:09.100
 Father!

00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:09.920
 Damn old-

00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:12.660
 Now, if I had to take it, it was blocking the driveway.

00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:17.540
 And Mary tell Joey can pick his car up at the garage tomorrow, and it'll have two new fenders.

00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:19.840
 Then, Sam, this whole thing was your fault.

00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:23.660
 And I want you to hone Mr. Kittenger and say the boys won't be over for dinner.

00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:25.500
 Alice, Mr. Kitten just wanted my best part.

00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:30.020
 I think you suppose you and Father could argue in the living room so we could teach you how it attains.

00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:32.060
 Henry, please go and answer that.

00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:34.100
 Sound stairs? Where Homer is?

00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:35.540
 Just pick it up here in my room.

00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:36.340
 Yes, sure.

00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:39.460
 Nossy here, Mary. Don't you know how to entertain the girls right now?

00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:40.960
 Hello?

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:42.460
 Hello? Hello?

00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:43.660
 Homer, where are you?

00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:46.320
 I'm right downstairs in your whole closet.

00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:48.780
 Would you mind kindly getting lost the line?

00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:50.780
 Hello, Homer. This is Frank being technical.

00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:55.780
 Homer, may I ask who gave you permission to take our phone into the hall closet?

00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:56.780
 Just ignore him, stringy.

00:17:56.780 --> 00:17:58.780
 How are you anyway?

00:17:58.780 --> 00:17:59.780
 I'm fine.

00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:00.780
 That's good.

00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:02.780
 Now listen, Henry.

00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:03.780
 How are you, Henry?

00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:04.780
 I'm fine.

00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:07.780
 That's good. I mean, can we get off the line?

00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:12.780
 Oh, I could just die. You know that dinner invitation was dinner invitation.

00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:16.780
 Oh, it's good to even know. I invited you and Henry over here for dinner.

00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:19.280
 You did? Oh, boy.

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:23.580
 Homer, my mother says we have to go to Kathleen Anderson's for dinner.

00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:25.780
 Are you going to the Anderson's?

00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:26.780
 Sure.

00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:29.380
 Stringing, what time do you want me to come over?

00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:30.980
 That's why I took time.

00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:35.080
 When I got home, I found enough for my mother sitting on those cat important beans.

00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:36.780
 They've been invited out for dinner.

00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:38.980
 Well, darn it all anyway.

00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:41.280
 Homer, do you like cotton beans?

00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:42.080
 No.

00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:43.280
 Neither do I.

00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:44.380
 Gee, I love them.

00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:46.380
 Listen, Henry, get off the line.

00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:47.780
 I'm gonna hold my lips on.

00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:50.580
 My mother left the phone on the house for having dinner last.

00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:52.980
 And I'm gonna phone up to get myself provided.

00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:54.880
 Yeah, but what about me?

00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:55.880
 That's it.

00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:58.680
 I'm just telling my friend of mine is starving to death.

00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:00.880
 Don't they know that duty and citizen?

00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:18.940
 Mrs. All the rich, is anybody gonna answer this phone?

00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:21.160
 Oh, Gee Whiz.

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:22.520
 Hello.

00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:24.700
 Hello, is that you Homer?

00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:25.360
 Yes.

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:28.180
 Have you, uh, have you had your dinner yet?

00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:29.040
 What?

00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:30.280
 No.

00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:33.540
 Then, dear, would you like to come over here for dinner?

00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:36.380
 Well, Gee Whiz, who is this?

00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:37.820
 This is your mother!

00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:40.380
 My mother?

00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:42.940
 And you're inviting me over for dinner?

00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:48.080
 Yes, the kids in truth are here. You remember the kids, Jude.

00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:51.380
 And their daughters, ring B? Yes, I got it on the phone.

00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:54.380
 Oh, baby. She and you'd really like to have me?

00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:59.880
 Why, I think yes. I don't know why. I didn't think of it before.

00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:02.880
 Well, thank you very much. I'd be delighted.

00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:05.880
 You're sure you haven't had your dinner?

00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:06.880
 I'm positive.

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:09.880
 Oh, well, come on then.

00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:11.880
 Oh, I'll be right over.

00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:15.680
 Take your time. Goodbye dear.

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:17.880
 Goodbye and thank you.

00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:20.880
 Oh Joe, Joe was that?

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:22.880
 Oh, it's you.

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:25.880
 Would you kindly mind stepping out of my way? I'm leaving.

00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:27.880
 You're leaving? I'd be delighted.

00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:31.880
 And would you mind sending me back my stuffed rattlesnake at your convenience?

00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:33.880
 I'll get it for you right now.

00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:35.880
 I'm sorry but I can't wait.

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:40.880
 It happens I've been invited out for dinner and my friends are very anxious for me to get there.

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:44.380
 Well, you better get going. Yeah

00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:48.980
 Well, it's been nice knowing you. Bye.

00:20:48.980 --> 00:20:52.240
 Bye

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:55.000
 Well

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:59.600
 Well, I have to answer the phone well

00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:02.960
 Bye

00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:04.960
 Bye

00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:11.360
 Hello, hello, is that you and me sure Kathleen? How are you?

00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:16.880
 Yeah

00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:23.440
 You mean she doesn't want me

00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:30.280
 She does well gee that suits me right down to the ground

00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:36.600
 The only thing is could I ask you one question

00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:43.600
 - No, I don't have any. - All I want to know is, well, exactly what has your mother

00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:45.600
 got against Homer?

00:21:45.600 --> 00:22:00.600
 Homer! Homer, your mother wants to know if you finish matching the potatoes yet.

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:02.600
 I'm mashing them. I'm mashing them.

00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:06.200
 Boy, does that Henry Aldrich make me sore?

00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:07.200
 Me too.

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:09.700
 Nobody in this whole family knows what they're doing.

00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:12.700
 And by Joba for dinner and where do you wind up?

00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:15.200
 In the whole closet with a bunch of gosh's.

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:20.300
 And imagine Henry eavesdropping on our telephone conversation like that.

00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:21.800
 Yeah, imagine.

00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:25.700
 Oh, it was his phone.

00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:29.100
 I know, but it was you I wanted to talk to, not him.

00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:35.100
 Sure, but just the same. He has a right to use his own phone if he wants to.

00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:37.100
 Oh, but he's so bossy.

00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:38.100
 Oh, I don't know.

00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:40.100
 Why don't the brownies always tell me what to do?

00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:44.100
 Yeah. Well, maybe I like being told what to do.

00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:45.100
 Well, my goodness.

00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:49.100
 And I'll thank you to stop making insulting remarks about my best friend.

00:22:49.100 --> 00:23:05.900
 friend. Mr. Dehaven. Yes, Henry. I guess I'll have another hamburger. Another one?

00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:11.140
 They didn't you have any dinner tonight? Well, as a matter of fact, I didn't. I was

00:23:11.140 --> 00:23:17.420
 invited out for dinner, but see, I don't know. You take women. No, you take men.

00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:18.420
 What's that?

00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:20.420
 Yeah, you take men.

00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:25.020
 You can talk to them for years and boy you always got lots to talk about.

00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:30.820
 But you talk to a woman for five minutes and see all she can talk about is men.

00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:33.060
 Well you don't say.

00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:34.060
 Sure.

00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:37.060
 All she can do is criticize your friends.

00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:44.580
 Homer, well that is, my friends might have big appetites but boy you never get bored

00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:45.580
 with him.

00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:52.580
 of them. Well, say, of course here. Oh, ow.

00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:55.580
 Mr. Behave, and have you done anything decent to eat?

00:23:55.580 --> 00:23:59.580
 Sure thing, Homer. You get up on that stool and I'll fix you some hamburgers.

00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:02.580
 This stool? This stool right here?

00:24:02.580 --> 00:24:04.580
 Yeah, I'll have them for you in a minute.

00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:09.580
 Oh. Hi. Hi.

00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:12.580
 Is this stool taken?

00:24:12.580 --> 00:24:14.580
 No, Gee, no.

00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:15.580
 So, then.

00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:16.580
 Thanks.

00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:18.580
 Did you all that?

00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:19.580
 Huh?

00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:22.580
 I said, "Isn't it cold out?"

00:24:22.580 --> 00:24:24.580
 I'll say.

00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:27.580
 Well, Gee, how are you, anyway?

00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:28.580
 I'm fine, Homer.

00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:30.580
 Just fine.

00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:32.580
 How are you?

00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:34.580
 I'm swell.

00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:35.580
 And...

00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:37.580
 Well, Gee, Homer.

00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:39.580
 Old timer.

00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:42.420
 Listen, I still got a dollar fifty.

00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:46.060
 Why don't you say we go over to the candy kitchen and get a whole lot of dessert?

00:24:46.060 --> 00:24:48.220
 I wouldn't mind going to the mansion now.

00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:50.300
 No sir, I'm Henry.

00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:52.380
 Listen Homer, I got a better idea.

00:24:52.380 --> 00:24:53.380
 Why?

00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:54.380
 Let's just stay here.

00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:55.380
 Swell.

00:24:55.380 --> 00:24:56.380
 Here are your hamburgers, Homer.

00:24:56.380 --> 00:24:59.060
 Oh boy, do they look good.

00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:00.820
 They are, Homer.

00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:01.820
 Hear him.

00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:03.420
 Have one of mine.

00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:04.420
 Thanks.

00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:06.260
 Gee whiz, is that Joe Graham?

00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:07.260
 Hi, Henry.

00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:08.260
 What are you doing here?

00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:10.260
 I'm having a mind dinner.

00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:11.760
 See, are those hamburgers?

00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:13.260
 That's just what I'm looking for.

00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:14.760
 Well, come on, sit down.

00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:17.760
 But Joe, didn't you just have a duck dinner over at my house?

00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:19.260
 Well, I started to.

00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:21.260
 Yeah, I bet the whole thing never would have happened

00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:22.760
 if the duck hadn't got burned.

00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:23.760
 It did?

00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:25.760
 Yes, your mother and father were so busy talking upstairs

00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:28.260
 they never would have noticed it if I hadn't smelled the smoke.

00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:29.760
 See, what do you mean you couldn't eat it?

00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:32.260
 Well, we started to, but then your father began telling me

00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:33.760
 how Mary does all the cooking.

00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:35.260
 And the first thing your mother knew,

00:25:35.260 --> 00:25:36.760
 Mary had dumped the gravy in her lap.

00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:38.360
 She, what did she do?

00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:39.360
 She went to bed.

00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:39.860
 Mary?

00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:40.860
 No, your mother.

00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:42.360
 Mary went for the doctor.

00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:44.160
 My mother needed a doctor?

00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:45.960
 No, the doctor was for your father.

00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:48.360
 You see, he was carrying a tray up to your mother

00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:51.360
 and he slid on some jelly beans and put it his ankle.

00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:54.060
 Oh, I wish I'd been there.

00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:56.060
 Listen, Homer, if we'd been there,

00:25:56.060 --> 00:25:59.060
 they'd only have blamed the whole thing on us.

00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:01.860
 Here, Joe, would you like a hamburger?

00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:03.560
 Yeah, thanks.

00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:06.660
 Certainly, two bad things had to go wrong.

00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:09.660
 You're the only boyfriend Mary has.

00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:12.660
 Well, somebody passed the catch-up.

 Well, thank you, Mary. The Sam, isn't she efficient?

00:28:52.660 --> 00:28:55.300
 She certainly is. The next time Joe comes for dinner,
