00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
 The Olrich family based on characters originated by Clifford Goldsmith and starring Ezra Stonas Henry with Jackie Kalk as Homer.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
 Henry! Henry Olrich!

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
 Coming, Mother!

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 [applause]

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 When you take a typical American family, plus some friends and neighbors,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.240
 You don't have to be a teenage boy.

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.280
 Well, you needn't bother to stir things up.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.520
 The boy will always attend to that.

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.640
 Henry Olridge is no exception to the rule.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.120
 The scene opens in the Aldrich living room.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.280
 It's early morning.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.160
 Now, Alice.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:59.560
 Now, Mother.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:00.760
 Sam, I'm not crying.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:01.760
 Of course not, Alice.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:02.880
 Of course not, Mother.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.440
 Here, take my handkerchief.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.560
 Alice, you knew Mary would be doing a thing like this,

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:07.520
 eventually.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.400
 Yes, only.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.920
 Sam, she's so young.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.680
 You and Father wouldn't want me around the house for the rest of your lives, would you?

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.000
 It's just a matter of getting used to the idea, out of it.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.280
 You'll get over it in no time.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.120
 Of course you will, Mother.

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:21.600
 Henry Oldridge!

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.800
 Oh, Gee whiz.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:23.560
 Henry!

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.280
 Henry Oldridge, how long have you been there under that piano?

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.200
 Why are you not long, Mary?

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.840
 Dear, please get off the floor with your clean sweater.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:31.880
 Yes, Mother.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.040
 And what's in that gunny sack beside you?

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:34.760
 Gunny sack?

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.440
 Mother, that's no gunny sack.

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:37.000
 No.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.600
 Gee whiz, no.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:39.480
 Then what is it?

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:40.980
 Hi Mrs. Aldrich.

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:41.980
 My goodness!

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.380
 Santa Coma!

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.780
 An understandable mistake, Alice.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.580
 And would you mind telling us what you and Homer were doing under that piano?

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:51.980
 Doing, Father?

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:52.780
 If you please.

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:53.680
 Why you?

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.080
 You might say we're looking for a golf ball, Father,

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.680
 that accidentally rolled under there from the hall.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:00.480
 A golf ball?

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.280
 Yes, sir, and I was helping him.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.980
 You don't say?

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:03.680
 Yes, sir.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:04.480
 Yes, sir.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.880
 Then may I ask why you didn't let us know you were there?

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.380
 Why, uh...

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.080
 We didn't think it was polite to interrupt you.

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.080
 Henry Aldrich, I never thought you'd stupid-slow with spying under piano on your own sister.

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.880
 Spying? Mary, I was spying?

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:19.880
 Yes, you were.

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.880
 Well, honest, Mary, we hardly heard a word.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:23.880
 Did we, Homer?

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.880
 No, hardly a word.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.180
 Well, then, suppose you each take an apple and go outside.

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.680
 Outside? Yes.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.180
 Before we find out why Mary's leaving home.

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.680
 Homer?

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.180
 Mr. Aldrich, I'm not nosy.

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.180
 I'm just naturally curious.

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.780
 When the time comes for you boys to know, you will be told.

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:43.780
 Now run along, Henry.

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.380
 Yes, Father. Come on, Homer.

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:46.180
 Well, other...

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.180
 Mother, won't you please give me your permit?

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.380
 Boy, Henry, why do you suppose they're throwing Mary out of the house?

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:52.980
 Homer, they're not.

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.180
 No. She's throwing them out?

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.780
 No, she's just leaving peacefully.

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:59.580
 What for?

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:00.580
 Don't you get it?

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.980
 Mary's finally getting married.

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.380
 Mary? Sure.

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:05.980
 Mary? Sure.

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:06.980
 To a fella?

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:07.980
 Homer.

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:13.380
 It's just that I've always looked at her as just a member of your family.

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.140
 Not someone in person would marry.

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:16.140
 Why not?

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.620
 She was when you forget your prejudice.

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.300
 Mary's really a darn good looking girl.

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:22.300
 She is?

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:23.300
 Sure.

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.340
 Henry, who do you think she's doing it to?

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:26.340
 Doing what to?

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.340
 Getting married to.

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:29.340
 Gene.

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.220
 Kermit Hannigan, I guess.

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.860
 The Kermit Hannigan who's a reporter on the time.

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:35.300
 Well, who else could it be?

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:36.300
 Oh, boy.

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:40.300
 - Hi Henry, you'll be able to get your name in the paper any time you want.

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:41.900
 - Not exactly, Homer.

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.000
 Kermit sort of specializes in obituaries.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.600
 - No, Mary, I must thought my housework.

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.200
 - For what you say, you'll let me first.

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.200
 - Alice, why not?

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.100
 - Sam, I told you, Henry, why aren't you outside?

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.000
 - Why, we're just about to go, Mother.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.900
 Come on, Homer.

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:58.900
 - Okay, and good luck, Mary.

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.100
 - Homer, we're not supposed to know.

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.600
 - You see, Mother, even Homer approves.

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.800
 Dear Homer is not your mother.

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.400
 Why not say yes and get it over with?

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.560
 Well, Mary, will you ask Alvin to let you come home to lunch every day?

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:13.640
 All the way home?

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.920
 Well, Mary, I'm sure he can spare you for that long.

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:17.080
 Well, I'll ask him.

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:20.280
 And tell him I insist that you take a nap in the afternoon.

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:21.240
 No, Alice.

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:25.440
 Sam, she's always been a little weak since she had her tonsils out.

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.240
 That was when she was 12.

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.640
 I know, but she's never completely recovered.

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:30.440
 Mother.

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.560
 No, Alice, I was 14 when I got my first job, and it did me a world of good.

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.060
 Yes, Sam, but your tonsils were like iron.

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:40.060
 Alice, why get so upset over a little thing like Mary getting a job?

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:43.760
 Sam, old rich, if your only daughter were going to work in a hard list

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.560
 or filled with saws and chisels, you'd be upset too.

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:59.560
 - Area your sodas, boys. - Thanks, Mr. Dehaven.

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.960
 Now, I let be, Mrs. Kilmer.

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:06.640
 She was... imagine. Poor little Mary getting married.

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.760
 Homer, what's so terrible about that?

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.400
 She was all people have to get married sometime.

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.360
 Show me one person who isn't.

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.160
 You're in Harriet.

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.760
 She's a rare case, Homer.

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:22.160
 Besides, she's going to marry Alvin Springer someday.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.240
 The one who owns Springer's hardware?

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.640
 Yeah. When?

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:26.640
 Someday.

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:29.160
 She better hurry if she's going to.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:30.600
 Homer, she's not that old.

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:32.120
 She's just around 40.

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:33.120
 Sure.

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.120
 But where around 40?

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.880
 Just around it, Homer.

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:41.520
 She's been that way for as long as I can remember.

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:46.440
 Well, 40's a good place to get stuck, I guess.

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:50.280
 Gee, you know, it's going to feel funny with Mary out of the house.

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:51.200
 Funny how?

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:52.240
 Oh, no.

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:53.760
 Oh, mister.

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:56.560
 Gee, there's one swell kid, Mary.

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:00.640
 When I think of all the swell arguments we've had together,

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:03.940
 gee, there's one swell kid.

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:05.740
 Henry, you'll get over it.

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:07.540
 Sure, but just the same.

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:12.780
 Every time I pass your empty room, I'll get a pain right here.

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:13.740
 Excuse me, Henry.

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:15.820
 Did I hear you say you had an empty room?

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:17.060
 What's that, Mr. de Haven?

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:20.060
 If it's for rent, my nephew might go as high as $6 a week.

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:21.180
 $6?

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:22.140
 Take it, Henry.

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:22.740
 Take it.

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:23.740
 Now, wait a minute, Homer.

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:25.620
 Mr. de Haven, we're not renting the room.

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:29.620
 It's just that my sister Mary is getting married, we think.

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:30.620
 You don't say.

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:32.620
 What's that Mrs. Kilmer?

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:34.620
 Do you have to give a body to help me die?

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:35.620
 Yes, I'll be right with you.

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:38.620
 Well, if you decide to rent that room, Henry, let me know.

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:41.620
 Gee, Henry, six dollars. Why did you turn him down?

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:43.620
 Because it's ridiculous, that's why.

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:45.620
 What's ridiculous about it?

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:49.620
 You said yourself every time you pass her room, you'll get a pain right here.

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:52.620
 Oh, sure, only what would my father say?

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:57.180
 Henry he'll probably double your allowance if you bring in six extra dollars a week.

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:58.180
 I don't know.

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:01.420
 You might even get more than six dollars if you throw in breakfast.

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:02.420
 Breakfast?

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:04.220
 Home or my mother would never agree.

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:05.220
 Why not?

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:07.940
 What's one more stranger at breakfast?

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:10.580
 But that takes all the profit out of Henry.

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:14.780
 How much can one egg and one orange and one cup of coffee cost?

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:15.780
 Ten cents.

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:18.420
 Fifteen at the most.

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:19.900
 Twenty tops.

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:21.620
 Suppose he wants two eggs.

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:25.940
 We'll put that in the contract one egg or his rent goes up

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:31.500
 Well, it's a matter of fact if we're getting ate for breakfast think of all we could get if we throw in dinner now

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:36.100
 Listen home Henry if your mother doesn't object to breakfast. Why should she did dinner?

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:48.260
 But Daisy

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:52.100
 Who was that on the phone Mary? Daisy Hoffman.

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:56.100
 And mother she's never said anything so strange to me in my life.

00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:57.100
 Strange? How?

00:07:57.100 --> 00:08:01.100
 Well I know sooner lifted the receiver when she said, "Why didn't I tell her first?"

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:04.100
 And then she burst out crying. What? Then she hung up.

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:07.100
 What do you suppose me to say that? I can't imagine.

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:10.100
 Unless... Unless what?

00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:13.100
 You don't think she wanted that job at Springer's too. You think so?

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:16.100
 Well my goodness she certainly has her nerves.

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:19.100
 Especially when she knows I'm taking the job because of Kermit.

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:22.600
 Kermit, yes. He asked me what I did during the day.

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:25.100
 And mother, I've never been so tongue tied in my life.

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:27.100
 Well, I've seen who that is.

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:28.600
 Hello?

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:32.600
 Alice, this is Sam. Do you know any other orchards in Centerville?

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:33.600
 Are they orchards?

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:35.600
 Yes. They might rent rooms.

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:37.600
 No, Sam. Why?

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:41.100
 I just had a call from a man who heard from another man that we have a room for rent.

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:42.100
 We?

00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:42.600
 With breakfast.

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:43.600
 My goodness.

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:45.600
 What did you tell him?

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:47.360
 - The city obviously had the wrong party.

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:48.640
 - I should say so.

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:51.680
 My goodness, we just about have enough room for ourselves.

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:54.260
 (upbeat music)

00:08:54.260 --> 00:09:04.680
 Can you hear me from under the car, Chester?

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:05.520
 - Yeah, sure.

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:06.840
 Hand me that hammer.

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:07.680
 - Gee, sure.

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:09.560
 - I'll get it, and I'll get it.

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:10.880
 Here, Chester.

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:11.720
 - Oops.

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:13.880
 - Oh boy.

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:15.200
 Did that get you, Chester?

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:17.200
 Well, not quite. It was a good try though.

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:20.200
 What's the best offer you've gotten for the room so far?

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:23.200
 Gia fella went to eight dollars, not more than ten minutes ago.

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:24.200
 As high as that?

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:27.200
 Did we mention breakfast was included?

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:29.200
 Yeah. And it's a nice room?

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:31.200
 I'll say it has double exposure.

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:32.200
 Oh yeah?

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:35.200
 The person who's moving out had it for nearly nineteen years.

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:38.200
 You don't say. Where is this room, Henry?

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:43.200
 Well, if I get permission at our house, yours, I didn't know you had an extra room.

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:46.100
 We don't. But we're losing Mary.

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:48.800
 Mary, your sister? She's sick?

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:51.300
 No. She's getting married.

00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:54.300
 Oh, you don't say. Who's a lucky guy?

00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:57.700
 Well, I'm not absolutely positive.

00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:02.000
 And, gee, I wouldn't want to start any unfounded rumors.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.700
 Oh, naturally. Henry, I'll take the room.

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:05.500
 You will?

00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:07.000
 Oh, boy, Henry.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.700
 I'll tell you the truth. I'm not very happy where I am.

00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:15.900
 Well, I'll tell you I'll have to get my mother and father's permission first. Well, that shouldn't be any trouble student

00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:21.540
 Well, I don't think so. Henry you won't have any trouble at all. Okay. Nobody excuse me when I make a phone call

00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:26.720
 Sure Chester old kid Henry, why don't we celebrate with a soul?

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:30.300
 L nine nine six

00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:38.540
 Henry were you calling on Chester? How are the acoustics and Mary's room the acoustics?

00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:41.940
 Well, Mary never had any trouble with him.

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:44.140
 Oh?

00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:45.840
 Mrs. Smith, this is Chester.

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:48.340
 You know, the fellow who has your front room?

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:49.140
 Yes.

00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:52.540
 Mrs. Smith, are you still against my practicing in my room?

00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:53.740
 I am.

00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:55.140
 Well, in that case, Mrs. Smith,

00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:58.540
 that my interest you to know that I'm taking my instrument and moving.

00:10:58.540 --> 00:11:01.140
 Well, I'm certainly glad to hear that.

00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:04.140
 I've got at least 20 people waiting to snap up that rule.

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:14.140
 [Music]

00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:17.640
 Mr. Dehaven, could I have a tube of toothpaste please?

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:23.640
 By sure thing Mary. Here you are. I guess you're looking forward to the big day.

00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:26.140
 My goodness, how did you hear about that?

00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:28.140
 Oh, I heard. Congratulations.

00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:30.140
 Thank you, Mr. Dehaven.

00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:31.140
 It must be pretty excited.

00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:33.140
 I am. It's my first.

00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:36.140
 I assumed it was.

00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:38.140
 Here's the money for the toothpaste.

00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:39.140
 Thank you.

00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:42.140
 Who's the lucky man?

00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:43.140
 Aren't you nice?

00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:45.140
 I wouldn't call him lucky exactly.

00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:47.140
 I'm very inexperienced.

00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:49.140
 What is Alvin Springer?

00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:50.140
 Who?

00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:51.140
 Alvin Springer.

00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:53.140
 The Alvin Springer that's put...

00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:54.140
 Alvin Springer?

00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:55.140
 Yes.

00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:56.140
 I've got to run along now.

00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:58.140
 If you need any hardware, drop in.

00:11:58.140 --> 00:11:59.140
 Yes.

00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:00.140
 Yes, thank you.

00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:01.140
 I will.

00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:02.140
 I'll catch you.

00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:03.780
 Oh, she was.

00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:05.260
 She watched me.

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:06.820
 Come on goodness, it's you two.

00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:07.460
 She was.

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:08.060
 Hi, Mary.

00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:08.820
 Hi, Mary.

00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:09.980
 Henry, I'm in a hurry.

00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:10.900
 Goodbye, Mary.

00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:12.700
 Goodbye, Mary.

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:15.380
 And we know that I take a good look at her.

00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:16.380
 You're right.

00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:17.820
 She's darn pretty.

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:18.820
 I know.

00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:20.620
 She the more I look at her.

00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:24.780
 The more I wish I'd noticed her when she was available.

00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:26.500
 Are you and Mary?

00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:29.140
 What's so crazy about that?

00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:30.340
 Well, hello there, boys.

00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:32.780
 Hi Mr. Dehaven, two double skyscrapers.

00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:33.580
 Yes sir.

00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:37.540
 And Mr. Dehaven, in view of business conditions,

00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:40.680
 I don't think we can let your nephew have it for six.

00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:42.620
 At what? Mary's room.

00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:43.620
 Oh yes.

00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:45.740
 Well Henry, you could have bolded me over with a feather

00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:47.420
 when she told me who she was married.

00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:48.500
 She told you?

00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:49.320
 Sure.

00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:52.860
 And the last man in the world I'd think of would be Alvin Springer.

00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:53.500
 What?

00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:54.300
 What?

00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:55.700
 Alvin Springer.

00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:58.300
 Old Alvin Springer?

00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:01.560
 Oh, gee whiz, Mr. Dehaven, you must be mistaken.

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:03.160
 She's not marrying Mr. Springer.

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:05.260
 She's marrying Kermit Hannigan.

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.800
 Henry, she just told me herself.

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:09.200
 Whose guy's scraper's come to help?

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:11.160
 She whiz, Henry.

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:12.400
 Mr. Springer.

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:16.280
 Homer, of course, it has its good side.

00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:19.880
 You'll never have to worry about nuts and bolts again.

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:21.320
 Don't be ridiculous.

00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:23.680
 Mr. Dehaven must have misunderstood, Mary.

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:24.480
 What?

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:28.040
 Gee whiz, Mr. Springer's promised to my Aunt Harriet.

00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:30.040
 Why would he marry Mary?

00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:32.040
 Henry, tell me the truth.

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:35.040
 If you had your choice between Mary and your Aunt Harry,

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:37.040
 at which would you take?

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:57.040
 And now getting back to the troubles of Henry Olbridge.

00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:03.040
 Henry and Homer have unwittingly started a rumor that Mary is about to be married.

00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:09.040
 But when the story returns to the boys, they're dumbfounded to learn that old Alvin Springer

00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:12.040
 has entered the picture as Mary's prospective bridegroom.

00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:17.040
 The scene opens in Alvin's hardware store. It is later that day.

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:18.040
 Hello there, Mr. Springer.

00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:19.040
 Well, hello, Mary.

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:22.040
 I thought I'd stop by and tell you I can take the job.

00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:23.040
 Well, that's fine.

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:25.640
 My goodness, I had a terrible time before they said yes.

00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:28.040
 Where's everyone so against women working?

00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:29.440
 Speaking of that, Mary...

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:30.440
 Yes, Mr. Springer.

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:34.640
 I hope you won't think I'm prying, but once you start working here, you'll stay, won't you?

00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:36.040
 My goodness, why shouldn't I?

00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:40.240
 Well, I've been hearing a rumor that you see, Mary, it takes time to train someone,

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:42.440
 and once I do, I want to be sure...

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:44.640
 You're not planning on getting married, are you?

00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:46.040
 My goodness, no.

00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:46.840
 Good.

00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:48.640
 That is my goodness, yes.

00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:51.840
 I mean, naturally, I hope to marry someday.

00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:56.000
 But the young man I have in mind feels he should work his way out of obituaries first.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.840
 And you know how long a thing like that can take.

00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:02.040
 Now, don't get the idea. I'm against marriage.

00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:06.840
 As a matter of fact, can you keep a secret?

00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:07.840
 Oh, yes.

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:10.840
 I proposed your Aunt Harriet last night.

00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:11.840
 You did?

00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:12.840
 Mm-hmm.

00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:14.840
 Well, my goodness.

00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:17.840
 I'm so happy I'm going to kiss you.

00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:18.840
 Oh.

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:19.840
 There.

00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:20.840
 Uncle Alton.

00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:23.440
 Mary, right in the front window of the store.

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:24.640
 Mary, my goodness, why not?

00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:26.340
 We're practically in the same family.

00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:28.040
 Yes, now that you mention it.

00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:29.340
 Well, I've got to be going.

00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:30.840
 Oh, goodbye, Mary.

00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:32.540
 See you Monday morning, 9 o'clock.

00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:34.140
 9 o'clock sharp.

00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:35.640
 Mary, wait a minute.

00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:37.640
 Mary, shouldn't you carry the tin first?

00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:38.840
 Three.

00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:40.840
 My goodness, why are you so flushed?

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:44.840
 Mary, I didn't believe it when I heard it.

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:48.240
 And boy, if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes,

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:49.740
 I'd never believed it.

00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:50.740
 I believe what?

00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:55.940
 Naturally, you're free to do whatever you please, but you certainly ought to think of your family.

00:15:55.940 --> 00:15:57.240
 What are you talking about?

00:15:57.240 --> 00:16:02.340
 You know very well, and I certainly don't blame Mother for not wanting to give her permission.

00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:04.240
 Henry, why should you object to that?

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:07.640
 Why not? Boy, I'll be the laughing stock of Centerville!

00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:08.840
 Just because I...

00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:11.740
 Why, Henry, I never imagined you were that old-fashioned.

00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:12.440
 What?

00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:15.640
 And this is your free country, and I'll thank you, remember the Bill of Rights.

00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:17.440
 Okay, Mary. Okay.

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:19.840
 But wait until father hears about this.

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:20.880
 - Can we come back?

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:22.960
 And may interest you to know we already had.

00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:23.960
 - Mary.

00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:24.880
 - Yes, Homer?

00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:26.080
 - Mary.

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:27.920
 I may have a way out.

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:29.200
 - How to what?

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:30.520
 - Mary.

00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:33.360
 Mary, if I were to ask you to wait for me,

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:35.200
 would it sound ridiculous?

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:36.720
 - Wait for you to what?

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:38.560
 - She already sounds ridiculous.

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:40.240
 (audience laughing)

00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:43.440
 - Homer, you mean wait for you to marry me?

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:44.480
 - Are you mad?

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:47.320
 - Well, no, of course I'm not mad, Homer.

00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:50.320
 You're not. Oh boy.

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:55.320
 The only thing is, of course, I'd have to keep going to school until maybe Sunday I graduate.

00:16:55.320 --> 00:17:00.320
 But if you're helping with my algebra, that shouldn't take more than three or four years.

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:01.320
 Homer!

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:04.320
 And naturally, you'd have to get my parents consent to give me away.

00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:07.320
 But that shouldn't be too hard.

00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:09.320
 Homer! Yes, Mary.

00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:10.320
 Dear.

00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:13.320
 Homer, naturally, I'm very flat.

00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:16.600
 You're very sweet to ask me, but I'm afraid it's out of the question.

00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:21.160
 Well, if it's money you're worried about, Mary, I think I can get my father to raise my allowance.

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:25.240
 Oh, I don't have time to explain now, but I'm afraid I have someone else's mind.

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:29.480
 I know, but, Mary, don't you think I'm an improvement?

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:30.840
 Mary.

00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:41.560
 Now, Chester, control yourself.

00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:42.800
 Control myself, Mr. Orr.

00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:44.600
 Do you realize what your son's done to me?

00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:46.480
 Mr. Smith has already rented my room.

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:47.880
 I appreciate that, Chester.

00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:49.920
 I've got my bags and my instrument case outside

00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:50.820
 where I'm going to put them.

00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:51.560
 Instrument case?

00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:53.800
 Mr. Orr, I'm afraid I'm going to have to insist

00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:55.320
 that you find me someplace to live.

00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:55.720
 But, yes.

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:57.760
 And until then, there's just one thing I can do.

00:17:57.760 --> 00:17:58.920
 Move in here.

00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:00.840
 Here, in my office, I can sleep on the couch.

00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:01.400
 No, Chester.

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:03.640
 As we move the water cooler in here, I can shave by the window.

00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:05.040
 Now, wait a minute.

00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:06.400
 Your father here?

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:07.600
 Henry, come in here.

00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:09.720
 Oh, boy, Father, do you know what's happening?

00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:14.720
 Would I know what's going to happen? You're going to march right out of here and not come back until you found Chester a room.

00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:16.720
 Chester? Oh gee, will you?

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:18.720
 Oh, you sure got me in a fine pickle Henry.

00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:20.720
 I know, but it wasn't definite.

00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:22.720
 Henry, let's not waste time. Mark.

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:26.720
 But father, you heard him, Henry. And make sure the room's big enough for my glockenspiel.

00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:38.720
 Mother, I could die. I could just die.

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:40.360
 Mary calmed down.

00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:41.360
 Mother, how can I?

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:42.560
 You will have to try.

00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:45.160
 Your nervous system won't be in any condition for dinner.

00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:47.800
 But, Mother, don't you realize what I heard on the bus?

00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:48.360
 What?

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:49.920
 I'm getting married.

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:50.480
 What?

00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:52.120
 Isn't that wonderful?

00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:54.200
 Dear, you mean just because you overheard

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:56.000
 some idle conversation on the bus.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000
 You were jumping to a conclusion like that.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.480
 Mother, it was Mrs. Kilmer, and she's never wrong.

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:02.600
 Oh, yes, but who is it?

00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:03.560
 I don't know.

00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:05.840
 Mrs. Kilmer got off the bus before I found out.

00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:08.120
 For my goodness.

00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:11.000
 Do you suppose those roses had anything to do with it?

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:11.800
 What, Rosie?

00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:13.880
 Well, they came for you a little while ago.

00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:14.840
 From who?

00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:15.400
 I don't know.

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:17.040
 There was no card with them.

00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:19.320
 But do you know what was in the box?

00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:20.480
 I'll answer the door, mother.

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:21.880
 Try to control yourself.

00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:23.520
 Dear, your hair's coming back.

00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:24.440
 I'm controlled, mother.

00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:25.440
 I'm controlled.

00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:27.600
 But in a business tree--

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:29.640
 what, Kermit?

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:30.320
 Hello, Mary.

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:31.400
 Hello.

00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:32.600
 Come in.

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:34.480
 Thank you.

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:36.400
 Did my roses arrive yet?

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:37.640
 Oh.

00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:39.240
 Oh, you're the one!

00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:41.640
 Well, after I heard the news, I thought...

00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:43.640
 ...there to show you how I feel, Mary.

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:44.840
 Oh, my goodness.

00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:46.640
 But the reason I came over is...

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:49.240
 ...did you happen to find my umbrella among the roses?

00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:50.240
 Your umbrella?

00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:55.840
 It wasn't until I got back to the office that I noticed I had the car that went with the flowers in my hand and my umbrella was gone.

00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:58.340
 Oh, I'll certainly keep my eye out, poorness.

00:19:58.340 --> 00:19:58.940
 Thank you.

00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:02.540
 And you didn't have to go to anything as expensive as flowers.

00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:04.240
 That's okay, Mary.

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:07.240
 After all, a thing like this only comes once in a lifetime.

00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:09.240
 And Mary.

00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:10.240
 Yes, Kern.

00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:12.240
 We'll always be friends, won't we?

00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:14.240
 I certainly hope so.

00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:16.240
 And I'm sure you will be very happy.

00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:18.240
 I hope you will be too.

00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:21.240
 I'll try, but frankly, it may be a little hard.

00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:22.240
 Well, Kern, Miss.

00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:24.240
 Mary, I guess this is goodbye.

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:26.240
 Good-bye, aren't you coming over tonight?

00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:29.240
 Well, Mary, after all, I mean, do you think I should?

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:30.240
 My goodness, why not?

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:31.240
 Well, I mean...

00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:33.240
 What will Mr. Sprinter say?

00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:35.240
 Mr. Springer, what does he have to know?

00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:36.240
 Mary!

00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:38.240
 Just because I'm going to work in his hardware store?

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:41.240
 Work! You're going to work after you're married?

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:43.240
 Well, of course, Kermit, that's up to you.

00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:44.240
 Me?

00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:48.240
 Yeah. I feel the husband should always decide things like that.

00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:54.240
 Mary. Mary, do you mind if I sit down on this umbrella stand? I suddenly feel weak.

00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:55.240
 Of course not.

00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:58.240
 Mary, aren't you marrying Alvin Springer?

00:20:58.240 --> 00:20:59.240
 What?

00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:03.640
 Oh, that's what I heard. I mean someone told me Henry said that I think.

00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:06.040
 Well, if that isn't the most ridiculous thing I ever heard.

00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:06.940
 You mean you're not.

00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:10.940
 Now, Kermit, why should I marry someone like Alvin when I knew you were just around the corner?

00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:11.940
 I mean...

00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:13.440
 Mary...

00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:15.540
 Mary...

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:17.540
 What, Kermit, why...

00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:19.540
 I'm stuck in the umbrella stand.

00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:25.140
 Hi there, can I have my supper now?

00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:26.940
 Henry, oh, did you come in here?

00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:28.940
 Mary, I haven't got time to...

00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:30.180
 What are you doing here?

00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:32.180
 Henry, what are you going around saying?

00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:34.440
 Well, I'm saying something, Mary.

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:36.440
 Henry, Mary is marrying Alvin.

00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:37.440
 She is?

00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:39.440
 Of course not, I'm just working for him.

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:41.440
 Wow, Gee, way!

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:43.940
 And you should know better than to start rumors like that.

00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:45.440
 Mary, I give you my word of honor.

00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:46.440
 I didn't start it.

00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:47.440
 No.

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:48.440
 She was.

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:49.440
 No, I heard it from someone.

00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:50.440
 Who?

00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:51.440
 Who?

00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:52.440
 Let me think now.

00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:53.440
 Who was it?

00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:54.440
 Who was it?

00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:55.440
 Henry, is that you?

00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:56.440
 Oh, Gee, with...

00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:57.440
 Yes, Father?

00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:58.440
 Henry, have you...

00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:01.160
 - Father, aren't you going to say hello to Kermit?

00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:03.960
 - Oh, yes, hello Kermit, Henry.

00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:06.180
 - Mr. Aldige, while I have you here.

00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:09.040
 While I have you here, sir.

00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:11.200
 - Wait until I've done it Kermit.

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:14.280
 We ever discuss things with Father on an empty stomach.

00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:15.120
 - What's that?

00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:17.360
 - And Father, if you're worried as to why I'm home,

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:19.520
 all I'm going to do is get a little nourishment,

00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:21.440
 then I'm going to put my nose right back

00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:24.240
 to the grindstone and fine Chester a room.

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:25.440
 - You haven't found one yet?

00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:27.720
 - Father, honest, I've looked everywhere.

00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:31.720
 The only empty room I could find was in the YWCA.

00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:33.720
 I see.

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:36.720
 And they won't let Chester above the ground floor there.

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:37.720
 Hey Henry!

00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:40.720
 What's Homer doing here at a time like this?

00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:42.720
 It must be dinner time.

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:45.720
 Hey, where can I have Chester a room?

00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:50.720
 You have? Oh boy, Father, did you hear that Gee whiz Homer? Where did you find one?

00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:51.720
 Homer in my house.

00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:54.720
 Your house? I didn't know you had an extra room Homer.

00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:56.720
 We haven't. I'm renting a mine.

00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:57.720
 You're?

00:22:57.720 --> 00:22:58.720
 For $14.

00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:03.120
 So, Hinn, could you come outside and help me with my trunk?

00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:04.120
 What?

00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:05.120
 Your trunk?

00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:06.520
 What's your trunk doing over here?

00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:10.120
 Well, Jean, Mr. Olrich, I've better have some place to live.

00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:11.520
 Now, wait a minute.

00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:13.120
 Wait a minute.

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:16.320
 Once and for all, we are not renting any rooms in this house.

00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:19.320
 But, Mr. Olrich, that's the beautiful part of it.

00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:21.320
