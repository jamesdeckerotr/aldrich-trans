1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,240
 Henry! Henry Oldry coming, mother!

2
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:27,560
 The Oldry family written by Clifford Goldsmith and starring as Ristone. Entertainment for

3
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:34,560
 all the family brought to you by Postam, attempting wholesome drink for all the family. Postam.

4
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:53,880
 Friends, welcome once again to a visit with the Aldrich family. And since this program

5
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:58,040
 as intended primarily for your amusement, we hope there's nothing to interfere with

6
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,720
 your sitting back and enjoying the fun.

7
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:05,880
 Of course, if something does interfere, if perhaps you're troubled by a touch of indigestion,

8
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,040
 we suggest that for the moment you be practical about it.

9
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,600
 Now while you think of it, consider whether coffee may cause your indigestion, whether

10
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,800
 you wouldn't benefit by drinking post-em instead.

11
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:21,080
 You see, while coffee is popular with most people, and while many people can drink it

12
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:24,680
 without feeling distress, many others cannot.

13
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:29,520
 So by all means, if you think coffee upsets you, switch to postam.

14
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,120
 For postam contains no stimulants, nothing upsetting in any way.

15
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:38,680
 Just drink fragrant flavorful postam instead of coffee, and see if before long your indigestion

16
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:43,960
 hasn't gone, see if you don't feel lots more humid again, after you give postam a fair

17
00:01:43,960 --> 00:02:00,960
 [Music]

18
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,960
 There is a neat white house at 117 Elm Street in Centerville.

19
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,960
 It's the home of the Aldrich's and an average American family.

20
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:12,460
 Their son Henry is typical of any teenage youngster.

21
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:15,760
 He's lively, adventurous, a real boy.

22
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,460
 Tonight we find Henry in the living room with his mother and father.

23
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:25,360
 But why do you say that, dear? Because, mother, because I don't want to get mixed up with anybody.

24
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,660
 But Henry, simply writing a letter to a girl doesn't mean you're in love with her.

25
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:32,660
 It could be taken that way. And I'm not even interested in her.

26
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,060
 You're not even interested in whom?

27
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,860
 In Darris Townsend, father.

28
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:36,960
 When did you see her?

29
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,680
 I didn't see her. I had a letter, just a ordinary short letter from her.

30
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,680
 And mother thinks I ought to sit right away and answer it.

31
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,680
 Well, Henry, I think she ought to know the truth.

32
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,720
 The truth about what?

33
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,120
 About me getting married.

34
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,360
 Getting what?

35
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,000
 Married. That's what the letter's about, Father.

36
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,560
 She says, "Dear Henry, we happen to read in the Centerville section of last evening's

37
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,360
 Middletown paper that a Mr. and Mrs. Aldridge announced the engagement of their son.

38
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,040
 Is this you? If so, mother says congratulations.

39
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,440
 Father says, "Who's the lucky girl?" Sincerely, Doris.

40
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,540
 How to thing like that get into the paper.

41
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:12,640
 It's a very simple mistake, Sam.

42
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,340
 The older Isoil born Maple Street is going to be married sometime next spring.

43
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:16,840
 Oh.

44
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,440
 And that's why I think Henry should take the time to write to Doris.

45
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,840
 But, Mother, why don't we just put a denial in the paper, then everybody will be satisfied.

46
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,740
 Henry, I think your mother would like you to write a letter.

47
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:29,540
 But, Father, I'm doing what Nancy Adams writes this minute.

48
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:32,940
 She's probably sitting over to her house wondering why I'm not there.

49
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,240
 And here I am here.

50
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,680
 But Henry, by this time, you could have had the letter written.

51
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,640
 Not an explain things properly, mother.

52
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,400
 Henry, you're to write the letter tonight.

53
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:40,900
 Tonight?

54
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:41,640
 Now.

55
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:46,200
 Now, Sam, as Nancy Adams is waiting, I don't think it's quite as important as that.

56
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,680
 I thought you wanted him to write it.

57
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:52,760
 I do, dear, but after all, why can't he be home by 9.30 and write a postcard before he goes to bed?

58
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,760
 Yes, mother. That's the least I can do.

59
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,280
 Are you sure you'll come home early?

60
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:56,960
 Yes, mother.

61
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,680
 Alice, you don't think you ought to write it before he goes?

62
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,080
 Sam, Henry's promised to be here by 9.30.

63
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:07,080
 And, G-Father, you know me, when I promise to do a thing, I break my neck doing it.

64
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:17,080
 [Music]

65
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,580
 Do you really think so, Henry?

66
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:26,080
 Oh, sure, Nancy. You take any marriage. Gee, the average marriage. I think that when a person's...

67
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,080
 You know what I mean?

68
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,080
 Well, as a matter of fact, Henry...

69
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,580
 Well, I think that you ought to have a diversity of interest.

70
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:34,000
 - No, you thought about this a lot, haven't you?

71
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,780
 - It's just common sense.

72
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,580
 Suppose a man marries a girl

73
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:40,220
 and all they both like is the same thing.

74
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:42,860
 Like, take gardening, for instance.

75
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:45,340
 I don't know why I take gardening, but some people do.

76
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:46,580
 And they have one.

77
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:49,020
 I don't mean a little one naturally, it's a big one.

78
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:51,960
 Lots of acres, like a ranch.

79
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,260
 Did you know they raised cotton in Arizona?

80
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,100
 - Who does?

81
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,180
 - The people in Arizona.

82
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,300
 - The married people?

83
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,180
 - I guess both kinds, why do you ask?

84
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:01,340
 - I just wondered whether you know anyone out there.

85
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:03,380
 No, I just may go to school out there.

86
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:05,740
 Really, Henry? I know a boy that goes to school there.

87
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:06,580
 In Arizona?

88
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:09,180
 Yes, I had a letter from him just day before yesterday.

89
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,040
 Is that right?

90
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,100
 Would you like to have me get it and read you some of it?

91
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,340
 No, I don't believe I'd care to hear it.

92
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,260
 Well, I'm sure you'd be interested, Henry.

93
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:17,640
 You write beautifully.

94
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:20,060
 Well, the way I look at it, Nancy,

95
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:21,580
 if a person gets the idea,

96
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:24,380
 he has to go all the way to Arizona to go to school.

97
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:27,060
 I don't think they deserve to have any state.

98
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:27,980
 You know what I mean?

99
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:28,980
 No, I don't.

100
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,380
 Well, you take your school.

101
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:34,300
 Suppose you're not crazy about it. It's not the fault of the government of the state, isn't?

102
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:34,800
 No.

103
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,420
 Well, there you are. Your father's a taxpayer, isn't he?

104
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:41,880
 Yes. I never thought of it that way, Henry. Just a second while I answered the phone.

105
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,460
 Have you ever tasted peppermint crunch ice cream?

106
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:45,740
 No, I haven't. Why?

107
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:49,020
 They served it in the school cafeteria today. It was pretty good.

108
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,820
 Hello?

109
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:53,200
 Nancy, this is Homer. Is Henry there?

110
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:53,860
 Yes.

111
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:55,460
 Homer, I've got to speak to him.

112
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:56,220
 Henry?

113
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,260
 Is that my mother?

114
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,900
 It's Homer, he wants to speak to you.

115
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,900
 Well, Gee whiz, I can't even go visiting without his bothering me.

116
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:02,900
 Hello?

117
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:03,900
 Now listen Homer.

118
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,900
 In me I'm in a terrible predicament.

119
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:06,900
 What's the matter?

120
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,900
 I'm over at your house and I want some help on our Latin assignment.

121
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,900
 Well, I can't come home just for that Homer.

122
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,900
 But in me I have to have it.

123
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:16,900
 My father says I've been fiddling around too much in Latin.

124
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:23,900
 But Gee whiz, I don't have to be home until 930 and even then I'm going to be very busy writing a postcard.

125
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:24,900
 Alright, here.

126
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:30,400
 All right. If you want to put Nancy Adams in your correspondence ahead of my homework, all right.

127
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,200
 You mean you're going home again?

128
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,600
 No, always.

129
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,700
 But your father said to be here not a second later than 9.30.

130
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:40,300
 Well, G.I'll be there. I've got plenty of time.

131
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,300
 No, I'm...

132
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,500
 Henry, you threw?

133
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,000
 Sure.

134
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,900
 I just ran up to get some of Dick's letters.

135
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:45,900
 Who's Dick?

136
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:49,700
 You're so interested in Arizona, I thought you'd like to have me read some parts of them.

137
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,700
 Did he write all the letters in that bumble?

138
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:55,700
 I'd been writing ever since last Christmas when I met him.

139
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:56,700
 Oh.

140
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,700
 I don't think he's missed a week since then.

141
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:01,700
 Here's what about Arizona's irrigation ditches.

142
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:02,700
 To you?

143
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:03,700
 Yes.

144
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:04,700
 Very interesting.

145
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:08,700
 He says, "My dear Nancy, did I see a ditch today?"

146
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:14,700
 It began miles and back of me and came up to me and then what as far as the eye of man could reach.

147
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:20,700
 When one realizes that all of this was done with human hands, it makes one proud to be a member of this human race of ours.

148
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:23,700
 After that we went dancing and I certainly wished you were there.

149
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,700
 They danced in the ditch?

150
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:29,700
 That was afterwards. And then he goes on to say...

151
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:30,700
 What?

152
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,700
 Oh, my goodness, I can't read you that.

153
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:33,700
 Oh?

154
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:37,700
 Here's one. Well, well, Nancy, here I am writing again.

155
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:41,700
 Didn't you scream at me? You'd certainly die if you ever met him.

156
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:44,700
 Yeah. It's got a nice sense of humor.

157
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:48,700
 Your letter came this morning and I have read it at least...

158
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:51,700
 No, no sense in reading that.

159
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,700
 Now, let's see.

160
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,700
 I have your picture on my bureau.

161
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:56,700
 No.

162
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,700
 Oh, here's something interesting.

163
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,700
 Here's something wonderful.

164
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,700
 Yesterday a crowd of us saw the Grand Canyon.

165
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,700
 Boy, is that something.

166
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,700
 Is he only interested in ditches?

167
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,700
 He's interested in everything, Henry.

168
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:09,700
 I'd like to read it yourself only.

169
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:12,700
 There's some rather personal things in it.

170
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,700
 Naturally.

171
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:14,700
 Of course.

172
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,700
 Is that clock on the mantle, right?

173
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:17,700
 Yes, I think so.

174
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:21,000
 Well, gee, I didn't realize it was nearly 8.35.

175
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,100
 You mean you have to go?

176
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,200
 I'll say I have.

177
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,500
 Why so early?

178
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:29,800
 Well, I've got to help Homer with his Latin, and then I've got to write a long letter.

179
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,800
 Oh.

180
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,800
 Boy, am I ashamed of myself.

181
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,600
 I bet there are at least four letters from this person.

182
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,200
 I haven't even started to answer.

183
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,100
 Well, I'm certainly glad you came over.

184
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,600
 She'll... the person.

185
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,600
 We'll be wondering what's been keeping me.

186
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,700
 Does she live very far away, Henry?

187
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,700
 No, just in the middle town.

188
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,420
 But her family's thinking of moving to California,

189
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:54,060
 and then of course my letters will have to be longer.

190
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:56,460
 Well, I'm awfully sorry, you have to go.

191
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:57,740
 Good night, Nancy.

192
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:59,660
 And I just want to tell you how much

193
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:01,940
 I enjoyed hearing your correspondence.

194
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:12,260
 Wait a second, huh, huh?

195
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:15,460
 Well, I dropped this postal card in the mail box.

196
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:17,460
 Tonight's night, isn't it?

197
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:19,460
 Let's walk back to the house.

198
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:21,960
 Did you ever notice, Henry, when you look up at the moon,

199
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,960
 it looks as though the clouds were standing still,

200
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:26,460
 and the moon is watch-moving?

201
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:27,460
 So what?

202
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:29,460
 What's the matter with you, Henry?

203
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,460
 Nothing's a matter with me.

204
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:33,460
 Well, why'd you come home from Nancy so early for?

205
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:36,460
 Well, you wanted me to help you with your Latin, didn't you?

206
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:39,460
 She was... you know how many times she's... how many times

207
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:41,460
 she's gotten letters from him?

208
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:43,460
 Who's gotten a lot?

209
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:48,160
 Every week, Homer, every week since last Christmas, all he talks about is ditches.

210
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,760
 So, and in the meanwhile, she goes around leading other people on.

211
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,960
 Into ditches?

212
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:58,260
 Anybody think that just because somebody you happen to know casually is going to school

213
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:01,760
 where you aren't going to school, then Gee, was he's pretty wonderful.

214
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,760
 Who is?

215
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,460
 Who cares how deep the Grand Canyon is?

216
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:05,460
 Do you?

217
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:06,460
 I ask you.

218
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:07,460
 I'm going home.

219
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:08,460
 Well, go ahead.

220
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:10,060
 And not only that, Homer.

221
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:13,360
 Nancy's been writing to this guy just as often as he's been writing to his family.

222
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:19,120
 to her. Oh. Oh. Well do you know what you want to do Henry? Why should I do anything?

223
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,080
 You ought to show her though. All you have to do is write a letter to some other girl

224
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:27,000
 and leave it lying around when Nancy will see it. You're crazy. You talk as though I

225
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,660
 cared on her. But you leave right out of your hand Henry. My own sister used to do it. She

226
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:36,680
 did? Sure every week. Did it get results? Well she's married isn't she?

227
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:41,600
 Mary just from that? Well you don't have to let it go that far if you don't want to.

228
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,840
 The only trouble is I don't know of any of the girl I'd want to write to.

229
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,840
 You don't have to. You aren't going to mail it.

230
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,160
 You're just going to write it and let Nancy see it.

231
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,100
 Now, how about this girl you just mailed a postcard to?

232
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,300
 Darr's Townsend?

233
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:57,900
 She was home. I could hardly get up enough interest to write that much to her.

234
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:01,000
 Well, I'll tell you what to say. I remember my sister's letters.

235
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,900
 Only when you write it, Henry, do it on your father's typewriter.

236
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,400
 Don't write it in your own handwriting.

237
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,000
 Why not?

238
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,700
 Because it isn't romantic enough.

239
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,200
 Okay, and I'll type it on some blue paper.

240
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:19,200
 [Music]

241
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,700
 Have some toast, Alice?

242
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:21,700
 No, thank you.

243
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:22,700
 Sam, I'm worried.

244
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:23,700
 Worried?

245
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:29,700
 Well, dear, I don't like to mention it, but this morning, when I went in to make Henry's bed, I happened to see a letter. He typed a darst town.

246
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:32,200
 I thought he was just going to send her a postcard.

247
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:36,700
 Well, so did I, Sam. I thought the whole thing was just a casual, ordinary bit of correspondence.

248
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:37,700
 Well...

249
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:42,700
 Well, Sam, I shouldn't have looked at it, but I couldn't help noticing that the letter began my darling daris.

250
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:43,700
 What's that?

251
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,700
 That's what it said, Sam. I saw it with my own eyes.

252
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,700
 What else did he say?

253
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,700
 Well, naturally, dear, I didn't read anymore.

254
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:50,700
 Why not?

255
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,700
 Well, because it was a personal letter.

256
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:55,700
 But it was your duty as a mother to read it.

257
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:58,700
 Well, if you must know, I did read the first sentence.

258
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,700
 But that's all.

259
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:01,700
 What did he say?

260
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:06,700
 Your letters have been coming through regularly and you will never know how they have changed my entire life.

261
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,700
 You mean that letter she wrote him wasn't the first one?

262
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:12,200
 No dear. Apparently that's why Doris Townsend was so concerned.

263
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,600
 She was afraid Henry really was engaged.

264
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,000
 You mean you think it's reached that point?

265
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,400
 I know it has. The only thing is why did he insist last night that he didn't want a right to her?

266
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:25,200
 Well that's obvious Alice. He was trying to cover up that cover up.

267
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,200
 Cover up what?

268
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,200
 I don't know.

269
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,700
 Well Sam I think it's time we did something.

270
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,480
 You see her, Henry?

271
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,640
 Sure, she's sitting right there on the school steps.

272
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,400
 And your letter's right in front of her.

273
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,720
 But what good will it do, Homer?

274
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,680
 You dropped it so darn far from her.

275
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,680
 I dropped it practically at her feet, Henry.

276
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,760
 And look, she's got it.

277
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,400
 She's reading.

278
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,680
 She is old boy.

279
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,480
 Old boy is she going to get a shot.

280
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,840
 Didn't I tell you, Henry?

281
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,280
 The only trouble is, Homer.

282
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,240
 That isn't my letter.

283
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,680
 Mine's still on the ground.

284
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,720
 It is.

285
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,640
 Homer, can you see where the one she's reading is from?

286
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,880
 How could I?

287
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,920
 Well, I can see as it's a fat one.

288
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,320
 A fat one?

289
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,320
 See, I wonder...

290
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,320
 Do you suppose?

291
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,680
 Well, if it is from Arizona, don't let it get your go-head.

292
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,680
 But Homer, she doesn't have to read his letters right here on the school grounds.

293
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,320
 Wouldn't you think she'd have some loyalty to our school?

294
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,320
 Look, Henry, she's standing up.

295
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,320
 Oh boy.

296
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,320
 She's leaning over.

297
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,320
 She...

298
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,320
 Well, she wish she's only tying her shoelace.

299
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,320
 Homer, she blind.

300
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,320
 She's even stepping on my letter.

301
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,320
 Now she's going into the building.

302
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,320
 Quick, Henry, why?

303
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,320
 He'll let us going away.

304
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,320
 Well, she was...

305
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,320
 Homer, you go that way and we'll corner it.

306
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,320
 Hurry up.

307
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,320
 I'm hurrying.

308
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:41,620
 Where is she, Homer?

309
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:44,020
 She's right there in the corridor talking to Eleanor.

310
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:46,620
 Or if you think she saw you when you slipped my letter into her coat,

311
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:47,820
 pocket, how could she?

312
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,120
 I was talking too fast.

313
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,320
 Well, she certainly can't miss this one.

314
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:54,520
 And I think it's better than a letter that blew away yesterday.

315
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,520
 Look, Nancy's walking away.

316
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,520
 Well, she puts her hand in her pocket.

317
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,920
 All my troubles will be over.

318
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:04,120
 The only thing is, Homer, boy, isn't that my letter sticking out of Eleanor's pocket?

319
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:07,520
 pocket where listen Homer did you put that in the wrong pocket of the wrong

320
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:11,480
 coat I didn't know they were standing that close together I saw a pocket and

321
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:15,080
 went up to them we've got to get that away from Illinois I can get it away

322
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:18,880

329
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:59,160
 - What do you think? - After all, if I were a boy and you were girl as nice as Doris Townsend,

330
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:02,160
 I think I'd want a picture of her. Wouldn't you, Sam?

331
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,160
 - Uh, wouldn't I, what? - Like a picture of Doris Townsend.

332
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:09,160
 - Well, yes, of course. - Well, I wouldn't. I just... I just...

333
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:13,160
 - You just what? I just don't think I like any girls.

334
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:16,160
 - Not any? - No, from. - Good. That's fine.

335
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:20,160
 Didn't I hear you using my typewriter upstairs just a few minutes ago?

336
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,160
 - Yes, Father. - What was it you were typing there?

337
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:28,320
 dear. Why, just something I was doing over, I typed it night before last and it blew away

338
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:35,840
 yesterday. Then I did another last night and that got lost today through an error. I see. Homework

339
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:43,040
 dear? Why, in a way you might say it was sort of homework. I was talking with Nancy Adams' mother

340
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:50,560
 today. She said Nancy is writing to some boy out in a school in Arizona. If I were you, I'd take a

341
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,560
 a little interest.

342
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,800
 Well, I'm not going to waste my time on her mother.

343
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,360
 You'll never find a nicer girl.

344
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,280
 She was, father.

345
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,960
 I have other things to think about besides just girls.

346
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:59,300
 She was.

347
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,360
 I've got a lot of other things on my mind.

348
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,600
 Where are you going, dear?

349
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,040
 Just upstairs and do a little--

350
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,880
 do a little typing.

351
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,400
 Sam.

352
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:07,800
 Well--

353
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,200
 If you think you ought to come right out

354
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,480
 and forbid he's writing any more letters to Doris Townsend--

355
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,320
 No, Alice.

356
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,080
 Let's not make matters any worse than they are.

357
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,320
 Much better to be subtle about it.

358
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,960
 You can't tell he may be up in his room

359
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:22,200
 right this minute wondering whether Doris Townsend is worth it.

360
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,240
 That's the way a boy's mind operates.

361
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,000
 Well, of course, dear, you know more about it than I do.

362
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

363
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:36,960
 Oh, Bunch, Bunch, Ralph.

364
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,040
 What do you have, Eleanor?

365
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,640
 Bunch, did you lose a letter?

366
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,520
 No, why?

367
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,720
 You didn't.

368
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:44,440
 Don't you go around with a girl over in Middletown by the name

369
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,680
 of Darf Townsend?

370
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,840
 Sure, I take her out practically every weekend.

371
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:51,120
 I don't know how it got there, but I found this letter addressed to her in my

372
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,440
 coop pocket and I thought it was probably yours.

373
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,160
 Let's see it.

374
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:54,960
 Here you are.

375
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,600
 Oh listen, this isn't any kind of a joke is it?

376
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,320
 Oh no.

377
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,240
 My darling Doris.

378
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,160
 Say, what is this?

379
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,000
 Is it some but you wrote it?

380
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,520
 But getting back to earth, I hope someday I can show you the Mississippi,

381
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:13,520
 which is 2,470 miles long, reaching at some point to a width of four miles.

382
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,640
 Hey, what I want to know is who wrote this. Where's the end?

383
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:20,560
 Have you ever noticed on a moonlight night how the clouds seem to stand still

384
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:23,040
 and the moon zooms along in a breathtaking pace?

385
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,800
 That's how I think of you.

386
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,920
 Oh! Oh, so that too, Rhoda.

387
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:28,960
 Who did, Rhoda?

388
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,760
 Never mind. He isn't going to live long anyhow.

389
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:45,280
 [Music]

390
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:49,880
 Well, poor Henry is certainly having a tough time getting the right letter to the wrong girl.

391
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:52,680
 And whether he ever will manage it is more than I know.

392
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:57,380
 But I do know, ladies and gentlemen, that if you like to get the right mealtime drink for your family,

393
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:01,480
 you really shouldn't miss all the grand things that Postam has to offer you.

394
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:05,980
 Believe me, you'll enjoy a good hot cup of Postam for the same reason millions enjoy it.

395
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:09,380
 Just because Postam tastes so downright good.

396
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:14,980
 Yes, when you pour yourself a steaming cup of Postam and add just a dash of cream and sugar to it,

397
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:19,780
 You have a drink that's so tempting and fragrance, so unusually delightful in flavor,

398
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:22,980
 that you keep wondering why you never thought of trying it before.

399
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:25,580
 Just don't expect Postam to taste like coffee,

400
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:28,580
 any more than you'd expect coffee to taste like tea.

401
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:32,580
 For naturally, the goodness of Postam is the goodness of a distinctive flavor,

402
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:35,980
 a flavor that puts the "mmm" in Postam.

403
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:38,280
 So enjoy delicious hot Postam tomorrow,

404
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:41,080
 and be sure to make enough for the young folks to enjoy too,

405
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,680
 because Postam is the drink for all the family.

406
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:46,280
 Just as your family will be all for post-em.

407
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:57,920
 Now getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldrich,

408
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,440
 in an attempt to make Nancy Adams jealous,

409
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:03,360
 Henry has typed several letters to another girl.

410
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,840
 But instead of mailing them, he has tried to leave them around

411
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,800
 for Nancy would find them.

412
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,280
 So far, however, he has been totally unsuccessful

413
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:13,000
 and has lost all of the letters he's written.

414
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 The scene opens now in the typing room at central high school.

415
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:24,700
 Homer, have you any idea where the A would be on this typewriter?

416
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,200
 Why can't you find it yourself?

417
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:30,200
 I haven't never seen the typewriters in this classroom the keys don't have any letters on them.

418
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,700
 Well, what good are they then?

419
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,200
 Oh, Gee whiz.

420
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,200
 Did you get an A?

421
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,400
 It's a W.

422
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:39,700
 Homer, what word is there that begins with W? That means the same thing.

423
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:40,400
 As why?

424
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,400
 As Angel.

425
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:47,380
 Why don't you just make it wing it angel wing it my wing it angel sure

426
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:53,360
 Where do you think the eye would be used to be around here somewhere

427
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:57,660
 Are you making plenty of carbon copies this time Henry sure look out?

428
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:00,880
 OJ did you get an eye an H?

429
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:06,960
 Now what am I gonna do? I've got WH why don't you make it white wing at angel?

430
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,360
 Yeah, that's nice

431
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:13,360
 The only trouble is Homer, if we don't find it this time, we're really stuck.

432
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:20,360
 Hello, Sam.

433
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,360
 Yes, Alice.

434
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,360
 Sam, I'm sorry to call you away from the office, but I want you to come home right away.

435
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,360
 What for?

436
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,360
 Rosales Townsend's mother is here.

437
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,360
 What's on her mind?

438
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:32,360
 I can't tell you on the phone, dear, but the sooner you come home, the better. She's terribly upset.

439
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:35,360
 Yes. I'll come over right away, Alice. But remember this.

440
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:40,360
 Remember this, no matter what she says, the girl is probably just as much to blame as Henry is.

441
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:47,360
 [Music]

442
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,360
 Homer, are you sure she finally found my letter?

443
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:53,360
 Yes, Henry. I put it right in your lunchbox, right on top of her lemon pie.

444
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,360
 Are you sure she didn't tear it up for anything?

445
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:59,360
 Why should she? A letter written by you to another girl that you're calling your white wing at Angel?

446
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,360
 It took me darn near a week to get it to her.

447
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,600
 get it to her all you have to do now and we have to go home by Monday Nancy will

453
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:29,720

 Homer that's a fine thing well what she got against reading somebody else's

459
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,200
 mail after all if all she cares about is that fella in Arizona why should I

460
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:58,640
 there are other girls besides Nancy Adam you know they are what I say sure

461
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:03,740

464
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,180
 then you write a letter to a girl in Middletown. Well, me? Sure, that's our

465
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:18,240

467
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:27,520
 Well, I'd like to see him start something. Can we hear much? Did you get in your

00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:47,480

472

 You're not.

487

 What happened to you?

488
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,440
 We're looking for something down here.

489
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,440
 What was Bunch Rouch doing to Henry?

490
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,440
 To me?

491
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,440
 He was.

492
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,440
 He wasn't doing anything.

493
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,440
 Well my goodness Henry, your folks just phoned the main office and they said you'd

494
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,440
 come right home to very minute schools out.

495
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:46,440
 I wonder what that could be about.

496
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:49,440
 I don't see why you have to feel that way about it Henry.

497
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,440
 After all butchers three times as big as you.

498
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,440
 Did you brush the back of my coat home?

499
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,560
 I'm sure your folks won't notice a thing.

500
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,400
 Henry!

501
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,760
 Yes, mother, where are you?

502
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,720
 I want you to come into the living room.

503
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,680
 Your father and I, will I have a talk with you?

504
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,960
 A talk with our mother?

505
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,440
 Yes, Henry.

506
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,400
 There's something wrong, father.

507
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,280
 How did you tell your cook pocket?

508
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,040
 Oh, that?

509
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:09,400
 That?

510
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,600
 Well, gee whiz.

511
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,200
 Home a deer.

512
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,800
 Would you mind leaving the room?

513
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,720
 You want me to go?

514
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,840
 We do.

515
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,920
 Please go up to Henry's room until we're through.

516
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,320
 Couldn't I wait out in the kitchen?

517
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,560
 You could not.

518
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,680
 Please go upstairs.

519
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,880
 Yes, Mrs. Aldrich.

520
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,240
 I'll wait upstairs.

521
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,240
 Now then, Henry. Yes, Father.

522
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,440
 Your mother wants to have a talk with you.

523
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,140
 Sam, I think you're the one that should have a talk with him.

524
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:32,340
 Aren't you the one Doris Townsend's mother talked to?

525
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:35,040
 Doris Townsend's mother. Yes, dear. She's been here.

526
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,940
 That would be putting it mildly.

527
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:40,240
 What? Henry, Doris Townsend was never so upset in her life.

528
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,140
 She's upset. She's upset.

529
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:44,340
 Over the letter you've been writing her.

530
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,940
 How did she get any of those?

531
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,540
 What do you mean, how did she get any of them?

532
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:49,140
 Haven't you been writing her?

533
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:51,640
 I've been... I've been...

534
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:52,440
 Look, Father.

535
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,540
 Have you been writing her?

536
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:54,040
 Yes, sir.

537
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:56,440
 I've been writing her, but I haven't been mailing them.

538
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,840
 What have you been doing with them?

539
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,840
 I've been losing them.

540
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,040
 Henry, don't be absurd.

541
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,040
 But I have, Mother.

542
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,340
 If you didn't intend mailing them, why did you write them?

543
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:04,840
 Because--

544
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,540
 They were written to be read by someone, weren't they?

545
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:08,540
 Yes, sir, but not by Doris Townsend.

546
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:09,640
 Then by whom, dear?

547
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,540
 Look, Mother, I know you won't believe it,

548
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:13,240
 but there are copies of my letter

549
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,540
 all over Central High School.

550
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:16,740
 What do you mean by that?

551
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:19,640
 Father, this English paper is a very good example.

552
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,940
 Do you mean you failed in English?

553
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:23,300
 No, I gotta see Plosh for it. Let me see it.

554
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:24,980
 Now, Alice, don't let him evade the issue.

555
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:26,860
 We're talking about his letters.

556
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:28,380
 But, Sandy, there's a letter.

557
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:29,420
 To Doris Townsend?

558
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:30,540
 Yes, dear.

559
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:32,540
 That's what Henry's been trying to tell us.

560
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:34,460
 He wrote those letters for English.

561
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:36,380
 He never intended to nail any of them.

562
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:37,180
 Did you, dear?

563
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:38,180
 Oh, look, mother.

564
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:39,260
 Of course you didn't.

565
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:40,740
 It is clear as they say.

566
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:43,060
 Well, why did Doris Townsend's mother

567
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:45,220
 have to get so upset over a composition?

568
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:46,980
 That's exactly what I wondered.

569
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,580
 Sam, I'm going to the phone and tell her.

570
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:50,140
 And give her my regard.

571
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:51,880
 Hey Henry, Henry.

572
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,140
 Here's your composition, Henry.

573
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:55,040
 Oh, am I interrupting the lecture?

574
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,040
 You are not interrupting anything, Homer.

575
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,440
 Only Henry.

576
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:01,320
 Next time, see to it that you get more than a C plus.

577
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,040
 Yes, Father.

578
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:04,480
 Henry, you know that letter Nancy handed back to you?

579
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:04,840
 Yeah.

580
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,320
 Well, that isn't one of your letters.

581
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:06,840
 Who's this?

582
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:09,280
 It's a letter she wrote to the guy in Arizona.

583
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:09,880
 From her?

584
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,200
 You mind if I see what it says?

585
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,080
 Wait, Homer, that letter wasn't meant to be read.

586
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,240
 What do you mean it wasn't?

587
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,240
 It isn't even sealed.

588
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:15,640
 She said--

589
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,240
 Now listen, Homer, give that to me.

590
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,160
 Oh, boy.

591
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:18,720
 Homer.

592
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,720
 Oh, boy.

593
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,720
 Oh my. Oh boy.

594
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,720
 Are you reading? You're all homo.

595
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,720
 The whole thing's about you.

596
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,720
 About me?

597
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,720
 She says you're one of the nicest sweetest boys she's ever known.

598
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,720
 Who me?

599
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,720
 Henry, you're one of the nicest sweetest boys she's ever known.

600
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:36,720
 Now wait Homer, she said that about me?

601
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,720
 Well gee whiz, can you imagine that?

 In the meanwhile, folks, a reminder of the double-barreled reason why you like Postam.

605
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,720
 For one thing, you'll like it if coffee upset you.

606
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,320
 For another you like it just because Postam tastes so swell.

607
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:13,020
 It's a grand tempting drink for all the family.

608
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:15,420
 So get Postam from your grocer tomorrow.

00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:23,820
 No, mother.

00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:27,320
 I'm sure I don't feel well enough to go to school today.

612
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,720
 But Henry, you'll miss some very important work.

613
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:32,220
 No, I won't, mother. I won't miss a thing.

614
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:34,420
 All we were going to do today, anyhow,

615
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:38,420
 always read our English compositions in front of the class.

616
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:41,420

618
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:53,420
 Here is a popular Christmas suggestion.

619
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:57,420
 In addition to your other presence, give United States defense bonds and stamps.

620
00:27:57,420 --> 00:28:00,420
 Make patriotism a part of your giving.

621
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:03,420
 The money you spend for defense bonds helps to resist tyranny and oppression.

622
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:06,420
 helps keep the spirit of Christmas alive in this country.

623
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:12,420
 So buy defense bonds and stamps and keep on buying them for yourself and for your friends this Christmas.

624
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:22,420
 Be sure to listen again next week to the Aldrich family same time, same station, for another sparkling half hour with your favorite youngster, his family and his pals.

625
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:26,420
 The Aldrich family starring as Rustone is written by Clifford Goldsmith.

626
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:29,420
 Original music is composed and conducted by Jack Miller.

627
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:34,420
 This is Harry Van Zell saying, "You will enjoy fragrant flavor for Postam."

628
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:37,420
 And remember, Postam contains no stimulants.

629
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:40,420
 It cannot give you indigestion. Good night.
