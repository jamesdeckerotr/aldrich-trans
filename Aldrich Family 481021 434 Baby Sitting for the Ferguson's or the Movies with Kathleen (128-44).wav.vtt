WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
 It's the Aldrich family.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 The Aldrich family presented by the Jell-O family.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.000
 J-E-L-L-O!

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.000
 Ooh!

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 Oh!

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
 There it is!

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.000
 Oh, there it is!

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 We'll sing!

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
 Well, I'll take it, my dear little talking people, are all set to hear the Aldrich family.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
 Do, do, do, do, do, do!

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
 And just think, here we are all the way out in Hollywood.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
 And Henry is all the way out on the limb!

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.000
 Aha!

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 No.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
 I mean, we're here on the West Coast, and Henry is there on the East Coast.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 And we're both in love with world famous jello desserts.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
 Never mind.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 Never mind.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 Everybody goes for the jello family.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
 Oh, Meredith, we dearly love jello puddings.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 They come in three delicious flavors.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
 Everybody loves those smooth as cream jello puddings.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 And we dearly love jello tapioca pudding too.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 Everybody loves the pudding with a personality.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 Personality and dimples

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 That's right, and don't forget forget forget Jell-o the world's most famous shimmering dessert

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.560
 Well, that is what I meant. I forget Jell-o with those big red letters on the box

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.800
 No, no, no, you don't understand I forget those six delicious flavors

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.860
 Wish I were dead

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:16.860
 Got a better idea

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.420
 You be strawberry.

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.980
 OK, I'll be strawberry.

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.540
 [SINGING]

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:22.540
 Cherry, we will--

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:23.540
 Orange, we will--

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:24.540
 Lemon, you will--

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.540
 Blue.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.380
 J-E-L-L.

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.300
 Oh, would you like it?

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.060
 No, not but--

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.560
 Uh-uh.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.380
 Oh, B-T-I.

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.660
 Hey, look at that clock.

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.540
 It's time for--

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.620
 The Oldridge family, based on characters originated

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:51.260
 by Clifford Goldsmith and starring Ezra Stone as Henry with Jackie Kalk as Homer.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.860
 Henry! Henry Oldridge!

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:55.860
 Coming, mother!

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:14.820
 As every grown-up knows, a teenage boy never has to look around for interesting problems

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:21.220
 to solve, the problems always seem to come looking for the boy. A new one every day.

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:27.540
 So it is with Henry Aldrich. The scene opens in the Aldrich front hall. It is early evening.

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:28.540
 But Kathleen...

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.900
 "Henry, you don't have to explain. I don't own you."

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.020
 Kathleen, the only reason I broke our date last night was I thought I ought to take a

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:41.260
 load off Mizzetti's mind. You know, and get the difference between my subjunctive mood

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.620
 and my pastploo perfect under my belt.

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:44.620
 You don't say.

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:45.620
 Sure.

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.180
 And what's Geraldine love got to do with your past blue perfect?

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.380
 Oh boy.

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.100
 How did you find out about her?

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.460
 I have my sources, Henry.

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:53.740
 I have my sources.

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:59.460
 Well, look, in connection with Geraldine, could I explain one thing, Kathleen?

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:00.660
 You really needn't bother.

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.180
 I don't know, you.

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.220
 But the only reason I happened to be at her house last night was because she phoned me

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.340
 and said, "Henry, what's your assignment and why don't we do it together?"

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:11.860
 She phoned you?

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.160
 Sure, and there's really no harm done.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.200
 We can see that Walter Pigeon picture tonight.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.700
 - We can. - Sure.

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.360
 - Don't you have to study your past poo perfect?

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.360
 - Oh no, I've got it down, perfect.

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.360
 - All right, Henry, but remember, I don't own you.

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.800
 - Edra. - I'm on the phone, Father.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:29.800
 - I know you are.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.320
 Will you come in the living room, please?

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:32.880
 - Yes, Father.

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.720
 Kathleen, could you hang on for just one short second?

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.480
 - I'm hanging, Henry.

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.200
 - Edra. - I'm coming, Father.

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.160
 Is there something you wanted to say to I?

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.000
 - There is.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.720
 - Did I hear you making plans to take Kathleen

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:46.560
 to the movie tonight?

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.320
 - Why, if you're thinking I should be studying instead,

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.560
 did I tell you about Miss Eddie?

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.400
 She said she never saw anybody with a better grasp

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.240
 of his past blue perfect.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.760
 - I'm not referring to your past blue perfect.

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.200
 - Dear, have you forgotten you were sitting

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.840
 with the Ferguson baby tonight?

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.160
 - Well, I am?

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.960
 - Of course, you promised.

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:09.800
 - Well, gee, I don't like to argue, father, but no, I didn't.

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.160
 What your father means is he promised for you.

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.680
 But father, don't you think you should have told me before I raised Kathleen's hopes about going to the movies?

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.600
 Henry, I did tell you. I called you through the bathroom door this morning.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.080
 Father, I give you my word. I didn't hear you.

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.680
 That'll teach you not to take a shower at the top of your lungs.

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:26.240
 But I...

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.760
 Henry, you'll be getting paid 25 cents an hour.

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.760
 Who wants money?

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.520
 Well, I must say that's a novel attitude.

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:39.560
 Yeah, the Ferguson's are counting on your babysitting for them tonight so that they can play bridge with us.

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.240
 Well couldn't they get someone else?

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.780
 Now dear you know sitters are almost impossible to get now a day.

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:48.280
 But Kathleen's looking forward to seeing Walter Pigeon die twice.

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:49.680
 Twice?

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:50.560
 Sure.

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.280
 Wants himself and wants his son.

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:57.320
 So do you think it's fair to deprive her of an experience like that?

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:59.040
 Henry you can go another time.

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.200
 But this is the last night it's playing and

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:06.200
 gee right this minute Kathleen's out there in the hall hanging in midair.

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:09.040
 Henry just explained the situation to her. She'll understand.

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.320
 There isn't a thing that can't be explained if it's done intelligent.

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:13.600
 I know, but father...

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:17.600
 Henry, I've given my word to the Ferguson's and the least you can do is to keep it.

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:20.080
 No, dear, hadn't you better get back to Kathleen.

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:21.080
 Yes, mother.

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:26.160
 But, gee, I don't know how she'll take being done out of water pigeon two nights in a row.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:27.680
 I'm sure she'll survive.

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:33.240
 Hello? Kathleen?

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.520
 Henry, I've been thinking, why are we trying to make the early show?

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.760
 In case there are some good parts you want to see over.

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:42.760
 Uh, some good parts to see over? Well, I'll tell you.

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:44.760
 Mr. I started putting on my coat.

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:49.760
 Well, Kathleen, don't you think seeing Walter Pigeon die four times in one night might be overdoing it?

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:50.760
 What's that?

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.760
 Well, Gia, a thing like that could depress you for weeks.

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:54.760
 Henry, are you packing out again?

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:57.760
 Kathleen, I'm not backing out exactly.

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:59.760
 Henry, you don't have to explain.

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:01.760
 Kathleen, I don't own you.

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:05.760
 Kathleen, it's just that I have an obligation to a member of my family.

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:06.760
 Oh.

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:07.760
 Oh, why?

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:09.120
 I understand.

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:10.120
 You do?

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:11.120
 Certainly.

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:15.320
 If your assistant Mary wants you to walk her girlfriend Daisy Harper home again, why

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.560
 natural you can't be rude?

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:21.520
 Kathleen in connection with Daisy that night, can I explain one thing?

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:23.200
 That's alright Henry.

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:25.720
 Maybe Charlie Clark isn't as busy tonight as you are.

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:26.720
 Charlie Clark?

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:27.720
 No, wait a minute.

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:28.720
 Kathleen, wait a minute.

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:31.640
 Look, suppose I take another crack at my father.

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:33.600
 You mean about going to the movie?

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:34.600
 Sure.

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:38.600
 Was there isn't anything that can't be explained if it's done intelligently?

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:50.600
 Sam, did Henry leave for the Ferguson's yet?

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:52.600
 Yes, Alice, about ten minutes ago.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:56.600
 Well, dear, I just want you to know I think you were right in being firm with him.

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:57.600
 Thank you, Alice.

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:02.600
 But, dear, it wasn't entirely Henry's fault he didn't hear you tell him about babysitting.

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:06.800
 sitting. We're the ones who've insisted that he take a shower every morning.

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:07.600
 No, Alice.

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:12.120
 Sam, it certainly wouldn't have hurt to let him talk you out of it,

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:13.280
 intelligent way.

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:13.840
 But, dear.

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:17.520
 Why couldn't we call the Ferguson's and more or less suggest that we play

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:18.440
 bridge over there?

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:21.760
 Alice, we can't do that. And besides, I gave Henry permission to get a

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:22.960
 substitute, didn't I?

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:26.680
 Well, if the Ferguson's couldn't get anybody else to sit, how can Henry?

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:31.320
 Although, Sam, I think I know the very person.

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:33.120
 Who? Miss Hotchkiss.

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:34.120
 Miss Hotchkiss?

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:37.320
 You remember her dear, the nice little girl who used to sit with Henry.

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:39.520
 Alice, that was 15 years ago.

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:42.520
 I don't think we should overlook anyone, I'll phone her.

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:44.320
 Very well, Alice, if it'll help matters.

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:45.520
 You remember I'll number her?

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:48.520
 It's in the old address book in the telephone table here.

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:49.520
 Number, please.

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:51.520
 Just a moment, operator.

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.320
 See, Hotchkiss, Hotchkiss.

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:54.320
 Here it is.

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:56.320
 L-9-1-1.

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:57.720
 L-9-1-1.

00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:58.320
 Alice!

00:07:58.320 --> 00:07:59.320
 Yes, Sam?

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:02.400
 If you can't get Miss Hotchkiss, I know someone with a call.

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:03.200
 Who, dear?

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:04.200
 Hello.

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:05.400
 Hello, Miss Hotchkiss?

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:06.400
 Miss Hotchkiss.

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:07.880
 Why, yes, I used to be.

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:08.960
 You did?

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:10.240
 This is Mrs. Aldrich.

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:11.120
 Henry's mother?

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:11.920
 Yes.

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:13.240
 Well, my goodness.

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:13.880
 Hello.

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:15.240
 It's been so long.

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:16.520
 How's the baby?

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:17.480
 The baby?

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:18.880
 Why, he's fine.

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:20.840
 I still have that picture you gave me of him.

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:23.840
 Oh, he looks so cute lying there on that bear skin rug.

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:24.480
 Yes.

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:27.440
 Does he still giggle when you tickle him under the chin?

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:29.280
 To tell you the truth, I don't know.

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:33.280
 The reason I called, do you still do sitting?

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:35.780
 Oh yes, but it's with my own baby now.

00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:39.080
 Your married? Congratulations when did it happen?

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:42.780
 Oh, ten years ago. Do you have another baby Mrs. Aldridge?

00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:44.780
 Oh no, we stopped with Henry.

00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:47.280
 It's for a friend.

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:50.580
 Well, I know somebody who might possibly be interested.

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:51.080
 You do?

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:53.080
 Although I'm not sure she's free tonight.

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:57.280
 Well, if she is, would you send it to Mrs. Ferguson's 97-seater road?

00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:59.840
 All right, but don't count on it, Mrs. Allridge. Goodbye.

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:00.840
 Goodbye.

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:02.040
 Can you call Malice?

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:06.120
 No, Sam, and she didn't sound too encouraging about getting anybody else.

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:07.720
 In that case, let me have the phone.

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:08.640
 Number, please.

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:09.800
 Elm 227.

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:11.200
 Elm 227.

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:13.400
 Sam, why are you calling my sister Harriet?

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:16.000
 She's always said, Henry, is her favorite nephew.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.600
 Now's a good time for her to prove it.

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:18.400
 Hello.

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:20.560
 Hello there, Harriet. This is Sam.

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:21.880
 It is? Well, hello.

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:22.880
 Hello.

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:24.080
 Sam Hall.

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:27.480
 Sam Allrich, your brother-in-law.

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:28.920
 Oh, that's Sam.

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:30.000
 Yes?

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.400
 Harriet, er...

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:33.320
 Harriet, we have a bit of a problem.

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:33.800
 Yes?

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:34.560
 Yes.

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:38.280
 You see, we invited Mr. and Mrs. Ferguson to play bridge tonight, and...

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:40.000
 Well, I was wondering if you could help out.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.160
 I'd be glad to.

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:41.760
 You would?

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:45.800
 Of course, my bridge is as good as my casino, but I'll do the best I can.

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:46.400
 What's that?

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:51.560
 My goodness, do you realize this is the first time you've invited me to one of your bridge evenings, since you got married?

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:52.040
 Harriet?

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:54.200
 I'll be dressed in over there before you know it.

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:54.680
 Goodbye.

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:55.480
 Harriet, wait!

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:57.880
 You don't understand. Harriet?

00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:00.180
 Well, that's a fine thing.

00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:01.440
 Sam, is she going to do it?

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:02.280
 No.

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:04.580
 And Alice, where can we dig up three more hands?

00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:20.980
 Well, that's a nice boy, Stevie. Just sit there.

00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:23.180
 Hello? Hello, operator.

00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:24.380
 I'm ringing your number.

00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:28.380
 Well, could you please hurry? I don't think Stevie's too happy here on the couch.

00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:29.380
 Oh, sir!

00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:31.380
 Stevie, the baby.

00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:35.380
 He wouldn't let me leave his room, so I had to bring him in here while I made the call.

00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:36.380
 I'll ring your party again.

00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:37.380
 Thanks.

00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:40.380
 Nice, Stevie. You're doing fine.

00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:42.380
 Hey, don't pull the fringe off that pillow.

00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:45.380
 Colony Theater, Mr. Harris, the manager's speaking.

00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:47.380
 Mr. Harris, this is Henry the oldridge.

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:49.380
 Henry, I'm busy taking tickets. What is it?

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:52.380
 Mr. Harris, what time does your last show start?

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:54.780
 - Nine five. - As soon as that?

00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:56.720
 - That's right. - Mr. Harris,

00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:58.980
 how do you feel about children?

00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:01.720
 - I like them. - Gee, that's swell.

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:04.220
 - Although they're awfully messy at Saturday matinees.

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:06.360
 - Yeah, well look, how would you feel

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:08.020
 if a gentleman was to bring one tonight

00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:10.360
 provided he was accompanied by a very reliable

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:12.660
 young lady named Kathleen Anderson?

00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:14.660
 - Tonight, how old is this child?

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:17.400
 - Well, Gee, he must be at least as old as six.

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:19.400
 - Years? - Months.

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:21.200
 - Months. Goodbye, Henry.

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:22.040
 - Goodbye, Henry.

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:23.300
 - But Mr. Harris, wait, Kathleen,

00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:24.700
 is anxious to see Walter Pridge

00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:27.140
 and grow up to be his own son.

00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:28.040
 - Where does that happen?

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:29.580
 - Well, right in your own theater.

00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:30.680
 - You don't say.

00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:31.860
 - Yeah, and she's waiting for me

00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:33.800
 to pick her right up this very minute.

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:35.380
 - What's that, Mr. Dannams?

00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:37.500
 Just drop your tickets in the box.

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:39.620
 Henry, I have to hang up, goodbye.

00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:42.900
 - But Mr. Harris, well, gee, what?

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:44.420
 - Say Henry.

00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:45.820
 - Homer, is that you?

00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:47.420
 - Sure, my mother said you phone

00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:48.980
 and said something about a movie.

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:51.240
 I'll say I did Homer, you've got to help me out.

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:52.240
 I'd be glad to.

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:53.500
 You will, boy.

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:54.380
 What's playing?

00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:55.040
 What?

00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:56.840
 Aren't you inviting me to the movies?

00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:59.400
 No, Homer, what I want you to do is save my life

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:02.200
 and make 25 cents an hour at the same time.

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:04.360
 That sounds like a nice arrangement.

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:05.480
 What do I have to do?

00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:06.360
 Sit.

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:07.360
 That's all?

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:08.680
 Sure.

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:11.880
 And keep an occasional eye on Stevie over there.

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:12.800
 That baby?

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:14.040
 Sure, will you do it?

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:17.080
 I'm sorry, him, but I have to think of the 440.

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:18.120
 What 440?

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:20.860
 that I'm running in our first indoor track meet tomorrow.

00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:22.440
 - You're running in a track meet?

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:24.260
 - What's so incredible about that?

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:25.500
 I'm on the team.

00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:27.520
 - Homer, you're water boy.

00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:28.840
 - Not anymore.

00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:30.760
 Toby Smith broke his ankle,

00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:32.760
 and then Butch Welch failed his English exam,

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:35.400
 and the coach said the fates were against him anyway,

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:37.020
 and put me in.

00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:39.840
 So I feel it's my duty to get all asleep I can.

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:41.960
 - But Homer, you were willing to go to the movie.

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:45.160
 - Can we the movies aware I sleep best?

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:46.000
 - I know only--

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:51.000
 I've never run as far as 440 yards in my life. I'll need all my strength.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
 But what am I going to do about Kathleen Anderson and Walter Pigeon?

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.000
 Why don't you take a run down to the Havens and get one of the other kids to sit for you?

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
 You mean you'll stay here with a baby while I do?

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.000
 Why?

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.000
 Homer, you're a real pal.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
 When Henry, I'm no good at taking care of babies.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:10.000
 That's the beautiful part, Homer. Stevie practically takes care of himself. So long.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
 Well, Gee whiz.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
 Well, what could we forget about--

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:20.000
 - Kuchiko Stevie, Kuchiko, look at Uncle Homer.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.160
 (screaming)

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:27.820
 - Oh boy, don't cry Stevie, don't cry.

00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:29.460
 Here play with my tie.

00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:31.440
 You like that?

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:36.120
 - No wait a minute Stevie, let go of my nose.

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:37.460
 Don't you let go.

00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:43.960
 - Oh boy, Stevie my nose is nothing to play with.

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:46.160
 How about a doll?

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:48.160
 Look at the funny face, Stevie.

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:52.160
 [SINGING]

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:55.160
 Stevie, would you like some music?

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:58.160
 Would you like me to play the player piano?

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:01.160
 Would you just wait while Uncle Homer sits down?

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:03.160
 You'll hear the pretty music.

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:09.160
 [SINGING]

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:13.160
 Well, Gee whiz, it worked.

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:24.160
 Come to me my melancholy baby, coddle.

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:40.160
 Well friends, here's a cheerful theme song coming up, "Jello for dessert"

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:44.560
 dessert, and say ever try jello pineapple mounds, you love them.

00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:50.000
 Just dissolve one package of strawberry jello in two cups of hot can pineapple juice.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.840
 Turn into individual molds and chill firm.

00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:58.400
 Then unmold each one on top a slice of pineapple, grand looking, grand eating.

00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:03.920
 For all six jello flavors, strawberry, raspberry, cherry, orange, lemon, and lime, taste so

00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:08.280
 rich and good they make you think of the real ripe fruit itself.

00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:15.280
 for Jell-O, America's favorite gelatin dessert.

00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:25.240
 And now getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldrich.

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:30.360
 Henry invited Kathleen to the movies tonight and then learned that Mr. Aldrich had volunteered

00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:32.880
 Henry's services as a babysitter.

00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:38.000
 Now both Henry and his parents are trying desperately to dig up a substitute.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.500
 The scene opens at Aunt Harriet's house.

00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:42.500
 It is later that evening.

00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:44.000
 Well, come in, Sam.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.000
 Hello, Harriet.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.500
 Sam, you didn't have to rush over for me.

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:47.500
 I was just leaving.

00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:48.500
 Yes.

00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:51.200
 Well, the reason I came, Harriet.

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:52.200
 The reason I came.

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:53.700
 Sam, you're perspiring.

00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:55.100
 Yes, I know.

00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:59.600
 Harriet, when I phoned you tonight, you thought I meant bridge.

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:01.600
 What I actually phoned about was Henry.

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:02.600
 Henry?

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:03.600
 Your nephew.

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:05.400
 Henry's playing with us?

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:07.700
 No, that is, we're not playing at all.

00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:14.500
 that is you're not other than is yes and well you mean you don't want me to

00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:19.140
 play bridge no that is yes that is it isn't that we don't want to Harriet

00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:24.460
 that's quite all right Sam I understand not Harriet don't get insulted I'm not

00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:30.980
 insulted I can take criticism Sam no matter how wrong it is Harriet here's the

00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:36.140
 deck of cards Sam now deal them out and just show me what's wrong with the way I

00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:39.140
 I play bridge. Really Harry. Sam Aldrich deal.

00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:53.140
 Henry, please stand to one side of the lobby you're blocking the theatre, Enthry.

00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:57.140
 But Mr. Harris. No, Henry. I won't run the news reel over twice and that's final.

00:16:57.140 --> 00:17:02.140
 But I haven't been able to find anyone to replace home or how I ever get Kathleen here on time.

00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:05.140
 I'm sorry, Henry, but I've had a hard day too.

00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:06.140
 Sure, but--

00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:07.140
 Where's my ticket-taker, God's sick?

00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:10.540
 Then the porter doesn't show up and I have to back him to lobby myself.

00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:14.740
 And then to top everything the popcorn machine started throwing popcorn all over the plate.

00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:18.340
 Well, look, could you tell me what time the earthquake starts?

00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:19.340
 Earthquake?

00:17:19.340 --> 00:17:20.340
 There's one do?

00:17:20.340 --> 00:17:22.140
 Sure, it's the way the picture opens.

00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:23.140
 Oh.

00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:26.140
 And right in the middle of it, Walter Pigeon dies for the first time.

00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:27.300
 Wouldn't you know it?

00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:30.980
 The first time in six years we've had an earthquake and I can't even get into my own theater to

00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:31.980
 see it.

00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:33.620
 Oh, I'll be darned.

00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:34.620
 There's Willy.

00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:37.500
 Excuse me. I'd be glad to. Ouch!

00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:39.420
 Oh, she was. What now?

00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:41.900
 Who hit me in the neck with this piece of popcorn?

00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:44.620
 Well, I'll be... I thought I had that machine fixed.

00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:47.660
 Willy? Hiya, Willy, old-timer.

00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:48.620
 Hi, Henry!

00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:51.340
 Willy, how would you like to save my life?

00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:52.300
 Well, that'll all depend.

00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:54.940
 I promise, Kathleen, I take her to the movies tonight, see?

00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:56.860
 And now I've got to sit with this baby.

00:17:56.860 --> 00:17:59.180
 Well, in that case, I'd be glad to save your life.

00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:00.940
 You would, Willy. How much?

00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:03.100
 Oh, gee, I couldn't think of charging you.

00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:04.600
 You wouldn't.

00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:09.240
 You know, Willie, you're a changed man since you fell off that diving board this summer.

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:12.400
 Well, gee, Liz, why should I charge you for taking Kathleen to the movies?

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:13.400
 Kathleen!

00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:16.400
 Willie, what I want you to do is sit with the Ferguson baby.

00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:19.400
 Oh, in that case, it's 50 cents an hour.

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:19.900
 50?

00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:22.300
 Henry, I do a professional job of babysitting.

00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:23.100
 What do you mean?

00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:25.800
 Well, I've got all kinds of things to keep my clients quiet.

00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:29.800
 I've got bells, I've got a toy dog that barks, and all that doesn't shut 'em up.

00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:31.100
 I've also got a hammer.

00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:32.100
 Willie.

00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:34.560
 A rubber one for them to bang on their crib with.

00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:38.160
 Well, okay, I'm in no position to argue. 50 cents.

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:40.100
 It's a deal, shake, shake, shake.

00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:43.100
 And while I'm picking up my equipment, you can pick up Dar's towns.

00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:43.700
 What for?

00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:46.600
 I've got a date with her and I might as well combine business with pleasure.

00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:48.100
 But, Willie, I have to pick up Kathleen.

00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:50.100
 Why not tell her to meet you here at the theater?

00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:51.600
 I guess I could do that.

00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:57.600
 Sure, then after you've your phone Kathleen and picked up Dar's, you can swing around by behaving and pick me up a quart of ice cream.

00:18:57.600 --> 00:18:58.100
 What?

00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:01.340
 - But willy, Henry, I'm bending over backwards,

00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:02.340
 to do you a favor.

00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:03.940
 But gee whiz, I didn't even ask you,

00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:05.680
 they've got a television set.

 Oh, no, I can't, can I?

 Mr. Ferguson said two clubs.

 In that case, I say two spades.

00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:18.820
 No, two diamonds.

00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:19.660
 No?

 Sam, is it against the rules for you

00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:22.700

 Thanks, Mr. Dehaven.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.000
 Boy, I wonder what's keeping Doris Townsend

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:38.500
 I found her nearly ten minutes ago

00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:40.300
 and told her to meet me here.

00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:41.200
 Henry!

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:42.200
 Hello there, Kathleen.

00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:43.400
 Oh, she was.

00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:45.500
 Henry, I waited for you for nearly fifteen minutes

00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:46.700
 in front of the colony.

00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:48.800
 Do you realize the second show has already started?

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:50.200
 Gee, Kathleen, are you sure?

00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:52.200
 Positive, let's go, let's go!

00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:55.200
 Kathleen, I can't go yet.

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:56.700
 What? Why not?

00:20:56.700 --> 00:20:59.300
 Well, you see, it's like this.

00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:02.300
 Henry, I demand to know why you're standing me up this time.

00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:05.500
 Kathleen, you're backing me right into the hot water bottles.

00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:06.000
 Mary!

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.300
 Yes, Mr. Dehayman.

00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:10.200
 Darris Townsend just phoned and said she won't be meeting you here.

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:10.900
 Oh!

00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:12.500
 She and Willie are going to the movie.

00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:15.400
 The movies, but Willie's supposed to be sitting with a baby.

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:18.200
 So Darris Townsend is the reason you're standing me up.

00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:18.800
 What?

00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:20.360
 Wait a minute, Kathleen.

00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:24.080
 In connection with Doris, could I explain one thing?

00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:26.200
 - Don't bother, it's perfectly clear.

00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:27.800
 Good night, Henry Aldrich.

00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:28.800
 - Whoops.

00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:30.840
 - Homer Brown, don't you have a look where you're going?

00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:31.680
 - Kathleen!

00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:33.760
 - Okay, put up your dupes, Henry.

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:34.880
 Put up your dupes.

00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:36.600
 - Homer, what are you doing here?

00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:39.400
 - Well, my legs are just one big Charlie whore.

00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:40.240
 - You got a Homer?

00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:44.120
 - I had a pump my way through melancholy baby 12 times.

00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:44.960
 - Homer, listen.

00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:47.680
 - I won't even be able to walk for 140 yards,

00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:52.960
 much less or on it. But Homer, if you're not with Stevie and Willy's not with Stevie,

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:54.680
 who is?

 >> Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad.

00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:19.480
 Gee whiz father, are you the babysitter?

00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:20.880
 Yes, Henry.

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:23.180
 Well, what about your bridge game?

00:22:23.180 --> 00:22:26.080
 Henry, your Aunt Harriet came over to play bridge and...

00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:29.980
 Well, since I got you into this, I felt it was my duty to get you out.

00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:31.180
 But where's Willie? Why didn't he-

00:22:31.180 --> 00:22:32.180
 I sent him away.

00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:32.980
 You did?

00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:37.380
 Gee whiz father, I promised him 50 cents an hour. You know Willie he'll sue.

00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:40.680
 No, he won't. I've already settled out of court.

00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:43.380
 Why aren't you and Kathleen at the movies?

00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:46.180
 Oh, I don't know, Father.

00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:50.180
 All of a sudden, Walter Pigeon just lost his appeal for me.

00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:51.180
 You know what I mean?

00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:52.180
 I think so.

00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:54.180
 So, now you can go home.

00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:55.180
 Oh.

00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:57.180
 I'll stay with Stevie.

00:22:57.180 --> 00:22:58.180
 Thanks very much, Bonnie.

00:22:58.180 --> 00:23:01.180
 Uh, Henry, as long as you're missing the picture,

00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:04.180
 maybe the only fair thing for me to do it to see it myself.

00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:05.180
 You, Father?

00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:07.180
 Yes, and let you know how it all comes out.

00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:09.180
 But you'll miss your bridge game with Ann Harrien.

00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:10.180
 I know.

00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:11.180
 Good night, son.

00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:15.180
 Uh, I'm sorry that your evening turned out as it did.

00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:17.540
 Well, gee, why be sorry.

00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:20.100

00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:22.220
 a conclusion in his all her life,

00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:25.260
 well, I'm sure glad I found out while I'm still young.

00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:27.460
 - Yes? - Sure.

00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:29.580
 I can live without her.

00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:30.900
 She doesn't own me.

00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:33.020
 - Not yet.

00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:34.940
 Good night, Henry.

00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:35.900
 - Good night, Father.

00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:37.580
 - And if Stevie wants more music,

00:23:37.580 --> 00:23:39.740
 you'd better find another song for him.

 "Sure, but, gee, there's no place for me to go now."

00:24:57.600 --> 00:25:00.600

 "You're not going, are you?"

00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:04.600
 "Don't you think I should?"

00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:09.600
 "Why, uh, say as long as you're here, why don't we both sit down?"

00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:13.300
 Why don't we both sit with Stevie and split the fee?

00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:14.300
 - Well...

00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:17.740
 - May I offer you a seat, Pearl?

00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:19.460
 - Hi, thank you.

00:25:19.460 --> 00:25:21.380
 - Oh, Gee, was I better see who else is at the door?

00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:22.660
 - All right.

00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:26.540
 And do you think we need all this life?

00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:28.100
 - Oh, boy.

00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:29.540
 (audience laughing)

00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:31.220
 - It's not disturb the baby.

00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:33.620
 - Kathleen!

00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:34.740
 - Come on, Henry.

00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:36.100
 - Kathleen, what are you doing here?

00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:37.740
 - Henry, can you ever forgive me?

00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:38.580
 - Forgive you?

00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:43.140
 Ask your mother, call my folks and ask if they wouldn't like to join them in a game of casino at your house.

00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:46.380
 And Henry I talked to her and she explained the whole thing.

00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:47.380
 She did.

00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:49.780
 Yes, so I came right over to apologize.

00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:51.280
 That's fine Kathleen, only.

00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:53.780
 Henry I'm just as ashamed of myself as I can be.

00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:56.380
 The way I get jealous for no good reason.

00:25:56.380 --> 00:25:57.880
 Oh, you've got good reason.

00:25:57.880 --> 00:25:58.380
 I mean...

00:25:58.380 --> 00:25:59.380
 I don't know him.

00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:00.580
 No, but...

00:26:00.580 --> 00:26:03.980
 Henry, we won't have to miss that Walter Pigeon picture after all.

00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:08.080
 Mr. Harris got so interested he's holding it over next to day so he can see it himself.

00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:10.080
 Well, that's fine Kathleen only.

00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:12.080
 And Henry, to show there's no hard feelings,

00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:15.080
 I'm going to keep you company to the Ferguson's get home.

00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:17.080
 What? No Kathleen.

00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:18.080
 No.

00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:19.080
 You got your gun to let me in?

00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:21.080
 Sure, sure, only Kathleen.

00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:23.080
 Yes, Henry.

00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:25.080
 In connection with Pearl,

00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:27.080
 could I explain one thing?

00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:30.080
 (audience applauding)

00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:35.080
 (applause)

00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:43.080
 Put up your dukes, Henry Oldrich. Put up your dukes.

00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:46.080
 But home wearing out my track legs, doing your babysitting.

00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:47.080
 Put 'em up, Henry.

00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:50.080
 Homer, let's try to act like sensible human beings.

00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:52.080
 Put 'em up, I say.

00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:55.080
 Homer, can't we see eye to eye on the situation?

00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:57.080
 Oh, no, Henry, oh, no.

00:26:57.080 --> 00:27:01.880
 Say, wait a minute boys, here's a situation you'll see eye to eye about, and that's

00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:03.480
 jello puddings.

00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:08.400
 Because when it comes to jello puddings, everybody always agrees they're the best desserts yet.

00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:12.600
 Yep, you never tasted anything better than jello, chocolate, butter, scotch, and vanilla

00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:13.600
 pudding.

00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:14.860
 A trio of treats.

00:27:14.860 --> 00:27:20.640
 Their smoothest cream, rich and distinctive, chuck full of old-fashioned homemade goodness.

00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:24.920
 Jello puddings made with milk are nourishing, and they cook to velvety perfection in just

00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:26.560
 about five minutes.

00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:32.280
 So no wonder more people buy "jello" puddings than any other prepared puddings in the world.

00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:39.360

00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:41.720
 Friends, this is United Nations Week.

00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:45.880
 A national week set aside for discussing and learning about the vitally important work

00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:51.160
 of the UN in its effort to secure permanent world peace and security.

00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:55.480
 Every decision and action of the United Nations affects your daily life.

00:27:55.480 --> 00:28:00.800
 So do your part, friends, by becoming acquainted with this vast program for world betterment,

00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:03.720
 by believing in it, by working for it.

00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:11.400
 Remember, we can work it out together, or fight it out alone.

00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:22.920
 The All-Rich Family starring Ezra Stone is Henry with Jackie Kalka's Homer, is written

00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:27.020
 by Norman Tokar and Ed Juris with music by Jack Miller.

00:28:27.020 --> 00:28:31.260
 Mr. and Mrs. Aldrich are House Jamison and Katherine Roth.

00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:33.860
 And this is Dan Seymour in New York saying,

00:28:33.860 --> 00:28:38.060
 "The Aldrich family is brought to you by the Jell-O family."
