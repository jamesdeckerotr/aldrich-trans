00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.500
 The Oldridge family based on characters originated by Clifford Goldsmith and starring Ezra Stone as Henry with Jackie Kalk as Homer.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.000
 Henry! Henry Oldridge!

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.000
 Coming, brother!

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.980
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.560
 And now for the Aldrich family.

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:55.660
 To an impulsive wide awake teenage boy, each new day is like a surprise package.

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:01.560
 If you open it and all sorts of excitement pop out, as Henry Aldrich knows only too well.

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.760
 The scene opens in a classroom of central high school.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.060
 It is the morning of the day before Thanksgiving.

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.060
 - Madam Chairman! - Honor! Madam Chairman!

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.160
 I am! Let's have the parliament in for stage!

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.160
 And now, who wants a plug?

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:20.160
 I do!

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.160
 The chair recognizes Charlie Clark.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.160
 From that section!

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:24.160
 Yeah, Henry!

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.160
 Okay, Charlie, shoot!

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:34.160
 Fellow committee members, I say the reason we've only sold 20 tickets for our Thanksgiving dance tonight is because we have an appeal to the school spirit of our class.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:40.160
 We've got to make them realize Central High is counting on them to put their shoulder to the wheel and get out there and dance!

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:45.160
 And if that doesn't work, I say let's get Ms. Eggleston to give everyone who doesn't buy a ticket a detention.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:46.160
 Why?

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.160
 Yeah, so...

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.160
 Wait a chairman!

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.160
 And a chairman, I object. That's against the Bill of Rights.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:57.160
 The Bill of Rights? The Bill of Rights? Homer, show me one place in the Bill of Rights where it mentions a detention.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:02.160
 It's there, Charlie. Read between the lines. Read between the lines.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.160
 I'll read between the lines yourself. I say give them a detention.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.160
 No!

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.160
 Yeah!

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.760
 - I'm telling you Mr. Curly addressed the remarks to the chair. - Watch it.

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.760
 - Me? - Madam Chairman.

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.760
 - I mean, I told you to sit down. - But I've got a suggestion.

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.760
 - I mean, every time you make a suggestion, at least it's trouble.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.760
 - Down. - I make a motion we hear Henry.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.960
 - Nobody seconds it. - I'll second it.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.760
 - It's her. - Why not? It's my motion.

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.760
 - Oh, okay, but why not Henry? - Thank you, Madam Chairman.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.160
 Mmm!

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.660
 Fellow members, I've been listening with a great deal of interest,

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.160
 Pro and Con, and I'm forced to ask myself,

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.260
 are we whistling up the wrong tree?

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.260
 And he's not dragging in trees and getting a pond.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.260
 What I mean is every year we go to these Thanksgiving dances and what happened?

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.060
 That's a good question. I'm glad it was brought up.

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.260
 I'll tell you, I'd be glad to.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.560
 Why do we to dance?

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.160
 What else did you expect?

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.960
 I'm glad you asked.

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:10.460
 I say let's climax our dance tonight with a good old-fashioned turkey run

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:12.760
 and we'll sell every ticket we've got.

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.560
 Oh, what? A turkey run!

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.760
 Just when everybody's getting good in board dancing with each other,

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.760
 we turn this 25-pound milk-fed country-raised turkey loose

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.260
 and the one who catches them keeps them.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.060
 Oh, no, that's not!

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.860
 Why?

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.460
 If you think I'm gonna run after a turkey and my new dress your crazy...

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:32.460
 Agnes is right.

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:33.460
 Yeah, wow.

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:36.460
 This guy's weekend a four to give away a 25-pound turkey.

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:37.460
 Thanks, Justin.

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:41.460
 I know where we can lay our hands on a turkey for as little as $5.

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:42.460
 $5.

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:45.460
 Can you realize what turkeys cost today?

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:47.460
 Homer, there isn't a thing to worry about.

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.460
 Give me a new cut of turkey up your sleeve.

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:50.460
 Madam Chairman.

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:51.460
 Madam Chairman.

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:52.460
 Madam Chairman.

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:53.460
 Madam Chairman.

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:54.460
 Madam Chairman.

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:55.460
 Madam Chairman.

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:56.460
 I want the chair.

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:57.460
 Look at it this way.

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:58.460
 This way.

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:10.460
 Mother, I don't care what you say. I'm not going in there again.

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:11.460
 He hates me.

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:12.460
 Now, Mary calm down.

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:13.460
 But he does.

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:15.460
 But when he looks at me out of one eye,

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:18.460
 Mother, I've never seen anything so sneaky in all my life.

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:20.460
 But Mary, the wash has to be hung out.

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:24.460
 And I'll hang it, Mother. But someone else has to go into the garage for the clothespin.

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:25.460
 Mary, really.

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.460
 I hate to tell you where he tried to bite me.

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.460
 He tried to bite you. My goodness.

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.460
 - Goodbye, Alice. I'm leaving for the office.

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.460
 - Sam, I'd like to speak to you first.

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:35.460
 - Yes, something wrong.

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.460
 - Sam Aldrich, for the last time, he has to go.

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:39.460
 - Who?

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.460
 - You know very well who. That turkey, your brother, John, sent us.

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.460
 - Alice, he's a wonderful turkey. He's milk-fed.

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:47.460
 - Father, he couldn't possibly get that disposition from milk.

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:48.460
 - Yes.

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.460
 - Sam, you just have to get rid of him.

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.460
 - Alice, are you sure we can't use him for our Thanksgiving dinner tomorrow?

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.460
 Now, dear, you know very well I have a clean, freshly dressed turkey in the refrigerator.

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.460
 Why not send him back to Uncle John?

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.460
 No, Mary, that would hurt his feelings.

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:03.460
 Uncle John, Father, you can say anything to him.

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.460
 My goodness, the way we joke about his whole family.

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:10.460
 Mary, that's only his family. He's very sensitive about his turkeys.

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:13.460
 Sam, why not just give it to someone?

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:15.460
 That turkey, Mother, who take it?

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:20.460
 Well, I'm sure there are many families in Centerville who aren't as fortunate as we are.

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:24.660
 as fortunate as we are. And what better time is there for sharing what you have

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:28.920
 than Thanksgiving? Alice, that's an excellent idea. I don't forgive it to

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:33.520
 Mrs. Dixon. Of course, Sam. She has those three nice children to support. I dropped

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:37.160
 the bird off at her house on my way to the off. Good. And be sure to put on your

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:40.680
 old clothes. Of course. Dear, that suit just came back from the cleaners and I

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:45.720
 won't have you killing a turkey in it. Kill it? I? Now, Sam, don't tell me you're

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.480
 -Squeamish. -Squeamish, Alice.

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:49.680
 -Toby-Silly. It's just that...

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:53.520
 -Well, I don't have a good sharp axe. -How about a hammer?

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.960
 -Marry. -Doesn't Will Brown have an axe?

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:01.400
 Yes. Yes, he does. I'll take the turkey right over the will.

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:04.240
 -I'll answer the song. -Marry is the bird field guide in the garage.

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:07.520
 Yes, Father, but when you go in there, be careful. You don't bend over.

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:09.400
 He's very unreliable.

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:12.040
 Hello?

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.520
 - Hi, mother.

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.320
 Mother, if you could think of the best news I could give you,

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:18.040
 what would you say it was?

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:18.880
 - Let me see.

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:20.880
 - The best news of all.

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:22.920
 - You got an A in that.

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:24.040
 - What?

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:25.960
 - There I'm so proud of you.

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:27.920
 - Mother, you're confusing the issue.

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:30.200
 What's Latin got to do with good news?

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:31.520
 - Very well, I give up.

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:33.680
 - I sold Uncle John's turkey.

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:34.520
 - What?

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:35.440
 - For $5.

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:38.240
 Agnes was tough, but when I suggested she could change

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:41.000
 to dungarees for the excitement she came around.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:41.840
 - Around the what?

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:45.440
 Well, it's Turkey, Ron, to a turkey, Ron, with Uncle John's turkey.

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:48.540
 But Henry, we don't have Uncle John's turkey anymore.

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:49.540
 What?

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:50.940
 You mean he escaped?

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:52.940
 No, dear, your father's giving it away.

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:55.440
 Well, Gee, where's Stop 'em, mother? Stop 'em!

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:59.140
 Now, Henry, Mrs. Dixon and her family deserve a nice Thanksgiving,

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:01.840
 just as much as any member of your class does.

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:04.240
 From mother, they've already paid me the $5.

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:05.640
 What can I tell them?

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:08.740
 Just explain that the turkey is for a very worthy cause

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:11.540
 and that there's no reason why they can't use something else.

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:14.500
 What for instance well we know

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:18.060
 Whoever heard of a wiener run

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:23.300
 Get busy and dig up a turkey right away. Goodbye. Hey wait

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:26.700
 Well my goodness

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:32.740
 Mother you should have seen it. You should have seen it seen what the turkey he insisted on getting into the front seat with father

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:37.740
 Oh my goodness, and you should have seen them driving down the street with the turkey trying to fly through the windshield

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:43.500
 Maybe I ought to have let that turkey go to Henry's dance after all

00:07:43.500 --> 00:08:01.460
 Homer did anybody notice I wasn't in study period no, but Henry you must have been out of your mind to buy a thing like that

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:04.940
 Homer you're upsetting Felix

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:10.440
 Felix the duck he was born with a name like Felix

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:13.180
 No, but I had to call him something

00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:16.240
 Can we how are you gonna explain to the dance committee?

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:23.260
 They've already got signs up all over the school about having a turkey run home or a duck was all I could get for five dollars

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:29.520
 Besides he was he's much cuter than a turkey. He is don't you think so?

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:32.780
 We'll hold him up so I can get a better look there

00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:36.500
 Hello, Becky

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:37.340
 - Ah.

00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:38.660
 (laughing)

00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:40.840
 - Hey, he's smiling at me.

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:42.000
 - How can you tell?

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.680
 - By the look in his eyes.

00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:44.840
 (laughing)

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:46.260
 - You're a sucky-walkie.

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:47.080
 - Oh.

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:50.180
 - You're right, Henry, he is cute.

00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:51.260
 - Sure.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:54.580
 - And besides, we're doing whoever wins them a favor.

00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:55.420
 - How?

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:57.260
 - See, every year it's the same old thing

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.700
 for Thanksgiving, turkey, turkey, turkey.

00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:01.340
 Don't you think they'll enjoy the novelty

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:02.860
 of eating a duck instead?

00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:03.860
 (growling)

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:04.860
 - What are we quiet?

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:05.700
 - What's wrong?

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:08.700
 I think you should discuss a thing like that in front of the duck.

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:10.700
 Oh, she was. I forgot.

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:12.700
 Open my locker for me, Homer.

00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:13.700
 Okay.

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:16.700
 Hen, there's just one thing.

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:20.700
 Even if the committee says it's okay to have a duck run, how can you?

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:21.700
 What do you mean?

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:23.700
 Well, a duck doesn't run. It waddles.

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:24.700
 It waddles?

00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:26.700
 Waddles, Henry waddles.

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:30.700
 Homer, you're crazy. A duck runs as well as the next person.

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:34.700
 How can it with its toes stuck together like that?

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:37.500
 Look Homer, I'll put Felix down and show you.

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:39.340
 There. Now, let's back away.

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:40.220
 You'll see.

00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:43.020
 Here, Ducky, Ducky, Ducky, Ducky.

00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:45.340
 Look at him run.

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:48.700
 Henry, that's waddling if I ever saw it.

00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:51.820
 Oh boy.

00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:53.900
 Homer.

00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:56.140
 Homer, where'd he disappear to?

00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:57.340
 Right over the locker.

00:09:57.340 --> 00:09:59.020
 There he goes down the hall.

00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:00.540
 After him, Homer, after him.

00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:02.300
 Henry, what about my next class?

00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:03.820
 Haven't you, when he's school spirit,

00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:06.620
 Our class is five dollars tied up in that duck.

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:07.620
 Come on!

00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:20.420
 How's it coming, Will?

00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:21.920
 Fine, Sam.

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:24.720
 Just a few more turns, there will be shop as a razor.

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:25.920
 Good.

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:28.220
 How did you dent your pender, Sam?

00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:31.020
 Well, if you ever tried driving with a turkey in your lap--

00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:33.220
 [GASPING]

00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:35.220
 Look Sam, he's apologizing.

00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:41.220
 He's kind of a cute little fella.

00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:43.220
 Hello, Tucky, Wookie.

00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:48.220
 Look at him, Sam. He's smiling at me.

00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:49.220
 Is that a smile?

00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:51.220
 Of course.

00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:55.220
 Well, there we are. Just feel the edge of this ax, Sam.

00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:57.220
 That's fine, Will. Fine.

00:10:57.220 --> 00:11:01.220
 Well, go ahead, Will.

00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:04.220
 Go ahead and watch.

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:07.220
 Go ahead and use the X.

00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:10.220
 What? Nothing going, Sam.

00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:11.220
 Why me?

00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:12.220
 It's your X, Will.

00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:13.220
 Sure, but it's your turkey.

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:15.220
 Well, I know how you hate to have other people.

00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:16.220
 Use your tools.

00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:18.220
 Sam, this is one time I don't mind.

00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:19.220
 No, Will.

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:20.220
 Now, Sam!

00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:34.380
 Come on Homer, the duck tracks go right around this corner.

00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:37.220
 Oh boy, look at them.

00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:39.220
 Well at least he's easy to follow.

00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:44.220
 Homer, did you find out how Felix got into art class in the first place?

00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:48.220
 Well the way I got it, they were painting this bowl of fruits, see?

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:50.220
 And the poor little fella must have been hungry.

00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:51.220
 He was?

00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:54.220
 But what happened after that is really Mr. Ortsfall.

00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:59.220
 If she hadn't let out a screen, Felix would never have flown into those paint jaws.

00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:03.220
 At least he could have picked out two jars of the same color.

00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:06.220
 Look, red and blue tracks all over the place.

00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:10.220
 Henry, look. This track stopped right in the middle of the hall.

00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:13.220
 They can't. He couldn't disappear into thin air.

00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:15.220
 Henry, that's it.

00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:16.220
 Why? He started to fly.

00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:19.220
 Homer, school is no place for flying around.

00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:21.220
 There's only one thing to do.

00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:25.220
 Why? Go into the principal's office here and ask him if anyone's seen a duck.

00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:26.220
 Henry, you're crazy.

00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:29.220
 But Felix has to be caught before he does some real damage.

00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:31.220
 Hey fella, it's Charlie Cahn.

00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:34.220
 Hiya fella, boy, the whole school sure talking about our turkey run.

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:37.220
 They are Homer, you see, I've gotta find 'em.

00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:38.220
 Find who?

00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:39.220
 Wait here for me, Homer.

00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:41.220
 I wish you'd reconsider, Henry.

00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:43.220
 Henry isn't going into the main office, is it?

00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:44.220
 Boy, learn.

00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:47.220
 Well gee, I was just in there. I've never seen Mr. Bradley so mad.

00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:48.220
 What about?

00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:50.220
 Would you know that fan in his office?

00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:51.220
 Yeah.

00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:53.220
 Well, he had it going, see, and some wise guy,

00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:56.220
 a whole bunch of feathers in it and boy you should see the place.

00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:59.220
 - Hi there. - All different colors.

00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:02.220
 Mr. Bradley threatening to expel a kid who did it.

00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:04.220
 Oh boy, Henry.

00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:05.220
 Where are you going, Homer?

00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:07.220
 Stop Henry before it's too late.

00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:10.220
 Henry, Mr. Bradley will be right out, Henry.

00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:11.220
 Thank you, Mr. Henry.

00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:13.220
 We have to talk to you.

00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:15.220
 She was homered. Don't forget where we are.

00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:16.220
 Henry.

00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:20.220
 Mr. Shae, have we located that shooting to his responsible?

00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:21.220
 Not yet, Mr. Bradley.

00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:24.220
 And Henry ordered to not speak to Henry.

00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:26.220
 Henry, I'm too busy to speak to you now.

00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:27.220
 But Mr. Bradley,

00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:29.220
 whatever you've broken, just pay for it,

00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:31.220
 it will forget the whole face.

00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:34.220
 I haven't broken anything, Mr. Bradley.

00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:36.220
 No, are you sure?

00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:37.220
 Positive.

00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:40.220
 Mr. Bradley, did you know there was something on your shoulder?

00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:45.220
 Well, it'll take me days to get the feathers out of this suit.

00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:48.220
 You had something to do with feathers recently?

00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:51.020
 Oh Homer, you stepped on my foot.

00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:55.020
 My dear, Mr. Bradley, that was Mr. Schultz, the janitor on the phone,

00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:57.020
 and he says those feathers come from a duck.

00:13:57.020 --> 00:13:58.220
 A duck? A duck?

00:13:58.220 --> 00:13:59.420
 Oh, whoa.

00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:00.220
 A live one.

00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:01.020
 What?

00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:02.220
 Let me say that's ridiculous.

00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:04.220
 A duck has no place in a public school.

00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:05.420
 But that's what it was.

00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:08.620
 Mr. Schultz said he saw it taking a bath in one of the drinking founts.

00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:09.420
 But--

00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:10.620
 [LAUGHTER]

00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:12.420
 Dokes don't come in those colors.

00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:14.620
 Well, Mr. Schultz can't explain that part of it,

00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:17.220
 but he says that he knows a duck when he sees it.

00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:18.220
 Mr. Bradley.

00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:19.220
 Henry, don't interrupt.

00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:24.220
 Mr. Bradley, if Mr. Schulz could tell us which way the duck went home, or not, I'd be glad to look for her.

00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:26.220
 We'll find the duck, Henry.

00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:30.220
 And we'll also find out who's responsible for bringing a thing like that into Central High.

00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:31.220
 We will.

00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:33.220
 Oh, boy.

00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:59.220
 [Music]

00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:03.220
 And now getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldrich.

00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:07.220
 While Mr. Aldrich is having turkey troubles of his own,

00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:13.220
 the duck which Henry has been forced to buy for the class turkey run has flown the koopa.

00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:17.220
 The scene opens in a hallway of central high school. It is the same day.

00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:19.220
 Homer, you mean you saw the duck?

00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:25.220
 Not personally. But he got an ancient history scene and started heckling Miss Eggles.

00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:28.220
 Huh? She was reading to the class about Hannibal.

00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:29.620
 He heckled Miss Eigleston.

00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:33.220
 She thought it was Toby Smith and sent him home to get his parents.

00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:35.020
 Oh, no.

00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:37.920
 Henry, you better find that duck before Mr. Bradley does.

00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:40.220
 I know, Homer. I know.

00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:43.120
 Well, she was. I never noticed that before.

00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:44.220
 Notice what?

00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:48.420
 That eagle on top of George Washington's picture on the wall air.

00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:50.120
 Homer! What's wrong?

00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:51.920
 That's no eagle. That's him!

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:53.920
 Who? Felix, our duck!

00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:55.720
 It is.

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:57.720
 He's changed

00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:04.120
 You're a ducky walkie come down

00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:17.000
 Well, we haven't time to cultivate his friendship maybe I could knock him down with one of my shoes who know Homer

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
 You might hit George Washington

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.560
 Felix you come down here, okay

00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:25.020
 - Henry, you frightened him. - Come back, Felix.

00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:26.200
 I didn't mean it.

00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:29.400
 - Hold her hands for him. - Henry, there he goes up the stairway.

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:32.360
 - Come back! Don't go up there! - Come back, Felix.

00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:35.860
 You get in trouble. That's a down stairway.

00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:46.180
 Hello?

00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:48.640
 - I don't know how to name these butcher shafts. - Oh, how do you do?

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:51.340
 I'm phoning about... just a minute, please.

00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:54.920
 Do you know what that chunky just did in a whole quarter of hound of Mr.

00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:56.300
 Davins candy kisses?

00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:59.100
 Well considering that he's going to be somebody's dinner soon that's the least

00:16:59.100 --> 00:16:59.700
 we can do for.

00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:00.700
 Oh hello.

00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:03.100
 Oh well I've got to put you on the phone.

00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:07.000
 Hello I'm Mr. Allrich and I'm calling in reference to a turkey.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.000
 Turkey?

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.000
 Yeah.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.000
 Even going like hunt cakes.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.000
 I think I have one left.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.000
 No no I already have a turkey.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.000
 Oh you're selling him.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.200
 I'm sorry but I can't get rid of the ones I got.

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:17.380
 You don't understand.

00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:21.280
 I have a live turkey and I thought I thought what would you charge

00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:22.280
 to kill and dress it.

00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:23.280
 Kill it?

00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:24.280
 Yes.

00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:25.280
 I tell you, I'm afraid I couldn't do that.

00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:26.280
 Why not?

00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:27.280
 Well, I just scrubbed my floors.

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:29.280
 Listen, Delaney, you're not squeamish, are you?

00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:30.280
 Greenish, of course not.

00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:33.280
 I guess because I'm a butcher, it's no reason for doing somebody else's dirty work.

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:34.280
 No, I love it.

00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:35.280
 But...goodbye.

00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:40.280
 Hey, listen, Jackie, stay away from those hot water bottles.

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:41.280
 What?

00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:42.280
 What are you doing down here?

00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:43.280
 Will he kill it for his hands?

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:44.280
 No.

00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:47.280
 Oh, Sam, you know who might be willing to do it for us?

00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:48.280
 Who?

00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:49.280
 Dr. Collins.

00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:51.080
 I hear he's a very handy man with a scalpel.

00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:52.840
 Oh, well, we couldn't ask him.

00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:53.840
 Why not?

00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:56.640
 He charges $25 a visit.

00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:57.920
 Besides, we look ridiculous.

00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:00.120
 But Sam, we've got to find somebody.

00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:01.680
 Anything I can do for you, Mr. Olrich?

00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:03.120
 Why, uh--

00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:06.640
 Mr. The Haven, have you had any experience with Turkey?

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:07.880
 Turkey's, I should say.

00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:08.640
 You have?

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:10.400
 Sam, he's our man.

00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:13.040
 If I do say so myself, we serve the tastiest Turkey

00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:14.360
 sandwiches in centerville.

00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:15.120
 Yes.

00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:16.880
 Well, would you consider--

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:17.880
 What's that?

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:18.760
 It gets the wrong--

00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:20.160
 Mr. Olrich, is that your turkey?

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:22.080
 I'm going to have a no-get up, Teddy, but just an accident.

00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:23.720
 Hey, hey, you turkey, get away from there!

00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:25.600
 Yes, get away! Stop eating those pebbles!

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:27.520
 Heavals, those are bath salts, Mr. Old.

00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:29.520
 Bath salts at $3 a bottle!

00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:42.440
 Hey, Homer, come on, I'm saving you a safe!

00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:45.520
 I'm just so I'm not sure I can take the time to eat lunch.

00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:47.720
 Have you seen Henry here in the cafeteria?

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:51.720
 Now, I can't even sit down long enough to hear what happened in Jim Watch, period.

00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:53.020
 Something happened.

00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:55.420
 Sure, we were playing volleyball, see?

00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:59.020
 And right in the middle of it, this bird tried to get into the game.

00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:02.720
 A bird? Agnes? Was it anything like a duck?

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:05.920
 No, it was different colors. More like a parrot.

00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:07.420
 Oh, it's cool.

00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:10.020
 And a girl's rock, a brown!

00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:11.220
 What have I done?

00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:13.520
 It's okay, kid. That's okay.

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:16.520
 But try it once more and I'll slap your face.

00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:18.520
 I didn't do anything.

00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:22.520
 Don't kid me. There wasn't anybody close enough to pinch me. It sucked you.

00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:24.520
 Pinch you.

00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:25.520
 I pinched you.

00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:26.520
 So you admit.

00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:28.520
 Homer, did you have any luck?

00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:29.520
 No.

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:31.520
 He was... I almost had him.

00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:33.520
 I trailed him to orchestra practice, see?

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:36.520
 And he flew right into Albert Harris's tuba.

00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:38.520
 Why didn't you grab him?

00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:41.520
 Before I had a chance, Albert blew him out.

00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:43.520
 No, no, no.

00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:45.520
 No one, Agnes. Just someone.

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:48.520
 - I certainly want to apologize. - Apologize, Agnes?

00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:53.520
 - For being against your turkey run. - Well, now that I think it over, Agnes,

00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:58.520
 maybe you were right. - No, I wasn't the desk ticket that they're going like hot cake.

00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:02.520
 - They are. - You or everybody's helping to catch the turkey.

00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:04.520
 - They are. - I hope it's a fast one.

00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:07.520
 A whole track team just got tickets from me.

00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:12.520
 Agnes, Agnes, look about that turkey. - And we all, Rich.

00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:14.520
 - What's the matter? - Are you looking for us?

00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:16.420
 Are you looking for a flop too?

00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:17.420
 But what did I do?

00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:19.420
 I suppose you didn't pinch me.

00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:20.920
 But she whizzed now.

00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:23.120
 Oh, Stella was you again, Homer.

00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:24.720
 Agnes, I give you my word.

00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:27.820
 Somebody pinch me and I dare them to try again.

00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:31.120
 What did you say?

00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:34.320
 Homer.

00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:35.220
 Where is he?

00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:36.620
 Under the table.

00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:38.220
 Get down there and grab him.

00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:39.420
 I cut it out.

00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:42.320
 I got him, Homer.

00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:43.020
 I got him.

00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:45.020
 Then we let go of my hair.

00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:47.020
 Oh, Jesus.

00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:49.020
 Fairy, go, look at the next table.

00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:51.020
 After all.

00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:53.020
 Oh, my goodness, those are the last tables.

00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:54.020
 Excuse me.

00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:55.020
 Shut it out, you.

00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:57.020
 Hey, watch your feet.

00:20:57.020 --> 00:20:59.020
 Fairy, go, look at the next table.

00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:01.020
 Sorry, Mrs. Dine.

00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:03.020
 What's the word, God?

00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:04.020
 Oh, my, see you.

00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:07.020
 I can't get by this guy's feet.

00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:08.020
 Hey, what's your feet?

00:21:08.020 --> 00:21:10.020
 You, what's your feet?

00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:12.020
 I beg your pardon.

00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:14.020
 Oh, whoa.

00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:16.020
 Hello, Mr. Bradley.

00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:19.020
 For those feet attached to you.

00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:21.020
 They are.

00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:23.020
 Stand up, please.

00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:24.020
 Mr. Bradley, I...

00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:25.020
 No, you won't believe this,

00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:29.020
 but I was really under the table on school business.

00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:30.020
 You don't say.

00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:32.020
 And what school business would take you

00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:34.020
 under the teacher's lunch table?

00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:35.020
 The teacher's table.

00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:38.020
 See, how do we lose our direction like that?

00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:41.020
 Oh, boy, there he is.

00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:44.020
 Get that duck! Somebody get that duck!

00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:49.020
 There's a ghost in the moment.

00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:51.020
 I'll tell you what, I'll tell you what.

00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:53.020
 Just a moment.

00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:55.020
 Just a moment, everybody.

00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:57.020
 Please, don't leave.

00:21:57.020 --> 00:22:03.020
 Oh, it's just a moment!

00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:05.780
 (crowd cheering)

00:22:05.780 --> 00:22:13.520
 Henry, is that you?

00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:14.960
 No, Alice.

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:15.860
 It's not Henry.

00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:19.060
 I think I'll go upstairs and take a hot bath and lie down.

00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:19.900
 Yes, dear.

00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:22.020
 Did you get the turkey to Mrs. Dixon?

00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:22.860
 Yes, Alice.

00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:23.700
 I got it to her.

00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:24.540
 Good.

00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:26.540
 And before I forget, here's something for you.

00:22:26.540 --> 00:22:27.380
 Thank you, Sam.

00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:28.780
 What is it?

00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:29.840
 Bath soles.

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:31.420
 Bath soles?

00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:33.820
 But dear, why only half a bottle?

00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:36.820
 Mr. Dayhaven made me a special offer I couldn't say no to.

00:22:36.820 --> 00:22:39.100
 Well, thank you, dear.

00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:41.220
 What did Mrs. Dixon say, Sam?

00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:41.820
 Say.

00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:43.260
 When you gave her the turkey.

00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:44.220
 What?

00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:44.620
 Allie--

00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:45.900
 Oh, mother, hello, father.

00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:47.700
 I don't go upstairs and get a bath right now.

00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:49.100
 The water will turn cold.

00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:51.620
 Henry, why are you coming home so late?

00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:55.500
 Why, there was a little cleaning up at school I had to do.

00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:57.220
 Well, dear, you better go upstairs

00:22:57.220 --> 00:22:58.540
 and start getting dressed for dinner

00:22:58.540 --> 00:23:01.020
 if you want to get to the Thanksgiving dance on time.

00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:06.360
 Well, I'll tell you, mother, that dance has sort of been postponed.

00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:07.860
 Really? Why?

00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:14.360
 Well, the student body's so worn out, there are no shape to dance.

00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:15.300
 Born out?

00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:16.540
 Yeah.

00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:21.040
 From sort of a duck run we had in school today.

00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:26.140
 So we decided to postpone the dance until Christmas.

00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:26.820
 Christmas?

00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:29.420
 At first, but on second thought, we

00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:33.760
 decided the whole school might not be back in shape even by Christmas.

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:37.760
 So instead we're gonna have an Easter egg roll dance.

00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:39.600
 Oh that sounds lovely.

00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:44.280
 And mother, when Easter comes around, do you suppose father might be willing to

00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:46.440
 advance me five dollars?

00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:50.760
 You see the class is kind of depending on me to provide the eggs.

00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:51.760
 Uh...

00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:52.920
 But I'm coming dear.

00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:55.560
 I wonder if duck eggs are cheaper.

00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:57.560
 What is it, Sam?

00:23:57.560 --> 00:23:59.960
 I'll ask you mind if I borrow those bath salts?

00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:01.060
 Of course not.

00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:03.560
 I'd like to get a little pleasure out of what happened today.

00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:06.760
 Fine. And would you answer the phone, please, while I start dinner?

00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:08.560
 All right. Hello.

00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:11.260
 Hello, Mr. Aldrich. This is Mrs. Dixon.

00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:13.360
 Oh, yes, Mrs. Dixon?

00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:15.760
 Mr. Aldrich, the reason I'm calling.

00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:19.660
 Well, you see, I found a beautiful turkey tied to my back porch

00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:21.360
 not more than half an hour ago.

00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:25.060
 Well, somebody probably wanted you to enjoy a happy Thanksgiving.

00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:26.660
 Yes, it was very kind of them.

00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:28.660
 But the point is, I don't need it.

00:24:28.660 --> 00:24:32.660
 My children found a lovely duck in school today.

00:24:32.660 --> 00:24:33.760
 Duck?

00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:36.660
 Yes, and practically all plucked too.

00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:38.360
 And it's the old rich.

00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:41.460
 There's no one I'd rather see have this turkey than you.

00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:42.960
 May, but Mr. Dickson...

00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:44.960
 Oh, it's a wonderful bird, Mr. Oldrich.

00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:46.660
 All you have to do is kill him.

00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:48.260
 Now, wait a minute.
