 Henry! Henry Eldridge!

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,600
 Coming, mother!

 The Old Rich Family, starring as Rustone,

00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,200
 written by Clifford Goldsmith,

10
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,200
 brought to you by the makers of those delicious new desserts

11
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,200
 all America's talking about,

00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,200

14
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:07,200
 In the town of Centerville, most of the residents are ready for march to come in like a lion and go out like a land.

15
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:13,200
 But in the Aldrich family home on Elm Street, these traditional animals have been relegated to the background.

16
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:20,200
 For Henry Aldrich has real rabbits hopping around the basement and live pigeons flapping about the attic.

17
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:25,200
 Our scene tonight opens in Henry's room with Mrs. Aldrich speaking to herself.

18
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,200
 Do you want this broken fountain, Tandya?

19
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,200
 Yes, Mother.

20
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,200
 You want this piece of lead pipe?

21
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,200
 Yes, Mother.

22
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,200
 Will you tell me what on earth, Paul?

23
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,200
 Mother, please, I want everything in my desk.

24
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,200
 That Henry your desk is a sight.

25
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,700
 Let me explain something.

26
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,500
 Right this minute, I'm very busy.

27
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,000
 But the first time I'm not busy, I'll clean it out.

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,700
 You've been saying that for six months.

29
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:48,900
 But she whizzed when you get through, I won't know where anything is.

30
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,300
 What are you saving this ticket to the World Fair for?

31
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,600
 I might use it.

32
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,600
 But it's to the Chicago World Fair.

33
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,600
 It was over several years ago.

34
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,000
 Yeah, I know it's to the Chicago World Fair.

35
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 Even if I don't use it, I'd like to have it for a souvenir.

36
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 What about these three pieces of rock?

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,800
 Mother, I brought all those back from Vermont last summer.

38
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,300
 I carried them back purposely.

39
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,300
 Where did you put them?

40
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,600
 In this lower drawer.

41
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,300
 Well, there's a very good example of what I'm trying to tell you.

42
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,500
 Supposing I should suddenly need those rocks and I'll hurry.

43
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,400
 I'd have to go through everything I own.

44
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,800
 Henry, you're exactly like your grandmother.

45
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,400
 Alice, are you a Henry Drew?

46
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,200
 Yes, Sam.

47
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,000
 Did you want me, Father?

48
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,400
 Oh, no, Henry.

49
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,000
 Alice, I realize you wanted the maid for some time

50
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,900
 and that we now finally have one.

51
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:37,500
 But I do wish you'd ask her not to go in that spare room I used to work in.

52
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,700
 What happened now?

53
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,340
 She's just gone through the place like a tornado.

54
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,180
 She's taken half the things off my desk.

55
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:46,300
 Fact is, dear, I cleaned out your desk.

56
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,180
 You cleaned it off?

57
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:47,980
 Of course.

58
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:49,260
 But what did you do with my pen?

59
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:50,780
 I put it in the pen holder.

60
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:51,820
 Why did you put it there for?

61
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:55,820
 My goodness, Sam, don't you want Martha to have any respect for us?

62
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,020
 Respect for us.

63
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:00,060
 After all, are we hiring her or is she hiring us?

64
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:04,040
 But dear, she's the only maid I've ever had, and this is her first day here, and your

65
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:07,860
 room looked almost as bad as the room Henry keeps his rabbits in down in the cellar.

66
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:10,340
 Mother, do we have to tell her about my rabbits?

67
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:14,280
 Whether we do or not, Henry, I think you'd better be prepared for the day when she finds

68
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,280
 them.

69
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,720
 Well, couldn't you put it up to her?

70
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:22,380
 Just tell her that if the rabbits will stay in their room, and father will stay in his.

71
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:24,140
 Wouldn't she be happy?

72
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:28,100
 Incidentally, who changed the blotter on my desk?

73
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,100
 I did.

74
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:32,700
 I didn't want to see it thrown out. I liked that old blutter.

75
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:35,900
 All right, dear. Go it down and get it out of the trash barrel.

76
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,460
 If you want to, you may sleep with it under your pillow,

77
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:40,940
 but I certainly hope you won't let Martha see it.

78
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:43,740
 Unfortunately, it had all my telephone numbers written on it.

79
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:46,220
 What do you want done with this Canadian penny, Henry?

80
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,900
 I might go to Canada sometimes.

81
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:50,940
 Miss Armin?

82
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,220
 Yes, Martha.

83
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:54,140
 Miss Armin, yeah.

84
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:55,180
 I'm right here, Mother.

85
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:59,380
 Miss. All you somebody want you downstairs at the front door.

86
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:00,380
 Oh gentlemen.

87
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:01,820
 You saw the resentment.

88
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,760
 Well did you ask him to step inside?

89
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,960
 Yes.

90
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:08,320
 Miss. Always could I pick up some of your time for something?

91
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,860
 What is it Martha?

92
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:15,900
 I don't like to complain but frankly when I come to you this morning you said there was only food in the family.

93
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,400
 Oh no. So there are.

94
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,600
 But how about all those rabbits down in the cellar?

95
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,100
 The rabbits Martha?

96
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,540
 Yes I didn't anybody know they was down there.

97
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:31,400
 Of course we knew they were down there, but I know that don't you like rabbits my brother kept rabbits once and frankly

98
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:36,600
 I got awful tired of them, but they don't ever come upstairs and get near way do they not yet

99
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:40,200
 But two of them working their way toward the cell of stands Martha

100
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:45,240
 We're not keeping those rabbits always Henry's simply going to raise them and then sell them very soon

101
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,880
 You they say here nice. Oh, yes, they like it here very much

102
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,680
 Yes, sir

103
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,880
 Right away

104
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,760
 I ain't gonna stay here with you, Rabbit.

105
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,680
 Martha. Martha, why don't you look at it this way?

106
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,840
 You know how lucky a rabbit's foot is.

107
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,480
 You read it from my brother's head.

108
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,520
 It was always just a lot of weight.

109
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,680
 How long did you live with your brother?

110
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,440
 Frankly, just a little while.

111
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,800
 I tried, but I couldn't get myself adjusted to him.

112
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,800
 But very few people get to like a rabbit right away, Martha.

113
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,560
 But once you get to know those I have, you'll say,

114
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,200
 gee whiz thanks Henry for letting me get to know them.

115
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,600
 Well, I finished off the day, but I can't stay any longer than that.

116
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,400
 Look, Martha, is there anything I could give you to make it worth your while?

117
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,080
 Like what?

118
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:32,400
 Well, I could give you a part of my allowance each week.

119
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,760
 How much would that be?

120
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,320
 Well, I could give you a 20 cents of it.

121
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,320
 20 cents?

122
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,280
 And I'll do all the work that's in connection with the rabbits.

123
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,280
 Gee whiz, Martha, isn't that a bargain?

124
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,480
 Frankly, I wouldn't be interested.

125
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:49,480
 Would you be interested in 20 cents a week in your choice of anything in my desk here?

126
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,280
 What did I?

127
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,280
 Well gee, I got a million things.

128
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,680
 How about a Canadian penny?

129
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,240
 How many is that?

130
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,960
 Well, just one.

131
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,440
 But don't let that mislead you.

132
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,400
 It's only a penny in Canada.

133
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,640
 But here Martha.

134
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,360
 How much is it here?

135
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,280
 Well, I wouldn't want to say.

136
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,360
 (audience laughing)

137
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,600
 In this country, a thing like that is very rare.

138
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,440
 Yeah.

139
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,800
 In fact, that's only the fourth one

140
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,120
 I've ever seen in my life.

141
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,120
 And you know how long I've been kicking around.

142
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,520
 Whatever you got.

143
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,820
 What else about, well,

144
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:23,740
 Would you like a piece of genuine Vermont granite, Martha?

145
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:25,820
 Yeah, just a piece of stone, ain't it?

146
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,220
 Not in Vermont, it isn't.

147
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:30,020
 In Vermont, that's granite.

148
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:33,420
 And you can't get better granite unless you want imported.

149
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:35,660
 You certainly wouldn't want to go to all that trouble.

150
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:37,220
 You got anything else?

151
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:39,940
 Well, there's a compass here.

152
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,540
 Only I wouldn't want to give you that.

153
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:44,340
 It's broken.

154
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:47,740
 See, Wiz, if you got lost with that, where would you be?

155
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,220
 I don't want to do that.

156
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:52,300
 Oh, here's something for you, Gee Whiz.

157
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:52,960
 What is it?

158
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,460
 How would you like a ticket to the World's Fair?

159
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:57,100
 To the WOOD FAFT!

160
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,260
 Sure.

161
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:59,540
 You gon' give me this?

162
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:01,860
 Of course, if you'll only stay with the rabbits.

163
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,700
 Martha, may I stick with you?

164
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,340
 Definitely miss Aldrich.

165
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:07,620
 Martha, that visitor downstairs did not

166
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:08,900
 want to see Mr. Aldrich.

167
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,500
 He wanted to see Henry.

168
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,140
 Henry?

169
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:12,620
 Somebody is here to see me, mother.

170
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:14,060
 Come right on up, Tony.

171
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:14,900
 Henry up here?

172
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,380
 I'm up my room, Tom.

173
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,980
 Martha, is it all safe?

174
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:20,240
 Well, I say it to the fell!

175
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,800
 Henry, take a look at this.

176
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,520
 What is it? It's the morning paper.

177
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,780
 Not so loud, Tom.

178
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:26,220
 But it's got the end we put in.

179
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,060
 Yeah, let's see it.

180
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,580
 I'm telling you, Henry, we're gonna make money

181
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:29,420
 hand over fifth.

182
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,940
 Has anyone phoned your house yet?

183
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:31,860
 Oh, it's too early.

184
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,580
 But I'm asking you, Henry, who else in town

185
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:35,580
 would have thought of using carrier pigeons this way?

186
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,340
 Not so loud, I tell you.

187
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,180
 What's the matter?

188
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,500
 I mean, what's the matter?

189
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,660
 We've got a new maid, and she ought to get used

190
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:43,340
 to one thing at a time.

191
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:45,660
 (audience laughing)

192
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:47,340
 Doesn't she like pigeons?

193
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,340
 We don't know yet.

194
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:51,140
 She doesn't know you've got some up in the attic?

195
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:52,640
 She'll find it out, Tommy.

196
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,340
 She'll find it out.

197
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,140
 They're in the room right next to hers.

198
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:58,640
 [LAUGHTER]

199
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,540
 Oh, Henry, is your mother in there?

200
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,840
 No, she isn't, Father.

201
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,740
 Tommy, fold the paper up quick and stick it on my desk.

202
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:05,740
 Where'd she go?

203
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:06,540
 Oh, mother?

204
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:07,640
 What is it, Dad?

205
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:11,140
 I dug my old blood around of the trash barrel.

206
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:14,040
 I also found one of my good shot flies in there.

207
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,940
 I almost hooked myself on that thing.

208
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:17,580
 every time I go into your desk drawer.

209
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,020
 - You don't know right to go in there, dear.

210
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:21,460
 That's my drawer and everything in there is mine.

211
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:22,460
 - It's all right.

212
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,380
 - Yes, mother?

213
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:25,940
 - A part I want to speak to you on the telephone.

214
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:27,580
 - I'll be right there.

215
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:29,500
 - Henry, isn't that the morning paper sticking out

216
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,340
 of your desk?

217
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:31,420
 - Oh, that is an R's mother.

218
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,260
 That's Tommy.

219
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,340
 - I'll take it, Mrs. Alders.

220
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:35,020
 There's no use bothering you with that.

221
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:36,260
 - May I see it, please?

222
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:37,820
 - Oh, Mother.

223
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:40,540
 You ever noticed how this piece of granite sparkles?

224
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:42,220
 - Henry, I'm looking at the advertisement

225
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,380
 before I do my shopping.

226
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,540
 - Well, wouldn't you like to have me look at them for you?

227
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:46,800
 I certainly would not.

228
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,380
 Have you noticed the ads on this other page, Mrs. Alden?

229
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:50,100
 Over here?

230
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,300
 Yeah.

231
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,340
 Why should I buy a piano?

232
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:54,340
 I don't know.

233
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:56,260
 They say they're good pianos.

234
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:59,300
 Alice, would you please tell Martha not to call me every time

235
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,060
 the phone rings?

236
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,260
 Who was that call for?

237
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,340
 Tommy Walsh's mother wants to talk with him.

238
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:05,060
 She wants to talk to me, Mr. Orgwick?

239
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:05,860
 She wants me?

240
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:06,580
 Yes, Tommy.

241
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:07,860
 Henry, the first one's come.

242
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:08,940
 The first one's come.

243
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:09,940
 What is come?

244
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:12,340
 I'm message you was expecting.

245
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:14,580
 Sam, did you see this advertisement?

246
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:17,580
 I think it might interest Henry too.

247
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:20,580
 What's it for, mother?

248
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:23,580
 A clearance of men's and young men's shoes.

249
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,580
 Shoes?

250
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:28,580
 Let me say it.

251
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:30,580
 Here.

252
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:32,580
 Henry, are you too warm?

253
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,580
 Warm, mother? What's the matter with you?

254
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:37,580
 I just thought I'd get down and see Tommy.

255
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:39,580
 Father, could I have the paper, please?

256
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:40,580
 One moment here.

257
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,580
 Alice, did you see this?

258
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:45,180
 - What? - Just notice, it says,

259
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:47,500
 "Carry a pigeon service.

260
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:51,240
 "Messages delivered to any point in Centerville.

 "Signed all rich and waltch, incorporated."

 (audience laughing)

266
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,620
 - Sam read that again.

267
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:07,140
 - I'd rather not.

268
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:10,120
 - Henry, do you still have those pigeons up in the attic?

269
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:13,120
 Well, less than a dozen, Mother.

270
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,120
 What do you suppose Martha's going to do when she finds them?

271
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,120
 Mother Tommy and I can make some money.

272
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:23,120
 Henry, you don't imagine anyone is actually going to use any such messenger service, do you?

273
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,120
 Why not? We only charge $0.10 a message and the whole thing's clear profit.

274
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,120
 Do you mean to say, dear, your pigeons can go anyplace you send them?

275
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:34,120
 Well, I couldn't go so far as to say that, Mother, but they're trained almost that well.

276
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:38,120
 When Martha leaves, can your pigeons be trained to do the housework?

277
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,580
 Could I keep the pigeons in my room, Mother?

278
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:42,580
 No, dear.

279
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:43,580
 Henry, may I come in?

280
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:44,580
 Yes, Tommy.

281
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:47,780
 Listen, Henry, Mrs. Persons wants us to deliver a very important message for her.

282
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:48,980
 It's all off, Tommy.

283
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:51,580
 Tommy, what is the message Mrs. Persons wants to deliver?

284
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:53,900
 Well, she didn't say she just said we should come over right away.

285
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:57,420
 And may I ask how a pigeon could possibly deliver a message for us?

286
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:58,820
 Or it'd be simple, Mother.

287
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:01,820
 We've got dizzy Stevens working for us on a commission, see?

288
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:06,140
 He takes one of our pigeons over to Mrs. Persons and fastens the message on our foot, see?

289
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:07,380
 On to Mrs. Persons?

290
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,980
 No, under the pigeons.

291
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:10,340
 How does it know where to go?

292
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,580
 It comes here.

293
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,060
 Whether the message is for us or not.

294
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,740
 Well, this is a relay junction.

295
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,940
 One of us then detaches the bird from the message,

296
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,740
 jumps on a bicycle and delivers it.

297
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:22,540
 (audience laughing)

298
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:25,180
 Sure, sure, that's all there is to it, Mr. Aldrich.

299
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:26,080
 You don't say so.

300
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,460
 Could anything be more simple?

301
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:29,700
 And where is Mrs. Priscan's all this time?

302
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,460
 That's the beautiful part of it.

303
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:33,900
 Once the message leaves her hands,

304
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,540
 she can forget the whole thing.

305
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:37,300
 (audience laughing)

306
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:40,300
 Supposing there's an answer.

307
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:43,300
 What's that?

308
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,300
 Supposing there's an answer.

309
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,300
 Well, Mr. Rawd, don't you think that would be an exceptional case?

310
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:52,300
 I mean, after all, most people just send a message, and that's all there is to it.

311
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,300
 Sure, that's what I should think.

312
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:57,300
 You know, Martha will never stand for our keeping those pigeons.

313
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:01,300
 Alice, what does Martha have to do with it, the boys have an idea here?

314
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,300
 Don't you want me to keep a name?

315
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,300
 Well, I don't think she should be spoiled.

316
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,300
 That's what I think.

317
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,300
 That's what I think.

318
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:09,460
 Now, that you explained to Martha what Henry wants to do.

319
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:12,020
 Well, if I can't understand it, certainly Martha can.

320
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,300
 Mother, look at it this way.

321
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,820
 Henry, there's no use arguing.

322
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,820
 Martha is not going to like Henry.

323
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:19,380
 But Mother, Henry, let me talk to your mother.

324
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:23,180
 Alice, I don't think what Henry wants to do is going to laugh.

325
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:25,460
 But I do think he should be allowed to try it.

326
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:27,580
 And I don't see why Martha should be afraid of pigeons.

327
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,540
 Would you like it if a pigeon should get in your room

328
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:30,300
 in the middle of the night?

329
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,460
 What harm could it do?

330
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,380
 Well, I'm sure I wouldn't like it.

331
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:34,980
 Where does the trouble seem to be, Henry?

332
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,380
 No place, Tommy.

333
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,380
 We just have a temperamental maid.

334
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:40,580
 Henry, if you must go through with this,

335
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:42,880
 supposing you wait while I have a talk with Martha.

336
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,580
 If you want my advice, don't mention the pigeons to her,

337
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:47,980
 and she won't even notice they're there.

00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,180
 What on earth is that?

340
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,180
 It's coming from the attic.

341
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,180
 I think it's Martha.

342
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:54,480
 She's found the pigeons.

 [MUSIC PLAYING]

344
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:13,160
 A week or so ago, ladies and gentlemen, one of our listeners gave a party.

345
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:16,760
 And a few days afterward she received a note of thanks from one of the guests.

346
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:20,880
 Now you've all heard people refer to such a note as a bread and butter letter, but this

347
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,000
 one was a pudding letter because here's the way it read.

348
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 Dear Helen, just a line or two to tell you how much Bob and I enjoyed the party.

349
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 It certainly was a big success and we all had our grand time.

350
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 Incidentally, the real hit of the evening was that wonderful pudding you served for dessert.

351
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 Bob keeps asking me to find out how you made it.

 So why don't you be a good girl and send me the recipe?

353
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 Love Julia.

354
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 Well, the next day Helen answered her friend's letter,

355
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 and if you could have peeked over her shoulder, you'd have read this.

356
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 Dear Julia, the pudding was called jello orange vanilla whip.

357
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,040
 vanilla whip, and I heard about it on the radio, on the program called the Aldrich family.

358
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,520
 Here's the way Harry von Zehl said to make it.

359
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:05,000
 Well first you take one package each of orange jello and jello vanilla pudding,

360
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,280
 and make them up as you usually do. Then chill the orange jello and whip it as directed on the box.

361
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:16,680
 Next you chill the jello vanilla pudding and add it to the whipped jello, beating constantly until

362
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:22,920
 blended, then mold, and there you have a truly swell dessert, a glorious combination of golden

363
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:29,400
 orange jello and smooth, creamy jello vanilla pudding, easy to make and downright inexpensive.

364
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:35,320
 P.S., now why not try some yourself friends, and see how soon it becomes one of your special

365
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:41,400
 favorites, for rich tangy flavor, for rare distinctive goodness, jello orange vanilla

366
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,400
 The width is absolutely tops.

367
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:56,400
 [Music]

368
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,400
 Now getting back to the problems of Henry,

369
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:03,400
 the Aldrichs have a new maid who apparently does not like pigeons.

370
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:07,400
 The scene opens on the second floor of the Aldrich home.

371
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,400
 Sam, I've about decided you were right.

372
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:15,400
 Well, I don't think we should make Henry get rid of those pigeons, just because Martha doesn't like them.

373
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,400
 You certainly aren't going to let her go, are you?

374
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,400
 Well, I thought you said I should.

375
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,400
 Well, that was before she made that beef stew we had for lunch.

376
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:24,400
 That was the best beef stew Alice. I ever ate in my life.

377
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,400
 But if we let her have her way on the pigeon, she'll water away on everything.

378
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:32,400
 It might interest you to know Alice that Martha no longer objects to the pigeons.

379
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,400
 How do you know?

380
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,400
 I had a little talk with her.

381
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,400
 What did you tell her?

382
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:40,400
 Well, I told her we'd give her a dollar a week more.

383
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,400
 Sam Olrich, you should never have told her that.

384
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,400
 But I like her stew.

385
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:50,400
 I still don't believe she's going to stay in her house with something she's scared the death of for only one dollar a week extra.

386
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:53,400
 Well, if you must know, I gave her something else.

387
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,400
 What?

388
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,400
 My chocolatine.

389
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,400
 She wanted it for a hat ornament.

390
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:02,400
 Well, at least I won't be hooked on it anymore.

391
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,400
 I also gave her a timetable.

392
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,400
 Well, I thought she was saying.

393
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:08,680
 No, she is until the Chicago world's fairy opened.

394
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:11,480
 What year will that be?

395
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:14,200
 I have no idea, but she's staying until then.

396
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,120
 Mother!

397
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,240
 Where are you, Henry?

398
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,400
 I'm coming down the attic stairs.

399
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,960
 Have any pigeons flown in any windows down here yet?

400
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,080
 None that I've seen.

401
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,200
 That's strange.

402
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,120
 How's your messenger say this wicked?

403
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:26,920
 Fine.

404
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:30,720
 I wonder how you can account for a thing like that.

405
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,520
 You've got to give our bird time, Henry.

406
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,720
 But babies, the fastest bird we have.

407
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,480
 Nothing seems to have gone wrong, Henry.

408
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,720
 Oh, nothing, Father.

409
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,920
 Nothing.

410
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,760
 Just seems to be a minor delay.

411
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:44,240
 The only thing that's wrong is we don't know where our pigeon went.

412
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,000
 Of course, maybe Dizzy Stevens hasn't even

413
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,400
 got her over to Mrs. Persons yet.

414
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,360
 That's what happened.

415
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,680
 Sure, Dizzy probably took the nickel we paid him

416
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,000
 and is out blowing it in.

417
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,840
 Come on up back up into the attic.

418
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,800
 Boys, you haven't forgotten your promise

419
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,960
 to stay out of Martha's room while you're up there.

420
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,800
 Oh, we haven't been near her door, Father.

421
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,440
 Henry, what do you suppose has become a baby?

422
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,600
 She was probably a strong headwind holding her back.

423
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,360
 But Mrs. Person's only goes a mile from here.

424
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:13,680
 Maybe she arrived when we weren't looking and couldn't see that this attic window here was open.

425
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,200
 She can find this house.

426
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,480
 She certainly ought to be able to tell whether a window was open.

427
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:20,240
 Tommy, Tommy, take a look outside.

428
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:20,720
 And what?

429
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,520
 Look, she's coming 90 miles an hour.

430
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,480
 That isn't a direction Mrs. Person's lives in.

431
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,440
 What difference does it make?

432
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,560
 She's coming, isn't she?

433
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:29,680
 She probably went around so she could come in on the wind.

434
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:32,720
 Where is she now?

435
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,980
 She's straight up there.

436
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:35,940
 Henry, Henry, I think I can see the message.

437
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:38,580
 Father, mother, come up for the landing.

438
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:40,700
 Stand back from the wind of Tommy so we don't frighten her.

439
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:41,540
 Where is she?

440
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:42,380
 She's overhead.

441
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:44,540
 She was.

442
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:46,140
 She went right by.

443
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:49,380
 To where?

444
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,020
 I don't know.

445
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,540
 She didn't stop.

446
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:53,740
 Just when we need her.

447
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,980
 As a matter of fact, that might have been some other bird.

448
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:58,220
 You know what we need is a parabonocular view.

449
00:17:58,220 --> 00:17:59,300
 As you landed, Henry.

450
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:03,300
 Not yet, Father, it was just an aeroplane or something.

451
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:04,900
 A musset's on her way up there.

452
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,700
 Oh, well, come right up, Martha.

453
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:07,900
 Oh, no!

454
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:10,100
 A musset wants you to come down and meet her.

455
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:12,500
 Sure, I'll escort you up, Martha.

456
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,700
 Ain't no no pig and loose up there, is it?

457
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,100
 Gee whiz, no, Martha.

458
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,800
 Every bird up here is in her own cage.

459
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,500
 And look, Martha, they won't hurt you.

460
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,100
 I put my fingers right through the bores

461
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,900
 and they don't even touch me.

462
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:26,500
 Just let me in my room here.

463
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,900
 There you are, Martha.

464
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,100
 Close that door.

465
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,100
 Sure.

466
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:32,100
 Henry, take a look out the window.

467
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,100
 Where?

468
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:35,100
 She's right over there on the roof of the next house.

469
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,100
 Tommy.

470
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,100
 Tommy, there she is.

471
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,100
 Hiya, baby.

472
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,100
 Mother!

473
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,100
 Mother!

474
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,100
 Hey, everybody, look outside.

475
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,100
 Come on, baby.

476
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,100
 Come on.

477
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:44,100
 Martha!

478
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,100
 Martha!

479
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,100
 What's the matter?

480
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:50,100
 Leave your window open in case baby wants to come in that way.

481
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:53,100
 I'm going back to clothing right now.

482
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,100
 Tommy is baby coming?

483
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,100
 Here, baby.

484
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,100
 Here, baby.

485
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,100
 She just sits on the roof of Mrs. Kilmer's house.

486
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,100
 Maybe she wants a rest for a minute.

487
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:04,100
 After flying just one mile, can you see the message?

488
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,100
 Sure.

489
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,100
 What can we? She's coming. She's coming.

490
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:08,100
 Yeah, only to the end of the roof though.

491
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:11,100
 Well, that's an art direction, isn't it? Her instincts are right.

492
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,100
 Why? Do you have your bird yet?

493
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,100
 Where are you, father?

494
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:16,100
 I'm here on the back wall.

495
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:19,100
 She just flew onto the window sill. Maybe she likes that house.

496
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:21,100
 Maybe she thinks we live there.

497
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:24,100
 Mr. Aldrich, could you get a stick and poker?

498
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:27,100
 There's no stick down here, that log.

499
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:31,100
 If everybody would keep quiet a second, maybe she'd come over here naturally.

500
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,300
 Henry, is she coming?

501
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,700
 She walked this way.

502
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:38,300
 That means she's getting ready.

503
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:40,100
 See that?

504
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,300
 What'd she do?

505
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,500
 She sat down.

506
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:48,500
 Mr. Roar, would you ring the bell next door and ask the people to push her off the window sill?

507
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,700
 I happen to know the kilmers are out.

508
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:55,300
 At a time like this, Father, could you go inside and push her off?

509
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,600
 I could not.

510
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:01,500
 Well, she was the opposed she's going to nest on that window, so maybe she's going to lay an egg.

511
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:06,700
 Father, do you see that ladder right there by the side of our house?

512
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:09,700
 I do, but I'm not going to climb up it.

513
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:12,820
 But she may be gone by the time we get down there.

514
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:15,860
 Sam, put that ladder against the house and help the boys.

515
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:17,100
 Where are you, mother?

516
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,580
 I'm down here with your father.

517
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:21,260
 I'm not going to climb up the side of Kilmer's house.

518
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:24,100
 What was it your idea that the boys would go ahead with this?

519
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,620
 But I certainly didn't know it was going to lead the breaking in the houses.

520
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:30,380
 - Sad. - All right, I'll help them.

521
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:33,540
 Well, Henry, send him off his room and tell her it's time to start dinner.

522
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:34,500
 Yes, mother.

523
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,060
 Martha.

524
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:38,540
 Martha.

525
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:39,700
 What do you know?

526
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:42,860
 My mother says it's time to start dinner.

527
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:45,020
 You got that fine devil called yet?

528
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:49,700
 Martha, if you come out, we'll give you protection to look under the stairs.

529
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,900
 Martha!

530
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:55,180
 Isn't she timid though?

531
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:59,460
 Father if you can get baby down I think we can get Martha out

532
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:06,760
 You don't say so don't talk to him Henry you want him to fall off that ladder must you mention my calling?

533
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:09,460
 Just talk to her father and she'll come

534
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:14,880
 What shall I say to her just say here baby come baby here baby?

535
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,580
 I'm not gonna say anything of the kind

536
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:23,060
 Mr. Orgens, if you'll stand on the top wrong and reach, I think it can get her.

537
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,740
 Stand to fault!

538
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:27,460
 Grab her quickly, but carefully, Father.

539
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:30,500
 Yes. Is there anyone else who would like to give me a flight?

540
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,900
 Oh, Gee, look who's opening that window.

541
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:35,140
 Was there something you wanted, Sam Orgens?

542
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:37,300
 Uh, how do you do, Mrs. Kelsey?

543
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,940
 Uh, where did the pigeon go?

544
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:40,660
 What pigeon?

545
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:42,740
 She didn't fly in your window, did she?

546
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:43,940
 What are you talking about?

547
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:46,100
 My father, he's trying to get a message.

548
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:46,820
 To me?

549
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:48,420
 No, from a pigeon.

550
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:53,320
 Henry, you're not helping that, is it, eh?

551
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:56,020
 Mr. Roar, but she's down there on the whim of that tree.

552
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:59,520
 Father, all you have to do is move your ladder.

553
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:03,920
 I'm not going to climb anything more.

554
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,720
 Sam, if we don't get that baby, we won't have any dinner.

555
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,920
 I can't help it.

556
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,340
 What are you having for dinner, Miss.

557
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:10,820
 Aldrich, pigeon pie?

558
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:15,720
 Alice, if I don't stop now, I'll end by climbing everything in town.

559
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,000
 Mother, could you climb up the tree?

560
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:18,900
 No, dear.

561
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,260
 Could you throw a stick?

562
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:21,700
 They're all gonna stick.

563
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:24,060
 Could you just toss a stone in her direction?

564
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:25,300
 All right, dear.

565
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,060
 And that's toward me, Alice.

566
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:29,260
 Be sure not to hit Baby, either.

567
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:30,260
 Here he goes.

568
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:31,900
 You're too high, Mother!

569
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:34,340
 Who do that?

570
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:38,440
 She and Waze Mother duck around the corner.

571
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,040
 It went through Martha's window.

572
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:42,840
 Did not care if you couldn't trust him, that kid, just...

573
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:45,080
 And now Baby's flown away.

574
00:22:45,080 --> 00:23:01,080
 [Music]

575
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,480
 If you ask me Alice, no maid on earth is worth it.

576
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:06,680
 Well, she's just gone up to the attic and she's perfectly happy.

577
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:10,920
 Well, she had better be. It cost me three dollars to get Henry to go out of business.

578
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:13,640
 Mother? Mother, are you down in the living room?

579
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,140
 Yes, dear, where are you?

580
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:18,760
 Could you come up to the second floor in just a minute?

581
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,200
 Now, what is it?

582
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,400
 Martha doesn't want to go up to her room.

583
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,560
 Tell Martha there isn't a pigeon left in the house.

584
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,240
 No?

585
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,760
 No, my father made me give them all away, Martha.

586
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:29,480
 Yes, Martha.

587
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:32,520
 Henry even gave his rabbits away just so you'd stay.

588
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,720
 I appreciate that.

589
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:36,440
 Only I never been up there before in the dark.

590
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,840
 Who does it like in your room?

591
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,640
 Not till I get to it.

592
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,760
 Martha, what if it is dark?

593
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:45,160
 As soon as you get to your door, you snap the switch on and there's light.

594
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:48,060
 Yeah, Henry isn't afraid, certainly you shouldn't be.

595
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:50,060
 Henry, will you go up there with me?

596
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:51,160
 Who I?

597
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,960
 Of course he will. In fact, Martha, if it will make you any happier,

598
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:57,960
 Henry will even sit in the chair just outside your door until you get this seat.

599
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:58,960
 In the dark, Mother?

600
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,160
 Of course.

601
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,860
 I thought you weren't afraid.

602
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:03,060
 I'm not.

603
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:03,960
 I'm not.

604
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,760
 I'll open the door to the stairs for you.

605
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,160
 There you are.

606
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,760
 Henry, you go in first.

607
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,360
 Oh, uh, you can go first Martha.

608
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:15,560
 Then if anything happens, you know I'm right in back of you.

609
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,560
 Henry?

610
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,560
 Henry?

611
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:23,760
 Mother, I'll lead the way.

612
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,160
 Are you coming Martha?

613
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,160
 Yes.

614
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,160
 Goodnight.

615
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:32,560
 Gee, I didn't realize it was so dark up here.

616
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,760
 What's that?

617
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:37,760
 It's the chair outside your door.

618
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:38,760
 There's the light Martha.

619
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,760
 You gonna sit out here?

620
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:41,760
 Sure.

621
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,760
 I don't mind the dark.

622
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,760
 Good night.

623
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:46,760
 Good night.

624
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:49,760
 Mom, are you afraid of this?

625
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,760
 Martha.

626
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,760
 What? What you want?

627
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:57,760
 Do I have to sit out here like this and very long?

628
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,760
 You get used to it after a couple of nights.

629
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:04,760
 Where did I put my night down?

630
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:07,760
 Come over here you little rascal to say good night.

631
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,760
 Mother, you choose all of us.

632
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:15,760
 I like to talk to myself.

633
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:21,760
 Now I'm off to turn out the lights.

634
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:28,760
 I'm good about this crowd in this room.

635
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:32,760
 Henry, Mr. Henry.

636
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:37,760
 Well, I'll let you know when I'm asleep.

637
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,760
 (audience laughing)

638
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:45,760
 I guess this place ain't so bad after all.

639
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,760
 Who there?

640
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,760
 Who there?

641
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:53,760
 There ain't nothing else, Ma.

642
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,760
 Just like I was still.

643
00:25:55,760 --> 00:26:00,760
 If Miss Orange is giving her one of our squatter's words in here.

644
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:09,760
 They're you buddy in here. Are you all right Martha? They're the eagles in here. Get away from me.

645
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:15,760
 Henry where are you? I put my phone downstairs for something Martha. But come back.

646
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:20,760
 Turn on the lights. The pigeons they all come back. What in the world is going on up there?

647
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:25,760
 Look only one came back. Was enough. And it's baby. It's baby.

648
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,760
 Sitting right over there on Martha's dresser.

649
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,760
 She's right on my ticket to the woods, Sam!

650
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:34,760
 Mother, mother, you hold Martha while I save baby.

651
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,760
 What's the trouble here?

652
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,760
 Martha, what is that rabbit doing beside your bed?

653
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:41,760
 I hope you don't mind my keeping just one, Miss Alder.

654
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,760
 Frankly, I just took the lack of ill fellas.

655
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,760
 I kind of took the one that keep one all of them.

656
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:47,760
 Mother.

657
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,760
 I just got the message, Father.

658
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:53,760
 Mrs. Persons wants a man to hurry over and fix her oil burner this afternoon.

659
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,760
 You don't say so.

660
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,760
 Martha, what are you getting your suitcase out for?

661
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:01,760
 If you don't mind this all just frankly, I think I'll go.

662
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,760
 Well, frankly, Martha, we don't mind.

663
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:15,760
