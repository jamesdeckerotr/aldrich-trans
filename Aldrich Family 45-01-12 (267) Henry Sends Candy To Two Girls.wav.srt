 They say that youngsters ought never grow up because when they're young they're happy.

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 However teenage boys like Henry Aldrich may be happy alright, but that isn't the whole story.

00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 The scene opens in the old rich kitchen.

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 Hey Henry, I'm here.

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 Homer, is that you? She was having fun and getting in touch with you.

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 Listen, Henry, have you got anything in the house worth eating?

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 Eating Homer? Look, did you see Kathleen at school today?

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 Yeah, sure. Did she happen to mention my name, by any chance?

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 I don't know whether she mentioned your name. I had enough troubles today.

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 Boy, do you know how much time I had for lunch? Well, all I know is Homer. Something's happened.

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 And then Mr. Nelson caught me with a piece of pie hidden in my chemistry lab table.

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 Henry, could you see the front door, please?

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 Yes, Mother, I'm going to the door.

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 Homer, would you be willing to do something for me?

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 Here's a box of flowers for all, Rich.

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 For all, Rich, she wins.

00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 You all, Rich? Sure. Thanks for I'm up.

 Okay.

 She lives here, me, who's sending you flowers.

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 Now listen, Homer.

27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 My mother makes some cookies today, I think,

28
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 and if you could do a little something for me,

29
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 I might be able to get you a couple.

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 But what is it you want me to do?

31
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 Well, first, you can't mean most speak to me.

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 She wouldn't speak to me all day.

33
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 What kind are they, Henry?

34
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 Do they have raisins in them?

35
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,800
 in them, raisins and wands.

36
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,300
 I thought you mother made some cookies.

37
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,300
 Hey, Ray, what was that?

38
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,100
 It was a door.

39
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:55,900
 Nothing, mother.

40
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,600
 It was just a box for you.

41
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,800
 Homer, will you please put on a phone call to Kathleen

42
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,900
 and just accidentally ask her why she saw her at me?

43

 Well, first, let's see the cookies.

 I'm bringing it, mother.

00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,100
 Homer, do you stay where you are?

48
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:11,800
 If she has more than one time, I'd like to see both.

 Dear, you may take a cookie into him if you'd like to, but you may not take a plate full.

 Oh, Sam!

 Of course!

 I know, but why?

 Well, because Harriet, why not?

86
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,700
 He might have sent them for any number of reasons.

87

 Mother, Homer wanted me to tell you those cookies were very good and...

89
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:17,700

 Well, do you mind if I come over? I'm sort of fed up with all the women here at my house.

185
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,960
 All right. Okay, I'll be seeing you right away.

186
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:48,960
 Okay, goodbye.

187
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,960
 Mother! Yes, Kathleen?

188
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,960
 Mother, I just had the most embarrassing thing happen to me.

189
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,960
 I nearly died.

190
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:54,960
 What happened?

191
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,960
 Well, I started to tell something to somebody. I thought it was Charlie Clark.

192
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,960
 And it wasn't Charlie Clark because I was just talking to Charlie Clark.

193
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,960
 What, Kathleen?

194
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,960
 My goodness, I'm certainly glad I didn't tell you what I thought of Henry.

195
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:05,960
 What's happened to Henry?

196
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:06,960
 Nothing, Mother. Nothing.

197
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,960
 Only if there's one thing I can't stand is somebody that's stuck up.

198
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:13,960
 Now, dear, Mother, you were standing right there in the school corridor before Latin,

199
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,960
 and I came along and I said, "Hello, Henry."

200
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,960
 You just went right on talking to Virginia Lee.

201
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:21,960
 Now, Kathleen, I'm sure Henry likes you, just as well as he likes Virginia Lee.

202
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,960
 Mother, I don't care whether he likes me. Whatever gave you an idea like that.

203
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,960
 Just a minute while I asked you to tell us what I'm...

204
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,960
 Well, I think you ought to make up with him.

205
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:29,960
 Hello?

206
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:30,960
 Hello, is this Kathleen?

207
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:37,960
 Yes. Well, Gee whiz I've been trying to get you ever since we were cut off. Who is this? This is still Charlie. Charlie who?

208
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:42,960
 Charlie Clark. Don't you remember? You were just going to tell me about what you thought of Henry.

209
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:52,960
 Oh, where are you falling from? White. From home. I see. Is your car worse? No. No. Don't you think Henry's in any sky though?

210
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:58,960
 No, just a minute. I've got to see who's at the front door. Don't hang up Charlie. I'll be right back.

211
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,960
 Hi Kathleen.

212
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,960
 Charlie, are you here already?

213
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,960
 Look, I want you to go to the phone.

214
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,960
 Who me? Well why? Who's on there?

215
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,960
 It's Charlie Clark.

216
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:08,960
 Who?

217
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,960
 Charlie, it isn't really Charlie. It's somebody that says he's you.

218
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,960
 And you know who I think it is?

219
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:13,960
 Who is it?

220
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,960
 I think it's Homer Brown.

221
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,960
 You know how he always sounds as though he had pneumonia?

222
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,960
 And he says he's me. Let me talk to him.

223
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:20,960
 Hello?

224
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,960
 Hello?

225
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:22,960
 Who is this?

226
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:23,960
 It's Charlie Clark.

227
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,960
 I mean, who is this?

228
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:26,960
 Charlie Clark.

229
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,960
 What? Who? Oh, Gee Whiz.

230
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:41,960
 Alice? Alice, are you home? Yes, Harriet.

231
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,960
 I found Alice. I found Alice.

232
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,960
 Really? What happened? You found out what?

233
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:49,960
 Why, Sam sent the roses. I knew there was something behind it all the time.

234
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,960
 What, Sam? I made out I was talking about something else.

235
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,560
 Then I just happened to say, "Those were nice roses, you sent Alice."

236
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,260
 And he said, "Did she like them?"

237
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:00,960
 And I said, "Damn, how'd you happen to send them?"

238
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,160
 And then Alice, then...

239
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:03,960
 What did he say?

240
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:04,960
 He hedged.

241
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,460
 He fought, he said, "You sent me, tell us I sent you some flowers."

242
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,060
 And then he changed the subject.

243
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:11,760
 Well, Harriet, what's wrong with that?

244
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:14,960
 Alice, sometimes I think I know Sam better than you do.

245
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,060
 Can't you see there's something behind it?

246
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,060
 Did he...

247
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:20,960
 Did he buy any chance mentioned next Sunday?

248
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,960
 Next Sunday?

249
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,560
 Harriet, we're supposed to go to a luncheon at the Tomkins.

250
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,520
 And Sam doesn't care much for the Tomkins,

251
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,600
 and I think he'd rather play golf.

252
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,960
 Alifacid, I could tell from the way he talked.

253
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,840
 No matter what I said to him, he just looked uncomfortable.

254
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,520
 He did.

255
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:37,120
 Mother, you have anything you could spare besides cookies?

256
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,600
 Henry, your mother and I are disgusting something.

257
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,080
 Good Aunt Harry, and Homer's upset,

258
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,600
 and I thought maybe a piece of pie or something could call him down.

259
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:47,200
 Henry, I'm sorry, but Homer is eating practically everything I had in this kitchen.

260
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,280
 Now please get out.

261
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,320
 Yes, Mother.

262
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,120
 Palmer!

263
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,320
 Listen, Henry, weren't you pleased to as I asked?

264
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,020
 No, Homer.

265
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:54,720
 Didn't I just do a favor for you?

266
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,420
 Sure.

267
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:55,720
 Sure.

268
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,620
 Look what happened.

269
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:57,820
 Well, could I help her?

270
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:00,820
 How was I to know Charlie Clark was going to be over at Kathleen's house?

271
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,020
 And that's another thing.

272
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:04,720
 Before you hung up, you should have asked you what right he had been there.

273
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,220
 Okay, Henry, okay.

274
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:08,720
 But Charlie said he was going to try to get even with me.

275
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,320
 Palmer, you mean you're afraid of him?

276
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,920
 No, I'm not afraid of him.

277
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,120
 But I'm asking you, Henry, like a gentleman,

278
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:17,520
 to go to the phone and call Charlie and tell him the whole thing was a joke.

279
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,720
 The two thought of.

280
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,220
 Didn't Kathleen tell you anything?

281
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,020
 About why?

282
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:22,720
 About why she won't speak to me?

283
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,720
 Henry, are you trying to change the subject?

284
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,720
 Homer!

285
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,220
 Homer!

286
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:27,220
 What's the matter?

287
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,220
 The candy store!

288
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,720
 I just happened to remember!

289
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,220
 Sure, it's the candy store!

290
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:33,220
 Cleaning your bloods and candy, Henry!

291
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:36,220
 Don't you realize Homer that I said "caffing a box of candy"?

292
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:38,220
 And she never even thanked me for him, so why?

293
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,720
 She probably didn't get it!

294
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,220
 That's why she isn't speaking to me!

295
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:42,720
 Listen, Homer!

296
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,220
 Will you go to the polling court and ask her what has she got?

297
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:46,220
 Oh no, Henry!

298
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:46,720
 Oh no!

299
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,160
 No, I'm not gonna get mixed up in anything more for you.

300
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,400
 Okay, then I know why I get the phone or prove.

301
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,320
 Never mind.

302
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,360
 I'm going downtown.

303
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,560
 Didn't you send a box to Virginia League, too?

304
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,840
 Sure I did, but Kathleen doesn't know I did.

305
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,120
 Come on, Homer.

306
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,760
 Okay, but where is it I'm following you to?

307
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,340
 (upbeat music)

308
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,740
 Hello there, Sam Ory.

309
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:18,740
 You are a bandist.

310
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:19,940
 Come in, come in.

311
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:22,240
 Well, I wondered what I'd find you here at the office.

312
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,240
 How are you?

313
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,540
 Fine. How's your wife and Cathy?

314
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,540
 It wouldn't be better.

315
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:30,040
 Sam, this isn't what I came in to talk to you about, but who are you sending flowers to?

316
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,840
 I saw you go into the porridge shop this morning.

317
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,840
 You can't get away with anything, Sam.

318
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:37,140
 Oh, I just happened to be going by the place.

319
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:39,740
 And it was a nice morning and I saw some roses in the window,

320
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,240
 so I decided to send some up to Alice.

321
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,740
 Oh, yes. You sure that's the only reason?

322
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,400
 Matter of fact, Alice is just a hurry.

323
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,240
 It asked me the same thing a little while ago.

324
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,540
 Well, now that I think of it, maybe I'll send some to Betty.

325
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:51,100
 Oh, well, here's what I want to ask you, Sam.

326
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,940
 How about a little golf next Sunday afternoon?

327
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:53,740
 I can't, Bob.

328
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:55,140
 I have to go to that lunch with my wife.

329
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:55,940
 Next Sunday?

330
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:57,440
 Is that lunch your next Sunday?

331
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,240
 Sam, how did I happen to forget that?

332
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,740
 How about I skipping that lunch?

333
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:01,340
 No, Bob.

334
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,140
 I promised out it.

335
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:03,240
 No, I can't do that.

336
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:12,640
 Hello?

337
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,640
 Hello?

338
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,480
 Hello.

339
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,680
 Is this Kathleen Anderson?

340
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,280
 Yeah.

341
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,880
 Now this is Johnson's Candy Kitchen.

342
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,400
 A young fellow was in here a while ago.

343
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:22,120
 He wanted me to call you and ask whether you got that box of candy.

344
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,120
 What box of candy?

345
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,560
 Senator, you were housed, didn't you get it?

346
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,680
 Oh yeah, I thought that it was the change of a heart.

347
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,180
 Yeah.

348
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:29,600
 I never knew what sounded, but what many cars in it?

349
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,320
 Well, let's see.

350
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,880
 He said his name was--

351
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,360
 His name was--

352
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,200
 How do you know about that?

353
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,360
 I don't seem to remember it.

354
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,480
 Can't you tell me where he looked like?

355
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,960
 Well, I guess he came up to about here on me,

356
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,600
 and he looked awfully worried.

357
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,400
 He did?

358
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,800
 As a matter of fact, when his name had been all rich...

359
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,320
 - Or it was Henry Otter. - Yeah, yeah, that was it.

360
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:50,400
 - Really? Honestly, did Henry send me that ball to Charlie?

361
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,200
 - Yeah. - I got it, did you do this?

362
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,800
 Well, why have I only known that?

363
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,000
 Well, why, I guess you don't know who that's in your ball.

364
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,200
 And why you're on the phone?

365
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,200
 Could you tell me if the other girl got hers?

366
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,800
 - What's wrong? - And he sent the same kind of a box

367
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,600
 to somebody by the name of Virginia Lee.

368
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,200
 I wondered whether you knew whether she got it.

369
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,400
 - Who's telling that one to... - Henry sent one to...

370
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,600
 Yeah, do you know whether she got it?

371
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,200
 Well, I really couldn't say.

 I, uh, I was just wondering...

379
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,200
 Well, maybe it was just my imagination.

380
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:44,280
 My father nothing nothing when I spoke to her I guess you didn't hear me

 I'm coming home

382
00:12:53,560 --> 00:13:02,200
 Boy, oh boy was that a coast cool. You know who just chased me up the street through Charlie Clark

 Why do you think he was carrying the hockey stick?

 No, I'm not when my father said the first time I get into another fight no matter who's fault it is

385

 I get my allowance cut off for a month. Why I don't know why I guess it's just been too much fighting in our family

386

 Well listen Homer. I just talked to doc whose candy kitchen and everything's okay. What do you mean?

 Well, she didn't know I said it. Oh boy. Can we oh boy? Is that Charlie at the door?

 It is? Well look at me. I think I'll step into the living room

389

 Henry, let me in. Who is it? Who do you think? I don't want to come out here now listen, Charlie

 You get away from here. Go on. Why should I?

 Why, Mrs. Aldrich? Is there anybody in the front hall?

 When I saw you in the kitchen, you didn't mention them, and I thought they were happy.

419
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:36,760
 I am the only reason I didn't mention them was because I was trying to get dinner started.

 Wrong? Wrong, Alice?

00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,760
 Yes, Sam, because if there is, you might just as well come out and tell me and get it off your mind.

00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,260
 Alice, I don't even know what you're talking about.

 Harriet?

 Why don't you not tell Harriet anything?

 Well, Sam, if you can't remember, I'm certainly not going to remind you.

468
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:08,280
 that I kissed her at her party last night, are totally unfounded.

00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:57,800
 Now getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldrich.

541
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:02,800
 Henry has been spending the day trying to find out why Kathleen won't speak to him.

542
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:09,800
 Hoping to get some information on the subject, Homer Fonda trying to disguise his voice as Charlie Clark,

543
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:13,800
 just as Charlie Clark walked into Kathleen's house.

544
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:17,800
 The scene opens several hours later in the Aldrich living room.

545
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,800
 That's not a Henry.

546
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,800
 Nothing, Father. Nothing.

547
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,800
 You quite sure everything's the way it should be?

548
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,200
 She was what he asked that.

549
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,600
 No, it's not just happened to notice a dinner.

550
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,200
 You did need a great deal and I wondered.

551
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:33,400
 No, as a matter of fact, you didn't seem to eat much either, Father.

552
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,800
 I simply wasn't hungry.

553
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:37,200
 Well, look, could you tell me something?

554
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,400
 I'll try to.

555
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,400
 Naturally, everything's going fine for you and Mother now.

556
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,800
 But you're married.

557
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,800
 That's that?

558
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:49,200
 But before you were married, I mean, have girls always been as much trouble as they are now?

559
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,400
 That would be a matter of personal opinion.

560
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:54,400
 Well, when they are, what do you do?

561
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:59,400
 Why, you take the bulb of the horns and find out what's the matter and sort of talk it out.

562
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,400
 And then everything's alright.

563
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,400
 Is that what you always do?

564
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,400
 Well, yes, in a way.

565
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,400
 See, that's what I've tried. I've owned Kathleen a couple of times, Father.

566
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,400
 Morninger isn't going to do any good. Go on over and see her.

567
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,400
 Do you think I should?

568
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:14,400
 The only way to get together is to get together.

569
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,400
 It is? Where's Mother?

570
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,400
 Why, I think she's reading the paper in the dining room.

571
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:24,360
 She is well, you know, maybe I'll take your advice does this suit look alright?

572
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:27,040
 I mean to go out in it looks fine boy

573
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:32,640
 I wonder if mother's mind if I took Kathleen one of those roses, but sad well the only reason I suggested is because

574
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,640
 Sometimes a flower sort of straightens everything out. Well don't take one of those

575
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:43,060
 They hear 15 cents stopping at the floor is on the way and start from scratch. What's that nothing? Go see who's on the phone

576
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:46,720
 You know father. I'm just gonna walk right over there, and if she walks see me

577
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,920
 I'm gonna tell Mr. Anderson how unreasonable she is because he always seems to like me

578
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:56,480
 Hello, oh, it's Henry orch there. Yes, this is Henry. Who's that? This is

579
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:03,600

00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:07,120
 Oh, she was I was just speaking of you, Mr. Anderson. How are you?

00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,320
 Well, I have an appointment. I mean what's on?

582
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:14,680
 I don't want any more of this here nonsense in the future. I want you to stop bothering Kathleen. Do you hear me?

583
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:20,360
 I've been bothering her. I don't want to see you with an even a block of this house. Do you hear me? Well look mr.

584
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:28,000
 Anderson is this mr. Anderson sure is this Henry language? Yes only gee was you mean I can't see Kathleen at all

585
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,720
 She'd much rather see other fellas like Charlie Clark now

 There's a young man with something to it, but gee mr. Anderson Henry. Oh, yes mother of just a minute mr.

 To begin with, what are you doing Sunday afternoon?

598
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:00,860
 Were you and Mr. Aldrich planning to do something Sunday afternoon?

599
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:01,860
 Well, I...

600
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:02,860
 You were planning to play golf, weren't you?

601
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:03,860
 Well, I...

602
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:04,860
 You admit it, don't you?

603
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:05,860
 Yes, I guess so.

604
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:07,860
 That's exactly what I thought.

605
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:08,860
 And that's all I wanted to know.

606
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:10,860
 And I'd like to say this.

607
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:14,160
 If you and Sam didn't want to go to that luncheon with Mrs. Anderson and me,

608
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,960
 you needn't have each beaten around the bush by sending us flowers.

620
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,360
 we wouldn't let you.

 Don't ask me, Henry, you've come to the wrong man.

 You mean a case like that is sort of unusual?

 Well, I can't tell me not to tell you to get her,

 Now, I can't make out whether she doesn't like that time.

 at that time, or whether she thinks her should have been more of one or more.
