2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 And now the Jell-O family presents...

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,500
 Henry... Henry O'GRAE!

4
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,000
 Coming, Mother!

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 [Applause]

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 Yes, it's the O'GRAE family based on characters

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,820
 originated by Clifford Goldsmith and starring Ezra Stone as Henry with Jackie

8
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:36,960
 Pelka's home. And yes it's the Jell-O family with its three famous desserts.

9
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,400
 Jell-O in those six delicious flavors regular Jell-O puddings with that old

10
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:48,100
 fashioned homemade flavor and Jell-O tapioca puddings. A miracle of goodness, a

11
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:50,100
 A Marvel of Speed

12
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:55,100
 Everyone's a Jello Goodfellow

13
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:58,100
 A very good Jello Goodfellow

14
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,100
 So rich, so tempting and mellow

15
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:05,100
 J-E-L-L-O

16
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:08,100
 And now for the Aldridge Family

17
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:20,820
 [Music]

18
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:27,060
 117 Elm Street Centerville is your own house or the house on the next block

19
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:30,500
 or that house right around the corner in your memories.

20
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:36,980
 And the important person in and out of it is always a typical teenage boy like Henry Aldrich.

21
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:39,820
 The scene opens at the Aldrich breakfast table.

22
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:41,340
 It is Saturday morning.

23
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,300
 - How long has we have to? - Now, Sam.

24
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:44,980
 - Started out to be such a nice day.

25
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:47,820
 The air is brisk, the sun is shining.

26
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:51,340
 Why ruin it by discussing Henry's report card.

27
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:52,940
 - But do you have you seen it?

28
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:54,020
 - I signed it.

29
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:55,500
 - But have you seen it?

30
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,300
 - You don't think I signed Henry's report card

31
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,660
 with my eyes closed, do you?

32
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,740
 - Yes.

33
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:00,580
 - How old?

34
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:01,420
 - If you looked at it,

35
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:03,340
 you'd certainly be more upset.

36
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:06,580
 And I'm sure we ought to have his basal metabolism taken.

37
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:07,420
 - That's why.

38
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:08,940
 - His basal metabolism, Sam,

39
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,300
 it's at the bottom of a lot of things these days.

40
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,260
 (audience laughs)

41
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:13,420
 - Not report cards.

42
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:14,820
 Alice, there's nothing wrong with Henry

43
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,500
 that some hard work won't cure.

44
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,500
 You just got to learn to stop procrastinating

45
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,340
 and buckle down.

46
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:20,340
 - That's right, dear,

47
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,260
 and I think you should speak to him about it.

48
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,980
 - Yes, Alice, I will.

49
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:24,900
 Tomorrow.

50
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,220
 - Why can't you do it today?

51
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,740
 - Alice, the sun is shining, the air is brisk,

52
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:31,740
 and it's Saturday, Henry's day of rest.

53
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:33,780
 - Sam Aldrich, if you ask me you could do

54
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,540
 with a little buckling down yourself.

55
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:42,340
 Henry yes mother come in here please and dear if he has any homework I think you should do it right now

56
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:48,740
 You were calling on my mother yes dear father has something to say to you he has oh boy

57
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:56,580
 I'll answer the phone yes father Henry Henry what I want to say is yes

58
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:02,180
 what I want to say father if it's going out of your head I don't mind dropping the whole thing

59
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:04,180
 until it comes back.

60
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:06,180
 I haven't forgotten Henry. Sit down.

61
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:09,180
 Sit down? But father, yes, father. I'm sad.

62
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:11,180
 I mean, sit. They're the seated.

63
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:14,180
 Henry, your mother and I have just been discussing your report card.

64
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:18,180
 You have? On a nice day like this?

65
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:20,180
 I had the same reaction.

66
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:24,180
 Henry, don't you think it's about time you buckle down and started to worry about your schoolwork?

67
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,180
 Gee, I do worry about it, Father.

68
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:29,180
 You do? I give you my word. There's nothing I worry about more.

69
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,180
 I'm glad to hear that.

70
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:34,180
 But I'd be glad to do a little extra worrying if it would ease your mind.

71
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:39,020
 That's very cooperative of you, Henry, but there's one method we ought to try first.

72
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,580
 There is what?

73
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:41,580
 Work.

74
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:42,580
 Work?

75
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:43,580
 Yes.

76
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:47,540
 Father, when you say work, how do you mean that?

77
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:48,740
 Just the way it sounds.

78
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:50,420
 Good, hard, industrious effort.

79
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:53,700
 I want you to buckle down and really put your mind to your study.

80
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,700
 Yes, sir.

81
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:57,140
 Now, what homework do you have this weekend?

82
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,140
 This weekend?

83
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:01,900
 Well, gee, that's a wonderful part, Father. I practically don't have any at all.

84
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,100
 Not at all?

85
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:06,500
 Well, just a few simple geometry problems.

86
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,900
 And gee whiz, I cannot close off in five minutes.

87
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:11,980
 Good! Suppose you take five minutes right now and start knocking.

88
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,780
 Yeah, what?

89
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:17,580
 But Father, when I said five minutes, I was thinking of five minutes Monday morning

90
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:20,420
 when my brain will have a whole weekend's rest.

91
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:24,220
 Henry, your mother and I have taken all the procrastinating we're going to.

92
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:26,660
 You're not to leave the house until your geometry is done.

93
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:27,980
 But Father, is that clear?

94
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:28,820
 Yes, sir.

95
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:31,460
 Sam, could I speak to you out here in the hall?

96
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:32,700
 Yes, Alice.

97
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:33,580
 I'll get to work, Henry.

98
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:34,860
 Yes, Father.

99
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:38,100
 But I'm really much better at homework on Monday morning.

100
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:41,460
 Sam, you didn't tell him to do his homework now, did you?

101
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:42,420
 Yes, why?

102
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:43,700
 That was Homer on the phone,

103
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,860
 and I'm afraid we'd made a terrible mistake.

104
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:46,700
 In what way?

105
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:49,100
 He's on his way over here.

106
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:52,380
 Alice, I'm afraid that's a mistake we can no longer avoid.

107
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:53,820
 Here you don't understand.

108
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,900
 We didn't realize that the boys have a date

109
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:58,580
 to go ice skating with Kathleen and Agnes.

110
00:04:58,580 --> 00:04:59,860
 So wouldn't it be just as well

111
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,740
 if he did his homework Sunday evening?

112
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:04,380
 - Alice, after I ordered him to do it now.

113
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:07,380
 - But Sam, this is Saturday, his day of rest.

114
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,740
 - Suppose I do this, Alice.

115
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:10,980
 Suppose I help him.

116
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:11,980
 - You will?

117
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:13,660
 Well, that might help.

118
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:14,780
 But nevertheless, dear,

119
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:17,180
 I'm certainly going to write a note to Mr. Bradley.

120
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:18,580
 - Henry's principal, why?

121
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:20,260
 - Sam, they have no right to ruin

122
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:22,580
 a boy's entire weekend this way,

123
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:25,620
 especially on the last good ice skating day of the year.

124
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:26,620
 Oh, Alice.

125
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:27,820
 So will you answer that, dear?

126
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,020
 I'm on the stove.

127
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:31,920
 Hello.

128
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,660
 Hello, Sam.

129
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:33,520
 This is Will Brown.

130
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,120
 Yes, Will.

131
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,580
 Sam, I just looked outdoors, and it's a wonderful day.

132
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:37,500
 Yes, isn't it?

133
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,620
 The sun is shining.

134
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:40,420
 There's a don't snap in the air.

135
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:42,820
 And I thought, why stay cooped up in the house?

136
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:45,920
 Why not call good old Sam and spend the afternoon bowling?

137
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,620
 Bowling?

138
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:47,320
 Why not?

139
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,060
 You mean, why be cooped up in the house

140
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:51,320
 when you can be cooped up in the bowling alley?

141
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,220
 But Sam, I have to get out of the house.

142
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,220
 Elizabeth's trying to get me to shellac the dining room

143
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:59,980
 Shall I get sure that's her favorite indoor sport trying to get me to shellac

144
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:05,780
 So what do you say aren't you in the mood to bowl Sam? Oh, I'm in the mood all right good

145
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:11,540
 Then suppose you pick me up right away. Well, I'll tell you there's a little matter. I have to clean up first

146
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:19,360
 You mean Alice has stuck you with some job. No, no, no, it's just just well. It's nothing. I can't finish in five minutes

147
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,700
 Okay, I'll be waiting for you so long Sam. Goodbye, Will

148
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:23,100
 - Hey, Ray.

149
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:26,500
 - I'm in the dining room, Father, buckling down on my homework.

150
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,340
 - Good.

151
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:29,780
 - Gee, Father, mother told me about your helping me,

152
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:31,940
 and boy, I certainly appreciate it.

153
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:32,780
 - That's quite all right.

154
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:33,620
 Now let's get started.

155
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:34,620
 - Hey, Henry.

156
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,020
 (audience laughing)

157
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,260
 - Gee.

158
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:39,100
 - Sounds like Homer.

159
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,660
 - Doesn't sound like anyone else.

160
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:45,340
 - Hi, him, hi, Mr. Old, which boy, what a day, what a day.

161
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:48,140
 (audience laughing)

162
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:48,980
 - Homer.

163
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,660
 - Is that an apple in that food bowl?

164
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,100
 - Homer, don't bite it.

165
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,100
 It's wax.

166
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,300
 It is.

167
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,780
 Boy, what a day.

168
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:57,380
 Come on, Henry, let's go.

169
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:58,220
 Let's go?

170
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:59,900
 Sure, are we meeting the girls at 12?

171
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:02,820
 Well, first, Homer, there's a little matter, my father,

172
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,460
 and I have to get out of the way.

173
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:05,460
 What a little matter.

174
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:07,100
 My geometry homework.

175
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,460
 You're gonna do that now?

176
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,820
 What'll you do Monday during lunch?

177
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,180
 (audience laughing)

178
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:13,820
 Homer, the fewer interruptions we have,

179
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:14,780
 the quicker we'll finish.

180
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:16,740
 So would you please sit quietly in the corner?

181
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:17,700
 Yes, sir.

182
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:18,540
 Now, Henry.

183
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:20,260
 Henry, did I tell you about that trick,

184
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:21,660
 Agnes and I worked out?

185
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:22,500
 Homer, if--

186
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,620
 We're skating along gracefully, see?

187
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,980
 And then all of a sudden, she grabs me by the wrist

188
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,140
 and throws me over a shoulder.

189
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:29,980
 Homer, I--

190
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:32,980
 And when I come down there, she is to grab me again.

191
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:33,820
 Homer?

192
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,340
 Yes, Mr. Olridge.

193
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,460
 I'll shut up.

194
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:38,380
 Good.

195
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:38,880
 Now--

196
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,820
 Is that banana wax, too?

197
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,100
 It is.

198
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:44,740
 Oh, the pear, too?

199
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:47,460
 Homer, I'm sure Mrs. Olridge must have something edible

200
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:48,300
 in the kitchen.

201
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:48,900
 Yes, sir.

202
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,460
 You don't mind my leaving?

203
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:51,420
 Not a bit.

204
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:53,180
 You won't be long, will you, hand?

205
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:56,740
 No, Gee, if we buckle down, we'll be through in no time.

206
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:58,700
 Henry, how many problems have you done so far?

207
00:07:58,700 --> 00:07:59,940
 How many?

208
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:03,940
 Well, there's one in particular I'm sort of stuck on.

209
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:04,440
 Which one?

210
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,260
 The first.

211
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:07,780
 I see.

212
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:09,140
 Well, let's get to work on it.

213
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:09,860
 Yes, sir.

214
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:12,460
 Just as soon as I get this lampshade fixed.

215
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:13,380
 What's wrong with it?

216
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:15,780
 Well, Gee, was-- did you ever notice how it tilts?

217
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:17,740
 Boy, you can hardly concentrate.

218
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:18,580
 Excuse me.

219
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:19,340
 Where are you going?

220
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:21,980
 get a pair of pliers so we can work with a free mind.

221
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:22,980
 - And reset down.

222
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:23,820
 - Yes.

223
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:25,700
 - You'll never get anywhere if you keep on procrastinated.

224
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:26,540
 - Yes.

225
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:29,300
 - Now, what's the problem you're stuck on?

226
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:33,860
 - A farmer gray has a field that is 900 feet on one side,

227
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:36,340
 800 feet on the parallel side,

228
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:38,820
 and the remaining sides are 100 feet each.

229
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:42,700
 If the field is in the shape of a trapezoid,

230
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,100
 what is the area?

231
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,940
 - Henry, that can't be right.

232
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:50,800
 But I copied it right off the blackboard, Phon.

233
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,620
 The field is in the shape of a what?

234
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:53,780
 Trapezoid.

235
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:54,700
 Oh.

236
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,700
 Oh, trapezoid.

237
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,180
 Well, that shouldn't be hard.

238
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,420
 Do you have your pencil, Henry?

239
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:00,260
 Yes, sir.

240
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:01,180
 And your ruler and your paper?

241
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,020
 Yes, sir.

242
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:05,620
 All right, can Henry now first tell me what is a trapezoid?

243
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:09,740
 What is it?

244
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:11,500
 Well, Henry, you can't expect to find the area

245
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,540
 unless you know what it is.

246
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:15,780
 But, Father, that's the whole thing.

247
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:19,380
 I don't even remember Ms. Bennett ever even mentioning trapezoids.

248
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:22,780
 I can't. Do we have a nutcracker on you?

249
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:24,980
 A nutcracker?

250
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:28,480
 All your mother had to eat that wasn't in a can with these walnuts.

251
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,080
 Homer, you'll find my hammer in the basement.

252
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,080
 Yes, sir.

253
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,080
 Henry, do you think you'll be through by the time I'm all cracked?

254
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:39,180
 Homer, just run along.

255
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:41,380
 Yes, Mr. All, which I'll leave you alone.

256
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,680
 Let's hurry, Henry. Suppose you look up trapezoids.

257
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,480
 Where's your math book?

258
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,340
 Why, in my lunchbox.

259
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:47,460
 - You're having it for lunch?

260
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:49,660
 - No, sorry, I put it in there so I'd be sure not

261
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:51,580
 to forget to bring the book home from school.

262
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:52,420
 - Well, please get it.

263
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:54,720
 - Well, that's just it, I forgot my lunchbox.

264
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,720
 (audience laughs)

265
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,260
 - You don't have a book at all?

266
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:58,100
 - No, sir.

267
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:01,300
 So couldn't you just tell me what a trapezoid is?

268
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,900
 - A trapezoid, of course.

269
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:07,100
 Now, as I remember it, a trapezoid is a sort of...

270
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:11,540
 - Yes, Father?

271
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:14,300
 - Henry, you'll never learn by my telling you.

272
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,940
 The thing for you to do is look it up.

273
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,180
 But we're fathers.

274
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:19,580
 Doesn't Homer have a geometry book?

275
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:21,180
 Sure, but it's probably in his house.

276
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,180
 Well, ask him to get it.

277
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:22,700
 But fine.

278
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:23,700
 And please hurry, Henry.

279
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:26,340
 A certain gentleman is waiting for me on a very urgent matter.

280
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:37,060
 Hello.

281
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:38,380
 Elizabeth, this is Alice.

282
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:39,660
 Oh, hello, Alice.

283
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:42,100
 Elizabeth, I'm writing a letter to Mr. Bradley.

284
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,820
 And I wondered if you'd be interested in signing it too.

285
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,500
 What sort of a letter, Alice?

286
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,180
 About the amount of homework they give the boys.

287
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:52,780
 I say, "Dear Mr. Bradley, as one of your mothers,

288
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:56,100
 I am deeply concerned about my son's weekend."

289
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,540
 Henry has homework over the weekend?

290
00:10:58,540 --> 00:10:59,280
 Yes.

291
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,780
 Well, isn't Homer lucky?

292
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:02,500
 He never has any.

293
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,860
 But are he and Henry in the same class?

294
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:05,540
 That's true.

295
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:06,420
 They are.

296
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:07,940
 He must have homework.

297
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:09,060
 I should think so.

298
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:11,780
 You know what Homer's trouble is he takes after will.

299
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:13,380
 Always putting things off.

300
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:14,220
 - He does?

301
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:16,500
 - Alice, I'd hate to tell you how long I've been after Will

302
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,620
 to shellac my dining room floor.

303
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:19,820
 I asked him this morning and he said

304
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,580
 he's going bowling with Sam.

305
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,580
 - Sam?

306
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:23,980
 Sam's going bowling?

307
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:25,100
 - Isn't he?

308
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:28,540
 - Well, right now he's working on a trapezoid with Henry.

309
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:30,900
 - You don't say?

310
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:31,740
 Well...

311
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:32,580
 - Elizabeth.

312
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:33,400
 - Oh my goodness, it's Will.

313
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,980
 I better hang up before he gets away.

314
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,220
 - All right, goodbye Elizabeth.

315
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:37,060
 - Goodbye.

316
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:38,460
 Will, I'd like to speak to you.

317
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:40,340
 - Elizabeth, I've never seen my bowling shoes.

318
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:43,060
 You're bowling shoes, they're in my broom closet.

319
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:44,260
 What are they doing there?

320
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:47,220
 They're so comfortable to do housework in.

321
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,140
 Elizabeth.

322
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:51,020
 And anyway, Will Brown, you won't need them.

323
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:51,700
 Why not?

324
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:54,580
 If Sam Aldrich can fix Alice's trapezoid,

325
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:57,220
 you can survive your life.

326
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,420
 Thanks, her wife.

327
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:01,020
 Oh, don't stand around asking questions.

328
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:01,980
 Suppose you stop.

329
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:04,620
 But Elizabeth, it's too humid to show up.

330
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:07,380
 You used the same excuse in July.

331
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:08,660
 But Elizabeth--

332
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:09,740
 Will Brown.

333
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:12,640
 How would you like to have sweet breads for dinner?

334
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,440
 Every day from now on.

335
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,940
 Sweet breads.

336
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:16,780
 Elizabeth.

337
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:19,460
 Glad you're going to get them if that floor isn't done today.

338
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,300
 But Sam will be here any minute.

339
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:21,820
 Hi, man.

340
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:22,820
 Elizabeth.

341
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:25,140
 Father, have you seen my geometry book anywhere?

342
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:26,020
 Where did you put it?

343
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,500
 I don't remember.

344
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,700
 I always put things like that right out of my mind

345
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,620
 as soon as I get home on Friday.

346
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,060
 Well, I haven't seen it.

347
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:33,580
 And Homer--

348
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:34,980
 Well, there it is on the hall table.

349
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:35,420
 Excuse me.

350
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:36,860
 Oh, wait a minute, Homer.

351
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:39,380
 Didn't you promise to help me shellac the dining room floor?

352
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:42,100
 Sure. When the time came, then she couldn't get out of it.

353
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,380
 Well, the time has come.

354
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:45,060
 Look at the brushes and let's start.

355
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:45,560
 What fun?

356
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,540
 Homer starts shellacking and shut up.

357
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:58,420
 Henry, go back and look through that encyclopedia again.

358
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:03,780
 Gee, was father. I did four times, and I give him my word trapezoids, nowhere in there.

359
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:06,260
 Henry, it must be everything's in the encyclopedia.

360
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:09,860
 But it isn't. It goes from Tripani to trap shooting.

361
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:14,060
 Oh, I know. Remember when little cousin Bertram visited us last summer?

362
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:14,960
 What about him?

363
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:19,060
 Boy, if there was one thing he liked to do, it was cut pictures out of books.

364
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:21,760
 You suppose he took trapezoids with him?

365
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,960
 That's a fine thing. Let me at that full.

366
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,160
 Father, who are you calling?

367
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,860
 Mr. Cleary, my accountant.

368
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:29,260
 And find out once and for all what a trapezoid is.

369
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:30,260
 Number two.

370
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:32,460
 Elma, 494.

371
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:34,260
 Do you think Mr. Cleary can help us?

372
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:38,500
 He can't know one can. I've never seen anyone who could do the things with figures that he can.

373
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,220
 Hello?

374
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:41,140
 Oh, hello, Mr. Cleary. This is our all-rich.

375
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:43,600
 Why, hello, Mr. All-rich. I've been trying to get you all week.

376
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,760
 Every time I call your office, you're in conference.

377
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,740
 Oh, yes. We don't have too much time left to get your books in order.

378
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:51,800
 Yes, I know, and I'm very anxious to have them out of the way, naturally.

379
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,580
 You are good, I'll have you right over.

380
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:54,100
 What?

381
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,540
 All I have to do is get your books together and sharpen my pants.

382
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:57,340
 But, Mr. Cleary...

383
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:01,340
 I don't usually work on Saturdays, but if we buckle down, we should be through in two or three hours.

384
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,260
 Two or three?

385
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:02,920
 Goodbye.

386
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:09,920
 Mr. Cleary, come back. Mr. Cleary, I don't have time to. Mr. Cleary, I'm in conference.

387
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:26,720
 And now it's time to listen to someone who actually is in conference. Meredith Wilson and his talking people.

388
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,580
 on-track on-track

389
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:32,260
 the sirs at best names

390
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:34,260
 on-track on just a moment here

391
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:35,240
 on-track

392
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,980
 that's french for intermission

393
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:41,180
 on time no it is but what has all your glamorous french got to do with henry

394
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,380
 all rich and his trapezoid

395
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:46,420
 we're the intervention on the all rich family program

396
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:47,720
 no yes

397
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,780
 sponsored by the jello family

398
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:52,820
 world's most glamorous desserts

399
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:53,820
 all i see

400
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:58,140
 there's glamour in the shimmer of jello six delicious flavors starting with

401
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:03,140
 Strawberry Eewee, cherry Eewee, orange! Love it to you!

402
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:09,140
 Ah, those shimmering flavors are rich with locked-in flavor!

403
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:11,140
 J-E-L-L-O-O!

404
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:15,140
 And Jell-O's locked-in flavor can't get out until your first tempting spoonful.

405
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:17,140
 Now that's why it tastes so good.

406
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:20,140
 It makes you think of the real ripe fruit itself.

407
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:23,140
 And don't forget those big red letters that spell Jell-O,

408
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:26,140
 also stand for the entire Jell-O family of desserts!

409
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:43,140
 [Music]

410
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:45,140
 And now back to the Aldrich family.

411
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:53,140
 [Music]

412
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:56,900
 Yes, getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldrich.

413
00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:00,840
 After Mr. Aldrich had made a date to go bowling with Will Brown,

414
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:05,640
 Mrs. Aldrich and vaguely meant to helping Henry with his geometry homework.

415
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:11,140
 This inspired Mrs. Brown to insist that her husband get to work shellacking the floor.

416
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:13,640
 The scene opens in the Brown's dining room.

417
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,540
 It is later the same day.

418
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:18,340
 Homer, that's the oldest mistake in the world.

419
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:22,540
 But Father, I thought you were leaving him down at your inn for us to get out.

420
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:24,540
 You thought I was leaving you.

421
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:29,540
 Now we're stuck in the middle of the dining room floor, surrounded by wet shellac.

422
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:30,540
 What are we gonna do?

423
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:32,540
 Keep quiet, I'm thinking.

424
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:33,540
 Yes, sir.

425
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:37,540
 And do you have to keep staring me in the face?

426
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:39,540
 Father, where else can I stare?

427
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,540
 Elizabeth!

428
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:43,540
 Why are you calling Mother?

429
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:46,540
 Homer, I have a very important appointment with a certain gentleman.

430
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:47,540
 Elizabeth!

431
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:50,540
 Well, do you have to shout all of...

432
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:51,540
 Well...

433
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:53,540
 Well, what?

434
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:55,540
 Well, wouldn't you know it?

435
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:59,540
 Elizabeth, let's be constructive. Get us out of here.

436
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:02,540
 Here, I'm afraid you'll have to stay there until the chill act drives.

437
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:03,540
 What?

438
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,540
 And why are you there, Homer?

439
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:07,540
 Mother, what are you getting out there in the hall?

440
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:09,040
 Your geometry book.

441
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:09,540
 What?

442
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,040
 Here, catch.

443
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,040
 Oops.

444
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,540
 If Henry can do his homework, you can do yours.

445
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:16,540
 But Elizabeth, what about me?

446
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:18,040
 You can help Homer.

447
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,040
 Help Homer.

448
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,040
 Father?

449
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:23,040
 Gee whiz mother have a heart.

450
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:33,540
 Do you see it Henry?

451
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:36,040
 Could you boost me higher Father?

452
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:39,040
 There is it all that top shelf?

453
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,040
 No Father.

454
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,040
 Well...

455
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,040
 That's a fine thing.

456
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,040
 I was positive I saw it out here in the garage.

457
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:49,040
 Gee whiz father what good is a mechanics handbook at a time like this?

458
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,760
 It might cover trapezoid.

459
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,960
 But Father, do you realize it's past 12?

460
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:53,860
 I realize it, Henry.

461
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:55,760
 I realize it very well.

462
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,120
 And we're not going to waste any more time.

463
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,560
 What's the name of your math teacher?

464
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,520
 Mespenant, why?

465
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,120
 We're going straight over to her house

466
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:01,880
 and ask for help.

467
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:02,680
 Mespenant?

468
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,680
 Do you think that's why?

469
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,280
 Why?

470
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,920
 I mean, asking her to see me on a weekend,

471
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:10,680
 considering what she goes through all week.

472
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,200
 Henry, come along.

473
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,040
 Hey!

474
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,000
 Back on the garage, Henry.

475
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,500
 Quick!

476
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,200
 Mr. Albright!

477
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,360
 Father, what's wrong?

478
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,360
 Sam, are you out, Mary Beth?

479
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,860
 It gets his hands on me, I'll be trapped for the rest of the day.

480
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:22,360
 And they get behind the car.

481
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,360
 Sam!

482
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,360
 Mr. Olgrich!

483
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,360
 Okay, keep down.

484
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,360
 Sam!

485
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:31,360
 I'm afraid he isn't out here, Mr. Cleary.

486
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:35,360
 That's strange. He told me he was very anxious to get those books audited.

487
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:39,360
 Mr. Cleary, you don't submit Posey meant for you to meet him at his office, do you?

488
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,360
 You think so?

489
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,360
 Perhaps you ought to drive down there.

490
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,360
 Perhaps I'd better.

491
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,360
 Let me close those garage doors for you.

492
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:51,160
 Mr. Cleary, you didn't snap the padlock, did you?

493
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,160
 Yes, why?

494
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:57,960
 Well, it's just that the locks got terribly rusty and Mr. Aldridge keeps putting off oiling it.

495
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:01,160
 One of these days we're not going to be able to get it open at all.

496
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:15,360
 No, Gus, I don't have a bitter junk for you today.

497
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:19,660
 "Junk? Oh, didn't you hear Miss Brown? I'm out of the junk business."

498
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:20,700
 "Oh, you are?"

499
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,260
 "Yeah, Sheila Mahash, she gave up the ghost."

500
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:24,260
 "She died?"

501
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:28,060
 "No, no, retired. Moved out to the country with some relative."

502
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:31,260
 "Yeah, I got a card from her just the other day."

503
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:32,960
 "She'd gained eight pounds."

504
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:33,960
 "A card?"

505
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,060
 "Well, written by a friend, actually."

506
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:39,760
 "Yeah, they say she's starting to eat like a horse again."

507
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:43,660
 "You need any exterminating Miss Brown?"

508
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:44,860
 "Do I need what?"

509
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:48,180
 exterminating. That's my new line. Need any?

510
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:50,620
 Well, none that I think you could handle.

511
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:53,980
 Gus, do you know anything about carpentry?

512
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:56,540
 Carpentry. Yes, sir, above.

513
00:19:56,540 --> 00:20:00,020
 I made a nice living at it back in '19, '07.

514
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:00,900
 You did?

515
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,460
 Or was it '08?

516
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:03,540
 Gus, could you?

517
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:06,020
 No, no, it was '07, all right.

518
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:11,060
 I remember because William Jennings, or was it 'At Five'?

519
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:12,980
 Gus, the point is,

520
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:15,380
 Do you know anything about trapezoids?

521
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,980
 Yeah. Trapezoids.

522
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:20,280
 I just found home a geometry teacher and she's gone skating.

523
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,080
 Well, what size trapezoids?

524
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,680
 Hmm. Right.

525
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,980
 Oh, any size?

526
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:25,980
 Any size?

527
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:28,980
 Miss Brown, you can't build a thing like a trapezoid any size.

528
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,280
 We're not going to build it.

529
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,280
 No.

530
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,280
 And what do you want the carbon to form?

531
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,780
 Oh, excuse me, Gus. That's my phone.

532
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:38,580
 Oh, I see an ant here in the corner of the porch.

533
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:40,080
 Of course I just give him a squirt, that's...

534
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,080
 Don't bother.

535
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,080
 It'll be on the house, Michael.

536
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,080
 [DING]

537
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,080
 Hello.

538
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,800
 And listen, but this is Alice.

539
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,880
 Is Will there?

540
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:48,880
 Why, yes, Alice.

541
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,320
 Only could you send him over to our house right away.

542
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,320
 But he's still in the middle of his shellac.

543
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,080
 What?

544
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,200
 Alice, what's wrong?

545
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,720
 Our car seems to have a short circuit in the horn.

546
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,280
 It just keeps blowing and blowing.

547
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,280
 Oh, my.

548
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,800
 And it's locked in the garage, and Sam's disappeared.

549
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:03,960
 Alice, Gus is here.

550
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,240
 Now I'll send him over.

551
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,560
 Would you thank you, Elizabeth.

552
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,040
 Goodbye.

553
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:07,880
 Goodbye.

554
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:08,880
 Gus.

555
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,520
 Oh, God.

556
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,960
 I got him, Miss Brown, clean his whistle.

557
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:12,960
 Gus, could you?

558
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,880
 And about that trapezoid.

559
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,560
 Wouldn't you say they was too dangerous to have around anyway?

560
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:22,000
 I saw a man fall off one in the circus one time.

561
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 [LAUGHTER]

562
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:23,560
 I'm gonna--

563
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,000
 I'm off for peculiar.

564
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,240
 Gus, never mind that.

565
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,920
 Could you go over to the Aldridge's?

566
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,720
 Their car horn is stuck in the garage door's lock.

567
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,000
 Oh, sure thing.

568
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,400
 Door's locked, huh?

569
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,800
 Do you happen to have a rat tail file around?

570
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,840
 No, I don't.

571
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:38,720
 A settling torch?

572
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,440
 No.

573
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,520
 Well, I'll find something to open it with.

574
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,760
 Alright, goodbye, Ms. Brown.

575
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,160
 Goodbye, guys.

576
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,440
 Mother!

577
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,680
 Homer, how did you get out of the dining room?

578
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,280
 Mother, never mind me, it's Father.

579
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:49,920
 What happened?

580
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,080
 We were standing here in the middle of the room, seein'

581
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:56,640
 Father said he couldn't stand being cooped up with me in trapezoids, both, so he did it.

582
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,280
 Did what?

583
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,720
 He tried to jump from the middle of the dining room to the living room doorway.

584
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,000
 Oh, dear.

585
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,120
 Can you know what happened?

586
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,480
 Of course, he didn't make it.

587
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,080
 Mother, that isn't the point.

588
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,720
 He was carrying his pot of shellac when he drew it.

589
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,700
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

590
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:26,880
 Henry, do you see Miss Bennett anywhere on the eyes?

591
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,800
 Not yet, Father, but I'm keeping my eyes open.

592
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,960
 Are you still upset?

593
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,560
 Henry, I'd rather not discuss it.

594
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,280
 Yes, sir.

595
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,640
 But you'd think Gus could have gotten us out of the garage

596
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:38,440
 without breaking down the door with an axe.

597
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,980
 Henry, what does Miss Bennett look like?

598
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:41,400
 - Gee, you can't miss her.

599
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:46,240
 She's sort of, well, gee, she's very healthy.

600
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,400
 - Healthy, how?

601
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,520
 - White in a big way.

602
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,360
 - I see.

603
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,840
 - Henry, oh, boy, Kathleen.

604
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,920
 - So you finally showed up.

605
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,960
 Do you realize it's nearly three o'clock?

606
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,160
 - And Kathleen, let me explain.

607
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,480
 - That's not necessary.

608
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,160
 Henry, my interest you to know

609
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:04,160
 that Agnes and I had a wonderful time skating with Charlie

610
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,000
 Claus.

611
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:05,840
 - Charlie?

612
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,680
 - Yes.

613
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,040
 Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going over to see

614
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,680
 If Charlie's resting comfortably.

615
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,920
 Something happened to him?

616
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,680
 Agnes threw him over his shoulder.

617
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:15,320
 And she wasn't there when he came down.

618
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,280
 Kathleen listened.

619
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,400
 Goodbye, Henry.

620
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,160
 But Kathleen?

621
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,320
 Never mind, Kathleen Henry.

622
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,080
 Look over there.

623
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,040
 Is that Miss Bennett?

624
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:21,920
 Where?

625
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,800
 Well, gee whiz.

626
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,280
 Father, do you think a math teacher should go around

627
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,640
 in public doing figure-8s?

628
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,080
 Is that what she's doing?

629
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,720
 She's trying to.

630
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,040
 Miss Bennett?

631
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:33,840
 Oh, Miss Bennett?

632
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:34,840
 Miss Bennett?

633
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:35,880
 Oh, Dad.

634
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:36,720
 I'm Miss Bennett.

635
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,320
 Henry, you oldridge, could I please speak to you?

636
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,720
 Oh, stop me, Henry, stop me.

637
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,920
 Father Quay, I've got you.

638
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:44,920
 Oh, my--

639
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:47,820
 [LAUGHTER]

640
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:49,320
 Thank you very much.

641
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:52,320
 Isn't this fun?

642
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,120
 [LAUGHTER]

643
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,120
 Miss Bennett.

644
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:57,520
 Henry, I'm like, oh, my own boy, I'm not too steady.

645
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,520
 Oh, Miss Bennett, I'm Henry's father.

646
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,200
 Oh, how do you do, Mr. Alden?

647
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:01,920
 Would you believe it?

648
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:04,280
 I haven't been on skates in 10 years.

649
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,200
 You haven't?

650
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,780
 - Thomas Bennett, we have a problem.

651
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:07,620
 - Yes.

652
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:08,460
 - That is Henry has a problem.

653
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:10,260
 That is, well I know it isn't ethical,

654
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:12,880
 but we're sort of stuck on that trapezoid.

655
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,800
 - Trapezoid, what trapezoid?

656
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,760
 - The one that's our homework for Monday.

657
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:19,720
 - Henry did I give a problem about trapezoid?

658
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:22,280
 - Gee, wait, sure, you wrote it on the blackboard.

659
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,320
 - I did.

660
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:26,160
 I haven't taken up trapezoids with the class yet.

661
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,000
 (laughing)

662
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 - What?

663
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,800
 - She hasn't taken it up.

664
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,640
 - Oh boy.

665
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,840
 - I meant to get into them this past week,

666
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,760
 But somehow I just put it up and put it off.

667
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:39,180
 Miss Bennett, do you mean to say?

668
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,200
 Do you mean to say--

669
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,680
 Mr. Otheletch, you're letting go of my arms.

670
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,600
 Father!

00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,600
 Miss Bennett!

 Yes, Alice?

675
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,440
 Are you all right on the couch?

676
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,960
 I'm fine.

677
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,640
 Is that easy chair comfortable, Henry?

678
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,840
 Yes, mother.

679
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,200
 Would either of you like another blanket?

00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,360
 No, thank you.

681
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,760
 No, thanks, mother.

682
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,720
 Well, I just want you both to know

683
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,440
 I think it was a very brave thing to do.

684
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,160
 Brave?

685
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:22,400
 Yes, pulling Miss Bennet out of the water like that.

686
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,000
 We didn't do it to be brave.

687
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 Miss Bennet was holding on to us for dear life.

688
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,360
 We rescued her in self-defense.

 Dear, I know better.

690
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 Father, are you really going to take me out of school if Miss Bennet stays at Central High?

691
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 I haven't decided.

692
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,500
 Sam, don't you think you ought to cool off first?

693
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:43,000
 Alice, I'm as cooled off as I'll ever be.

694
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 Incidentally, Sam, did you find out what a trapezoid is?

695
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 Yes, Alice. A trapezoid is a...

696
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 A trapezoid...

697
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 Well, Alice, do you see that lampshade over the dining room table?

698
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 The one that sort of tilts?

699
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 Yes, that's a perfect example of a trapezoid.

700
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 You know father it just occurred to me it's been hanging over our heads all day.

 Boy Homer, you sure took your time.

707
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 I couldn't help but my father and I just got through cleaning off the walls.

708
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 The wall?

709

 He's pushing him.
