00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 The Aldrich family based on characters originated by Clifford Goldsmith and

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 starring Ezra Stonner's Henry with Jackie Kalk as Homer.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
 Henry! Henry Aldrich!

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 Come in, other!

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.980
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:24.980

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:44.980
 [Music]

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:52.980
 And now for the Aldrich family. Memories of youth are precious things to be challenged and recalled all your life.

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:59.080
 And there's no better way to keep those memories fresh than knowing a real teenage of everything boy like Henry Aldrich

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:03.620
 Or Henry's every escapade seems a mirror held up to your own you

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.140
 The scene opens in the Aldrich front hall

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:14.460
 Homer are you sure sure I was walking by the emporium and I saw them right in the window with my own two eyes

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.860
 That's what I mean. You've been complaining. You don't see too well lately. That's only in Latin

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:20.860
 Oh.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.860
 Hey, man, is that the phone?

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:25.860
 No, Father, just Homer.

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.860
 Oh, I thought perhaps it was that long distance call I'm waiting for.

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.860
 Henry, can you think of a way we can raise $6.95 a piece?

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.860
 Just $6.95 for genuine pilots?

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:35.860
 Oh, sure.

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.860
 They're surplus from the Air Force.

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.860
 Boy, would I like those.

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:41.860
 I'll say they're even for a line.

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.860
 The only thing is, it's $6.95.

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.860
 They'll go like hot cake, Homer.

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.860
 - Hey, my father will never advance me that much voluntarily.

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:50.860
 - Henry!

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:51.860
 - Yes, Mary.

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.860
 - Well, maybe you have any white elephants you'd like to get rid of.

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:54.860
 - Do I have one?

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:55.860
 - Hey, elephant.

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:56.860
 Do you, Henry?

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:57.860
 - I don't think so.

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.860
 - Do you have any--your hot, Homer?

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:00.860
 - White elephant?

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.860
 - Yes, I'd be glad to stop buying collection.

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.860
 - Well, I haven't noticed any lately.

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.860
 - Can we--is Mary feeling all these days?

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.860
 - Hey, Mama, I've got an idea.

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:11.860
 - What about?

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:12.860
 - How we can get the pilot's food?

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:13.860
 - How?

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.860
 Oh you calling Henry?

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:16.860
 Number three.

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:17.860
 Al, two, three, two.

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:18.860
 No, two, three, two.

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.860
 Hey, that's my house.

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.860
 Homer, all you have to do is talk your parents into it, and mine will be a pushover.

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:30.860
 When Henry, every time I ask my father for money, he makes me count out ten dollars in pennies.

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:31.860
 That poor.

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.860
 It's supposed to teach me the value of money.

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.860
 Homer, the least you can do is try here, take it.

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.860
 But, Henry.

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.860
 Hello?

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:42.860
 Yes.

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.860
 Is this Mrs. Brown?

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:46.860
 Yes.

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:47.860
 Who is this?

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:48.860
 Homer.

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:49.860
 Homer, who?

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:50.860
 Homer, you're Sam.

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.860
 Wow.

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.860
 Yes, dear.

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.860
 Mother, how's your headache?

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:57.860
 Fine.

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.860
 It cleared up just a little while after you left.

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.860
 Oh, that's good.

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.860
 Mother, how do you feel about boots?

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:07.860
 You mean the polyn?

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.860
 No, the crane with fur lining from the Air Force.

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.860
 Fear the Air Force would never take you. You are after way.

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:21.860
 He was, I don't want to join the Air Force. All I want is $6.95.

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:27.860
 So do I. I'd like a new hat. But I'm not going to cut out $10 in this heading together.

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:28.860
 But mother...

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.860
 Oh, my head aches back. Goodbye, dear.

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:31.860
 But mother...

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.860
 I don't think he makes me suffer.

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:34.860
 I love it.

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:35.860
 Hello.

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:39.860
 Boy, you don't know how to handle mothers at all, Homer.

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:41.860
 Well, let's see you do better.

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.860
 Dear, you're not disturbing your father, are you?

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:45.860
 Disturb him?

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:46.860
 How could we do that?

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.860
 Well, I want you to be very careful today.

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:50.860
 He's working on a very important case.

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:52.860
 Has he been kicked out of his office?

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.860
 No, Homer, it's being painted.

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.860
 And I'd appreciate it if you'd steer clear of his study.

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:58.860
 Mother...

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:03.660
 Mother, how would you like to go through this winter and not have to worry about my

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:04.660
 catching cold.

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:05.660
 Catching cold.

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:06.660
 Nice going, him.

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.660
 Let me see your forehead, Henry.

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:09.660
 Oh, no, Mother.

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:10.660
 You don't understand.

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:11.660
 I don't have a cold now.

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:14.660
 It's this winter I'm worrying you about.

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.660
 So, could I have 695?

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:17.660
 What's for?

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:18.660
 Boots.

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:19.660
 Politics boots.

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:20.660
 Sort of like a luscious.

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.660
 Dear, you'd have to ask your father for that much money.

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.660
 You mean if it's alright with him, it's alright with you?

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:28.660
 I suppose so, but do it quickly.

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:29.660
 He's in his study.

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:32.660
 Can we explain it's really our patriotic duty to take these boots off

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:37.820
 boots off the governor's hands. Yeah. Father. Yes. Is it the phone is at long

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:41.960
 distance the phone? No sir. Henry I do not wish to be disturbed this afternoon.

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:47.140
 Is that clear? But but I'm going out and play. Father couldn't you answer just one

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:56.300
 question for me. Yes. May I have 695 for a pair of boots? You may not. Homer maybe

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:03.540

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:49.300
 there's a newspaper here on the telephone table

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:50.300
 i'll jot it down on that

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:51.300
 fine

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.180
 The first is volume three.

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:54.740
 - Article 14.

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:56.780
 - Article 23.

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:57.780
 Got it?

00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:58.780
 - Yep.

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:00.420
 - The second one, let me see.

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:03.860
 - Connor, would you consider those tattoo of Liberty bookends on your desk?

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:04.860
 White elephant?

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:06.860
 - Mary, I'm speaking to Chicago.

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:07.860
 - Oh, mother.

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:08.860
 - Oh, hello, Bert.

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:10.620
 Now, what's the second one?

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:11.860
 - Mother, I found it.

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:13.060
 - Oh, you found what, dear?

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:16.020
 - Got black and purple veins at Bellgate five years ago.

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:17.540
 It's a perfect white elephant.

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:21.260
 - Peter, do you think we should give that away after all your Aunt Bell paid 25?

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:27.100
 $5 for it she told you that of course not just happened to leave the price tag on

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:31.620
 Oh, well, it's certainly not doing anybody any good up in the alley. All right, dear

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:37.140
 Sammy you still on the phone? Oh, thank you very much, right?

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:39.500
 Goodbye

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:44.380
 What is it Alice dear? Please come and eat your lunch. Oh first I must copy these figures into my brief

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:49.780
 You can do that if you eat you've got to take some nourishment. Oh, but I am sick very well

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:54.780
 And Alice isn't there any way to get the boys out of the house this afternoon?

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:57.780
 I'll speak to them, dear. You go in and start on your salad.

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:00.780
 Oh, certainly a relief to have that Chicago business all over.

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:02.780
 Henry, I saw it myself.

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:04.780
 Henry? Yes, mother.

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:05.780
 Dear, I'd like to speak to you.

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:11.780
 Mother, I know what you're going to say, and the only reason I'm excited is because of a ridiculous thing Homer just said.

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:15.780
 Mrs. Allrich, do you happen to have last night's paper around?

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:21.380
 It's right there on the telephone table, but dear you and Homer will have to get out of the house this afternoon

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:27.980
 Yes, mother here. I'll show you Henry even if the ad is in there. They never give a job like that to us

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:33.880
 Why not? We're we're too young. No, that's a beautiful part of it. What I find the ad

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:40.320
 There it is Henry. Let's see wanted men to work on street cars Saturdays

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:43.060
 Good pay experience unnecessary

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:49.620
 Call L950. Experience unnecessary. I know. Police we can do is call.

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:56.980
 Number three. L950. L950. Hope they pay us higher. Three dollars a day, Henry. For us?

00:07:56.980 --> 00:08:00.260
 Now tell the truth. Doesn't that sound foolish?

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:06.660
 Senator Streetcard Company Employment Office. Hello. I'm calling about the ad in yesterday's paper.

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:12.340
 Yes? How inexperienced can you be? You've had a high school education?

00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:15.340
 In a manner of speaking you might say so.

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:16.340
 That's enough.

00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:18.340
 Would you tell that to my friends?

00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:19.340
 Here Henry.

00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:20.340
 Hello?

00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:21.340
 What is it you want to know?

00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:24.340
 You mean you'd let us drive street cars without experience?

00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:26.340
 Of course not.

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:28.340
 Do just help collect fares.

00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:30.340
 On the line that runs down to the football stadium.

00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:32.340
 Is that all? Just collect fares?

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:33.340
 That's right.

00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:36.340
 If you want that job you better come down today before 5.

00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:37.340
 Ask me.

00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:38.340
 This is Lincoln's browser.

00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:40.340
 Lincoln's browser?

00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:42.340
 Homer write that down.

00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:44.340
 Blingenspelzer?

00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:46.340
 How do you spell it?

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:48.340
 Just the way it sounds.

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:50.340
 Blingenspelzer.

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:51.340
 Prashiller.

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:53.340
 Blingenspelzer.

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:55.340
 I'll write it down next to the ad.

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:57.340
 Mr....

00:08:57.340 --> 00:08:59.340
 How much would that job pay?

00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:00.340
 Six twenty a day.

00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:01.340
 Six twenty?

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:02.340
 Six twenty.

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:03.340
 Oh boy.

00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:04.340
 What do you take?

00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:05.340
 Okay.

00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:06.340
 Drop down.

00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:07.340
 Goodbye.

00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:08.340
 I told you, Henry.

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:09.340
 I told you.

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:12.340
 Henry, could I have part of that paper to wrap this phase in?

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:13.340
 Sure, Mary, here.

00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:15.340
 My goodness, I don't need that much.

00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:17.340
 Here, I just cleaned this hole.

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:18.340
 I'll pick the paper, Seth.

00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:20.340
 Are you using all of that paper, Henry?

00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:21.340
 Now, just this section.

00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:23.340
 It will give me the rest of it.

00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:25.340
 'Cause the junk man comes today.

00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:27.340
 I'm going down to the White Elephant shop.

00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:28.340
 Very well.

00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:31.340
 And Henry, remember what I told you about getting out of the house.

00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:33.340
 Henry, you know what? Let's do one.

00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:34.340
 Let's take a street car down there.

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:36.340
 We can get experience as we go.

00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:37.340
 That's right.

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:44.340
 If they pay $6.20 for us the way we are, imagine what they'll pay if we know the business.

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:55.840
 You're crazy, Henry.

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:57.340
 You're the one who's crazy.

00:09:57.340 --> 00:10:01.340
 Because you've been earning this trolley for 10 minutes, you're thinking of the whole thing.

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:03.840
 He uses that pedal to ring the bell.

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:05.340
 Ring the bell, ring the bell.

00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:09.340
 Homer, what happens when your father presses the pedal in his car?

00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:10.340
 It stalls.

00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:14.340
 Come on, let's go up and stand by them motily.

00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:15.340
 Okay.

00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:16.340
 Find straight off.

00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:19.340
 Do you mind letting that lady off, Sonny?

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:20.340
 Excuse me.

00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:22.340
 Watch your step getting off, Miss.

00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:25.340
 Wallen Street next.

00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:27.340
 You boys getting off the ball?

00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:29.340
 Ah, no, sir.

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:32.340
 Mr. Do you mind us standing here?

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:34.340
 I guess not.

00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:37.340
 You think you might like to take up transportation when you get older?

00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:40.340
 Yes, we're thinking of going into it right now.

00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:41.840
 It's a fine career for a man.

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:42.840
 Is that a fine?

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:46.840
 Yes, indeed. You get around. See the world. You know what I mean?

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:51.840
 Oh, mister, that pedal on the floor there. Is that the gas or the bell?

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:53.340
 Neither. It's a brake.

00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:56.340
 You see, Homer. It's a good thing we ask.

00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:58.840
 Well, this isn't Walnut Street, mister.

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:01.340
 I know. I have to go out and switch the track.

00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:05.980
 Oh boy, look at all those things he has to work.

00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:08.380
 Henry, which one is the belt he's supposed?

00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:10.060
 Now listen Homer, don't touch anything.

00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:11.500
 There it is, hand that butt.

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:12.780
 Homer, look out for the clank.

00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:13.100
 Why?

00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:14.220
 Homer, you're out of all!

00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:16.380
 I'm hoping Homer's not there!

00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:18.140
 I don't know how you stay!

00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:21.900
 Oh boy, he hit stop.

00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:23.660
 Huh, good work, Homer.

00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:25.500
 May, didn't you stop it?

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:26.540
 Who started that car?

00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:27.660
 Who started that car?

00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:29.340
 Oh, it's futile.

00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:30.940
 It was an accident, hon.

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:32.860
 Sure, and it stopped it, man.

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:34.180
 It stopped all right.

00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:35.180
 It chanced.

00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:36.460
 Smack into the Swiss.

00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:38.940
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:45.620
 Hello?

00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:46.280
 Hello?

00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:47.140
 Hello, sir.

00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:48.140
 What had cost you--

00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:49.020
 Yes, pretty much.

00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:49.860
 I'm sorry, sir.

00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:51.620
 There'll be three hours a day.

00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:52.380
 Three hours?

00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:55.420
 Operator, don't you realize that brief has to be in by five?

00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:56.220
 I'm sorry, sir.

00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:57.220
 We'll do that quick, yes.

00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:58.220
 Thank you.

00:11:58.220 --> 00:11:59.380
 No, Sam, calm down.

00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:00.420
 Calm down, Alice.

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:02.500
 Do you realize what losing that paper means?

00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:04.980
 But if you'll just tell me what sort of paper it was--

00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:05.900
 A newspaper.

00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:06.540
 A newspaper.

00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:07.660
 Yes, it is times.

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:10.300
 I jotted it down on the margin and left it right here

00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:13.340
 on the telephone table when you made me come to lunch.

00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:14.580
 Oh, dear.

00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:17.420
 Sam, I thought it was just an ordinary center bill time.

00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:19.140
 Alex, what did you do with it?

00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:20.740
 I told Henry he could have it.

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:21.460
 Henry has it?

00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:23.380
 Yes, that is he has part of it.

00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:24.300
 Where the rest?

00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:27.660
 Mary, all except the part I put on the trash pile outside.

00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:28.580
 On the trash pile?

00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:29.740
 Maybe the part I want is there.

00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:34.340
 The only thing is, go to the jumpman, take that out, not more than 15 minutes ago.

00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:35.340
 Oh, no.

00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:36.340
 Mother, are you all?

00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:37.840
 Mary, come in here at once.

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:40.840
 My goodness, Father, you should have seen the excitement downtown.

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:42.440
 Travel was tied up for bomb.

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:43.440
 Never mind, that way.

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:45.440
 We were jacking up a streetcar right in the middle of Maine.

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:46.240
 Alice.

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:48.740
 Mary, what did you do with that part of the newspaper?

00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:50.440
 You wrapped Aunt Belle's vase in.

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:52.440
 I left it in the white elephant shop with a vase.

00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:53.740
 Go right back there and get it.

00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:54.540
 His father.

00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:55.140
 Who are?

00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:58.340
 I have some very important information written down on part of that paper.

00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:00.260
 Oh my goodness, I'll run all the way!

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.060
 Before you do, change your display deal.

00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:04.020
 - Let him out in the flat heels, just start.

00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:04.860
 - Yes, Father.

00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:06.300
 - Did Henry say where he was going out?

00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:07.140
 - No, dear.

00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:08.140
 - Well, I'll have to find him somehow.

00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:09.700
 Meanwhile, you called us and tell him

00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:11.100
 to bring all our papers right back.

00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:12.940
 - Yes, dear, and how about a cup of tea?

00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:13.940
 - Tea, tea.

00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:15.580
 - To calm you down.

00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:16.780
 - I'll get it, let your car go.

00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:18.900
 - I'll put on the wall, hey.

00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:19.820
 Go ahead, Chicago.

00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:21.140
 - I should go where?

00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:24.380
 - Henry, is that you?

00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:26.900
 - Yes, Father, boy, and do we need a lawyer?

00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:27.740
 - Where are you?

00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:32.740
 downtown with Homer and the streetcar company and sits where responsible.

00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:34.740
 Hey, redoch you will the step. I'm coming right down.

00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:35.740
 You are?

00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:40.740
 Homer, we have nothing to worry about. I just got us the best lawyer in town.

00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:52.740
 Where'd your father go?

00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:55.740
 And there he is talking to the man from the streetcar company.

00:13:55.740 --> 00:14:01.900
 company where there in front of the drugstore oh yeah boy is that guy in man see

00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:05.500
 the way he's pointing his finger right in your father's face you'll notice though

00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:09.540
 my father's pointing right back

 they got the streetcar moving I think this is a fine thing we're the ones who

00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:20.060
 did the whole thing and with all these people in front of us I can't see a thing

00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:22.060
 Hey, hey, hey, where are you?

00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:23.060
 Here, fathers.

00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:24.060
 Is everything settled?

00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:25.060
 Just let them sue.

00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:26.060
 We'll sue right back.

00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:28.060
 Now, Henry, let me have that paper.

00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:29.060
 What paper?

00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:30.060
 You took from the house this morning.

00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:32.060
 The newspaper? The one with the ad in it?

00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:33.060
 Yes.

00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:34.060
 I don't have it.

00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:36.060
 We toy the ad out and threw the rest of it away.

00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:37.060
 Throw it away?

00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:38.060
 Where?

00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:39.060
 On the trolley?

00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:40.060
 What trolley?

00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:41.060
 The one that was stuck in the switch.

00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:42.060
 There it is going down the street.

00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:43.060
 Well, that's a fine thing.

00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:44.060
 Come back.

00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:45.060
 Father, what have I done?

00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:46.060
 Come back!

00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:47.060
 Come back!

00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:22.860
 newspaper on which he has written important information has disappeared in three

00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:27.580

00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:32.180
 her part of the paper. Mrs. Miller. Mrs. Miller.

00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:34.800
 I'm Mary. Oh, Richard. I was hoping you'd drop in again.

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:37.300
 Mrs. Miller, you know that white elephant I brought in this morning?

00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:40.740
 Yes, Mary. I'm just as thrilled as I can be about that.

00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:44.480
 Yeah, but when you brought that in Mrs. Hooker said to me she's on a committee to me.

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:45.280
 Yes, I know.

00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:48.280
 Mrs. Hooker said we'll never be able to sell that thing.

00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:51.040
 That white elephant's going to be a white elephant.

00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:52.120
 Just kind of cute, I thought.

00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:53.880
 To that vase, Mrs. Miller. Where is it now?

00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:55.440
 That's what I'm getting at, Mary.

00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:56.480
 I sold it.

00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:57.040
 You did?

00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:57.760
 Mrs. Smith.

00:15:57.760 --> 00:15:58.320
 Oh dear.

00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:01.920
 I had to talk her ear off, but I finally sold it to her for 95 cents.

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:04.320
 But the newspaper, you still have that, don't you?

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:05.000
 What news page?

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.400
 That the vase was wrapped in.

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:09.000
 My goodness, no, I tore it up and stuffed it in a vase.

 What father? I had to keep it from breaking.

00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:13.600
 What's wrong? Mrs. Miller, do you know where Mrs. Schmidt lives?

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:15.120
 Oh, gracious, I could find out.

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:19.400
 Could you? My father's entire career may depend on getting that paper back.

00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:34.280
 Father, are you sure that what your after was on the part of the paper we had?

00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:38.120
 No, Henry, but it's liable to be, and I can't overlook a single possibility.

00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:39.880
 There's a street car, Mr. Orlner.

00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:41.000
 Where? Just ahead.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.080
 Oh, yes.

00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:43.640
 Is that the trolley you went on, Henry?

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:44.600
 I don't know.

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:47.040
 They all look alike.

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:49.120
 It's stopping at that traffic light.

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:51.280
 I'll pull over in park.

00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:52.480
 Father, that's it.

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:53.280
 Are you sure?

00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:54.360
 I'm positive.

00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:56.920
 I remember that sign on the side of it.

00:16:56.920 --> 00:17:00.480
 Ride the trolleys and smile.

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:02.360
 Well, let's hail him before the light changes.

00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:04.760
 Homer, get out.

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:06.760
 Hey.

00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:08.760
 You're calling me?

00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:09.760
 Yes, sir.

 I'm sorry I'm not taking any passengers.

 If you just let us look through the car, we won't bother you again.

00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:29.260
 I'll say you won't, because none of you are sitting foot in this car.

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:31.260

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:35.260
 I'd be delighted after I've looked for my paper.

 You can get it down at the lost and found.

00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:39.140
 You can't keep me off if I pay my pay.

00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:41.420
 I can too. I'm not taking passengers.

00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:42.520

 After all that happened today, they figured she'd jinxed.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.120
 Henry, that man's name was Hockendouper.

00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:39.400
 Homer, you're crazy.

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:40.840
 You are the one who's crazy.

00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:41.200
 Man?

00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:42.280
 Sure I'll prove it.

00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:42.720
 How?

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:43.160
 How?

00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:45.640
 Here's that clipping with his name or--

00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:46.640
 What's wrong?

00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:49.640
 Was his name Voll III, Art 14?

00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:50.640
 What?

00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:51.640
 Oh, she was.

00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:53.640
 I was looking at the wrong side.

00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:54.640
 Voll III, Art.

00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:56.640
 Homer, let me see that.

00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:57.640
 Oh boy.

00:22:57.640 --> 00:22:58.640
 Father!

00:22:58.640 --> 00:22:59.640
 Henry, what's wrong?

00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:00.640
 Come back!

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:01.640
 Come back!

00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:18.640
 Would you like a pillow for your feet, Sam?

00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:20.640
 No thanks. This is fine.

00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:22.640
 Henry? No mother.

00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:25.640
 Boy, is this a comfortable couch?

00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:27.640
 My goodness, what a day.

00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:29.640
 What time was the brief file?

00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:31.640
 Four fifty-nine.

00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:39.640
 and three quarters. Boy, if it wasn't for the streetcar company selling us, everything would be fine.

00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:44.640
 Henry, would you do me a favor? Sure, fine. In the future, would you please stay away from streetcars?

00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:49.640
 You mean for the rest of my life? If necessary. Maybe you're right.

00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:55.640
 And Alice, I don't mean to criticize, but this whole thing would never have happened if we had a pad by the telephone.

00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:59.640
 Yes, dear. As a matter of fact, one came in the mail this morning.

00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:03.640
 Here it is on this table. Who's it from? I haven't looked yet.

00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:07.640
 Oh, my goodness. What's so funny?

00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:11.640
 Is this bad? There are jokes on it? Sam, do you know what it says?

00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:15.640
 What? For smoother writing, use this pad by Golly.

00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:19.640
 For smoother writing, use the center of the control.

00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:21.640
 What? The trowel?

00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:23.640
 We're coming each other so far.

00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:25.640
 [LAUGHTER]

00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:27.640
