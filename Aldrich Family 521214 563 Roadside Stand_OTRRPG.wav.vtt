00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.240
 Henry! Henry, all great!

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.000
 Coming, mother!

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.800
 [applause]

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:20.000
 Yes, it's the Orange Family, as transcribed, written by Clifford Goldsmith.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 [Music]

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 Adults think they have problems.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
 But a teenager also has his share of them.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 And if he's a typical American boy like Henry Aldridge,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 it seems there's no end of problems.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
 One bumps right smack into another.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.600
 And the search for solutions is always a desperate one.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.500
 The scene opens in the all-rich kitchen, and the time is afternoon.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.500
 Now listen Homer, let me squeeze the next lemon.

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.500
 Why don't you be getting the sugar out Henry?

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:00.500
 I already got it.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.500
 Come on, it's my turn to run to juicers.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:03.500
 Okay.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:04.500
 Henry!

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.500
 Yes Mother?

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:06.500
 Where are you?

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.500
 Um, well I hope and I are just sort of here in the kitchen.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.500
 I thought you promised Homer's father you'd wash his dog.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.500
 We are washing it Mother.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:16.500
 In the kitchen?

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.200
 No, Mrs. Aldrich, smoothie stayed outside for the time being.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.840
 Sure, we just came in for a drink of water.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.840
 So you're making lemonade?

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.340
 Well, Mother, you know how warm you get chasing a dog.

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.180
 No, I'm afraid I don't.

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.940
 And you'd better finish that dog before Will Brown comes back.

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.520
 Oh, he's over fixing our furnace, Mrs. Aldrich, with Henry's father.

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.520
 We got all the time in the world.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.520
 Well, Sam, I must say that I am a little warm.

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.920
 Oh, boy, Homer, is that your father already?

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.920
 We've got a hurry, Henry.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.920
 Come on out in the kitchen, Will.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:48.920
 Let's see what we can find.

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:49.920
 That sounds good to me.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.920
 I sure am thirsty.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:52.920
 Hello, Father.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:53.920
 Hello, boys. You all finished?

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.920
 That's just what we were going to ask you.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.920
 Well, I guess I owe you, boys.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:58.920
 35 cents, huh?

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.920
 35 cents, Father?

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:01.920
 Yeah, we're washing the dog.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:02.920
 Here you are.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.920
 Well, um, well, you really don't have to pay us right now, Mr. Brown.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.920
 Oh, here. Take it.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:08.920
 How did Smoothie look?

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.920
 Boy, she certainly was a sight.

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:11.920
 Yeah, all say she was.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:12.920
 Where is she?

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:13.920
 Hopping back.

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:14.920
 Hop 'n' back.

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:15.920
 Here, Smoothey!

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.280
 And Father, wouldn't you like some sweat lemonade first?

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.280
 Lemonade?

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.280
 Here, you can have my glass, Mr. Brown.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.280
 And here, Father, you take Homer's glass.

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.800
 I don't want to deprive you, boys.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.360
 Oh, gosh, Father, it's no deprivacy at all.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.560
 Well, thank you.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:29.760
 Ah.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.760
 Yeah, that certainly hits the spot, boys.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:32.560
 Thanks a lot.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.680
 You're welcome, Father.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.920
 Now I'll go out and back and take a look at Smoothey.

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.080
 Well, first, won't you have another glass of lemonade?

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.600
 Oh, I'd like to see Smoothey.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:40.400
 Oh, come on, Will.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.920
 That's going to the living room and relax.

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:42.480
 I'm tired.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.520
 Well, maybe you're right, Sam.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.520
 They come to think of it, I'm pretty tired myself.

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.120
 I'd oblige for the lemonade, boys.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.320
 Oh, that's all right, father. That's the least we could have done for you.

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.520
 Henry, let's hurry up and finish up on smoothie.

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:53.120
 Sure.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.120
 As soon as we make a little lemonade for ourselves.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.320
 Hey, boy, this is some juicer.

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.720
 With this 35 cents, Henry, how much do we have?

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:01.920
 $12.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.120
 Boy.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.320
 All we need is $3 more and we'll have enough for a down payment on that car we saw.

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.320
 The only trouble is Homer, how are we going to get three more dollars?

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.320
 Well, why don't we go into business?

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:13.520
 What kind of business?

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.820
 Well, something we've had experience in.

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.720
 Like washing dogs.

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:18.920
 You mean for people?

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:19.720
 Sure.

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.520
 They're the only ones who have money.

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.120
 Well, we're making out something there.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.620
 You're John Wright.

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.920
 It's taking a lot longer to do smoothie than I thought it would.

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.920
 I think we ought to charge 50 cents.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.520
 Oh boy, we're all of Lemmon's homework.

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.320
 Oh man, I know what we do have any ice-box.

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:35.820
 What?

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.320
 And I'd like to try it on the squeezer too.

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:38.320
 It's a pineapple.

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:38.820
 She was--

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.320
 I sure like pineapple.

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:41.620
 It's already got the bottom cut off.

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.220
 Stand back now while I put it on here.

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:44.220
 Hang on, Henry.

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:49.020
 Look, Homer, look what it does to it.

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.620
 Boy, will we have some drink.

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.420
 Only thing is, Henry.

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.020
 Will we charge the same price to wash your great daines?

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:57.620
 We do a fox terrier?

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.820
 Naturally, we'll charge different prices for different sizes.

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:03.320
 Then for third-breads, we'll have to charge a lot extra.

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:04.520
 Oh, sure.

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.820
 They need a more delicate soap.

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:09.020
 Homer, do you know what else we ought to squeeze in here?

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:10.020
 What?

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.920
 Look, in the icebox.

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.720
 Here's half a can of love.

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.080
 Why didn't I think of that before?

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.920
 - Sure.

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.840
 - And step them out of them first though, Henry.

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:18.880
 Here we go, Homer.

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.400
 Henry, look at what you did.

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.440
 Why didn't you jump out of the way?

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.000
 The seeds are all over me.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.240
 Though I don't worry about those, Homer.

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.640
 Hey, just take a taste of what we've made here.

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.200
 Well, how was it?

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.200
 Boy, I think we've got something.

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.160
 And Gee was, I'll say we have.

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:42.920
 How about patting it?

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:44.320
 Could we pat anything like this?

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:45.320
 Well sure, why not?

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.480
 It's our own personal formula.

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.600
 Every time anybody wants a glass, well they send us so much money.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:51.920
 Whether they like it or not?

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:52.920
 Sure.

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.680
 How would they know where we live?

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.960
 We'll send them our address.

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.400
 Or maybe we could have our own roadside stand.

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.600
 Let's have a little more of that punch, Henry.

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.520
 Yeah, how about a roadside stand?

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.240
 In December, Henry?

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.800
 Come on, man.

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.560
 I thought you said you watched smoothie.

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.800
 Well, we did get her half-wiseed father.

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.800
 Well, what's she supposed to do? Finish the job herself?

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.800
 Well, we didn't think we ought to rush her into it, Mr. Brown.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.800
 She was so warm by the time we caught her, we thought she ought to cool off first.

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.800
 Well, I'll just take back that 35 cents until she does cool off.

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:25.800
 Well...

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.800
 Homer? Yes, father.

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:31.800
 The real reason we haven't finished smoothie is because we had to work out this special drink.

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:32.800
 For smoothie?

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.800
 Gosh, no father, for our roadside stand.

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:36.800
 What roadside stand?

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.800
 Didn't you know so we can get enough money to make a down payment on our car?

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.800
 Well, you just forget your roadside stand until next summer.

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:46.800
 Yeah, but father, if we don't get a car, Henry and I will have to walk wherever we go.

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.800
 Good. Suppose you start walking toward that dog.

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:50.800
 Yes, father.

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.800
 Homer, what happened to your face?

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.800
 Cantaloupe seeds.

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.800
 I'll go with you, Homer and Holder. Why do you wash?

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.800
 I bet a holler, Henry. She's pretty ticklish.

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:03.800
 Well, what I'm going to do if the boys run a roadside stand?

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:08.900
 I don't know but instinct tells me no personally. I like that initiative. They ought to be encouraged

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:12.640
 Only I don't think the boys need a car and I'm the winner anyhow don't be absurd

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:18.520
 Well, they'll never actually earn enough to get a car. Oh, but why take a chance? Let's have some more of this lemonade here. Well

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:24.240
 Well, we'll both have a lot less trouble on our hands if we let them try their luck businessmen

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:26.960
 And we'll have still less if we don't here's to us

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:28.960
 It's to us.

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:31.960
 [Laughing]

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:33.960
 Ooh, this tree.

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:35.960
 It's okay, Sam.

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:37.960
 Let the boys have their roadside stand.

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:39.960
 They won't get any car.

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:52.960
 [Music]

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:53.960
 Refreshments, mister.

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:55.960
 Delicious punch.

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:57.960
 Ice cold, homemade punch.

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:02.960
 Boy, there were a lot of people in that car too.

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:04.960
 I mean, I'm getting colder by the minute.

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:06.960
 Well, here, have another glass of punch.

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:08.960
 Could we warm it up a little first?

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:10.960
 Hey, Homer, maybe that's the trouble.

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:11.960
 What is?

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:13.960
 Maybe we should be featuring our hot dogs.

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:15.960
 Sure, that's an idea.

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:18.960
 Boy, if everybody is as cold as I am,

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:20.960
 I'll try it.

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:24.960
 Get your hot dogs here, red hot hot dogs, hot dogs with mustard,

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:26.960
 Red Hot Mustard.

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:31.460
 Maybe they've got a heater in their car.

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:35.460
 Hey, here comes another one.

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:37.460
 Get your hot dog here!

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:39.460
 Red Hot Hot Dog here!

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:41.460
 Red Hot Dog here!

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:44.960
 She wouldn't even stop.

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:46.960
 What time do you think it is, Henry?

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:48.460
 Oh, it isn't so late.

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:50.960
 Seems like an awful long time since the sun went down.

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:52.460
 I'm cold.

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:55.760
 She was home where we can't quit after investing all our money in this stop.

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:57.960
 We got nearly $4 tied up here.

00:07:57.960 --> 00:07:59.760
 Henry, it stands to reason.

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:03.360
 If we've only sold 25 cents worth since 3 this afternoon,

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:05.760
 we're never going to sell $4 worth this late.

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:07.960
 But we're paying rent to the guy that owns this stand.

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:09.760
 We've got to get full use out of it.

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:11.760
 Now I know why we got it so cheap.

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:14.260
 And here comes a car.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:17.260
 Refreshments, mister, hot dogs.

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.260
 Peanut butter sandwiches.

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:23.880
 Henry, do you suppose our location has anything to do with it?

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:25.060
 Our location?

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:28.460
 Well, maybe it isn't good to be on a curve that's on the side of a hill.

00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:32.460
 People get hungry on curves.

00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:35.460
 Well, a fellow that owns this place couldn't even sell gas.

00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:37.560
 Here comes another car.

00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:38.560
 I'll stop it.

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:43.960
 Hey, Mr. Refreshments, sandwiches, hot dogs for a cold day.

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:46.460
 Henry, you stopping? You stopping?

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:46.960
 Hey, buddy.

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:47.960
 Yes, sir.

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:48.960
 It's all good.

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:49.960
 Oil?

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:51.840
 (audience laughing)

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:53.760
 And I'm sorry, but we don't carry oil.

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:55.360
 - What you got those signs up for?

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:56.400
 - Well, those are from another guy.

00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:57.400
 He went throat.

00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:59.240
 - Which is all you're gonna do all right too.

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:00.080
 - Thanks.

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:00.920
 (audience laughing)

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:02.520
 How about a delicious drink?

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:03.720
 - Yeah, that sounds good.

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:05.800
 Nice hot cup of coffee show would warm me up.

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:07.240
 - We haven't got coffee.

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:08.080
 - What did you got?

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:09.320
 - Ice cold punch.

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:10.600
 - Ice cold punch.

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:11.880
 - And a night like this.

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:15.360
 - He's got pineapple and cantaloupe and strawberries.

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:16.200
 And...

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:19.120
 - He was, he didn't even say goodbye.

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:20.820
 (audience laughing)

00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:21.820
 Anyhow, we stopped.

00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:23.100
 That's encouraging.

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:24.620
 Let's drink a little more punch.

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:25.980
 You drink it, I don't want any more.

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:27.420
 I'm all goose pimples.

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:30.060
 We gotta eat something, Homer, to keep up your strength.

00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:31.700
 Henry, maybe we shouldn't have told our folks

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:34.120
 who wouldn't be home for dinner tonight.

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:35.300
 Homer, somebody stop.

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:37.020
 Hey, you got any hot dogs?

00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:38.340
 Yes, sir.

00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:39.980
 Let's have five to take out of the car.

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:40.800
 Yes, sir.

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:41.640
 Five.

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:42.540
 Homer, where'd you go?

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:43.380
 Homer?

00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:44.220
 Yeah, what do you have, Henry?

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:45.060
 Make it five.

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:45.900
 Yes, sir.

00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:46.740
 Coming up.

00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:47.580
 Five what?

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:49.340
 Hot dogs!

00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:52.140
 Didn't I tell you Homer? It was just a case of sticking to it.

00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:53.820
 Uh, will it take very long, Mac?

00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:55.580
 No, sir, you'll have 'em right away!

00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:57.180
 Homer, which bag are they in?

00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:58.620
 Haven't you got 'em on the fire?

00:09:58.620 --> 00:09:59.980
 We ate all we cook.

00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:03.740
 If I didn't want to take any time at all, sir, all we have to do is build a fire.

00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:04.940
 Build a fire?

00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:06.620
 Come on, we'll go out and find some kindling.

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:08.220
 Never mind, Mac.

00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:09.740
 Can't you wait?

00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:11.660
 I've got to make the coast by Wednesday.

00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:13.820
 I know, but wait!

00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:16.700
 How about some peanut butter sandwiches?

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:18.700
 There are some delicious new pucks.

00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:22.200
 We're farther away from getting our car than we ever were.

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:24.700
 Well, all I can say, Homer, is I don't like your talkies,

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:26.200
 though what we're doing is a mistake.

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:28.200
 Well, I can tell you, Henry, is how things look to me.

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:29.200
 All right, then, all right.

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:30.700
 Now, I suppose you want to quit.

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:32.200
 Just when people are beginning to stop.

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:33.200
 Sure.

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:34.200
 I'm going home.

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:36.200
 And I'm taking my share of the hot dogs, too.

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:39.200
 Okay, Homer, I expected it all the time.

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:41.700
 What's that?

00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:42.200
 It's a car.

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:43.200
 Is the customer?

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:44.700
 Hello there.

00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:46.200
 What can we do for you?

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:48.200
 How far is it to the next town?

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:50.200
 Center goes in back of you.

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:54.700
 Yeah, I know. We just came from there. Isn't a room left in town?

00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:58.500
 Joseph, let's drive on. I don't want talking to strange men on the road.

00:10:58.500 --> 00:10:59.700
 Oh, we're not men.

00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:04.700
 Oh, my goodness. Joseph, he's drawing a gun.

00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:06.700
 This isn't a gun, it's a hot dog.

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:08.700
 Billy, be yourself.

00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:11.300
 You boys don't have any cabins here, do you?

00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:12.100
 No, sir.

00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:14.900
 Well, I'm not going any further tonight.

00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:16.900
 Would you like to sleep here in our roadstand?

00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:19.160
 Does it have heat and running water?

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:20.400
 Well, no, not exactly.

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:22.740
 Do you know of any place we could get a room?

00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:25.440
 I'd pay anything in reason.

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:26.800
 Hey?

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:28.340
 You would have to be a hotel?

00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:31.800
 Any place at all, just so long as it has some beds.

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:35.080
 Well, of course you could stay at my house.

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:35.960
 We could?

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:36.960
 They could, Henry?

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:38.880
 Are there just the two of you?

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:41.320
 Well, there's my husband here.

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:44.320
 And our two grandchildren are sleeping in the back seat.

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:47.320
 Well, how much do you charge a knife?

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:49.320
 Well...

00:11:49.320 --> 00:12:05.320
 Thomas, you were asleep yet.

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:06.320
 What is it, Sam?

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:08.320
 It's Henry, and...

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:10.320
 No, dear, I've been listening for him.

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:12.320
 Well, he'll be along.

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:17.700
 Dear, I'm worried to death. They're out there on that main highway all alone, and it's cold.

00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:19.860
 They'll take care of themselves, all right?

00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:22.260
 They didn't even come home for dinner.

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:25.860
 They probably ate their own hot dogs and enjoyed them.

00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:27.060
 Listen, Sam.

00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:31.300
 Isn't that a car stopping in front of the house?

00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:33.700
 Probably somebody bringing Henry home.

00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:42.140
 It may be my imagination, but it sounds as if there were five or six getting out of that car.

00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:45.140
 Now, Alice, there aren't five or six getting out of it.

00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:49.140
 Henry and Homer are probably unloading the dishes he borrowed.

00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:52.140
 Was that the front door I just heard?

00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:55.140
 I hope so. Either that or the furnace exploding.

00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:57.140
 Henry!

00:12:57.140 --> 00:12:59.140
 Henry!

00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:00.140
 What is it, Father?

00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:02.140
 Be sure to lock the door, dear.

00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:03.140
 I have locked it.

00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:05.140
 And Father, can I ask you something?

00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:07.540
 Not tonight, Henry. It's time to go to bed.

00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:09.140
 But it won't take more than a second.

00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:10.640
 How was business, son?

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:12.240
 Well, not very good at the beginning,

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:13.740
 but let me tell you how we ended up.

00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:16.140
 I'm glad you did so well, but not tonight.

00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:17.540
 Hey, but, Mother, just let me tell you--

00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:20.140
 Henry, your father and I both want to get to sleep.

00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:22.140
 You don't think he'd be even slightly interested?

00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:23.440
 Please close the door.

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:26.140
 Yes, Father, but I just want to say that business is very good.

00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:28.440
 Don't get up too early, dear.

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:29.640
 No, Mother.

00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:31.240
 Mr.

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:33.340
 Oh, Mr. Are you down there?

00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:36.080
 How about these suitcases, young man?

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:38.040
 Just a minute, I'll be right down.

00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:39.880
 My folks seem to have gone to bed.

00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:42.540
 What time do you serve breakfast?

00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:43.840
 Oh, gee whiz.

00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:45.480
 Just come down any time you like.

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:47.980
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:13:47.980 --> 00:14:00.160
 Father.

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:00.960
 Father?

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:02.360
 I'm eating breakfast.

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:04.080
 Homer, what are you doing up so early?

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:06.040
 Father, I've been thinking about something all night.

00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:07.040
 I've got an idea.

00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:08.400
 Road science 10 business?

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:10.600
 Well, that's sort of what I want to talk to you Bob.

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:12.560
 Father, why don't we take in rumors?

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:13.920
 Rumors?

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:15.640
 Homer, what would we do with rumors?

00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:16.800
 Let them sleep.

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:18.040
 There's big money in it.

00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:18.880
 There it is?

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:19.720
 Sure.

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:21.680
 Henry Olives made $5 last night.

00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:23.400
 He took home four guests.

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:24.240
 He did.

00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:27.840
 And now he's going to charge them $0.25 each for breakfast.

00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:29.280
 Do his folks know about it?

00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:31.360
 Well, not yet, I don't think.

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:36.360
 The Homer you told me to say that Sam Aldridge is going to wake up this morning and find four strange people in his house.

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:40.360
 Sure! Won't he be surprised to get all that money?

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:43.860
 Oh, this is too good to miss.

00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:45.860
 Hey, Homer! Where are you, Henry?

00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:48.860
 On the front porch! Come on up the town with me!

00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:49.860
 Four four!

00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:53.860
 Well, before my folks get up, I've got to get some oranges, eggs, and pabble 'em!

00:14:53.860 --> 00:15:03.860
 [applause]

00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:10.860
 [applause]

00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:13.860
 Well now getting back to the troubles of Henry Aldrich.

00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:18.860
 Henry and his friend Homer have gone into the roadside stand business.

00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:22.860
 On their first night at work a party of four came along looking for rooms

00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:28.860
 And Henry, the complete businessman, took them to his house, only to find his parents had retired.

00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:32.860
 The scene opens in the all-rich dining room, the time, the next morning.

00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:34.860
 Sam! Sam!

00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:36.860
 I'm all ready for breakfast, Alice.

00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:37.860
 Is Henry up?

00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:39.860
 Well, I thought he was down here. He isn't in his room.

00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:42.860
 I certainly hope he hasn't gone back to his road stand.

00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:46.860
 Now, Alice, stop worrying. There's nothing wrong with Henry having spunk enough to go out and try to earn a little money.

00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:47.860
 Well, I know.

00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:50.860
 Break me, I like to see it, and we ought to do everything we can to encourage it.

00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:52.780
 Perhaps you're right, Sam.

00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:55.180
 What's that car doing out in front?

00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:56.180
 What car?

00:15:56.180 --> 00:15:58.380
 The one with the Illinois license on it.

00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:01.860
 Oh, apparently the kiln is next door having guests.

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:04.860
 I love they park in front of their own house.

00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:08.580
 When I sit down and drink your orange juice, I'll go out and get your eggs started.

00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:09.580
 Where's my paper?

00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:10.980
 Right there on the table.

00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:11.980
 Oh, yes.

00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:12.980
 Yes.

00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:15.860
 Sam, listen, isn't that Henry walking around upstairs?

00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:16.860
 It couldn't be.

00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:18.700
 Well, it certainly can't be Mary.

00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:19.700
 She's away, dear.

00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:22.500
 Then you don't hear any footsteps your imagination.

00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:24.740
 I heard Henry come down half an hour ago.

00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:28.580
 And Sam, where do you suppose all those things on the kitchen table came from?

00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:29.300
 What thing?

00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:32.500
 A dozen oranges, two dozen eggs, and a box of pablum.

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:35.380
 Didn't you order them from the store?

00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:36.900
 Pablum, of course I didn't.

00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:39.380
 Well, the grocer probably made a mistake.

00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:42.180
 Oh, well, yeah.

00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:46.180
 There's an embarrassing situation some fellow walked into.

00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:47.620
 Did you read about it in the paper?

00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:48.900
 No, what is it?

00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:52.900
 He lives in one of those real estate developments where all the houses look alike.

00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:57.900
 He came home the other night and went to bed and when he got up the next morning he found he had slept in the wrong house.

00:16:57.900 --> 00:17:01.900
 Imagine a thing like that.

00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:05.900
 Not only that, he slept in the wrong pajamas.

00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:07.900
 And not only that.

00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:11.900
 Hear your eggs and coffee.

00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:13.900
 Dear, do you want anything more? I'll be out in the kitchen.

00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:14.900
 Thank you, dear.

00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:20.900
 Ah, good morning. Is this the dining room in here?

00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:22.900
 [Laughter]

00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:24.900
 I beg your pardon?

00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:25.900
 What state are you from?

00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:26.900
 What state?

00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:28.900
 No, I'm from Illinois.

00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:29.900
 Name is Jackson.

00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:31.900
 Say, how are the meals here?

00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:32.900
 [Laughter]

00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:34.900
 Well, I've never heard any complaints.

00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:38.900
 I hope they're better than the beds, that's for sure.

00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:40.900
 How did you sleep last night?

00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:45.900
 Fairly well. You, uh, you, uh, know someone here at this house?

00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:48.900
 No, not a soul. We're total strangers here.

00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:51.900
 We, how many of you are there?

00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:54.900
 I'm a wife and myself and two grandchildren.

00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:56.900
 We were going to bring their aunt Molly too,

00:17:56.900 --> 00:17:58.900
 but she got sick at the last minute.

00:17:58.900 --> 00:17:59.900
 It's her old trouble.

00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:02.900
 The way that woman's ankles swell up.

00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:03.900
 I'm sorry to hear it.

00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:06.900
 Say, how do you get service around here?

00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:09.900
 If there's one thing I don't like to do, it's weight.

00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:11.900
 Sam, it is not necessary,

00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:13.900
 but you could tap on a glass when you want something.

00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:17.900
 something all you have to do with good morning ma'am

00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:21.020
 morning one order of buckwheat cakes

00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:26.420
 with syrup and send up two soft boiled eggs to my wife

00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:29.140
 Sam unless this gentleman is familiar no I

00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:33.980
 very nice I'm sure the children are coming down later

00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:37.140
 dear if you'll excuse me I'll go back to the kitchen

00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:40.500
 not a bad look at that's for sure

00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:43.500
 Well thank you I think so too.

00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:46.500
 Joseph are you downstairs?

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:47.500
 What do you want Millie?

00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:48.500
 Come here a minute!

00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:49.500
 Okay!

00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:54.500
 If anybody tries to take my place here tell them it's took will you?

00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:57.500
 Why don't you just tip your chair up?

00:18:57.500 --> 00:18:58.500
 Good idea.

00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:01.500
 When you're through with that newspaper save it for me will you?

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:02.500
 Yes I will.

00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:03.500
 Alice!

00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:04.500
 Alice!

00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:05.500
 Yes dear.

00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:07.500
 Alice are we in the right house?

00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:08.500
 Sam who is that?

00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:09.500
 Who is that man?

00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:10.500
 Where did you meet him?

00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:12.500
 I don't know any more about him than you do.

00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:15.500
 Personally, I'd say the fellow was lost and doesn't know it.

00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:16.500
 Where is he now?

00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:17.500
 Upstairs.

00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:19.500
 He thinks they're a grandchildren up there.

00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:20.500
 My goodness.

00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:25.500
 And you're sitting there letting an insane man wander around the house without doing anything.

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:27.500
 What would you suggest I do?

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:28.500
 Put him out there.

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:30.500
 Oh, that's all there is to it?

00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:32.500
 Perhaps he's suffering from amnesia.

00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:34.500
 You don't have to speak sharply to him.

00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:36.500
 Just leave him gently to the door and tell him to go.

00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:38.500
 Only thing you're supposing he resents it.

00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:41.060
 Well, if you speak to him carefully, he won't.

00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:42.760
 Shh, he's coming back downstairs.

00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:44.200
 You better step into the kitchen.

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:46.300
 Yes, dear, only be careful, Sam.

00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:48.300
 My griddle cakes here, yet?

00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:50.100
 Well, no, they aren't.

00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:52.700
 Frankly, this service here is very poor.

00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:55.700
 If I were you, I'd take my family

00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:58.500
 and try to mention house downtown the deep front door

00:19:58.500 --> 00:19:59.700
 is right out that way.

00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:01.400
 Where can we get a doctor?

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:02.300
 A doctor?

00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:03.700
 Yeah, for the grandchildren.

00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:05.300
 Oh, yes, the grandchildren.

00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:08.300
 Hey, where in the heck are my griddle cakes?

00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:10.060
 Now try to get them for you.

00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:11.940
 (bell rings)

00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:13.020
 - Yes?

00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:14.340
 Are you calling me?

00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:15.660
 - One order of griddle cakes,

00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:18.260
 and when you have time, please call a doctor.

00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:19.100
 - A doctor?

00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:21.140
 - That's right, a doctor and griddle cakes.

00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:23.100
 That's what Mr. Jackson wants,

00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:25.060
 and we do want to keep him happy.

00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:26.460
 That's for sure.

00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:29.040
 (upbeat music)

00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:39.040
 [Music]

00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:43.040
 Sam, have you any idea where Henry might have gone when he left the house this morning?

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:46.040
 No, and if he knows what's good for him, he won't come home.

00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:47.040
 [Laughter]

00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:48.040
 Has the doctor come yet?

00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:53.040
 He's upstairs now. And Mr. Jackson is out on the porch. Why don't you ask him what time he's leaving?

00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:57.040
 I did. Some time before dinner. Until then, we'll simply have to bear with him.

00:20:57.040 --> 00:21:01.080
 with them. Sam here comes another car it's stopping right in front of the house.

00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:06.540
 If Henry has sent any more people here. Oh it's only Will Brown. If you ask for

00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:10.120
 me I don't want to see him. We'll never hear the end of this. Good morning to the

00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:13.680
 owners who live here. Yes sir only I don't know whether they have any more

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:22.640
 rooms or not. Open up Sam I know you're in there. Oh hello Sam. Alice. Just

00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:25.320
 But I come over and see how business is.

00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:26.760
 - Our business is fine, thank you.

00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:28.480
 - Might a nice place you've got.

00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:29.640
 It's all right for a visit,

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:31.520
 but I wouldn't care to live here.

00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:32.640
 - Now look here, Will.

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:33.640
 - Where do I register?

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:35.840
 - Will, have you seen Henry or Homer?

00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:37.440
 - Not for the last hour.

00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:38.960
 - What were they doing when you did see them?

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:40.840
 - Talking about going down to railroad station

00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:42.600
 and meeting the incoming trains.

00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:44.240
 (audience laughing)

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:45.440
 - What's that?

00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:46.520
 (phone ringing)

00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:47.440
 - Who can that be?

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:49.760
 - Probably an inquiry about rates.

00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:50.880
 - Hello?

00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:52.160
 - Yeah?

00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:56.560
 What? No! Absolutely no!

00:21:56.560 --> 00:22:00.560
 Yes, that's right. And if Henry's there, please tell him to come home.

00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:03.660
 Oh, he left some time ago? Very well, goodbye.

00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:07.760
 Sam, you shouldn't turn any guests down like that.

00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:09.260
 Isn't the way to build goodwill?

00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:12.460
 That wasn't a guest, well, it was Mr. Sparrow. He called about a car.

00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:15.360
 The boys are trying to buy on time payments.

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:17.060
 They still want to get that old jar?

00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:18.260
 Oh, no, not anymore.

00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:21.860
 Mr. Sparrow says that now they're interested in a station wagon.

00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:23.580
 needed for their business.

00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:25.500
 Well, why not let them get it, Sam?

00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:27.700
 Didn't you say I liked their initiative?

00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:28.700
 If they ought to be encouraged.

00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:30.740
 Listen, well, I've taken quite enough from you.

00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:32.420
 Sam, the doctor wants to see you.

00:22:32.420 --> 00:22:33.260
 You want to see me?

00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:34.100
 Yes, dear.

00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:36.260
 Oh, you've got a doctor staying here, too.

00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:37.900
 Yeah, don't even speak to him.

00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:39.660
 You look upset, Al, it's what's the matter.

00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:40.740
 I am, Sam.

00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:42.660
 Do you know what the doctor thinks?

00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:45.020
 The two grandchildren have the measles.

00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:45.860
 The measles?

00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:47.340
 Well, I guess I'll be running along.

00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:49.100
 Well, do you know what that means?

00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:50.940
 We'll be cooked up with that whole family

00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:56.700

00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:16.740
 did not father we're making money hand over fist Henry do you realize that

00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:20.140
 those guests you brought home may be quarantined here.

00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:22.240
 Oh boy, at the regular rates.

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:25.040
 Hey, Henry, what is it you want?

00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:26.440
 A credit reference from Mr. Sparrow.

00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:26.940
 Yes, sir.

00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:29.240
 Well, anybody's enterprise and you deserve one.

00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:30.340
 You mean you'll help us, Mr. Bride?

00:23:30.340 --> 00:23:31.240
 I'd be glad to.

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:31.940
 Well, proud.

00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:32.740
 Oh boy.

00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:34.340
 So long, Sam.

00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:36.440
 What are I'm going to do if we help a boy?

00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:38.740
 Wasn't that what you said, Sam?

00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:42.740
 Sam, the doctor says that what the children have is one of two things.

00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:44.040
 Something worse than the measles?

00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:48.120
 No, he says it might just possibly be a strawberry rash.

00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:50.440
 He's the only trouble is Mrs. Jackson doesn't remember

00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:53.040
 giving the children any strawberries yesterday.

00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:55.360
 - Sure, Mother, they had strawberries yesterday.

00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:56.200
 - When?

00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:57.160
 - In the punch.

00:23:57.160 --> 00:23:59.800
 - Well, my goodness, Henry.

00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:03.440
 - Is there anything you and Homer didn't put in that punch?

00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:05.080
 - Well, not like a think of offhand.

00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:06.640
 - Oh, then it is a rash,

00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:10.040
 and Sam just think we won't be quarantined.

00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:12.200
 Oh, the house is our own again.

00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:13.480
 - Oh, Mr. Audrey!

00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:14.680
 Yes, Mr. Jackson?

00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:18.880
 I just wanted to say that if we find it is due to strawberries,

00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:20.980
 we'll be leaving the first thing in the morning.

00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:22.480
 You mean you're staying another?

00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:23.480
 Yes, mother?

00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:25.580
 Come out in the kitchen right this minute.

00:24:25.580 --> 00:24:27.080
 Y'all be right there.

00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:28.280
 Will it take long?

00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:30.680
 Homer and I are supposed to meet the bus from Chicago.

00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:31.580
 Wait a minute.

00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:37.480
 Mr. Allrich, I want you to know that we're going to tell everybody about your lovely roadhouse.

00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:40.980
 Well, Mr. Jackson, I'm afraid that all of our rooms for tonight are taken.

00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:42.180
 You mean you're all filled up?

00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:43.180
 I can't stay.

00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:46.880
 I can't tell you how disappointed I am, but there's another place in town that I can recommend.

00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:48.480
 The rooms are even more comfortable than ours.

00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:49.380
 Oh, very easy.

00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:51.580
 And as soon as you're packed, I'll show you the way over there.

00:24:51.580 --> 00:24:52.380
 Now if you'll excuse me...

00:24:52.380 --> 00:24:54.680
 Well, that's very nice of you.

00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:56.780
 Operator, get me sent a bill 631.

00:24:56.780 --> 00:24:57.280
 Yes, please.

00:24:57.280 --> 00:24:58.980
 I'll go right up and get packed.

00:24:58.980 --> 00:24:59.380
 Glend it.

00:24:59.380 --> 00:25:00.980
 Henry, I'm gonna have a talk with you.

00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:04.380
 Hey, are you really going to let Henry buy a station wagon on credit?

00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:05.780
 Over my dead body.

00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:08.380
 Hello, is this the Artcraft Sign Company?

00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:10.680
 I'd like to order a small sign.

00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:11.280
 Rush.

00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:15.880
 It's to read "Rums for Rent, Tourists, Welcome."

00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:17.520
 Got that? Fine.

00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:21.320
 And take it over and stick it on the front lawn of Will Brown's house.

00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:24.320

00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:43.600
 But Father, if you don't want to take in any more rumors,

00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:46.400
 which at least be willing to let me build some cabins...

00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:47.200
 Where?

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:48.480
 Out in the yard.

00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:51.840
 Henry, you may not build any cabins in our yard.

00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:54.320
 She whiz father with all my ideas for making money,

00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:55.520
 you just discourage me.

00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:58.480
 On the contrary, Henry, I'm going to let you make some money.

00:25:58.480 --> 00:25:59.680
 How, Father?

00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:02.280
 From now on, for every idea you get,

00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:04.800
 I pay you one dollar not to use it.

00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:14.800
