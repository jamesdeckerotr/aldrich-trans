 [Music]

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 Dello presents the Aldrich family written by Clifford Goldsmith and starring as Ristone.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 Henry Henry Aldrich! Coming Mother!

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
 [Applause]

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.500
 [Music]

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.000
 Now that autumn is on the doorstep, folks, the corner grocery store has begun to take on added color.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 Piled high on the fruit counter are heaps of shiny red cheek apples, yellow peaches and big glossy grapes.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 Yes, sir, it's a mighty attractive sight, but even more inviting is the sight of a bright, colorful, yellow fruit cup,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
 Made with some of the same apples, peaches, and grapes.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 Better yet, this swell dessert is wonderfully easy to prepare.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000
 You first arrange diced tart apples, seated grapes, and diced peaches and sherbet glasses.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
 Then make up one package of orange jello according to directions on the box,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 and pour over the fruit. Then chill, and take it from me friends, there is a real treat.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 A tough-notch treat that you can serve either as an appetizer or as a dessert.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 You'll be surprised to find how delightfully the cool tang of orange jello

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 blend with the rich flavor of ripe summer fruit.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
 Our jello makes a grand fruit cup taste even grander.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 So tomorrow try this tempting jello recipe,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 a combination of juicy red apples,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
 tender golden peaches, rich purple grapes,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
 and delicious orange jello.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 [Music]

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 All of us know a town like Centerville, a family like the Aldrich's, and all of us know a teenage boy like Henry Aldrich.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 Anything is likely to happen when Henry is around, and it usually does.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 As our scene opens tonight, we find Henry Aldrich in the dining room with his father and mother.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.500
 Mother, will you have some more peas?

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.500
 No, thank you. You've finished a few peas there or there.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.000
 Oh, I wouldn't think of touching them. Father, wouldn't you like these peas?

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.000
 No, thank you.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 I think you ought to have them, Father. I'll just scrape them into your plate.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.500
 Henry, I don't want them.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.500
 Would you like some bread, Mother? No, dear. Now, I just stopped passing things in eat.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.000
 Well, if you don't want anything, just ask for it, huh?

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.400
 Boy did I see a swell movie this afternoon.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.800
 I'm going out and get some butter.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.400
 Sit still, mother. I'll go out and get it.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.200
 I'll get it.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.400
 Give me the dish, mother.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.600
 My goodness, one would think you have nothing to do,

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.600
 but run around waiting on all of it.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.000
 Family, please tell me what's gotten into Henry.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.200
 I have no more idea than you.

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.400
 I offered him his allowance a few minutes ago,

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.600
 and he refused it.

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.200
 Well, something's wrong.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.200
 After dinner, you'd better take his temperature.

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.400
 Is your arm, mother? Will you have some butter?

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.200
 No, thank you.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.600
 Oh, go ahead and take a little.

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.600
 I have some here.

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.200
 Did I tell you I saw a movie this afternoon?

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.400
 I believe you did.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.800
 Boy was there a swell guy in it.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.600
 Sam, don't forget when you're downtown tomorrow

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.000
 to get two decks of cards and bring them home at noon.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000
 Oh, giving a bridge, Pardon?

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.800
 I am.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.400
 Well, listen, there's no reason in the world

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.300
 why I couldn't get those cards for you.

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:17.900
 That's what I was waiting for.

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.000
 Give him a dollar, Sam, if he wants to help.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.500
 Henry, are you quite sure none of this

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.300
 has anything to do with your conscience?

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:26.100
 My conscience?

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.200
 Mm-hmm.

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.400
 What conscience?

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.160
 Then you happen to me?

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.960
 No sir.

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.400
 I'm not surprised.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.400
 Mother, about how much do you spend a week on food?

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.400
 Well, Mary's away, about $14.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.400
 Well, from now on, I'm paying my share.

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.400
 Why, Henry, older, if you're not going to do anything of the kind.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.400
 Yes, I am, Mother. No more free eating for me.

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.400
 Have you struck oil, Henry?

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.400
 I haven't struck oil, but I've got a job.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.400
 How much do you think I ought to pay a week for my room?

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.400
 I have no idea.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.400
 Well, supposing I was a stranger here and you didn't know me.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.400
 And I came to the door and said, "I want a room.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.400
 How much would you charge me?"

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.400
 Personally, I wouldn't even let you in.

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:08.400
 Well, why not?

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.400
 Not if your hands look the way they do right this minute.

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.400
 Oh, she was out, go right up and wash them.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.400
 But before I go, let's settle on a price.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.400
 Would $3 a week be too much?

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.400
 What kind of a job do you have?

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.400
 You'll learn soon enough.

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.400
 I begin tomorrow morning and I'm going to give half of every cent of the day.

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.200
 of every cent I make to the Red Cross or something.

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:28.700
 Well, isn't that fine?

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:33.200
 That movie I saw this afternoon was called "The Generous Gentleman."

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.500
 And boy was it swell.

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.000
 The gentleman did kind things for everybody.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.600
 Did he?

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.200
 And did people like him?

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.600
 Even when he became old everybody liked him.

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:47.500
 And this swell looking girl that never liked him before finally fell in love with him.

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.300
 Henry, eat your mashed potatoes.

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:50.400
 Yes, follow me.

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.700
 From now on, I'm going to help my friends

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:55.500
 and do little things for strangers that are in trouble.

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.700
 And from now on, mother, you'll never have to tell me more than once to do anything.

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:03.200
 Then for the last time, will you please go up and wash your hands?

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:06.300
 Yes, mother, but first let me tell you how I'm going to help people.

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:21.800
 Young man, have I ever seen you around this golf course before?

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.140
 Well, I've been around it.

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:24.640
 Ever had any experience, kettie?

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:28.580
 Well, after all, there isn't much to carrying a bag of clubs is there.

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:29.680
 Oh.

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:33.040
 There were any other boys on hand. I wouldn't even consider you.

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:35.220
 Now, stand back when I put this ball on the tee.

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:38.160
 Yes, sir. But you don't have to worry about me.

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.460
 I know that when you're going to hit the ball, I should keep very quiet.

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:42.260
 That's fine.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.600
 Personally, I think if you're being paid to do something, you ought to do it.

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:46.000
 Mm-hmm.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.400
 Even if it's just to keep quiet.

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.240
 Do you want me to put that ball back on the tee for you?

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.440
 No, thank you. Just stand back.

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:54.040
 Yes, sir.

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:57.340
 And keep your eye on this ball when I hit it. I left my glasses at home.

00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:59.940
 Oh, gee, I have wonderful eyesight.

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:00.440
 Good.

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.940
 Yes, or everybody speaks about it.

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:06.140
 Have you seen the picture called the generous gentleman?

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:09.740
 Will you please stand back? I'd like to hit this ball.

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:11.140
 Oh, down there.

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:14.040
 Oh, I know who that is down there.

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.540
 What do you mean by yelling just as I swing?

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:17.840
 Oh, did I frighten you?

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:19.740
 I didn't make a terrible shot.

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:21.140
 Have you hit it already?

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:22.740
 Didn't you have your eye on it?

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:23.440
 Well, uh...

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:24.940
 We'll find it alright.

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:26.840
 It might have gone over here to the left.

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:28.140
 What makes you think so?

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:30.640
 Well, we'll look to the left first and then work around.

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:31.840
 Hmm...

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:34.540
 The reason I didn't hit it straight-er is because of this coat.

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:36.340
 Would you like to have me carry your coat?

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:37.540
 All the way around the course.

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:39.040
 Gee, I don't mind a little thing like that,

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:40.840
 especially if it helps anybody.

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:41.740
 Alright, here.

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:43.740
 I'll throw it right over my shoulder.

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:44.640
 Ah, Herbert.

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:45.140
 I am.

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:45.740
 Henry!

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:47.440
 I thought that was you.

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:49.540
 Well, a lot of balls out on this course.

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:51.800
 I picked up four just since I got here.

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:53.300
 -Caddy, have you found my ball?

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:57.640
 -Not yet, Mr. Eddie, but Herbert says this is a very good place to look for them.

00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:59.140
 -Here it is right here.

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:00.740
 -Oh, have we found it?

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:02.640
 I thought it would be to the left.

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:04.640
 -Let me have my machey.

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:06.240
 -Your machey?

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:09.040
 Do you think that's the best one to use for a shot like that?

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:10.840
 -I'd like my machey.

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:11.540
 -Yes, sir.

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:13.940
 -And when I hit the ball this time, keep your eye on it.

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:15.440
 -Yes, sir.

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:16.840
 No more talking.

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:19.340
 -And this other young man, don't stand so near.

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:23.660
 No sir. Herbert have you seen a picture called the generous gentleman?

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:27.020
 Young man. Yes sir. Herbert. Why?

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:32.460
 He's about to swing the club. Oh what's the name of that picture then we...

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:38.620
 Cathy may I ask who this young man is? Oh I guess I didn't introduce you did I?

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:43.260
 This is Herbert. How do you do sir? What are you doing here? I asked him to meet me here.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:48.300
 What for? He wants to learn how to caddy. I told him the easiest way would be to watch me.

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:49.300
 I see.

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:54.900
 Well, supposing Herbert, you go over and sit under that shady tree.

00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:57.900
 Not the nearest tree, not the one just beyond,

00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:01.000
 but the one way over on the far side of the fairway.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:01.700
 Yes, sir.

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:02.800
 Don't be hurt, Herbert.

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:05.900
 People that are new with this game are always easily upset.

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:07.700
 - Young man. - Yes, sir?

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:09.500
 - Have you your eye on this ball? - Yes, sir.

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:11.000
 - Very well, then. Here goes.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.900
 Gee, whiz, what a sock.

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:16.300
 - Where did it go? - It hit that tree.

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:19.300
 Where did you learn to shoot so straight?

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:22.000
 I never made a shot like that before.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.260
 I didn't think you should have used your mashy.

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:25.860
 The whole trouble is this sweater.

00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:28.060
 Oh, that's all right. Just take it off. I'll carry it.

00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:29.100
 You're sure you don't mind?

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:31.300
 Gee whiz, I'm here to serve you, aren't I?

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:33.020
 All right. Yeah.

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:35.100
 Give me the number three, iron.

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:36.060
 The number three?

00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:37.460
 Yes, sir.

00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:39.460
 You want me to roll that log out of your way?

00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:40.420
 No, thank you.

00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:42.300
 I'll show you how to put the ball right straight down

00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:42.900
 on that green.

00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:43.400
 OK.

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:44.900
 And don't say a word.

00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:54.540
 house. I was look at that ball travel herber almost in a circle. That's the

00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:59.460
 first time I ever made a shot like that. You know Mr. Eddie I had a feeling you

00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:03.380
 shouldn't use that number three. The trouble is my collar is too tight. Want

00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:06.780
 me to take your neck time? You sure it won't be too much trouble. No just roll

00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:10.380
 it up and stuff it in my pocket. Did you see where the ball landed? Yes sir.

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:14.860
 Do you see that clump of trees to the left? Uh huh. And that house on the other

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:19.260
 side of the road yes well it went right in the yard of the house just beyond

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:25.060
 how did it do that well I I guess you just laid into it all right all right

00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:28.140
 give me another ball there I'll hit it on down you go over and get that on the

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:31.660
 woman meet me at the green yes sir here you are I'll run all the way and don't

00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:36.860
 come back without that ball oh you don't have to worry I saw exactly where it

00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:40.020
 went I think

00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:40.180
 (

00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:50.020
 (Music)

00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:51.020
 (Coughing)

00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:53.020
 Pardon me.

00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:56.020
 Pardon me.

00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:58.020
 Was there something you wanted?

00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:01.020
 Did you see a golf ball land in your backyard?

00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:03.020
 Well if one did you better get it before a coffee does.

00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:04.020
 I should.

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:05.020
 Yeah.

00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:09.020
 Papa says it's because things like that that our chickens won't lay.

00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:11.020
 Hmm, I wonder where that one of mine went.

00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:14.020
 Well, I'd help you, only. I'm having some trouble with this garden hose.

00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:15.020
 What's the matter?

00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:18.020
 Well, the figure on the side of the house won't turn off.

00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:20.020
 Well, gee whiz, let me give you a hand.

00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:21.020
 Well, don't get all wet.

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:24.020
 Oh, don't worry about me. I can turn it.

00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:26.020
 Have you seen the generous gentleman?

00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:27.020
 No, what?

00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:30.020
 It's a slow picture I saw yesterday.

00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:33.020
 In it, a guy went out in the rain as a favor to somebody.

00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:34.020
 And guess what?

00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:36.620
 Guess what? He got soaking wet too.

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:37.520
 He did?

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:38.520
 Yeah.

00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:39.520
 Mmm.

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:40.520
 That's strange.

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:42.520
 Well, won't it turn off?

00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:43.520
 Mmm.

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:46.520
 You know, I think I can fix it.

00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:49.020
 Hey, say it's an issue ball right here.

00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:55.320
 So it is. Look, I think if I just slip the handle of this golf club into the spokes

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:58.320
 of a faucet, I can get a little leverage on it.

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:00.020
 Oh my goodness, look at your shoes.

00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:02.520
 Look, the club just fits in.

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:06.980
 Oh good gracious look at what you've done to it.

00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:07.980
 Imagine.

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:10.860
 I almost spend his number three iron double.

00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:12.220
 Look, can you straighten it?

00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:13.620
 I think I can.

00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:16.420
 Fortunately it's steel.

00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:17.700
 There.

00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:19.140
 Unless you held it right up to your eye,

00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:21.580
 you'd hardly notice it's been bent.

00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:24.140
 I'll try the force it once more.

00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:26.660
 Oh now look at what you've done.

00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:29.300
 She was, I broke it off.

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:30.700
 You don't have another force it to you.

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:31.940
 Oh of course we don't.

00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:32.940
 Do you have a telephone?

00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:33.940
 No we don't.

00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:35.940
 Well don't you have anything for an emergency like that?

00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:36.940
 No.

00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:37.940
 I'll tell you what I'll do.

00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:39.940
 I'll run over to the clubhouse and telephone for a plumber.

00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:41.940
 But how about the basement?

00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:42.940
 It's running right into it.

00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:45.940
 I'll have someone here before you know it.

00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:46.940
 Imagine this.

00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:47.940
 What is it?

00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:51.340
 I found a dollar in my pocket to get my mother some playing cards but I can get them with

00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:52.940
 the money I earn for tatting.

00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:53.940
 Here you take it.

00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:54.940
 What for?

00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:55.940
 To pay for the false?

00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:56.940
 Why should you pay for it?

00:11:56.940 --> 00:11:57.940
 Well I broke it didn't.

00:11:57.940 --> 00:11:58.940
 I hear it.

00:11:58.940 --> 00:11:59.940
 Go ahead you take it.

00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:00.940
 Well thank you.

00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:04.740
 I'll take these clubs in this sweater and coat and I'll run every step of the way.

00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:05.740
 Well hurry!

00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:08.940
 Goodbye and I'm very glad to have been a help to you.

00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:24.440
 Hey Henry is that you?

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:28.440
 Yes Herbert, does this road swing around at the clubhouse?

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:30.440
 Yeah, where have you been?

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:31.440
 I've been busy.

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:33.240
 Well, Mr. Ruddy says he needs you.

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:36.840
 I wonder whether I ought to help him a little before I put in that crawl.

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:39.340
 I see a ball, Henry. I'll see you later.

00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:40.340
 Hey, buddy.

00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:41.140
 Who's that?

00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:43.940
 Come back up here on the road a second. What do you my car's stuck in the mud?

00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:47.540
 The only trouble is I've got a couple other things to do.

00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:49.540
 Well, couldn't you land a full of our hands?

00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:50.740
 You need some help?

00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:51.940
 Yeah.

00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:54.540
 Well, maybe I can assist you.

00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:56.140
 Start your motor.

00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:01.940
 No, now don't start it quite so fast.

00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:02.740
 Okay.

00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:04.820
 Just start it real slow, see?

00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:13.380
 Look, I'll tell you what, back up until I stop moving my hand.

00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:15.060
 You won't let me drop into the ditch, will you?

00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:17.220
 Oh no, there's some boards over it.

00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:17.620
 Okay.

00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:19.620
 Come on.

00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:21.860
 Come on.

00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:29.220
 Oh, gee, whiz.

00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:32.220
 You ought to hear what I'm saying.

00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:35.220
 [audience laughter]

00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:38.220
 Mr. Du-- do you have a shovel?

00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:40.220
 What would I be doing with a shovel?

00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:42.220
 Well, you certainly need one.

00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:44.220
 [audience laughter]

00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:46.220
 Wait a minute, here comes a car behind you.

00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:49.220
 Hello there! Hello!

00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:51.220
 Would you please let me get by?

00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:53.220
 Could you pull up against this gentleman and push--

00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:55.220
 Oh, my goodness, I can't drive that well.

00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:57.520
 Well, would you like to have me take the wheel?

00:13:57.520 --> 00:13:59.420
 Oh, it won't take more than a minute.

00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:01.220
 I'm in a terrible hurry.

00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:02.420
 It won't take a second.

00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:06.020
 You better stand over there so you don't get any mud splashed on you.

00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:08.220
 Oh, that's very tough to look you on shore.

00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:10.520
 Gee whiz, that's the least I can do.

00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:14.520
 This reminds me of a moving picture that's in town this week.

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:15.720
 Oh, you're coming.

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:17.120
 Are you ready to head there?

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:18.320
 Come on.

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:19.320
 Here we go.

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:23.920
 Be careful.

00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:28.920
 (Laughter)

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:31.920
 Isn't that strange?

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:34.920
 How far are you?

00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:36.920
 Even deeper than you.

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:38.920
 And what am I to do?

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:42.920
 Well, I'll tell you, Miss. I've got to go to the clubhouse and phone a plumber anyhow.

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:46.920
 I'd be very glad to put in a call for a tow car at the same time.

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:48.920
 And in the meantime, I'm due downtown at court.

00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:49.920
 You're?

00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:52.920
 And if I'm not there, I have to forfeit $25.

00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:57.920
 Well my father's a lawyer and I'll phone him too and tell him to go down and fix things for you.

00:14:57.920 --> 00:14:58.920
 Are you sure he can?

00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:02.920
 Oh gee, he's like me. He likes to do things for people.

00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:04.920
 In the same way?

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:07.920
 Well I'll beat it over and phone right away.

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:09.920
 Well my name is Mrs. McGill.

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:10.920
 Yes ma'am.

00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:12.920
 And the charges are for talking back to an officer.

00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:14.920
 Yes ma'am.

00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:19.920
 And if you get a chance to see that picture of the guy that was so nice everyone, don't miss it.

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:21.920
 Henry I thought you were going to see Mr. Reddy.

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:27.520
 Mr. Reddy Herbert Herbert will you go over to the clubhouse for me? I can't Henry I'm finding too many balls

00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:31.240
 You are sure I just sold sex to Mr. Reddy well

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:34.680
 Where is he you go right through those trees there under the underbrush?

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:37.340
 Okay, and then go straight through to the swamp

00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:42.220
 Okay, tell them these boys to look in there though. I've already cleaned that part out

00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:45.200
 Mr. Eddie

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:46.000
 Oh

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.920
 Mr. Ready

00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:51.620
 Where have you been I just want to tell you I'll be right back

00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:52.620
 Where are you going?

00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:53.620
 It's a call of plumber.

00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:54.620
 What fall?

00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:55.620
 I got a lady in a ditch.

00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:56.620
 How did you get a lady in a ditch?

00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:58.620
 I was trying to get another guy out.

00:15:58.620 --> 00:15:59.620
 When?

00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:01.620
 Right after I busted a faucet for a girl.

00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:02.620
 What faucet?

00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:03.620
 The girls!

00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:06.620
 Would you like to wear your coat or sweater or anything?

00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:07.620
 I would not.

00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:09.620
 Boy have I been having a tough time.

00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:12.620
 You've been having a tough time.

00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:15.620
 I just played four holes with one club.

00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:18.620
 How did you do?

00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:20.620
 Young man, have you had a sunstroke?

00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:21.620
 Do I look pale?

00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:23.120
 Are you going to Cathy for me?

00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:24.320
 Well, I'll tell you, Mr. Ready.

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:26.420
 I'll give you two more clubs.

00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:28.320
 That ought to hold you while I go up on phones.

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:29.320
 Oh, no, you don't.

00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:30.420
 You can't eat an hour, never.

00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:33.120
 But you don't realize the position you're putting everyone in?

00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:34.320
 Come here with that bag.

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:35.220
 I can't help it.

00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:39.320
 You're going around with me if I have to drive you around with this club.

00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:51.320
 [Music]

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:57.320
 You know, folks, sometimes it's not the things Henry says, but the way he says them, that make all the difference in the world.

00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:01.320
 And that's true of a lot of things we all say. Take the simple phrase, "Oh yes."

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:05.320
 And just notice what a variety of meetings a person can put into it.

00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:10.720
 For example, suppose you were invited out to dinner, and your hostess asked you if you had ever heard of Jell-O.

00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:12.620
 Your answer would be as follows.

00:17:12.620 --> 00:17:13.720
 Oh, yes.

00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:19.320
 Then, when she informs you that there's to be Jell-O for dessert, you might say eagerly, "Oh, yes?"

00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:25.720
 And later, when she asks you if you want a second dish, you'll reply as sure to be, "Oh, yes!"

00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:29.620
 So you see, friends, it does make a big difference the way you may say a thing.

00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:33.020
 Now, that's true when you say, "Oh, yes!" to a second dish of Jell-O.

00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:36.520
 And it's just as true when you order a package of jello at the store.

00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:38.320
 Bear that in mind, ladies and gentlemen,

00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:40.720
 and the next time you ask the grocer for some jello,

00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:43.320
 don't just say, "I want some jello."

00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:45.520
 Say, "I want jello."

00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:48.020
 Then you can be sure of getting genuine jello

00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:50.520
 and jello's famous extra-rich flavor,

00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:53.720
 because jello is a trademark, the property of general foods.

00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:55.520
 And those big red letters on the box

00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:59.520
 assure you of getting America's favorite gelatin dessert, jello.

00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:08.520
 [Music]

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:14.520
 Now getting back to the troubles of Henry Albridge, Henry has decided to be kind and helpful to everyone he meets.

00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:16.520
 So far he's done very well.

00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:23.520
 While carrying on the golf course for a Mr. Eddie, he's broken a water spigot and run two cars into a muddy ditch.

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:26.520
 Well, as the scene opens, Henry is speaking.

00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:31.520
 Mr. Ready. Mr. Ready.

00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:36.520
 As soon as you've knocked the ball over this water hazard, could I just run up and foam?

00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:38.520
 Give me my number three iron.

00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:41.520
 You're a number three iron?

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:45.520
 Isn't that the one you used that took me away for so long?

00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:47.520
 May I have it?

00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:49.520
 Yes, Mr. Ready.

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:51.520
 Then may I put in that call?

00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:52.520
 Stand back, please.

00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:53.520
 Yes, sir.

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:57.520
 You know if I hadn't left my glasses behind, I'd swear this club was crooked.

00:18:57.520 --> 00:19:00.520
 You really think so?

00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:01.520
 Henry!

00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:02.520
 What, Herbert?

00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:04.520
 Which way are you going to have that for?

00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:07.520
 Over the water hazard and you keep away from it.

00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:08.520
 Come here, Herbert.

00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:10.520
 For...

00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:12.520
 Boy, what a shot!

00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:16.520
 I was the... I was the... I was the... I was the head of each club.

00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:20.520
 I never did a thing like that before.

00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:22.520
 See, they certainly make clubs poorly nowadays.

00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:25.040
 Nowadays give me my number two iron mr.

00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:31.040
 Eddie I really think you ought to let me pay for that number three what became of my ball Herbert put that ball back

00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:35.580
 I just want to see what it was this who's did you think it would be it's yours all right?

00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:43.160
 Herbert could you step over here to one side a minute? Well you have now then let's see what this iron does listen Herbert

00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:48.360
 I want you to go to the clubhouse and put in three phone calls if they won't let you say it's for mr

00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:51.360
 One call is to a plumber to shut off some water.

00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:53.360
 One is to a garage.

00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:07.360
 Miss Pearson?

00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:08.360
 Yes, Mr. Olich.

00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:09.360
 Will you take a letter, please?

00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:11.360
 Mr. Olich, while you were at a launch,

00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:14.360
 a young man by the name of Herbert Thompson, telephone.

00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:15.360
 Herbert?

00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:17.360
 Oh, Henry's friend, what did he want?

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:20.360
 Well, the fact is he seemed rather confused.

00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:23.360
 At any rate, you're going to go down to court at once and help get Henry out of trouble.

00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:24.360
 What kind of trouble?

00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:27.360
 All I understand was your son has talked back to some officers.

00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:30.360
 That's a fine thing. I can't possibly go down.

00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:32.360
 I'm scheduled for a conference.

00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:35.360
 Impertance to an officer, huh? What do you say to him?

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:36.360
 I don't know.

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:40.360
 Well, Henry can just stay down there. I don't believe in interfering with the law.

00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:44.360
 I understand if you don't straighten things out, the fine will be $25.

00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:48.760
 Twenty five dollars twenty call the committee and tell them I'll be late.

00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:49.720
 You're going to court.

00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:50.520
 Of course I am.

00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:53.400
 I can't afford to pay twenty five dollars anymore than anyone else can.

00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:54.560
 Who's that?

00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:55.360
 I have no idea.

00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:57.000
 Hello.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.480
 Yes.

00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:00.760
 One moment.

00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:02.000
 Mr.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.200
 Aldrich I have a message for you.

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:03.760
 Who is it?

00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:04.160
 Mrs.

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:08.480
 Aldrich says she has a whole house full of guests waiting to play bridge and there aren't any cards.

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:09.880
 Didn't Henry get them.

00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:10.880
 He doesn't seem to have.

00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:15.280
 Well, here, take this dollar, close up the office and get her some cards.

00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:30.080
 Excuse me, sir.

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:31.280
 What is it, young man?

00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:33.880
 Have you seen Mr. Eddie around the clubhouse here?

00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:35.880
 Oh, Mr. Eddie is still down the locker room.

00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:40.080
 Well, will you tell him I found his coat, but I'm sorry we mislaid his sweater.

00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:41.080
 Yes, sir.

00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:42.680
 One moment, young man.

00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:43.880
 Oh, I, uh...

00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:46.180
 I found your coat, Mr. Eddie.

00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:48.180
 But I think I ought to tell you.

00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:52.280
 The fellow with the lawnmower ran over one of the sleeves.

00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:53.380
 He did.

00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:54.680
 Well, I'm not surprised.

00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:58.280
 But, Mr. Eddie, all I was trying to do when I carried it was to help you.

00:21:58.280 --> 00:21:58.780
 Yes.

00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:00.480
 I was trying to serve you.

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:03.780
 Yes, 50-75-1 dollar.

00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:06.580
 Now, let's just forget that we ever even met.

00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:09.380
 Well, frankly, I don't feel I should even take the money.

00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:12.380
 Just take it and let's not say anything more about it.

00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:15.780
 There's just one thing for which I suppose I ought to thank you.

00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:16.480
 What's that?

00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:20.580
 For 15 years my wife has been trying to get me to give up golf.

00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:22.580
 Today I'm giving it up.

00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:24.580
 Forever?

00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:25.180
 Forever.

00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:26.980
 Well I'm certainly sorry.

00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:28.780
 Let's not discuss it anymore.

00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:32.080
 If we ever meet on the street let's not even speak to each other.

00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:33.280
 Yes Mr. Eddie.

00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:36.980
 Now then do you think you can do one more thing for me and do it right?

00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:39.080
 Oh yes or anything you say.

00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:44.080
 All right. Go around in front of the clubhouse and tell the boy to bring my car here.

00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:44.580
 Yes, sir.

00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:48.080
 But don't you go near the car. Don't you even touch the car.

00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:51.180
 No, sir. And will you be... Where will you be here? I mean...

00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:55.180
 I will be right over here at the desk talking to Mr. Blotman.

00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:57.680
 Yes, sir. Did you want me, Mr. Eddie?

00:22:57.680 --> 00:23:00.080
 I do. Something gone wrong, Mr. Eddie.

00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:06.080
 Wrong? Wrong? I just want to tell you what I think of the way your entire club is wrong.

00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:07.780
 Did something in particular go wrong?

00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:15.780
 I... I hired a caddy to look for my golf balls and I spent my whole day looking for my caddy.

00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:18.780
 Well, do you know what my score was?

00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:20.780
 185.

00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:26.780
 Well, I usually do it in 120.

00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:32.780
 And then to add insult to injury, I come into the locker room looking forward to a shower.

00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:35.780
 Oh, just a minute, Mr. Eddy. That's something I want to catch up with.

00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:42.140
 I get under the shower and in the midst of my bath the water is shut off.

00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:44.140
 Completely shut off!

00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:45.700
 But that's what I want to explain.

00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:47.980
 It's something over which we had no control.

00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:53.100
 Through some misdirection a plumber came here and unknown to us shut off all the water

00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:54.100
 in the clubhouse.

00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:55.100
 Why?

00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:57.980
 Well all we know is some young man called in.

00:23:57.980 --> 00:23:58.980
 That is no excuse.

00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:03.940
 The fact still remains that underneath my clothes right this minute I am covered with

00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:10.940
 sopesons. Well, I'm very sorry. Sorry. Did you ever walk around with suds on you?

00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:13.940
 Oh, no, sir. Try it sometime.

00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:18.940
 Mr. Ready. Mr. Ready, I have some rather disconcerting news for you.

00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:22.940
 Now, what happened? Was yours a black roadster?

00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:28.940
 What has happened to it? Nothing except that the fella out in front says that sometime this afternoon,

00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:31.940
 a man from a garage came and towed it away.

00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:32.940
 told it away.

00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:34.820
 Told it, who told him to do that?

00:24:34.820 --> 00:24:35.820
 He didn't know.

00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:38.940
 He just said somebody had phoned for him to come and get it.

00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:41.940

00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:54.860
 Father.

00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:56.940
 Father, would you like some more, Butter?

00:24:56.940 --> 00:24:58.540
 No, thank you.

00:24:58.540 --> 00:25:00.620
 Are you sure you're going to have enough?

00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:04.180
 Henry, if I were you, I wouldn't bother your father anymore.

00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:05.180
 Oh.

00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:07.140
 Is he tired, Mother?

00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:08.780
 He is.

00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:11.260
 Both tired and embarrassed.

00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:13.460
 Did something go wrong?

00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:14.860
 Not a thing.

00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:19.900
 All I did was miss a yearly business meeting in order to bail my son out of jail for talking

00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:23.100
 back to an officer who didn't know anything about it.

00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:25.900
 Father, that was entirely Herbert's fault.

00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:26.900
 Oh, no.

00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:27.900
 No, it wasn't.

00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:28.900
 It was your fault.

00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:34.000
 kind to someone you didn't even know. Well it's a funny thing but things didn't

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:38.880
 work out like this in the generous gentleman. Did the generous gentleman forget to bring

00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:43.160
 cards for his mother's bridge party? Mother I'm going to pay you back that dollar you

00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:48.400
 gave me for the cards. I really am. I'd give you what I earned this afternoon only.

00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:55.560
 I paid that to Mrs. McGill toward her fine. You gave your dollar to Mrs. McGill? Yes sir.

00:25:55.560 --> 00:26:02.640
 And I told her if there was ever anything I could do to help her, I'd be very glad to.

00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:04.240
 And what did she say?

00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:07.200
 She said she was quite sure there wasn't a thing I could do.

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:09.720
 Oh, I'll answer the phone, Mother.

00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:10.720
 Just beat your dinner.

00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:11.720
 I'll see who it is.

00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:13.280
 Yes, Mother.

00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:17.120
 Head Ray, when does school start?

00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:20.320
 In a few days.

00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:21.800
 Why?

00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:22.800
 No reason.

00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:25.040
 I was just wondering.

00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:26.920
 Is there anything I can pass your phone?

00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:29.080
 No, no, no, thank you.

00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:32.720
 Gee, the more I think about how Herbert Baldwin

00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:33.880
 brings up today.

00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:36.200
 Hey, do you know Mr. Eddie?

00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:37.400
 Mr. Eddie?

00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:39.080
 Yeah, in a way, why?

00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:40.800
 He just phoned for me?

00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:43.040
 Does he want me to caddy form the moron?

00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:46.400
 He wants to know whether you have his necktie.

00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:48.680
 Oh, gee, I've got it in my pocket.

00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:49.920
 I'll take it to him tomorrow.

00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:51.920
 He said you're not to take it to him.

00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:53.120
 You're to mail it to him.

00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:58.960
 Well, that's certainly very thoughtful of them, because I'd plan to do something else

00:26:58.960 --> 00:26:59.960
 tomorrow.

00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:00.960
 What?

00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:05.640
 Well, I wasn't able to give the Red Cross any money today, and I thought I'd go over

00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:07.520
 and help them instead.

00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:09.080
 Here Henry is a dollar.

00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:10.080
 A dollar?

00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:11.080
 What for?

00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:12.080
 For the Red Cross.

00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:15.240
 They're having enough problems without you're going over and helping them.

00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:41.240
 [Music]

00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:46.940
 Butter, eggs, potatoes, and flour are food products that housewives refer to as staples.

00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:50.840
 Foods that have a variety of uses and must always be kept on hand.

00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:54.240
 And the same definition fits jello and jello puddings too.

00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:56.940
 They're really what you might call staple desserts,

00:27:56.940 --> 00:28:00.740
 because they're so handy, so easy to adapt to different recipes

00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:04.240
 that they've won an established place on the average pantry shell.

00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:10.640
 You'll find that jello and jello puddings are simple to make, inexpensive, and truly delicious.

00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:13.640
 So ask your grocer for both of these swell desserts tomorrow.

00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:15.640
 Jello and Jello would it?

00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:28.640
 Henry, I want to tell you how nicely you helped with the dishes.

00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:30.640
 Thank you, Mother. Thank you very much.

00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:33.640
 Could I go out to the movies this evening? There's a swell picture.

00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:34.640
 What's the name of it?

00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:35.640
 Jesse James.

00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:38.640
 No, for one week you're not to go inside a movie.

00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:39.640
 movie.

00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:50.480
 The

00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:54.840
 Aldrich family starring as Ristone is written by Clifford Goldsmith. Original music is

00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:59.400
 composed and conducted by Jack Miller. Listen every Thursday night to the Maxwell House

00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:04.280
 Good News show and the Aldrich family which immediately follows it. Remember, 60 solid

00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:08.840
 minutes of brand entertainment every Thursday night. Now this is Harry Van Zell saying

00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:14.840
 good night for Jell-O, America's favorite gelatin dessert. Now pleasing more people than ever.

00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:27.720
 This is the National Broadcasting Company.

00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:29.960

00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:32.040

00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:34.120
