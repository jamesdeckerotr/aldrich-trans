00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 Henry Henry, old great coming mother.

00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 [Applause]

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 Yes, it's the oldest family, transcribed and written by Clifford Goldsmith.

00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 Everyone knows Centerville, USA, because it's your own hometown,

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 and everyone knows the Aldrich family because they're your very next-door neighbors.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 And everyone especially knows Henry Aldrich,

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 Because he's your son's pal, your daughter's boyfriend, a real American boy.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 The scene is the Aldridge living room, the time is early evening.

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 Henry, get washed, dinner's almost ready.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 All right, mother.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 Sam, I think Henry's getting ideas again about my birthday present this year.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 I hope you gave him a clear hint as to what I wanted.

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 I did.

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 A clear hint?

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 I told him you wanted Hemingway's new book, The Old Man in the Sea.

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,600
 Is that a clear hint?

20
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,480
 Well, Henry, I'm not sure.

21
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,200
 Did he say anything?

22
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,640
 No, but I had a definite feeling

23
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,400
 he was wondering why you were interested

24
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,600
 in other old men when you had me.

25
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,320
 Not dear.

26
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,480
 I just hope it sinks in.

27
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,880
 I don't want another pair of Siamese fighting fish

28
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,200
 like last year.

29
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,880
 It was depressing the way those two fish hated each other.

30
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:39,800
 Father?

31
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,840
 I've been here with your mother, Henry.

32
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,240
 Jimus, I didn't mean to interrupt.

33
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,360
 It's all right, dear.

34
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:48,600
 I was just telling your father how much I wanted to read the old man in the sea.

35
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,720
 The old man and...

36
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,360
 What's that mother?

37
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,400
 Sam.

38
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,960
 I'll try again.

39
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:57,600
 Father, did I tell you what I'm going to put over on Charlie Clark?

40
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,480
 Boy, am I going to make money.

41
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,400
 Put over on him.

42
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,040
 Henry, I hope you're not planning to do something you shouldn't.

43
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:03,880
 Oh, no.

44
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:06,520
 Charlie wants to buy this flashlight, see?

45
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,000
 And I'm going to...

46
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,080
 You're telling the flashlight I bought you this summer?

47
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,760
 Oh, no, sir. One just like it.

48
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:11,840
 Looks the same to me.

49
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,960
 Well, sure.

50
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,040
 They're both super ray hydrogent cosmic beams.

51
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,480
 Only this one doesn't work.

52
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,340
 Oh.

53
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:21,120
 Charlie wants to buy my super ray hydrogent cosmic beam.

54
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,040
 Only I wouldn't sell it, see.

55
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,880
 But today I happen to be talking to another guy.

56
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,320
 And he said, just casually, do you

57
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:30,120
 want to buy a super ray hydrogent cosmic beam?

58
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,400
 And it was exactly like mine, except for the difference.

59
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,280
 So I said, I'll give you $0.25 for it.

60
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,280
 He said, $30.

61
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,720
 I said, no, $25.

62
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,240
 He said--

63
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,760
 How much did you finally pay for it?

64
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,160
 $0.30.

65
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:48,160
 And now you have two super hyped something or other cosmic beams?

66
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,160
 Well, sure.

67
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,160
 But isn't it clear, Father?

68
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:57,160
 I'll buy batteries for 25 cents, so one flashlight to Charlie for a dollar and make 50 cents clear for profit.

69
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,160
 Mmm.

70
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,160
 Father, would you care to take a look at it?

71
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,160
 Why should I look at it?

72
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:04,160
 Boy, just tell me, maybe you'd like to make an offer.

73
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,160
 I have a flashlight.

74
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:08,160
 But do you have one you can buy for a dollar?

75
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,160
 I mean, well, this one will help you see where you're going.

76
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,760
 I'm sorry, Henry, but I know where I'm going.

77
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,760
 Mother, would you like to get in on the opportunity?

78
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,560
 Mother, I think the potatoes are ready.

79
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,760
 Be right there, Mary.

80
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,660
 Would you, Mother?

81
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,160
 No, thank you, Henry.

82
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,760
 You wouldn't be interested in owning something

83
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,560
 that could keep you from stumbling over stuff?

84
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,760
 Mother?

85
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,960
 Apparently she'd rather stumble.

86
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,560
 [LAUGHTER]

87
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,860
 Father, now that Mother's going, I can tell you

88
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,360
 why I'm making all this money.

89
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,160
 Oh, all right.

90
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,360
 It's for her birthday.

91
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,560
 Well, I thought you had some money, at least enough,

92
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,560
 to give her that book she wants.

93
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,800
 Well, I have, Father, but I certainly don't want to give her just a book for her birthday.

94
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:51,200
 After she's slaved over me all these years, she wants Hemingway's book, son.

95
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,880
 This flashlight is only the beginning. I'll make at least 50 cents on it.

96
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:58,880
 Then I'll invest that and double it. Then I'll invest that and triple it.

97
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,760
 She's by the time her birthday comes around, I can get her anything.

98
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,560
 What she wants, Henry, is the book.

99
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,440
 Henry?

100
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,240
 Yes, Mother?

101
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,240
 Will you answer the phone, please?

102
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,240
 And if it's for you, keep it short.

103
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,540
 Dinner's in five minutes.

104
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:13,340
 Sure, Mother.

105
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:16,540
 You know, Father, I wonder why more people don't go into business.

106
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:18,440
 Please answer the phone.

107
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:18,940
 Yes, sir.

108
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:21,340
 I'm answering it.

109
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:22,240
 Hello?

110
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,340
 Henry, my mother said you wanted me to call you about something,

111
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:28,440
 and I'm also to say we've got to eat in three minutes.

112
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,640
 Oh, is that you, Charlie?

113
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:33,340
 Hello, Charlie, old timer?

114
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,640
 What do you want, Henry?

115
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,940
 It's a great opportunity, Charlie.

116
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:40,940
 I've located a swell super ray hydrojet cosmic beam.

117
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:41,940
 So what?

118
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:44,940
 Well, I might be willing to sell it to you.

119
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:46,940
 I don't want one anymore.

120
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:47,940
 You don't want one?

121
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:50,940
 I'm going to save up and get a camera.

122
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:53,940
 Oh gee whiz Charlie, that leaves me holding two super...

123
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,940
 That's no way to do business.

124
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:58,940
 Who's talking about business? I just want a camera now.

125
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:02,940
 Well, wouldn't you like a flashlight so you could see where you're going?

126
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:05,940
 I'd rather take pictures and see where I've been.

127
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,940
 But Charlie, so long.

128
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,940
 Oh boy.

129
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:11,940
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

130
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:26,460
 I've got to go to class, Henry.

131
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:29,060
 Either you do or you don't want to buy this camera.

132
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:32,460
 But home or $2 for a second hand camera?

133
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:35,420
 You sound like my mother at the meat market.

134
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:36,420
 Wait a minute.

135
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:39,380
 Would you take this Super Ray Hydro Jet Cosmic Beam for it?

136
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:40,380
 That?

137
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:41,380
 Well gee, let's see it.

138
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:43,380
 It doesn't like any ordinary flashlight.

139
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,380
 Well let's see.

140
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:48,140
 Just press the old Super Ray button here and well if you had a battery you'd get your

141
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:49,140
 cosmic beam.

142
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,140
 Oh boy.

143
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:51,660
 I don't want it.

144
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:56,180
 I'll wait a minute Homer.

145
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:58,140
 I'm not asking you to pay me for this.

146
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:00,300
 I'll give it to you for the camera.

147
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:04,460
 Well give me the Super Ray Hydro Jet Cosmic Beam and a dollar.

148
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:07,860
 I'll give you the super ray hydrojet cosmic beam in 50 cents.

149
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:08,360
 A dollar.

150
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:08,760
 Fifty.

151
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,360
 Seventy-five.

152
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:09,760
 Sixty.

153
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,860
 Sixty-five.

154
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:11,360
 So.

155
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:11,860
 So.

156
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:13,560
 [LAUGHTER]

157
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,460
 You know Homer, that's the way I like to do business.

158
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:19,660
 And if you see Charlie Clark, tell him I've got something for him.

159
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,660
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

160
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:30,560
 But she, wisdom, other Charlie's only coming over for a little while

161
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,160
 tonight.

162
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,360
 For how long, dear?

163
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:38,960
 probably haggle a little. How long will it take you to haggle? It depends on who's the best haggler.

164
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:44,560
 Only I'm sure I can out haggle him. Henry, your pardon by mentioning anything is unimportant

165
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:50,000
 his homework. It's perfectly all right, Father. Thank you. When are you going to attend to it?

166
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,680
 Just as soon as I've cleaned up Charlie. And don't worry, Father. The assignment tonight is a breeze.

167
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,920
 It's an essay and I've got it all down in my mind. And may I suggest you start transferring it

168
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,680
 it from your mind to paper.

169
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,880
 Pardon?

170
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,680
 Start writing.

171
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,880
 Well, it won't take me a half hour, honest.

172
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,320
 We all have to write about the profession

173
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,120
 I am preparing for.

174
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,320
 Well, that's fine.

175
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,600
 You know, I wasn't much older than you when I started

176
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,960
 thinking seriously about preparing myself for law.

177
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,800
 For law, huh?

178
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,280
 For law?

179
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,920
 Well, the only thing that really appeals to me

180
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,960
 is selling things.

181
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,280
 Selling things?

182
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,160
 Sure.

183
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:28,520
 I buy something for a little, and I sell it to you for a lot.

184
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,520
 Why do you want to do that, dear?

185
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:33,520
 Oh, she, mother, I guess I have an act for it, that's all.

186
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:38,020
 Maybe it's hereditary. Did we ever have any tycoons in our family?

187
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:43,320
 I don't mind your shooting, hi, son, but don't overlook the legal profession.

188
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,320
 Well...

189
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,820
 It isn't bad, you know.

190
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:49,820
 I provided a very comfortable home here, haven't I? As a lawyer?

191
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,220
 Well, sure, father.

192
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:54,120
 But wasn't the man that sold it to you a business man?

193
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:54,820
 He was.

194
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,020
 There you are.

195
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,520
 He's got all your money and all you got was this house.

196
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,720
 Boy, I hope that isn't Charlie yet.

197
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,040
 But you're expecting him.

198
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,680
 Only Toby's supposed to get here first.

199
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,840
 I agreed to Charlie, but Toby...

200
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,320
 He's part of the same deal, mother.

201
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:11,400
 If you want to see how big business operates, stick around.

202
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,000
 Bang.

203
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,320
 Oh boy, Toby, for a minute I was afraid you were Charlie.

204
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,280
 Well, I'm not. I know it. Come on in.

205
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,960
 What do you want me to come over for?

206
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,680
 I want you to help me do something.

207
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,240
 Come on, Toby. We'll go in the dining room.

208
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,500
 What's that about, Henry?

209
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,460
 First of all, you're positive you don't want to buy a camera.

210
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:33,460
 Henry, I'm in the position of not being able to buy even a package or chewing gum.

211
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:36,580
 Well, look, maybe we can work a little commission out of this.

212
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:39,180
 Charlie Clark does want to buy it, see.

213
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:40,780
 But he'll try to get it from me cheap.

214
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:42,060
 And what do I do?

215
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:43,840
 You'll wait out here alone, see?

216
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:49,660
 And then when you hear Charlie make an offer on my camera, you come into the living room as though you wanted it, and offer 10 cents more.

217
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:52,600
 But, Henry, I just explained my financial situation.

218
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,360
 You don't need any money, Toby.

219
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,360
 This is just a way to encourage business.

220
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,760
 Henry, you have another guess.

221
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,660
 Yes, mother, I'm getting things ready for him.

222
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:03,160
 I raised Charlie 10 cents.

223
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:03,760
 Sure.

224
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,260
 OK.

225
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,360
 Now stay here.

226
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,560
 While I go into the living room.

227
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,260
 OK.

228
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,060
 Henry.

229
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:09,360
 Coming, father.

230
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,560
 Hello, Henry.

231
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,960
 Hi there, Charlie.

232
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,260
 Sit on, my friend.

233
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:17,460
 Oh, uh, mother, father, do you mind if we discuss

234
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:19,360
 a little business in front of you?

235
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,160
 Of course, someday when I have my own office.

236
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:21,660
 Thank you.

237
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:24,260
 but I think I'll do some work out in the garage.

238
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:25,560
 - Well, there's a frost tonight.

239
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,600
 Sam is too cold to work out there.

240
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,700
 - Then the basement.

241
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:29,960
 - But if you really like to stay here--

242
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,760
 - I'm not that bloodthirsty.

243
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:35,640
 - Sam, I wanna show you where I'd like another shelf for preserves.

244
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:40,340
 - What did your father mean about not being bloodthirsty?

245
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:43,880
 - Well, it's just a family expression.

246
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,840
 Here, Charlie, take a more comfortable chair.

247
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,440
 - What's wrong with this?

248
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:51,080
 - Well, I just thought you'd feel better with your head, tip back.

249
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,080
 Nah.

250
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,080
 Um...

251
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,080
 How was it out, Charlie?

252
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,580
 Still cold?

253
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:59,080
 Ice on the puddles.

254
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,380
 Early for this time of year.

255
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:02,380
 Mm-hmm.

256
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:05,180
 How's your family?

257
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:06,880
 They're pretty well.

258
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,080
 My sister was just vaccinated on her arm.

259
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,480
 Say that reminds me.

260
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,780
 Still need a camera?

261
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,580
 Know where I could get one?

262
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:16,580
 A cheap?

263
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:19,280
 I think I could put my hands on one.

264
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,680
 What's that in your pocket?

265
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,980
 This?

266
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,180
 Well, I'll be dog gone.

267
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:25,480
 It's a camera.

268
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,380
 Let's see it.

269
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:28,080
 Too bad I can't sell it to you.

270
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:28,980
 You can't?

271
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:29,780
 No.

272
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:32,780
 Not for less than $2.00 anyhow.

273
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:33,780
 Did you hear me, Charlie?

274
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:36,080
 I say not for less than $2.00.

275
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,080
 I heard you.

276
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,580
 Of course, if you don't want it, I have someone that is interested.

277
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:40,780
 Yeah?

278
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:42,780
 In just a second.

279
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:46,380
 I thought I heard something out toward the dining room.

280
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,080
 Like what?

281
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:48,580
 Nothing.

282
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:49,980
 I guess I didn't.

283
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:52,780
 You offered me two dollars Charlie?

284
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:54,880
 I can hear you Henry.

285
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,680
 I said two dollars Charlie?

286
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,380
 I haven't got that much.

287
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:02,080
 Oh, well how much have you got?

288
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,580
 50 cents.

289
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:06,580
 50 cents, that's all?

290
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:08,580
 Yeah, take back your camera.

291
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:10,680
 -But Charlie? -I thought you wanted a camera.

292
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,480
 I do. Well how are you gonna buy it with only 50 cents?

293
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,580
 That's what I'm telling you, I can't.

294
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:18,780
 But Charlie, don't you have any sense of responsibility?

295
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:21,780
 Would you let me swap you anything for it?

296
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:23,780
 What have you got?

297
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:29,780
 Well, would you be interested in a thing that's at home in our attic that cost $8.95 when it was new?

298
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:34,780
 Hey, what is it? A very good beach umbrella.

299
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:36,780
 What?

300
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:39,780
 Didn't you ever hear of a beach umbrella?

301
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,780
 What would I do with it? Sit under it!

302
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:44,780
 So you don't get sunburned.

303
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:47,780
 Don't you know anyone that wouldn't like to get sunburned?

304
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:50,380
 Well, I might be able to do something with it.

305
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:53,380
 It's still as good as new. It's hardly ever been sat on that.

306
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:56,380
 You'll swap it for this camera and $1.

307
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:59,480
 Now, wait, Charlie. You aren't supposed to be selling me anything.

308
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,180
 I'm selling you something.

309
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,180
 That's why I invited you over.

310
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:07,980
 Look, I'll give you the camera and 50 cents for the umbrella.

311
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:08,980
 50 cents!

312
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,180
 60 cents!

313
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:10,980
 Who said that?

314
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,180
 I said it.

315
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,780
 But, you whizzer, you hear Toby?

316
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:16,980
 Sure. Our father's banana and the kitchen, is it all art?

317
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:21,140
 Toby off a sixty Henry do you make up seven but listen I'm like a day now wait

318
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:24,140
 Toby you don't even know what this is about he made it 80 cents didn't he

319
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:28,660

320

00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:40,380

322
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:44,020
 sure let's do that Henry I certainly hope you aren't planning to go out in the

323
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:47,940
 cold without your windbreaker on. Well it's only to get a beach umbrella mother

324
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:52,900
 that costs eight dollars and ninety five cents. I'll be back before you know it.

325
00:12:52,900 --> 00:13:10,180
 Hello Mrs. Foye. This is Mary Aldrich. I'm not interrupting your dinner am I? Oh fine.

326
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:14,820
 Yes, we finished quite a while ago too.

327
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:17,540
 In a way, that's why I'm calling.

328
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:20,420
 By any chance of you seeing my brother tonight.

329
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:23,020
 He did.

330
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:24,020
 Jerry, are you calling?

331
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:24,860
 Yes, another.

332
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:27,420
 Well, if he comes by again,

333
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:29,580
 will you tell him to come home?

334
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:30,940
 Thank you.

335
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:31,820
 Goodbye.

336
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:35,380
 Henry was there, and Mrs. Boy, he's all confused

337
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:37,180
 because he went into a long rigamar

338
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:39,500
 all about the dangers of winter sun.

339
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,500
 - Oh, really?

340
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,060
 Well, this time, Henry will simply have to go

341
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:44,540
 without his dinner.

342
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:46,140
 - Hi, everybody.

343
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:47,300
 - Evening, mother.

344
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,720
 - I don't even want to bite to eat.

345
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,560
 - Good.

346
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,540
 I wouldn't even think of troubling you.

347
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:53,340
 - Fine, and my conscience won't bother me.

348
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,740
 - Henry, where have you been?

349
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:57,060
 - We've phoned all over.

350
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:59,320
 - Well, I think the last place.

351
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,100
 Yes, I just came from Mrs. Ross's.

352
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,460
 - Did she buy the umbrella?

353
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:03,280
 - No, Mary.

354
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,480

 Excuse me, I'll see who's at the door.

372
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:08,140
 Skiing is kind of dangerous, isn't it?

373
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,780
 I wonder if I could persuade you to go to--

374
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:10,600
 I think I should--

375
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,140
 How much have you put into that umbrella so far?

376
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:15,660
 Well, so far, only a dollar and 90 cents.

377
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:17,380
 But it's all from others present.

378
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:19,700
 You're out, a dollar, 90?

379
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:22,860
 Well, I'm out at the moment, but I'm hoping to come back.

380
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:24,700
 From the limb?

381
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:27,220
 Father, I think you're just looking at this

382
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:29,300
 as though I weren't getting anywhere.

383
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,620
 night before last i had a flashlight

384
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:33,300
 and i got a camera with it

385
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,540
 now i've got an umbrella

386
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:37,620
 don't you call it progress

387
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:42,100
 well i'm only a lawyer i don't know a thing about big business

388
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,420
 in big business

389
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:46,020
 you have to think that

390
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:50,420
 and she wants to know if we have any old mayonnaise jars

391
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:51,180
 any what

392
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:54,820
 hot and he didn't mean mister alder evening agnes what do you want me an

393
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:57,260
 a-charge for i'm collecting them

394
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:58,900
 That's an interesting hobby.

395
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:02,420
 Mr. Aldrich, my hobby is men, not mayonnaise.

396
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,580
 I need them for something else, Henry.

397
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:06,460
 Well, there's some in the basement.

398
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:07,900
 OK, Agnes, follow me.

399
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:10,340
 Be careful on the static.

400
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:12,420
 Agnes, what do you do with the jars?

401
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:13,700
 Just something.

402
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:16,060
 I've been working my head off getting them.

403
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:17,060
 Mayonnaise jars?

404
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,700
 Isn't that a bore?

405
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:21,140
 I suppose any jar might do except in the speech

406
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:24,540
 that Congressman Mayday said mayonnaise jars.

407
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:26,020
 You mean they're worth something?

408
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:27,660
 Can you keep quiet about it?

409
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:28,560
 Sure.

410
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,980
 I mean, because if more people realize the possibilities,

411
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:36,500
 everyone in Sederville might start saving Mayonnaise jars.

412
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,060
 What speech?

413
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:37,900
 What Congressman?

414
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:40,740
 It was just a squib in the newspaper a week or so ago.

415
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:41,180
 Yeah?

416
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:43,940
 It had to do with conserving tin, see?

417
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:46,500
 And this congressman is trying to put through a bill

418
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,300
 in Congress where sea rations for the army

419
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:53,020
 will be put up in things like Mayonnaise jars, for example.

420
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:54,540
 Instead of tin cans.

421
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:55,620
 Very interesting.

422
00:16:55,620 --> 00:17:01,420
 And he said the government could help reduce taxes by buying them at low cost from the public.

423
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,100
 Oh boy.

424
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,420
 Do you think the bill passed?

425
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:07,700
 Father said it was just nutty enough too.

426
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,700
 How much are they going to pay for the jars?

427
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:12,620
 Well, up to now I've just been collecting.

428
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:14,500
 I've got nearly 200.

429
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,940
 Gee.

430
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:21,220
 Agnes, would you be interested in looking at something I have for sale?

431
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,020
 Why?

432
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:25,020
 It's in the seller closet here.

433
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:27,420
 How would you like to own that beach umbrella?

434
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:29,980
 Henry, where'd you get it?

435
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:30,860
 You like it?

436
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:32,260
 Henry, yeah!

437
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,540
 It's the best orange and green one I've ever seen.

438
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:36,820
 Honey, it's beautiful.

439
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,820
 Hey, hey, you're so pretty!

440
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:41,260
 Yes, mother, I'll be right there.

441
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:44,780
 Listen, Agnes, how would you like to strike sort of a deal?

442
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:46,020
 What kind?

443
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:48,780
 How many of your jars would you give me if I let you have,

444
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:52,580
 without any cost you whatsoever, this umbrella?

445

 Henry, in setting out to raise money

463
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:13,300
 for his mother's birthday present,

464
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,300
 has gone through a series of intricate

465
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:20,980
 business transactions only to end up with some mayonnaise jars and so far not a

466
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:26,900
 cent of profit the scene opens in the Aldrich Hallway

467
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:33,020
 hello it's Alice dear are you busy with anyone at the office no dear I just had

468
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:37,140
 to call you Sam I was in Mrs Browning's gift shop this morning and I saw the

469
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:39,420
 the loveliest China tea set.

470
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,860
 - Oh.

471
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:45,300
 - You can take that how much is it sound out of your voice, dear.

472
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:48,540
 Mrs. Browning told me Henry had asked her to hold it for him

473
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:50,760
 and Sam, it's $20.

474
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,540
 And he told her the price didn't matter.

475
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:54,700
 He was in a very successful business.

476
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,980
 - Henry did seem pretty happy about something.

477
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:58,140
 - You saw him today?

478
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,580
 - You dropped by the office.

479
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:02,660
 Wanted to borrow some of my business stationery.

480
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:03,740
 Alice-- - Yes?

481
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:07,060
 - Have you any idea why he'd be writing to Congress?

482
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:09,060
 Good heavens, no.

483
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:10,360
 Well, I thought maybe you might.

484
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,560
 It seems to have something to do with your birthday.

 Yes, Sam.

490
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:37,980
 - What's this under the sofa?

491
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:40,140
 - Mayonnaise jars.

492
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:43,140
 - He's keeping, what's wrong with the cellar?

493
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:46,180
 - I don't think there's any more room in the cellar.

494
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:48,820
 - Mother, where's my laundry bag?

495
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:50,620
 - Henry took it out with him.

496
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:51,460
 - What's more?

497
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:52,940
 - I got more jars, Mary.

498
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:54,980
 - Well, my goodness, Henry, I certainly think

499
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:56,780
 you're overdoing this.

500
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:58,940
 - Must you put those bottles down right here

501
00:20:58,940 --> 00:20:59,780
 in the living room?

502
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:01,300
 - It's only for a second, Father.

503
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:04,540
 Mother, if you could have anything for your birthday

504
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:10,060
 wanted what would you like if I could have anything not just a book you mean

505
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:16,140
 yes it's just sort of a hyper theoretical question well to be honest it might be

506
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:21,180
 a tea set I saw at Browning's gift shop with lavender flowers on the cups is

507
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:25,540
 that right lavender flowers but I'm afraid it costs far more than I could

508
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:31,100
 ever pay for it is that right what Mary you've got to take those mayonnaise

509
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,820
 He drives off the front porch.

510
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:35,180
 Father find a place to put them, Mary.

511
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:39,060
 Mother, are you actually encouraging Henry?

512
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:41,620
 Father, I want to make a proposition.

513
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:44,020
 I do not want to buy any of those jars.

514
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:46,220
 Oh, it isn't that, Father.

515
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:48,100
 How would you like to invest?

516
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,220
 Just invest in my business.

517
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:55,020
 What are you doing, Henry, forming a mayonnaise monopoly?

518
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:56,020
 Geez.

519
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:59,700
 She may be I am becoming a sort of empty jar king.

520
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:02,040
 Right now though I need some working capital.

521
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:06,620
 Do you mean to say you've actually spent all you have on nothing but jars?

522
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:08,540
 Well she was, why shouldn't I?

523
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:11,100
 I'm going to get a swell present for a mother and I'll have a fortune to spend

524
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,540
 when Christmas rolls around.

525
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:16,860
 Father, do you still wish you could afford to build a wing on the garage for a swell

526
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:18,460
 machine shop?

527
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:21,140
 How much have you spent altogether son?

528
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:23,940
 Just a little over seven dollars.

529
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:28,020
 And enter there comes a time in every business when the investment must begin

530
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:34,140
 to show a profit, otherwise a nasty little thing called bankruptcy rears its ugly head.

531
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:38,060
 Oh, don't you worry. Just as soon as the government sends for the jars...

532
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:39,060
 Government?

533
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:40,420
 Just wait, Father.

534
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:45,060
 Henry, do you know what happened to that large jar of mayonnaise I bought yesterday?

535
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:48,340
 Yes, Mother. It's on a plate in the icebox.

536
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:50,340
 - Henry, all great.

537
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:53,340
 (siren wailing)

538
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:58,340
 (siren wailing)

539
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:01,340
 (whistling)

540
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:03,340
 - Oh boy, the mailman.

541
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,340
 - Henry, breakfast.

542
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:07,340
 - Just getting the mail, mother.

543
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:09,340
 Oh boy, it's here.

544
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:13,340
 - Anything for me, Henry?

545
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:15,340
 - Yes, sir, but I think it's for me, actually.

546
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:17,340
 You see, I wrote it on your station area.

547
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:22,300
 have it please yes sir but if you could read it aloud mmm i mean it'll concern

548
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:27,900
 me and in a way sort of concerned mother mmm i don't understand there what is

549
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:34,300
 it fam eat your cereal henry dear constituent this man isn't from our state

550
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:39,740
 please go on father it takes a man of your large vision to see the wordiness of

551
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:44,780
 the bill i presented to congress in the interest of conserving tin by using

552
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:51,180
 glass jars for military ration. Oh boy. Unfortunately my bill has been killed in

553
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:57,500
 committee. What? Moreover since my own party has not seen fit to renominate me

554
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:01,660
 for the fourth. Oh boy.

555
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:13,820
 Well Sam isn't it nice to come home and not find a house full of mayonnaise

556
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:19,820
 -Where'd they all go? -I don't know. I simply came up the front walk this afternoon as a truck was

557
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:25,820
 leaving loaded with them. -Mother, is there going to phone call for me this afternoon? -Not that I know of.

558
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:33,820
 -Get a good bargain for your jars, Henry. -Boy, did I, did I? -Well, sure. I met a boy that lives out on a farm, see.

559
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:37,820
 And I just happened to mention casually that I'd been saving mayonnaise jars for the government.

560
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:41,820
 And right away he wanted to buy them. I hoped you told him the government couldn't use them.

561
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:47,260
 use them. Mother, there wasn't any reason I should tell them was there. Dear, I think you should have.

562
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:52,820
 Well, you didn't even ask me, Mother. And in business, if someone doesn't ask you something, you don't tell them.

563
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:59,620
 How much did you make? Well, that part would be hard to say. I've got to do a little figuring first.

564
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:04,820
 Didn't you sell for cash? Cash, Father? When I could get a better proposition?

565
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:11,620
 What did you trade the jars for? Just a little something. And there's always a good market for it.

566
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:15,620
 I hope you didn't have to pay anything in addition to the jars.

567
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:16,620
 Just two dollars.

568
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,620
 You've put two more dollars.

569
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:20,620
 Everybody you want it on the phone.

570
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:22,620
 I am? It's from me, Mary. Gee whiz.

571
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:24,620
 I'll be right back, Father.

572
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:26,620
 I'll be out if you can rise.

573
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:31,620
 Hello? Is this the Senate Bill Meat Market?

574
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:34,620
 Well, look. How much would you pay for a pig?

575
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:37,620
 A pig.

576
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,620
 How much a pound?

577
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:41,620
 Is that all?

578
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:44,620
 Well, gee whiz, my mother was complaining about the price of pork chops.

579
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:46,620
 I don't see why she should have a whole pig o-

580
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:49,620
 Oh, whole sale.

581
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:53,620
 Well, well, I wish you'd come out and look at her.

582
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:56,620
 Only remember, I'm in business to make money.

583
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:57,620
 Yes, sir.

584
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:58,620
 Goodbye.

585
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:00,620
 Who were you talking to, Henry?

586
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:04,620
 Mother, how did you say you were paying for pork chops?

587
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:06,620
 Wait a minute, pork chops.

588
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:08,620
 As an average, for the best?

589
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:09,620
 for the best.

590
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:12,380
 Alice, what do you think I just found out in the garage?

591
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:13,380
 Why?

592
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:14,380
 Ha ha!

593
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:16,940
 Did you say a hog, Sam?

594
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:18,860
 Yes, Alice, in the garage.

595
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:21,380
 Father, let me explain.

596
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:22,900
 You know where it came from?

597
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:23,900
 Yes, sir.

598
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:24,900
 All right.

599
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:27,020
 I'll give you just five minutes to get it out.

600
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:28,180
 It's my investment.

601
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:34,540
 Alice, dear, would you mind if Henry and I had a serious talk together?

602
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:35,540
 No, dear.

603
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:36,540
 I'm afraid it's time.

604
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:37,540
 Sit down, Henry.

605
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:38,540
 Henry.

606
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:39,740
 Well, I mean, I suggest something.

607
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:40,540
 Sit.

608
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:41,840
 Yes, sir.

609
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,040
 This farm boy.

610
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:43,840
 What's his name?

611
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,840
 Billy Weber.

612
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:45,540
 Oh, yes.

613
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:45,840
 Weber.

614
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,640
 I know his father.

615
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,840
 He had a bad time of it because of the dry spell last summer.

616
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:51,940
 I know.

617
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:54,640
 Billy did say the pig was a little too thin to market.

618
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,740
 Only I was hoping by the time Mother's birthday came around.

619
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,240
 Henry.

620
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,840
 Henry, I think you should give Billy back his pig.

621
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:05,440
 Well, if he was dumb enough to buy those jars,

622
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,560
 If I sell the pig, I lose only $4 now.

623
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:11,400
 If I give her back to Billy, I lose everything.

624
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,200
 Besides, I don't want those jars back.

625
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,040
 - I don't need it.

626
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,680
 - I've sunk every cent I have into this.

627
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,560
 - I'm interested, Henry.

628
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,760
 What are you going to do?

629
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,920
 - I won't be able to give mother even a book.

630
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:24,520
 I'll have to cancel the tea set.

631
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:28,160
 I'll give him back the pig, Father.

632
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,000
 - I'm glad.

633
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:29,840
 (door slams)

634
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:30,960
 - Anybody home?

635
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,200
 - In here, Homer.

636
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,400
 - Hey, you got any more mayonnaise jars to sell?

637
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,240
 - Why?

638
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,480
 You know that Billy, wherever you sold them to?

639
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,560
 Hello, Mr. Albridge.

640
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,400
 - Hello, Homer.

641
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,840
 - Yeah, Homer, what happened?

642
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,880
 He sold them, he sold them all.

643
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,000
 3,000 of them at a half a cent each.

644
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:45,840
 - To who?

645
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,120
 - The state agricultural laboratories.

646
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,640
 They grow cultures in them.

647
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,760
 - Half a cent?

648
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,880
 He made 15 bucks on the jars.

649
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,400
 Plus what you paid them.

650
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,480
 - Oh boy.

651
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,760
 You know what?

652
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,360
 I'm gonna make Billy take the pig back

653
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,880
 and give me what he got to the jars.

654
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:01,720
 - You are?

655
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,880
 - Just because his family needs the money

656
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,720
 shouldn't be any reason

657
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,120
 why I should let him get away with it.

658
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:09,500
 Naturally, especially since in the profession you are entering business is business.

659
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:10,500
 Sure.

660
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:13,160
 Supposing I've been poor and he's taken advantage of me.

661
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,220
 How would I have...

662
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:16,740
 I mean...

663
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:19,140
 How would you have felt?

664
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:20,260
 Well, it would have been...

665
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:22,000
 The dirty trick.

666
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:22,700
 Sort of.

667
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:26,460
 And Henry, did I tell you about Agnes selling your beach umbrella?

668
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:27,200
 To who?

669
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,300
 To a junk man.

670
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,940
 She got two dollars for it.

671
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:33,440
 He's gonna put it on his wagon.

672
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,440
 You think it's actually possible that I'm not cut out for business?

673
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,440
 Henry, Henry, what do you think?

674
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,440
 They're what?

675
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:43,440
 Mr. Davis from the meat market just went out to look at your pig.

676
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,440
 She did?

677
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,440
 Henry, she's a mother! She's a mother!

678
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,440
 She's a waltz!

679
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,440
 I've got any little pigs.

680
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:53,440
 If you want them off your hand, he'll give you $20 for the whole business.

681
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,440
 $20? $20?

682
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:59,440
 I'll break exactly even.

683
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,440
 Father, didn't I tell you my investment would come out all right?

684
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:09,440
 come out all right.

685
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:21,000
 In this national election year, one obligation of citizenship heads all the rest.

686
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,800
 The obligation of every qualified voter to go to the polls and vote.

687
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:30,360
 The ballot you will receive this year is a symbol of your personal dignity.

688
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:33,960
 There is no man whose ballot is more important than yours.

689
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:36,680
 No man whose ballot will count for more.

690
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:41,200
 On election day you will have as much power as much responsibility in the shaping of your

691
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:46,400
 country and your way of life as the most influential person.

692
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:49,240
 Don't ignore this priceless possession.

693
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:53,920
 Vote as you please, but register and vote.

694
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:54,680
 See you at the polls.

695
00:29:54,680 --> 00:30:08,060
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

696
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:10,620
 Henry, I thought you were going to sell your pigs.

697
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:11,420
 I did, Father.

698
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:12,500
 I sold them all.

699
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:15,220
 And what are those bags of feed doing out in the garage?

700
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:15,860
 She was, Father.
